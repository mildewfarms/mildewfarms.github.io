In this installment of "Ask Udi," we brave the flames of the ongoing REST vs. Web Services debate. REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style founded on the simplicity of HTTP, while Web Services are, in essence, a set of specifications supported by several vendors in various phases of standardization. Join us for an examination of the benefits REST-ful thinking can bring to service oriented architectures.</span>
