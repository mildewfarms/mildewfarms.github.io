1 If mod_rewrite isn't part of your Apache installation, and you've 
compiled the Apache apxs utility, you can add mod_rewrite from the Apache 1.3.12 
source directory with apxs -i src/modules/standard/mod_rewrite.c.

2	WML also supports some traditional HTML tags for ease of use. For example, &lt;a/&gt; tags may be used in place of &lt;anchor/&gt;.<p>
3	While I'm a big fan of XSLT, being able to transform a single data set to many types of interfaces does not necessarily address the core issue here. A WAP application will hopefully not differ from an HTTP application only in its presentation, but also in its design, flow, and function. WAP usability concerns require that applications go far beyond simply translating data for presentation.<p>
4	If you aren't familiar with the Apache API as provided by mod_perl, consult O'Reilly's <i>Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C</i> by Stein and MacEachern for information that will change your development life and world view.
