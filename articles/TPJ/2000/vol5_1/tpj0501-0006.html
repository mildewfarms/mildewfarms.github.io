  <p>When most people think of Home Automation (HA), they think of
  <i>The Jetsons</i>, where every appliance in the house has a mind
  of its own and occasionally does something you want it to do. The
  classic image of a HA geek is a man who lives in his easy chair,
  controlling every aspect of his life with voice commands and
  buttons like you see in Figure 1.</p>

  </table>While this may actually be the ultimate dream of a few
  couch potatoes, this is not what most people want. To many
  people, a night alone in a smart house would be worse than a
  night at the Bates Motel. ([Include possible apocryphal story
  about Bill Gates' first night in his new NT-controlled mansion,
  where he couldn't turn off the TV? - Editor 1] [We can't verify
  that, so we'll just mention it in a footnote and say that we were
  unable to confirm the story. Hey, it works for political
  candidates... - Editor 2])

  <p>This article shows you my take on HA, used for practical,
  everyday chores that even your technophobe spouse or relative
  might appreciate. You can do it with the computer you have today.
  And you don't have to be Bill Gates to afford it. And you can do
  it all with your most favorite programing language!</p>

  <p><b>Ha! Perl?</b></p>

  <p>So why does Perl make an excellent choice for an HA
  programming language? Let me count the ways:</p>

  <p><b>Concise and object-oriented.</b> HA is object-oriented
  programming in its most literal sense, allowing Perl's concise
  object syntax to shine. What could be simpler and more intuitive
  than a event like this:</p>
  <pre>
   set $christmas_lights ON;
</pre>

  <p>Behind the scenes, we build a generic serial port object, and
  then easily build objects for more specialized
  serially-controlled devices that inherit the generic serial
  port's methods.</p>

  <p><b>Good with strings.</b> Every good smart house should be
  able to read and write. And boy, can Perl read and write!</p>

  <p>As an example, consider the David Letterman Top 10 list.
  Sometimes very funny, and always past my bedtime. With a few
  lines of Perl, we can retrieve the previous night's list from the
  web and convert it into a speakable string that can then be
  served with the morning breakfast:</p>
  <pre>
  # Get the HTML and translate to text
  my $html = get 'http://marketing.cbs.com/lateshow/topten';
  my $text = HTML::FormatText-&gt;new(lm =&gt; 0, rm =&gt; 150)-&gt;
               format(HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new()-&gt;parse($html));

  $text =~ s/^.+?the Top Ten/The Top Ten/s;  
  # Delete text before the list
  $text =~ s/(.+\n *1\..+?)\n.+/$1\n/s;      
  # Delete text after the list
  $text =~ s/([^\.\?\!])\n/$1\.\n/g;         
  # Add a period at end of lines.

  speak $text;
</pre>

  <p><b>The mighty eval.</b> Rather than stopping and restarting
  the entire program from scratch each time we want to change
  something, we can use <tt>eval</tt> to quickly load in just the
  code that has changed.</p>

  <p>This is especially useful with a complex HA program, where
  small changes to event programming can be frequent and you don't
  want your house offline for very long.</p>

  <p><b>Free and ubiquitious.</b> Not only is Perl free, but it
  also runs everywhere. The HA community is currently split between
  Windows (lots of fun software/periperals) and Unix (reliable,
  which is kind of important for HA). Using Perl, we can easily
  switch between platforms when it makes sense.</p>

  <p><b>MisterHouse</b></p>

  <p>Now that you're convinced that Perl is good (admittedly not a
  tough sell for TPJ readers), how can you use it to control your
  house? With MisterHouse! Cue the infomercial music...</p>

  </table>

  <p>About two years ago I began a Perl program called MisterHouse.
  A little over one year ago I posted it to the net and started a
  mailing list. Since then, the growing user group (about 250
  subscribers by the end of '99) has helped shape it into a fairly
  powerful HA program with the following features:</p>

  <p>&bull; It executes actions based on voice input, time of day,
  file data, serial port data, and socket data.</p>

  <p>&bull; It has an optional Tk interface, pictured in Figure 2,
  with menus for all objects and voice commands.</p>

  <p>&bull; It has a web interface that mirrors the Tk interface to
  allow control and feedback from any browser, either on a local
  intranet or on the internet. Check ours out at <a href=
  "http://misterhouse.net:8080" target=
  "resource window">http://misterhouse.net:8080</a>.</p>

  <p>&bull; On Windows systems, it uses OLE calls to Microsoft VR
  (Voice Recognition) TTS (Text To Speech) engines</p>

  <p>&bull; On Unix systems, it can use the Festival TTS.</p>

  <p>&bull; On Linux systems, it can use the IBM ViaVoice VR and
  TTS engines.</p>

  <p>&bull; Using the SerialPort module, it can read and write to
  any serial device, on either Windows or Unix.</p>

  <p>&bull; It has modules for reading and writing to the X10
  ActiveHome (CM11) and Firecracker (CM17) interfaces. See Bill
  Birthisel's article in this issue for more details.</p>

  <p>&bull; It also has modules for reading and writing digital,
  analog, and X10 signals using other HA interfaces from JDS,
  HomeVision, and Weeder Technologies.</p>

  <p>&bull; Other hardware interfaces we have code for include
  IRMan (for receiving IR signals), LCDproc (for writing to various
  LCDs and reading keypad input), ham radio modems (for tracking
  vehicles with GPS units), and modem code for caller ID and
  paging.</p>

  <p>&bull; It has Internet hooks for reading and writing email,
  HTTP, or FTP files.</p>

  <p>MisterHouse consists of one main Perl program called
  <tt>mh</tt> (no relation to the mail reading program) and a bunch
  of library, data, and user code files. The basic flow of
  <tt>mh</tt> is:</p>

  <p><b>Setup.</b> Load modules, read configuration files, open
  serial and socket ports. This step takes about 15 seconds on a
  100 MHz Pentium and consumes about 15 MB of memory.</p>

  <p><b>Read and <tt>eval</tt> User Code.</b> The user code is
  parsed so that all code except global variables and object
  declarations are put into a loop subroutine. This is then passed
  to <tt>eval</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Run the Loop.</b> Each pass through the loop checks for
  voice commands, keyboard input, and socket/serial/file data. Then
  the user code loop is evaluated and global variables and objects
  are set for the next pass of the loop.</p>

  <p>Using a <tt>sleep</tt> parameter, you can control how often
  the loop is executed. With a 100 millisecond sleep period,
  <tt>mh</tt> runs about nine passes per second on a 100 MHz
  Pentium, using about 15% of the cpu.</p>

  <p>The <tt>perl2exe</tt> program from demobuilder.com is used to
  create optional <tt>mh</tt> binaries for Windows and Linux, so
  that you can run <tt>mh</tt> even if you don't have a recent
  version of Perl installed, or are missing some required
  modules.</p>

  <p><b>Objects In The Home</b></p>

  <p>The best way to explain how <tt>mh</tt> uses objects and
  methods is with an example. This code allows for voice control of
  a light that is plugged into an X10 lamp module:</p>
  <pre>
   $hall_light   = new X10_Item 'A1';
   $v_hall_light = new Voice_Cmd 'hall light [on,off]';
   set $hall_light $state if $state = said $v_hall_light;
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>A1</tt> code is the X10 identifier we chose for the
  lamp module. Each state in the Voice_Cmd enumeration creates a
  separate voice command. When one of those commands is recognized,
  the Voice_Cmd <tt>said()</tt> method returns the relevant
  state.</p>

  <p>The <tt>set()</tt>...<tt>if</tt>...<tt>said()</tt> line is put
  in the loop subroutine, so it is evaluated on every mh loop. If
  someone says hall light on, then <tt>said()</tt> would return on,
  and the X10_Item <tt>set()</tt> method is called to turn the
  light on. (See Bill Birthisel's article in this issue for more
  details on how the X10 protocol is implemented.)</p>

  <p>Voice_Cmd is just one of the <tt>mh</tt> objects. Here is a
  list of some of the others:</p>

  <p>File_Item: Reads, writes, and monitors data from files.</p>

  <p>Process_Item: Creates, kills, and monitors background
  processes.</p>

  <p>Serial_Item: Reads, writes, and monitors serial port
  devices.</p>

  <p>Socket_Item: Creates client and server sockets.</p>

  <p>Group: Allows for groups of objects, for easier control.</p>

  <p>Timer: Starts, stops, and monitors timers.</p>

  <p><b>Talking And Listening</b></p>

  <p>The holy grail for the would-be smart house is reliable voice
  input (Voice Recognition or VR) and understandable voice output
  (Text To Speech or TTS). Although this has progressed a long way
  in the last few years, it is not quite to the point where you can
  tap your Star Trek communicator badge and have a meaningful
  conversation about where your house phasers will be sufficient to
  quiet your neighbor's dog.</p>

  <p>You can, however, put on a microphone headset, or stand in
  front of a desktop microphone in a fairly quiet room, and have
  your house recognize specific, pre-programmed phrases. This mode
  of VR, called <i>Command and Control</i>, is much more reliable
  than dictation in which any arbitrary text can be spoken.
  Dictation requires you to train your VR engines to recognize your
  voice; Command and Control does not.</p>

  <p>The <tt>mh</tt> Voice_Cmd object has two types of phrase
  enumeration. As shown earlier, text enclosed in <tt>[]</tt>
  characters is used to control what is returned with the
  <tt>said()</tt> method. To allow for variations on phrasing, you
  can also enclose text within <tt>{}</tt> characters. For example,
  this statement:</p>
  <pre>
   $v_lights = new Voice_Cmd '{turn the,} {living,dining} ' .
                             'room fan [on,off]';
</pre>

  <p>...would create these recognizable phrases:</p>
  <pre>
   turn the living room fan on/off
   turn the dining room fan on/off
            living room fan on/off
            dining room fan on/off
</pre>

  <p>There are currently two VR engines that <tt>mh</tt> can use.
  On Windows, Microsoft has an OLE-controllable engine, and on
  Linux, IBM has recently made ViaVoice binaries available. There
  are three TTS engines that <tt>mh</tt> can use: IBM's Outloud on
  Linux, Microsoft's TTS engine for Windows, and the Festival TTS
  engine, available on a variety of platforms.</p>

  <p>All of these engines are freely downloadable (locations are
  available in the mh install instructions), and you can mix and
  match the engine of the day. mh interacts with the ViaVoice and
  Festival engines through socket-based servers, so we can run mh
  on a different machine and a different OS. For example, I run mh
  on Windows because I prefer the TTS engine (it uses pre-digitized
  voices to give an amazingly human-like voice), but I run the VR
  engine on a Linux box because of the improved accuracy of the IBM
  ViaVoice engine.</p>

  <p><b>A Smart TV Guide</b></p>

  <p>I promised you some practical, don't-scare-the-spouse-away
  type of examples. Here is an example of how you can have your
  house announce when a favorite TV show is starting:</p>
  <pre>
my $favorite_tv_shows = "voyager,dilbert,family guy";
$f_tv_file = new File_Item "$config_parms{data_dir}/tv_info1.txt";
if (time_cron '0,30 18-22 * * *') {
  run qq[ get_tv_info -times $Hour:$Minute -keys 
"$favorite_tv_shows" ];
  set_watch $f_tv_file 'favorites now';
}
if (changed $f_tv_file) {
  my @data = read_all $f_tv_file;
  speak "Notice, a favorite show is just starting. @data";
}
</pre>

  <p>The File_Item object has <tt>set_watch()</tt>,
  <tt>changed()</tt>, and <tt>read_all()</tt> methods, used to
  monitor and read file data. The <tt>time_cron()</tt> function is
  used to test against a cron-formatted time string (in this case,
  every half hour between six and ten in the evening).</p>

  <p>The <tt>run()</tt> function creates a separate process to run
  the <tt>get_tv_info</tt> program, so that the main mh loop does
  not pause while <tt>get_tv_info</tt> runs. On Windows, run calls
  Win32::Process. On Unix, <tt>fork</tt> is used.</p>

  <p><tt>get_tv_info</tt> is a Perl program bundled with the
  <tt>mh</tt> distribution. It queries data from a DB_File database
  created by another <tt>mh</tt> event that parses TV programming
  info from web pages. If you have an IR output device, you can
  also use an mh event to automatically record shows.</p>

  <p><b>Whole House CallerID</b></p>

  <p>Tired of being your children's phone secretary? With this
  code, you can monitor incoming calls using your caller ID
  modem:</p>
  <pre>
$phone_modem = new Serial_Item 'ATE1V1X4&amp;C1&amp;D2S0=0+VCID=1', 'init', 'serial3';
set $phone_modem 'init' if $Startup;

# Look for modem caller ID data like this: 
#   NMBR = 507-123-4567
#   NAME = WINTER BRUCE
my $modem_data;
if (my $data = said $phone_modem) {
    $modem_data .= $data;
    if ($data =~ /NAME =/) {
        my ($caller, $number, $name) = 
Caller_ID::make_speakable($modem_data);
        speak(rooms =&gt; 'all', text =&gt; $caller);
        
        logit_dbm("$config_parms{data_dir}/phone/
callerid.dbm", $cid_number,"$Time_Now $Date_Now 
$Year name=$cid_name");
        undef $modem_data;
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>The ...<tt>if $Startup</tt> check sends the modem an
  initialization string to put it into caller ID mode. The
  Serial_Item <tt>said()</tt> method returns a string each time a
  record is received from the modem. Once we have the NAME record,
  we use the <tt>Caller_ID::make_speakable()</tt> function to
  convert the data to into a string like: "Phone call from Larry
  Wall from California." It can also use an optional rule to return
  a phonetic version of the name (TTS engines don't do well with
  names like Bret Favre or Galileo Galilei), a digitized audio
  file, so you can have the caller announce their call using their
  own voice! A snapshot of the MisterHouse phone log is shown in
  Figure 3.</p>

  <table width="400">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/tpj0501-0009-03.gif"></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><font face="verdana" size="-2"><b>Figure 3.</b> With a
      Caller ID unit, MisterHouse can log all incoming and outgoing
      phone calls. They can then be viewed or searched with a web
      interface or the Perl/Tk interface shown here (home phone
      numbers blurred intentionally).</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>If you really want to get fancy, you can wire up a
  relay-controlled PA system, and modify a <tt>pa_stub()</tt>
  subroutine so you can use the rooms option of the
  <tt>speak()</tt> function to direct the speech to specific
  rooms.</p>

  <p>Finally, the <tt>logit_dbm()</tt> function logs the name and
  number into a DBM file so we can query it to find names and
  numbers of callers.</p>

  <p><b>Squeaky Stairs</b></p>

  <p>Is your house too new to have any of those endearing squeaky
  stair steps that are the bane of teenage children trying to sneak
  out at night? This code monitors a wireless X10 motion sensor to
  play back simulated digitized squeaks:</p>
  <pre>
  $timer_stair_movement = new  Timer();
  $movement_sensor = new Serial_Item('XA2AJ', 'stair');
  if (state_now $movement_sensor eq 'stair' and 
      inactive $timer_stair_movement) {
      set $timer_stair_movement 60;
      play(file =&gt; 'stairs_creak*.wav');
  } 
</pre>

  <p>The Timer object is used so that we have no more than one
  squeak per minute, which prevents squeak-seeking kids from doing
  jumping jacks in front of your sensors. The <tt>state_now()</tt>
  Serial_Item method returns '<tt>stair</tt>' when the motion
  sensor (set to code <tt>A2</tt>) is triggered and sends string
  <tt>A2AJ</tt>. The <tt>play()</tt> function will randomly play
  one of the <tt>stairs_creak*.wav</tt> files.</p>

  <p><b>You Have Mail</b></p>

  <p>This code periodically checks your email account and
  summarizes incoming messages:</p>
  <pre>
$p_get_email = new Process_Item 'get_email';
start $p_get_email if $New_Minute and !($Minute % 10) and 
&amp;net_connect_check;
 
if (done_now $p_get_email) {
    my $text = file_read "$config_parms{data_dir}/get_email.txt";
    speak $text if $text;
    
    &amp;scan_subjects("$config_parms{data_dir}/get_email.scan");
}
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>start()</tt> method of the Process_Item object runs
  the <tt>get_email</tt> program every 10 minutes so long as the
  <tt>net_connect_check()</tt> function verifies that you're
  online. The Perl <tt>get_email</tt> program reads the headers of
  new email (for accounts specified in a configuration file,
  <tt>get_email.scan</tt>) and creates a summary in the file
  <tt>get_email.txt</tt>. The <tt>done_now()</tt> method returns
  true when the <tt>get_email</tt> process is finished.</p>

  <p><tt>get_email</tt> also creates a <tt>get_email.scan</tt> file
  that has the first few lines of each email. The
  <tt>scan_subjects()</tt> function then checks that file for
  remote, password-protected commands, so you can control your
  house from your email-enabled cell phone!</p>

  <p>There are other MisterHouse programs:</p>

  <p>&bull; Vehicle Tracking. Shows how you can use a HAM radio to
  track vehicle positions.</p>

  <p>&bull; Event Reminders. Shows how you can program event
  reminders, directly and using the Outlook interface.</p>

  <p>&bull; Time And Temperature With An Attitude. Shows how to
  sync up with Internet clocks and weather data.</p>

  <p><b>Say What?</b></p>

  <p>To give you a better feel for types of things our house says,
  here is a list of things I copied out of a recent speech log
  file:</p>

  <p>&bull; Turning furnace heat on after 23 hours at 67.6
  degrees<br>
  &bull; Turning furnace heat off after 20 minutes at 69.1
  degrees<br>
  &bull; Notice, the sun is bright at 32 percent, and it is cold
  outside at 24 degrees, so I am opening the curtains at 8:07
  AM<br>
  &bull; The van is traveling north at 58 mph 0.8 miles west of
  Walmart.<br>
  &bull; The car is parked at Friedell School.<br>
  &bull; Email account laurel has 4 new email messages from The S F
  gals.<br>
  &bull; Email account nick has 1 new email message from
  accountmanager.<br>
  &bull; Notice, Nick has been on the computer for 2.1 hours
  today.<br>
  &bull; The front door has been left open.<br>
  &bull; Phone call from Mal and Beth Winter from Montana.<br>
  &bull; Notice, there is 1 favorite show starting now: Dilbert on
  channel 8.<br>
  &bull; 8:58 PM. VCR recording will be started in 2 minutes for
  Southpark on channel 47.<br>
  &bull; Notice, there were 668 web hits from 74 clients in the
  last day.<br></p>

  <p>Here is an example of a VR session. To keep it from
  accidentally responding to human-to-human conversation, we use
  special phrases to activate and deactivate it:</p>
  <pre>
 Human: Hey MisterHouse.
    mh: What's up?
 Human: Christmas lights on.
    mh: I heard christmas lights on.
 Human: What is the outside temperature.
    mh: The outside temperature is 26 degrees.
 Human: Go to sleep.
    mh: Later.
</pre>

  <p>If you have an HTTP-capable MP3 player, you can hear what our
  house sounds like and optionally have a conversation with a
  heavily-modified Eliza ChatBot at <a href=

  "resource window">http://misterhouse.net/mh/web/speak</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Give Your House A Brain</b></p>

  <p>Not ready to take the plunge yet? Consider this: You can order
  the send-only X10 FireCracker kit (described in Bill Birthisel's
  article later in this issue) from X10.com for $6. Or for $50, you
  can get the send and receive ActiveHome kit. In either case, all
  you need is an open serial port and a lamp or appliance you want
  to control. There are no wires to mess with, so you can even use
  it in a rented apartment or dorm room.</p>

  <p>If you don't need or want the complexity and overhead of
  <tt>mh</tt>, you can use the X10 Perl modules from CPAN and write
  your own interface. Even if you don't have need X10 control, you
  might still find the voice, time, and Internet functions of
  <tt>mh</tt> of some use. For example, my twin sons each have a
  bare-bones version of <tt>mh</tt> running on the computers in
  their rooms (they call it MisterRoom), just so they can have
  remote and timed control of their MP3 players (pictured in Figure
  4).</p>
