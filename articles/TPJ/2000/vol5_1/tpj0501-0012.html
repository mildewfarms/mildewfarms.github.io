  <h2 align="center">The Perl Poetry Contest</h2>

  <h4><i>Kevin Meltzer</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->

  <p>The First Annual Perl Poetry Contest results are in, and I was
  quite happy to see so many entrants. We received haikus (although
  not always true to haiku style), love poems, ports of real poems,
  and poetry generators. The competition was fierce, the styles
  were varied, and there were even some entries containing no Perl
  at all.</p>

  <p>There were no real categories in this contest, but to be fair
  in the judging I grouped the type of poems together. Haikus were
  judged against haikus, poem generators against poem generators,
  and entries containing no Perl grouped together in
  <tt>/dev/null</tt>.</p>

  <h4>BEST POEM PORT</h4>

  <p><b>Wayne Myers</b> ported this Yeats poem, <i>The Coming Of
  Wisdom with Time,</i> to Perl. I enjoyed his use of Perl
  functions to coincide with Yeats' word use. For example, this
  Yeats line:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <tt>Though leaves are many</tt>
  </blockquote>became

  <blockquote>
    <tt>while ($leaves &gt; 1) {</tt>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This was exactly what I was hoping to see from the entries. I
  also enjoyed his tounge-in-cheek use of <tt>sway()</tt> to ensure
  that the poem will <tt>die()</tt> if not on a Sun was slick. Here
  is the original poem:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Though leaves are many, the root is one;<br>
    Through all the lying days of my youth<br>
    I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun;<br>
    Now I may wither into the truth</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And here is Myers' Perl version:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
while ($leaves &gt; 1) {
        $root = 1;
}
foreach($lyingdays{'myyouth'}) {
        sway($leaves, $flowers);
}
while ($i &gt; $truth) {
        $i--;
}
sub sway {
        my ($leaves, $flowers) = @_;
        die unless $^O =~ /sun/i;
}
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <h4>HAIKU</h4>

  <p>I was a bit surprised to read this haiku by <b>Clinton
  Pierce.</b> All true haikus should pertain to the seasons, and
  while poetry reading is a subjective art, this poem seems to have
  a more offensive message.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
               1, 2 or more('to'),
        tie $her, $up and bind $her, $up;
         sub for ({ each  %2; do {} };)
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I think that's supposed to be a devilish smiley at the
  end.</p>

  <h4>A PERL PROGRAM THAT GENERATES POETRY</h4>

  <p><b>Ronald J. Kimball</b> went all out on this one. It was the
  only entry I received with it's own bibliography. His
  <tt>sonnet.pl</tt> explains itself:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <tt>sonnet.pl 0.1 generates sonnets, inasmuch as the poems are
    14 lines long, in iambic pentameter, and match the rhyming
    scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Any apparent meaning in the generated
    poems is purely coincidental.</tt>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To create the sonnets, Ronald's entry uses a pronunciation
  list (http://linguist.dartmouth.edu/~rjk/mywords.dat.gz)
  generated by Sean Burke's Moby-based Pronunciator (<i>Searching
  for Rhymes with Perl,</i> TPJ #16). Ronald also received extra
  points because his entry ran with warnings on.</p>

  <p>I ran this many, many times, and was amused by every sonnet it
  generated. The moment of endearment came when I read <tt>Magmatic
  appendicular tort duck</tt> --which actually rhymed with an
  alternate line, in true sonnet form.</p>

  <p>Here is a sample of the output from Ronald's
  sonnet.pl:</p><tt>Rani proponent lapis anus raft<br>
  Triacetate magniloquently brogue<br>
  Locution cannonball outbuild corf graft<br>
  Harmoniously raspingly pure vogue<br>
  Inclusion prayer waive endarch flowage halves<br>
  Sensillum egg pilosity impart<br>
  Retaliate exclude filets moo calves<br>
  Fibrotic piling scrapie purpleheart<br>
  Troll ignominy build join rattlebrained<br>
  Azan prosector hydrothorax mog<br>
  Defoliate accomplice holt constrained<br>
  Back prostatectomy numb door incog<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Epergne appropriate charivari<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cahoots misvalue jimp born abatis</tt>

  <p>This entry kept me amused for more time than I care to admit,
  and I hope others find it as entertaining, artistic, and
  strangely poetic as I have.</p>

  <h4>OBFUSCATED POETRY?</h4>

  <p>This entry from <b>Damon Harper</b> would seem to be a better
  match for the Obfuscated Perl Contest. I liked the extensive use
  of actual Perl. Damon didn't abuse whitespace, and almost makes
  this script look like it was a real poem first. This entry runs
  with warnings on and prints the poem itself when executed. Here
  is his entry, which should be named <i>waiting.</i></p>

  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="40%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
$_=open (and_, "waiting")==0?'': system ('clear');

@hoping= &lt;and_&gt;; $waiting
=$i{m}{'patiently' and ''}='breathlessly';
foreach (human ('contact')){

$just= "$waiting to "=~/^breathe?/

&amp;&amp;'forever' ?"waiting
------
".("but when w$e"=~/ do/, join( 'together',())):
                                            ($o='ur'. crypt('ic',
"words confuse"),
s/[^ta-y! \n$o: ]//go,$_);
$i{m}=print($ed? 'indelibly': ($waiting= $just)). "disappoints";}

sub human {$e="motionally now:
done with"; @hoping;}
$_="done with $waiting

the solution" eq'uals'? 'this': 'eyes' .close($d =and_);
                                              $i{mmerse}="$d in";
bless\$ed; sleep;
</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table><b>The output of Damon's poem:</b><br>
  <br>
  <pre>
waiting
------

open and waiting: system clear

hoping and waiting
impatiently and breathlessly
foreach human contact


just waiting to breath

forever waiting

but when we do join together: our cryptic words confuse
stay! no: go

imprinted indelibly: waiting just disappoints

sub human emotionally now:
done with hoping
done with waiting

the solution equals this:
                        eyes closed and immersed in blessed sleep
</pre>And then the program sleeps.

  <h4>BEST OF SHOW</h4>

  <p>This short entry, by <b>Angie Winterbottom</b>, was the most
  interesting. Her style was fresh and unique, and her use of
  visual representations in the text are clever. Consider the
  following excerpt:</p>
  <pre>
                ($blaze_of_night{moon} == black_hole)
</pre>

  <p>"The moon, a black hole in the blaze of night." Marvelous!
  Angie tells us that this entry is from Jim Steinman's song <i>The
  Invocation,</i> on the Pandora's Box album <i>Original Sin</i>.
  Here is her entry:</p>
  <pre>
if ((light eq dark) &amp;&amp; (dark eq light)
   &amp;&amp; ($blaze_of_night{moon} == black_hole)
   &amp;&amp; ($ravens_wing{bright} == $tin{bright})){
 my $love = $you = $sin{darkness} + 1;
};
</pre>

  <p>Here are the original lyrics:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>If light were dark and dark were light<br>
    The moon a black hole in the blaze of night<br>
    A raven's wing as bright as tin<br>
    Then you, my love, would be darker than sin.</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Honorable mentions: <b>Robin Berfon,</b> for a sweet love poem
  (not to me, keep in mind), and to <b>Anoop Sarkar, Steve
  McNabb,</b> and <b>Sterling Hughes.</b></p>

  <p>Thanks to everyone for making this contest a success, and get
  your Perl plumes ready for next year!.</p>_ _END_ _<br>
