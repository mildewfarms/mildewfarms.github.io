  <h2 align="center">Home Automation: The X10 Nitty-Gritty</h2>

  <h4 align="left"><i>Bill Birthisel</i></h4>

  <p>Consider small computers. No, not notebooks, subnotebooks or
  even "embedded" single board controllers. WinCE, Psion, Palm --
  still way too big. Game consoles, microwave oven keypads, clock
  radios? Getting closer. TV remotes, computer keyboards, and
  talking toys are at the top end of this class. The real foot
  soldier of home automation is the <i>microcontroller</i> -- a
  tiny computer optimized to do a few things well. <i>Tiny</i> is
  the key word here -- microcontrollers need to be small, cheap,
  and able to run on low power.</p>

  <p><img src="images/tpj0501-0010-00.gif" align="left">In this
  article, we will introduce some of the nitty-gritty details of
  working with home automation. We'll talk about two
  microcontroller-based boxes you can connect to your computer: one
  simple (the CM17) and one complex (the CM11). Each sends messages
  to devices which plug into your house power and control
  individual items (one lamp or appliance per device). We'll start
  with the CM17 and use it to describe the commands, protocols, and
  timing issues common to most home control installations. Then
  we'll look at the CM11 and the extra complications associated
  with receiving commands. Finally, we'll look at some of the
  issues a real home automation application needs to consider.</p>

  <p>Along the way, we'll examine some the Perl modules you can use
  to manipulate the CM17 and CM11. The examples will run on your
  computer even if you don't have any of the hardware, although you
  won't be able to "watch der blinkin' lights." In practice, the
  modules are commonly called from within a user environment such
  as MisterHouse, which Bruce Winter described in his article
  earlier in this issue.</p>

  <p>The Perl slogan, "There's More Than One Way To Do It", also
  applies to home automation. There are lots of vendors, lots of
  products, multiple protocols, and a variety of command sets. You
  can build kits, purchase individual components, or even buy
  complete packages. Some of the products are even compatible. I've
  selected specific models for this article because the CPAN
  modules supporting them are the most mature, but don't consider
  that a product endorsement. Modules for other types and other
  vendor protocols are in development and will be available by the
  time you read this. Check the ControlX10:: namespace at your
  favorite CPAN site. The term 'X10' is a bit ambiguous; in this
  article, it refers to a mechanism for sending data messages via
  house wiring (power line modulation). There is also a company
  named X10 Inc. that manufactures and sells the CM11 and CM17
  controllers.</p>

  </table>The CM17 (Figure 1) is a little box about twice the size
  of your thumb, with two switches that send on and off commands
  via radio to household appliances. It's sold under the trade name
  "FireCracker", and it plugs into a serial port (the little 9-pin
  connector on most PC hardware). It draws its power from the port
  -- no batteries required.

      title="Figure 1: The Firecracker"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>There are at least four separate communication transport
  systems found in home automation: radio (used by the CM17), power
  line (CM11 and others using the X10 protocol), infrared (TV
  remote controls and line of sight devices), and direct-wire
  (CEBus, CAN, BACnet, and other slimmed down industrial I/O
  protocols). The CM17 transmits radio signals to another box that
  powers on or off an appliance plugged into it and retransmits
  commands via X10 power line modulation to other device
  controllers. Inside each box, a microcontroller waits to decode
  and implement any commands sent its way.

  <p>Microcontrollers are designed to manage a small amount of
  rigidly defined I/O and to talk exclusively to other
  microcontrollers and computers. "Spartan" is a polite description
  for the user interface; it's tough to implement a shell, much
  less a modern GUI, in 256 bytes of RAM. You program
  microcontrollers by toggling individual bits or sending a handful
  of encoded bytes to a serial port. Each microcontroller
  implementation is different; fortunately, the gory details can be
  collected in Perl modules, so most users will never have to know
  them.</p>

  <p><b>The ControlX10::CM17 And ControlX10::CM11 Modules</b></p>

  <p>The ControlX10::CM17 and ControlX10::CM11 modules are
  collections of functions that make it possible for you to
  manipulate CM17 and CM11 boxes from your Perl program. We'll see
  a number of examples throughout this article. The first is so
  simple it requires no special hardware at all -- we'll simply
  pretend we have the necessary hardware and ask a CM17 to toggle a
  lamp on and off twice. (To actually turn something on and off,
  we'd need a serial port, a CM17, and a radio receiver that talks
  the same RF protocol.)</p>

  <p>Our program below (<a href="tpj0501-0007a.html">Listing 1</a>)
  imports the SerialStub.pl file (available on the TPJ web site),
  which creates an object that behaves like a serial port with a
  CM17 box plugged into it. We never talk to the actual box, but
  the CM17 module doesn't care -- it finds the methods it wants, so
  it's happy.</p>

  <p>The main part of the example turns a device on and off twice.
  It creates an object and passes it to the <tt>send_cm17()</tt>
  function. We also turn on verbose output during the second toggle
  sequence to see how the command is translated.</p>

  <p><b>What's In A Command?</b></p>

  <p>The microcontroller in the CM17 uses only three of the wires
  in the serial port: a ground and two signals, called RTS and DTR.
  At least one of the signals must be on at all times to provide
  power to the microcontroller. The command is a series of 40
  pulses (a <tt>0</tt> bit is RTS pulsing off, and a <tt>1</tt> bit
  is a DTR pulsing off). The <tt>CM17: Sending:</tt> lines above
  show typical 40-bit output strings.</p>

  <p>The <tt>send_cm17()</tt> function takes a serial object and a
  command string as arguments, and calls a strange selection of
  serial object methods. It doesn't use either the read or write
  lines of the serial port -- it just passes them through so
  something else (a terminal, or device like a CM11) can use the
  port simultaneously (as long as it doesn't use DTR or RTS, and as
  long as the operating system permits port sharing -- some
  devices, like a serial mouse, need exclusive access).</p>

  <p>The <tt>command_string</tt> usually contains three parts: the
  <i>house code</i>, the <i>unit code</i>, and the
  <i>operation</i>. There's one house code per house (out of
  sixteen possible: <tt>A..P</tt>), one unit code per appliance
  (<tt>1..9, A..G</tt>), and seven possible operations for the
  CM17:</p>
  <pre>
        $operation                   Function

           xJ           Unit On (requires unit code x)
           xK           Unit Off (requires unit code x)
           L            Brighten Last Light Programmed 14%
           M            Dim Last Light Programmed 14%
           N            All Lights Off
           O            All Lights On
           P            All Units Off
</pre>

  <p>Not all receivers support operations L, M, N, and O.</p>

  <p>This division into sixteen house (major) and sixteen unit
  (minor) parts is a common feature of the protocols. I'm not
  worried about interference here in rural Wisconsin, but the
  sixteen house settings mean that in a crowded apartment building
  your neighbor is less likely to be controlling your living room
  lights.</p>

  <p>Our second example will toggle a real lamp or appliance on and
  off if you have a CM17, a transceiver, and a device controller
  set to address A1. You need a serial port module installed on
  your system: either Win32::SerialPort (for Windows) or
  Device::SerialPort (for Unix). On some operating systems, you
  will also need permission to open the port and access the
  hardware. See the documentation bundled with the SerialPort
  modules for specific platform details. <a href=
  "tpj0501-0007b.html">Listing 2</a> will run without a CM17, but
  the results will be like those from Listing 1. (The module can't
  determine itself whether a CM17 is present.)</p>

  <p>Listing 2 is almost exactly the same as Listing 1, and the
  output on your screen will be identical. The important
  differences are hidden in the <tt>require</tt>. All the
  initialization and operating system details are provided by
  start_port.pl, shown in <a href="tpj0501-0007c.html">Listing
  3</a>.</p>

  <p>The <tt>BEGIN</tt> block at the start of Listing 3 is
  deceptively simple. In <a href="../vol4_1/ewtoc.html" target=
  "resource window">TPJ #13</a>, I commented only briefly about
  Win32API::CommPort, which implements the actual operating system
  interface (the API calls) to the serial driver. Win32::SerialPort
  translates the primitive elements of the interface into more
  useful methods for your Perl program. Win32API::CommPort is
  currently 100% Perl, making the API calls via the Win32::API
  module. This division permits seamless conversion of
  Win32API::CommPort to XS to boost performance in the future.</p>

  <p>Similarly, Device::SerialPort relies on POSIX.pm for
  portability across POSIX-compliant operating systems. Since both
  SerialPort modules have the same top level methods, most user
  code is easily transportable between operating systems; fully
  portable versions of the <a href="../vol4_1/ewtoc.html" target=
  "resource window">TPJ #13</a> code listings are available from
  the TPJ web site.</p>

  <p>Listing 3 also checks that the OS-specific system calls
  (ioctls) needed to run the CM17 are available for your platform.
  If they aren't, you won't be able to control real hardware, but
  the examples will still run and print what they are doing. You'll
  see a <tt>=== Bypassing ioctls ===</tt> message if the module
  can't issue the necessary hardware pulses.</p>

  <p>Let's see another example of the ControlX10::CM17 module.
  Here's <a href="tpj0501-0007d.html">Listing 4</a>,
  slow_speed.pl:</p>

  <p><b>Timing Issues</b></p>

  <p>If you run Listing 4, you'll see output like this, after a
  delay that might be as long as ten seconds:</p>
  <pre>
| Turning address A1 ON
| Turning address A2 ON
| Turning address A3 ON
| Turning address A4 ON
| Turning address A5 ON
| Turning all house A OFF
</pre>

  <p>Why is it so slow? The answer may seem frivolous: It doesn't
  need to be any faster. I mentioned earlier that the transceiver
  echoes commands to other devices via power line modulation. The
  X10 power line protocol transmits one bit per power line cycle
  and requires 47 cycles for a typical message -- around a second.
  If you have the appropriate hardware, you can run the following
  experiment: set a lamp module to the same address as a
  transceiver with a built-in mechanical relay. When you send an on
  or off command to that unit, you will hear the relay make an
  audible click about a second before the lamp responds. Since
  microcontrollers have small command buffers, you don't want to
  have too many operations pending. Running the CM17 module at
  about the same rate as the power line transmission reduces the
  amount of queueing and buffering needed.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0501-0007e.html">Listing 5</a> is like Listing 4,
  but groups the units into related house addresses, letting a
  single pair of commands simultaneously alter up to 16
  appliances.</p>

  <p>This runs much faster.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0501-0007f.html">Listing 6:
  cm11_no_hardware.pl</a></p>

  <p><b>Bidirectional I/O with the CM11</b></p>

  <p>Before we look at the issues involved in designing a home
  automation application, let's look at another type of hardware
  controller. The CM11 talks to a computer via a serial port, and
  communicates with unit modules only via household power lines. It
  also monitors the power lines for commands it <i>didn't</i> send,
  such as from motion detectors or RF transceivers, and reports
  those to the computer. It includes a built-in clock and even
  permits cron-like macro programming ("turn A3 ON at 09:00"). The
  CM11 interface is so unlike the CM17 that both devices can share
  the same serial port. Like Listing 1, this should run on all
  systems regardless of hardware.</p>

  <p>A CM11 command consists of two parts: one or more addresses (a
  house/unit combination, like <tt>A2</tt>) and one or more
  operations (a house/operation combination, like <tt>AK</tt>).
  This is actually closer to the command signal format sent on the
  power lines than the 40-bit string we saw in the CM17.</p>

  <p>The <tt>send_cm11()</tt> method looks much like the
  <tt>send_cm17()</tt> method used in earlier examples, but it does
  a lot more work. It computes a checksum, validates the
  transmission, handles retries, and checks for incoming data. The
  CM11 can also initiate communication, sending a single character
  "read me" request when it has data waiting to be processed.</p>

  <p>Let's look at one final example that assumes we have the
  hardware we need to manipulate our appliances. The result is
  <a href="tpj0501-0007g.html">Listing 7</a>, follow_leader.pl.
  After initializing, the program loops waiting for activity on
  unit A1. If it sees any, it sets A2 to the same state. This is a
  somewhat contrived example, but it illustrates some important
  elements of an automation control loop -- in part because it
  spends most of its time scanning for inputs of interest. (I used
  the <tt>$block</tt> option to get a loop timing of about a second
  instead of an explicit <tt>sleep 1</tt>.)</p>

  <p>If you run follow_leader.pl without hardware, you'll see a
  result like this:</p>
  <pre>
| ...............
| Sending A2 ON
| ...............
</pre>

  <p>The example simulates receiving an <tt>A1 ON</tt> halfway
  through, and prints a dot roughly every second to indicate cycles
  through the loop. With a CM11 and an external RF command unit,
  you'll see output like the following:</p>
  <pre>
| .....
| Received A1AJ
| 
| Sending A2 ON
| .......
| Received A1AK
| 
| Sending A2 OFF
| .......
| Received A1AJ
| 
| Sending A2 ON
| ......
| Received A1AK
| 
| Sending A2 OFF
| .....
</pre>

  <p><b>A Few More Considerations in Building an
  Application</b></p>

  <p>So what other issues are involved in creating a real home
  automation program? Earlier in this issue, Bruce Winter discusses
  some of the user interface issues and one approach to managing
  them. I'll concentrate on the issues that arise in a read/write
  hardware setup and those associated with multiple users as well.
  Most of these comments apply to both the CM11 and CM17 (and to
  other computer interfaces as well).</p>

  <p>1. It takes a long time to talk to household appliances -- so
  long that if you're going to be having some appliances depend on
  what others are doing, or if you're going to have a spiffy user
  interface that monitors many appliances, you need an event queue.
  This lets your computer perform other tasks between attempts at
  communication.</p>

  <p>2. A real application needs to know what is turned on and what
  is turned off. We can keep track of what we've done to each unit,
  or if CM11-style two-way communication is available we can send
  an "are you on" status query. However, this is slow, so we want
  to maintain a local model of the appliances whenever
  possible.</p>

  <p>3. If we wish to allow commands from multiple sources (say,
  from a web page, command line, and program loop), or from
  multiple users, we need to resolve issues such as who "owns" the
  port.</p>

  <p>4. Some means of override needs to be provided in case the
  state data becomes stale or invalid. When the computer is
  rebooted (or the program stopped and restarted), we won't know if
  an appliance is on or off unless we saved the previous state.</p>

  <p>5. When many people have access to the same set of appliances,
  you might want to restrict access for certain user/appliance
  combinations. In this case, authentication may be required.</p>

  <p>6. We have touched only lightly on error handling and event
  logging. The device controllers can detect many kinds of errors,
  including collisions on the power line and invalid commands. The
  CM11.pm module uses checksums to validate communications with the
  CM11 box, and the box itself can detect some errors and retry
  unsuccessful transmissions. The CM17 is a one-way device, so its
  error handling is more limited.</p>

  <p>Bruce Winter has addressed most of these, and many more, in
  his excellent MisterHouse program. It's well worth a bit of study
  before you reinvent the wheel.</p>
