  <p>The first time that most Perl programmers run into
  object-oriented programming is when they need to use a module
  whose interface is object-oriented. This is often a mystifying
  experience, since talk of "methods" and "constructors" is
  unintelligible to programmers who thought that functions and
  variables were all there was to worry about.</p>

  <p>Articles and books that explain object-oriented programming
  (OOP) do so from the perspective of how to create programs.
  That's understandable, and if you learn to write object-oriented
  code of your own, you'll find it easy to use object-oriented code
  that others write. But this approach is the <i>long</i> way
  around for people whose immediate goal is just to use existing
  object-oriented modules, but who don't yet want to know all the
  gory details of having to write such modules for themselves.</p>

  <p>This article is for those programmers - programmers who want
  to know about objects from the perspective of using
  object-oriented modules.</p>

  <h3>Modules And Their Functional Interfaces</h3>

  <p>Modules are the main way that Perl provides for bundling up
  code for later use by yourself or others. As I'm sure you can't
  help noticing from reading <i>The Perl Journal</i>, CPAN (the
  Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) is the repository for modules
  (or groups of modules) that others have written, to do anything
  from composing music to accessing Web pages. A good deal of those
  modules even come with every installation of Perl.</p>

  <p>One module that you may have used before, and which is fairly
  typical in its interface, is Text::Wrap. It comes with Perl, so
  you don't even need to install it from CPAN. You use it in a
  program of yours, by having your program say:</p><tt>use
  Text::Wrap;</tt>

  <p>and after that, you can access a function called
  <tt>wrap</tt>, which inserts line-breaks in text that you feed
  it, so that the text will be wrapped to seventy-two (or however
  many) columns.</p>

  <p>The way this <tt>use Text::Wrap</tt> business works is that
  the module Text::Wrap exists as a file <tt>Text/Wrap.pm</tt>
  somewhere in one of your library directories. That file contains
  Perl code which,(And mixed in with the Perl code, there's
  documentation, which is what you read with <tt>perldoc
  Text::Wrap</tt>. The <tt>perldoc</tt> program simply ignores the
  code and formats the documentation text, whereas <tt>use
  Text::Wrap</tt> loads and runs the code while ignoring the
  documentation. ) among other things, defines a function called
  <tt>Text::Wrap::wrap()</tt>, and then <i>exports</i> that
  function. That means that when you say <tt>wrap()</tt> after
  having said <tt>use Text::Wrap</tt>, you'll actually be calling
  the <tt>Text::Wrap::wrap()</tt> function. Some modules don't
  export their functions, so you have to call them by their fully
  qualified name:
  <tt>Text::Wrap::wrap(...<i>parameters</i>...)</tt>.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether a module exports the functions it
  provides, it's basically just a container for chunks of code that
  do useful things. The way the module allows for you to interact
  with it is called its <i>interface</i>. And when, like with
  Text::Wrap, its interface consists of functions, the module is
  said to have a <i>functional interface</i>.(The term "function"
  (and therefore "functional ") has various meanings. I&#8217;m
  using the term here to mean essentially a subroutine: a chunk of
  code called by some name which takes some parameters and returns
  a value.)</p>

  <p>Using modules with functional interfaces is straightforward -
  instead of defining your own <tt>wrap()</tt> function with
  <tt>sub wrap { ... }</tt>, you entrust <tt>Text::Wrap</tt> to do
  that for you, along with whatever other functions it defines and
  exports according to the module's documentation. Without too much
  bother, you can even write your own modules to contain your
  frequently used functions; I suggest having a look at the
  <tt>perlmod</tt> documentation for more leads on this.</p>

  <h3>Modules With Object-Oriented Interfaces</h3>

  <p>Suppose that one day you want to write a program that
  automates the process of transferring a bunch of files from one
  server down to your local machine, and then off to another
  server, all with FTP.</p>

  <p>A quick browse through search.cpan.org turns up the module
  Net::FTP, which you can download and install using the normal
  installation procedures (unless your system administrator has
  already installed it, as many have).</p>

  <p>Like Text::Wrap or any other module with a familiar functional
  interface, you start off using Net::FTP in your program by
  saying:</p><tt>use Net::FTP;</tt>

  <p>However, that's where the similarity ends. The first hint is
  that the documentation for Net::FTP refers to it as a
  <i>class</i>. A class is found in a module with an
  object-oriented interface.</p>

  <p>Whereas modules like Text::Wrap provide bits of useful code as
  <i>functions</i> to be called like
  <tt>function(...parameters...)</tt> or like
  <tt>PackageName::function(...parameters...)</tt>, Net::FTP and
  other modules with object-oriented interfaces provide
  <i>methods</i>. Methods are like functions in that they have a
  name and parameters; but methods look different, and are
  different, because you have to call them with a class name or an
  object as an argument. First I'll explain the syntax for method
  calls, and then I'll explain what they all mean.</p>

  <p><b>Class methods</b>. Some methods are meant to be called as
  <i>class methods</i>, with the class name (same as the module
  name) as a special argument. Class methods look like this:</p>
  <pre>
   <b>ClassName</b>-&gt;methodname(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
   <b>ClassName</b>-&gt;methodname()   # if no parameters
   <b>ClassName</b>-&gt;methodname     # same as above
</pre>which you will sometimes see written:
  <pre>
  methodname <b>ClassName</b> (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
  methodname <b>ClassName</b>      # if no parameters
</pre>

  <p>Most class methods are for making new objects. The methods
  that make objects are called <i>constructors</i>, and the process
  of making them is called "constructing" or "instantiating" an
  object. Constructor methods typically have the name <tt>new</tt>,
  or something including "new" (for instance,
  <tt>new_from_file</tt>), but they can conceivably be named
  anything. DBI's constructor is named <tt>connect</tt>, for
  example.</p>The object returned by a constructor is typically
  captured in a scalar variable:
  <pre>
$object = ClassName-&gt;new(param1, param2...);
</pre>

  <p>Object methods. Once you have an object (more later on exactly
  what that is), you can use the other kind of method call syntax,
  the syntax for <i>object method</i> calls. You call object
  methods just like class methods, except that instead of the
  ClassName as the special argument, you use an expression that
  yields an object. Usually this is just a scalar variable that
  captures the output of the constructor. Object method calls look
  like this:</p>
  <pre>
   <b>$object</b>-&gt;methodname(parameter1, parameter2, ...);
   <b>$object</b>-&gt;methodname()   # if no parameters
   <b>$object</b>-&gt;methodname     # same as above
   They are sometimes written like this as well:
   methodname <b>$object</b> (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
   methodname <b>$object</b>      # if no parameters
</pre>Some examples of method calls:
  <pre>
my $session1 = Net::FTP-&gt;new("ftp.myhost.com");
   # Calls a class method "new", from class Net::FTP,
   #  with the single parameter "ftp.myhost.com",
   #  and saves the return value (which is, as usual,
   #  an object), in $session1.
   # Could also be written new Net::FTP('ftp.myhost.com')
$session1-&gt;login("sburke", "aoeuaoeu") # call the 'login' method
    || die "failed to login!\n";
print "Dir:\n", $session1-&gt;dir(), "\n";
$session1-&gt;quit;        # same as $session1-&gt;quit()
print "Done\n";
exit;
</pre>

  <p>Incidentally, I suggest always using the parentheses and
  <tt>-&gt;</tt>,(The character-pair <tt>-&gt;</tt> is supposed to
  look like an arrow, not "negative greater-than"!) and avoiding
  the forms that begin <tt>methodname $object</tt> or
  <tt>methodname ModuleName</tt>. When everything's going right,
  they all mean the same thing as the <tt>-&gt;</tt> variants, but
  the <tt>-&gt;</tt> is more visually distinct from function calls,
  as well as being immune to some rare but puzzling ambiguities
  that can arise when you're trying to call methods that have the
  same name as subroutines you've defined.</p>

  <p>Syntax aside, all this talk of constructing objects and object
  methods begs the question - what <i>is</i> an object? There are
  several angles to this question that the rest of this article
  will answer in turn: What can you do with objects? What's in an
  object? What's an object value? And why do some modules use
  objects at all?</p>

  <h3>What Can You Do With Objects?</h3>

  <p>You've seen that you can make objects, and call object methods
  with them. But what are object methods for? The answer depends on
  the class. For Net::FTP, an object represents a session between
  your computer and an FTP server. So the methods you call on a
  Net::FTP object are for doing whatever you'd need to do across an
  FTP connection. You make the session and log in:</p>
  <pre>
my $session = Net::FTP-&gt;new('ftp.aol.com');
 die "Couldn't connect!" unless defined $session;
     # The class method call to "new" will return
     # the new object if it goes OK.  Otherwise it
     # will return undef.
    
$session-&gt;login('sburke', 'p@ssw3rD')
   || die "Did I change my password again?";
     # The object method "login" will give a true
     # return value if actually logs in, otherwise
     # it'll return false.
</pre>

  <p>You can use the session object to change directory on that
  session:</p>
  <pre>
$session-&gt;cwd("/home/sburke/public_html")
   || die "Hey, that was REALLY supposed to work!";
     # if the cwd fails, it'll return false
</pre>And then get files from the machine at the other end of the
session:
  <pre>
foreach my $f ('log_report_ua.txt', 'log_report_dom.txt',
               'log_report_browsers.txt') {
    $session-&gt;get($f) || warn "Getting $f failed!"
};
</pre>... and plenty else, ending with closing the connection:
  <pre>
$session-&gt;quit();
</pre>

  <p>In short, object methods are for doing things related to (or
  with) whatever the object represents. For FTP sessions, it's
  about sending commands to the server at the other end of the
  connection, and that's about it - there, methods are for doing
  something to the world outside the object, and the object is just
  something that specifies what bit of the world (well, what FTP
  session) to act upon.</p>

  <p>With most other classes, however, the object itself stores
  some kind of information, and it typically makes no sense to do
  things with such an object without considering the data
  inside.</p>

  <h3>What's In An Object?</h3>

  <p>An object is (with rare exceptions) a data structure
  containing a bunch of attributes, each of which has a value. Some
  of the object's attributes are private, meaning you'll never see
  them documented because they're not for you to read or write; but
  most of the object's documented attributes are at least readable,
  and usually writeable, by you. Net::FTP objects are a bit thin on
  attributes, so we'll use objects from the class
  Business::US_Amort for this example. Business::US_Amort is a very
  simple class (available from CPAN) that I wrote for making loan
  calculations (specifically amortization, using U.S.-style
  algorithms).</p>

  <p>An object of the class Business::US_Amort represents a loan
  with particular attributes. The most basic attributes of a "loan
  object" are its interest rate, its principal (how much money it's
  for), and its term (how long it'll take to repay). You need to
  set these attributes before anything else can be done with the
  object, through accessors. An <i>accessor</i> is simply a method
  that accesses an attribute, either retrieving (reading, getting,
  fetching) or storing (writing, setting, putting). Moreover,
  accessors are typically the <i>only</i> way you can change an
  object's attributes.</p>

  <p>Usually, for simplicity's sake, an accessor is named after the
  attribute it reads or writes. With Business::US_Amort objects,
  the accessors you need to use first are <tt>principal</tt>,
  <tt>interest_rate</tt>, and <tt>term</tt>. Then, with at least
  those attributes set, you can call the <tt>run()</tt> method to
  figure out several things about the loan. Then you can call
  various accessors, like <tt>total_paid_toward_interest()</tt>, to
  read the results:</p>
  <pre>
use Business::US_Amort;
   my $loan = Business::US_Amort-&gt;new;
   # Set the necessary attributes:
   $loan-&gt;<b>principal</b>(123654);
   $loan-&gt;<b>interest_rate</b>(9.25);
   $loan-&gt;<b>term</b>(20); # twenty years
 
   # NOW we know enough to calculate the interest to be paid:
   $loan-&gt;run;
   
   print
     "Total paid toward interest: A WHOPPING ",
     $loan-&gt;total_paid_toward_interest, "!!\n";
</pre>

  <p>This illustrates a convention common to accessors: calling the
  accessor with no arguments (as with
  <tt>$loan-&gt;total_paid_interest</tt>) usually means to read the
  value of that attribute, but providing a value (as with
  <tt><nobr>$loan-&gt;term(20)</nobr></tt>) means you want the
  attribute to be set to that value. This stands to reason: why
  would you be providing a value, if not to store it in the
  attribute?</p>

  <p>Although a loan's term, principal, and interest rates are all
  single numeric values, an object's values can be any kind of
  scalar, array, or hash. Moreover, an attribute's values can
  itself be an object. For example, consider the MIDI files I wrote
  about in TPJ #13. A MIDI file usually consists of several musical
  tracks, and is complex enough to merit being an object of its own
  with attributes like the tempo, the file-format variant it's in,
  and the list of instrument tracks in the file. But tracks
  themselves are complex enough to be objects too, with attributes
  like their track type, and either a list of MIDI commands or raw
  data. So I ended up writing the MIDI modules so that the
  <tt>tracks</tt> attribute of a MIDI::Opus object is an array of
  objects from the class MIDI::Track. This may seem like a
  runaround - you ask what's in one object, and get <i>another</i>
  object, or several! But in this case, it reflects exactly what
  the module is for - MIDI files contain MIDI tracks, which then
  contain data.</p>

  <h3>What Is An Object Value?</h3>

  <p>When you call a constructor like
  <tt>Net::FTP-&gt;new(hostname)</tt>, store the result in a
  variable, like <tt>$session</tt> or <tt>$loan</tt>. We've been
  pretending that those are the objects you're dealing with. This
  idea is innocuous up to a point, but it's really a
  misconception.(It depends, very presidentially, on what our
  definitions of "are" are.) The reality is that the variables
  $session and $loan are not objects. It's a little more indirect -
  they hold values that symbolize objects. The kind of value that
  $session or $loan hold is what I'm calling an <i>object
  value</i>.</p>

  <p>To understand what kind of value this is, first think about
  the other kinds of scalar values you know about: The first two
  scalar values you probably ever ran into in Perl are numbers and
  strings, which you learned (or just assumed) will usually turn
  into each other on demand; that is, the three-character string
  "2.5" can become the quantity two and a half, and vice versa.
  Then, especially if you started using <tt>perl -w</tt> early on,
  you learned about the <i>undefined value</i>, which can turn into
  0 if you treat it as a number, or an empty string if you treat it
  as a string.(You may also have learned about references, in which
  case you&#8217;re ready to hear that object values are just a
  kind of reference, except that they reflect the class that
  created them in addition to being an array reference, hash
  reference, or something else. If this makes makes sense to you,
  and you want to know more about how objects are implemented in
  Perl, have a look at the perltoot documentation or the sidebar
  later in this article.)</p>

  <p>And now you're learning about object values. An object value
  is a value that points to a data structure somewhere in memory,
  which is where all the attributes for this object are stored.
  That data structure as a whole belongs to a class (probably the
  one you named in the constructor method, like
  <tt>ClassName-&gt;new</tt>), so that the object value can be used
  as part of object method calls. If you want to actually
  <i>see</i> what an object value is, you might try just saying
  <tt>print $object</tt>. That'll get you something like this:</p>
  <pre>
Net::FTP=GLOB(0x20154240)
</pre>or
  <pre>
Business::US_Amort=HASH(0x15424020)
</pre>

  <p>That's not very helpful if you wanted to really get at the
  object's insides, but that's because the object value is only a
  symbol for the object. This may all sound very abstruse and
  metaphysical, so a real-world allegory might be helpful:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>You get an advertisement in the mail saying that you have
    been (im)personally selected to have the rare privilege of
    applying for a credit card. For whatever reason, <i>this</i>
    offer sounds good to you, so you fill out the form and mail it
    back to the credit card company. They gleefully approve the
    application, create your account, and send you a card with a
    number on it.</p>

    <p>Now, you can do things with the number on that card - clerks
    at stores can ring up things you want to buy, and charge your
    account by keying in the number on the card. You can pay for
    things you order online by punching in the card number as part
    of your online order. You can pay off part of the account by
    sending the credit card people some of your money (well, a
    check) with some note (usually the pre-printed slip) that has
    the card number for the account you want to pay toward. And you
    should be able to call the credit card company's computer and
    ask it things about the card, like its balance, its credit
    limit, its APR, and maybe an itemization of recent purchases
    and payments.</p>

    <p>Now, what you're <i>really</i> doing is manipulating a
    credit card <i>account</i>, a completely abstract entity with
    some data attached to it (balance, APR, etc). But for ease of
    access, you have a credit card <i>number</i> that is a symbol
    for that account. Now, that symbol is just a bunch of digits,
    and the number is effectively meaningless and useless in and of
    itself - but in the appropriate context, it's understood to
    <i>mean</i> the credit card account you're accessing.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is exactly the relationship between objects and object
  values, and from this analogy, several facts about object values
  are a bit more explicable:</p>

  <p>&#8226;&nbsp; An object value does nothing in and of itself,
  but it's useful when you use it in the context of an
  <tt>$object-&gt;method</tt> call, the same way that a card number
  is useful in the context of some operation dealing with a card
  account.</p>

  <p>Moreover, several copies of the same object value all refer to
  the same object, the same way that making several copies of your
  card number won't change the fact that they all still refer to
  the same single account (this is true whether you're "copying"
  the number by just writing it down on different slips of paper,
  or whether you go to the trouble of forging exact replicas of
  your own plastic credit card). That's why this:</p>
  <pre>
$x = Net::FTP-&gt;new("ftp.aol.com");
   $x-&gt;login("sburke", "aoeuaoeu");
</pre>does the same thing as this:
  <pre>
$x = Net::FTP-&gt;new("ftp.aol.com");
   $y = $x;
   $z = $y;
   $z-&gt;login("sburke", "aoeuaoeu");
</pre>

  <p>That is, <tt>$z</tt> and <tt>$y</tt> and <tt>$x</tt> are three
  different <i>slots</i> for values, but what's in those slots are
  all object values pointing to the same object. You don't have
  three different FTP connections, just three variables with values
  pointing to the same single FTP connection.</p>

  <p>&#8226;&nbsp; You can't tell much of anything about the object
  just by looking at the object value, any more than you can see
  your credit account balance by holding the plastic card up to the
  light, or by adding up the digits in your credit card number.</p>

  <p>&#8226;&nbsp; You can't just make up your own object values
  and have them work - they can come only from constructor methods
  of the appropriate class. Similarly, you get a credit card number
  <i>only</i> by having a bank approve your application for a
  credit card account - at which point <i>they</i> let <i>you</i>
  know what the number of your new card is.</p>

  <p>Now, there's even more to the fact that you can't just make up
  your own object value: even though you can print an object value
  and get a string like <tt>Net::FTP=GLOB(0x20154240)</tt>, that
  string is just a <i>representation</i> of an object value.</p>

  <p>Internally, an object value has a basically different type
  from a string, or a number, or the undefined value - if
  <tt>$x</tt> holds a real string, then that value's slot in memory
  says "this is a value of type <i>string</i>, and its characters
  are&#8230;", whereas if it's an object value, the slot in memory
  says, "this is a value of type <i>reference</i>, and the location
  in memory that it points to is...". By looking at what's at that
  location, Perl can tell the class of what's there.</p>

  <p>Perl programmers typically don't have to think about all these
  details. Many other languages force you to be more conscious of
  the differences between all of these (and also between types of
  numbers, which are stored differently depending on their size and
  whether they have fractional parts). But Perl does its best to
  hide the different types of scalars from you - it turns numbers
  into strings and back as needed, and takes the string or number
  representation of undef or of object values as needed. However,
  you can't go from a string representation of an object back to
  the object value. And that's why this doesn't work:</p>
  <pre>
$x = Net::FTP-&gt;new('ftp.aol.com');
    $y = Net::FTP-&gt;new('ftp.netcom.com');
    $z = Net::FTP-&gt;new('ftp.qualcomm.com');
    $all = <b>join(' ', $x,$y,$z);</b>
        
</pre>...later...
  <pre>
    ($aol, $netcom, $qualcomm) = <b>split(' ', $all);</b>
    $aol-&gt;login("sburke", "aoeuaoeu");
    $netcom-&gt;login("sburke", "qjkxqjkx");
    $qualcomm-&gt;login("smb", "dhtndhtn");
</pre>

  <p>This fails because <tt>$aol</tt> ends up holding merely the
  <i>string representation</i> of the object value from
  <tt>$x</tt>, not the object value itself - when <tt>join</tt>
  tried to join the characters of the "strings" <tt>$x</tt>,
  <tt>$y</tt>, and <tt>$z</tt>, Perl saw that they weren't strings
  at all, so it gave <tt>join</tt> their string
  representations.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this distinction between object values and
  their string representations doesn't really fit into the analogy
  of credit card numbers, because credit card numbers really
  <i>are</i> numbers - even though they don't express any
  meaningful quantity, if you stored one in a database as a
  quantity (as opposed to an ASCII string), that wouldn't stop them
  from being valid as credit card numbers.</p>

  <p>This may seem rather academic, but there are two common
  mistakes programmers new to objects often make, both having to do
  with the distinction between object values and their string
  representations.</p>

  <p>The first common error involves forgetting (or never having
  known in the first place) that when you use a value as a hash
  key, Perl uses the string representation of that value. When you
  want to use the numeric value two and a half as a key, Perl turns
  it into the three-character string "2.5". But if you then want to
  use that string as a number, Perl will treat it as meaning two
  and a half, so you're usually none the wiser that Perl converted
  the number to a string and back. But recall that Perl can't turn
  strings back into objects - so if you tried to use a Net::FTP
  object value as a hash key, Perl actually used its string
  representation, like "Net::FTP=GLOB(0x20154240)", but that string
  is unusable as an object value. (Incidentally, there's a module
  called Tie::RefHash which implements hashes that <i>do</i> let
  you use real object-values as keys.)</p>

  <p>The second common error with object values is in trying to
  save an object value to disk (whether printing it to a file, or
  storing it in a conventional database file). All you'll get is
  the string, which will be useless.</p>

  <p>When you want to save an object and restore it later, you may
  find that the object's class already provides a method
  specifically for this. For example, MIDI::Opus provides methods
  for writing an object to disk as a standard MIDI file. The file
  can later be read back into memory by a MIDI::Opus constructor
  method, which returns a new MIDI::Opus object representing
  whatever file you tell it to read into memory. Similar methods
  are available with, for example, classes that manipulate graphic
  images and can save them to files, which can be read back
  later.</p>

  <p>But some classes, like Business::US_Amort, don't give you a
  way to store an object in a file. In that case, you can try using
  any of the Data::Dumper, Storable, or FreezeThaw modules. Using
  these will be unproblematic for objects of most classes, but it
  may run into limitations with others. For example, a
  Business::US_Amort object can be turned into a string with
  Data::Dumper, and that string written to a file. When it's
  restored later, its attributes will be accessible as normal. But
  in the unlikely case that the loan object was saved in
  mid-calculation, the calculation may not be resumable. This is
  because of the way that that <i>particular</i> class does its
  calculations, but similar limitations may occur with objects from
  other classses.</p>

  <p>But often, even <i>wanting</i> to save an object is basically
  wrong. What would saving an FTP <tt>session</tt> even mean?
  Saving the hostname, username, and password? The current
  directory on both machines? The local TCP/IP port number? In the
  case of "saving" a Net::FTP object, you're better off just saving
  whatever details you actually need for your own purposes, so that
  you can make a new object later and just set those values for
  it.</p>

  <h3>So Why Do Some Modules Use Objects?</h3>

  <p>All these details of using objects are definitely enough to
  make you wonder - is it worth the bother? If you're a module
  author, writing your module with an object-oriented interface
  restricts the audience of potential users to those who understand
  the basic concepts of objects and object values, as well as
  Perl's syntax for calling methods. Why complicate things by
  having an object-oriented interface?</p>

  <p>Basically, a module should have an object-oriented interface
  because the module's insides are written in an object-oriented
  style. This article is about the basics of object-oriented
  <i>interfaces</i>, and it'd be going far afield to explain
  object-oriented <i>design</i>. But the short story is that
  object-oriented design is just one way of attacking messy
  problems. It's a way that many programmers find very helpful (and
  which others happen to find to be far more of a hassle than it's
  worth, incidentally), and it just happens to show up for you, the
  module user, as the style of interface.</p>
