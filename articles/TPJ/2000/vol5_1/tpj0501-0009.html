  <p>The fate of Usenet has been bantered about quite a bit lately.
  Slashdot posters have proclaimed the death of Usenet (<a href=
  "http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/02/04/2224201" target=
  "resource window">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/02/04/2224201</a>),
  and even a Washington Post article claims that Usenet mave have
  outlived its usefulness (<a href=
  "http://search.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/2000-02/04/066l-020400-idx.html"
  target=
  "resource window">http://search.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/2000-02/04/066l-020400-idx.html</a>).
  They both seem to suggest that Usenet newsgroups will be replaced
  by special-purpose web-based discussion forums, like Slashdot.
  Furthermore, a series of flamewars and a barrage of CGI questions
  in comp.lang.perl.misc have had many in the Perl community
  wondering about the viability of comp.lang.perl.misc, and how
  long it can last.</p>

  <p>Myself, I'm a big fan of the newsgroup. I learned a lot of
  Perl from it, and more importantly I learned how to answer
  questions for new Perl programmers. I gained a lot of experience
  by simply lurking, and then posting, to the group. What follows
  is an in-depth analysis of the articles posted to
  comp.lang.perl.misc, all nicely trimmed and categorized &mdash;
  and a little speculation on what makes the group tick.</p>

  <p><b>A Little History</b></p>

  <p>The Usenet group comp.lang.perl.misc was created in May 1995.
  The charter originally described it as a newsgroup for
  "discussion of issues of all sorts relating to Perl." It's become
  exactly that. The topics in the group range from discussion of
  Perl's guts to CGI programming with Perl.</p>

  <p>The group is high-traffic, often receiving over 200 posts a
  day. The posters are new Perl programmers, experts, and the
  occasional visits by people who were looking for other groups.
  The "experts" can be people who are still learning Perl and
  happen to know enough to answer the question at hand, up to gurus
  who speak at conferences, write books, and hack on Perl
  itself.</p>

  <p><b>How the Day in the Life was Done</b></p>

  <p>Before diving into the statistics, a brief description of how
  they were gathered. I analyzed all the threads with messages
  posted on Groundhog Day, 2000. Why February 2? Because I decided
  to write the article on the 4th, and my local newsfeed had
  several days of articles remaining in the spool. This meant that
  I didn't have to use Deja News to retrieve articles. I wasn't
  trying to find (or avoid) flame wars; it was mostly just a
  convenient day for me.</p>

  <p>Any thread that was open on February 2 was considered for the
  statistics. According to my newsfeed, exactly 250 articles were
  posted on that day. Once messages posted on other days that
  belonged to February 2 threads were included, there were 432
  articles that needed to be read, sorted, graded, and judged.</p>

  <table align="right" width="200">
    <tr>
      <td><font face="verdana" size="-2"><b>Figure 2.</b> a Perl/Tk
      categorization tool for comp.lang.perl.misc</font></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/tpj0501-0011-02.gif"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>For reading the articles, I wrote a small Perl/Tk
  application (pictured in Figure 2) to pop up each article one at
  a time along with a clickable scorecard. The headers (except for
  the <tt>Subject: line</tt>) and the signatures were removed while
  I scored to help prevent bias. After years of reading c.l.p.misc,
  I was sometimes able to determine a poster just by his writing
  style, but I tried not to let that affect my grading.

  <p>Each article was judged on its own merits. The quality of the
  questions (except for determining whether the poster's subject
  line was appropriate) was ignored. If a poster flamed a good
  question, or counter-flamed, it was still considered a flame.
  Sarcastic, flame-baited answers were considered both answers and
  flames &mdash; articles could to fall under multiple headings
  &mdash; the same message could be "off-topic", "flame", and an
  "answer".</p>

  <p><b>The Raw Statistics</b></p>

  <p>There were 109 questions posted to the group in that period,
  of which 30 included some code. This means that the person asking
  the question (and later on, the person answering) included some
  attempt at writing the code and was seeking correction, syntax
  help, advice, or debugging.</p>

  <p>17 questions were simply off-topic, having no Perl content
  whatsoever. The topic for c.l.p.misc is "issues of all sorts
  relating to Perl", so anything involving Perl is fair game. Many
  people in c.l.p.misc feel that CGI questions are off-topic for
  the group, and I do as well &mdash; except when it's about CGI pm
  module usage, or Perl CGI programs that aren't working. To me,
  this is just the latest trend in computing. It used to be
  client/server applications, and next it might be distributed
  computing. Perl adapts to its environment so well, it's natural
  that c.l.p.misc's posts would drift toward current trends. And
  it's not just CGI. Half the off-topic posts were about SQL or
  databases of one kind or another, having nothing to do with Perl
  (or its modules) whatsoever.</p>

  <p>How many of those 109 questions were answered? All but four of
  them were eventually answered with code, suggestions to move
  along to another group, documentation pointers, or other helpful
  information. This is a response rate of over 96%. Some of them
  took a few days to be answered, and I stopped checking after four
  days to see if the remaining four would be answered.</p>

  <p>Of the 109 questions, only 60 had what I'd consider to be good
  subject lines, where the body of the message was adequately
  described. (I was being quite generous.) At this point, I'd like
  to kick out a few soapboxes, and point out that of those 49 bad
  subject lines, only one was changed by the responder.</p>

  <p>On the subject of subject lines, the articles broke down along
  these lines, with the major theme being the following:</p>
  <pre>
<font color="#000000">
      <b>On Topic Articles</b>
         
         209 Perl language usage, bugs, questions, and answers
          29 Windows-specific questions 
          20 Web questions 
          18 Module usage questions
          12 Books 
          14 Questions about programs that Perl interacts with
             (sendmail, shell questions, ...) 

      <b>Off Topic Articles</b>
         
          18 Web articles (CGI, HTTP, or web server issues)
          10 Database (SQL language, database server issues, ...)
           9 Questions about running programs other than Perl
           4 Javascript postings
           8 Windows, Unix or OS conversations; unrelated to Perl
</font>
</pre>

  <p>There were 30 articles which were neither questions or
  answers, just casual on-topic conversation about Perl.</p>

  <p><b>The Day's Weather Report</b></p>

  <p>Overall, things in the newsgroup were calm that day. 178
  answers were posted to the group, and a suprising 70 of them
  included code written by the responder.</p>

  <p>Flames were moderate that day as well. Only 14 articles were
  categorized as true flames: content-free, without any merit
  whatsoever and existed only to say "NO, THAT'S WRONG!"
  Suprisingly (or not, depending on your view) almost all eleven
  flames were from channel regulars.</p>

  <p>Finishing on a good note, there were sixteen messages that
  were Thank You's. Not simply "TIA" (thanks in advance), but
  honest thanks for information passed along. They acknowledged the
  advice sent, seemed to benefit from it, and were polite enough to
  respond accordingly. Who says civility is dead?</p>

  <p>The group c.l.p.misc has a blessing almost unique to Usenet
  newsgroups: there's almost no spam. Only three articles out of
  all 432 could be considered advertising, and two were on-topic.
  The two on-topic posts were a Call for Papers for the O'Reilly
  Perl Conference in Monterey, and a job listing for a Perl
  programmer (which should have been posted elsewhere). The
  off-topic posting, way off the mark, was a broadly-crossposted
  Call for Papers for a USENIX Windows NT Symposium. Shame on
  USENIX; they should know better.</p>

  <p><b>Netiquette Nits</b></p>

  <p>Abusive crossposting was almost non-existent. Most of the
  crossposts were between comp.lang.perl.misc and any one of
  alt.perl, comp.lang.perl.modules, or the obsolete comp.lang.perl.
  70 articles were crossposted total. Only 5 articles were
  crossposted to three or more groups, and none (except the
  aforementioned USENIX spam) to more than 5.</p>

  <p>Despite all of the moaning about munging email addresses when
  comp.lang.perl.moderated was being created, addresses are almost
  never hidden in comp.lang.perl.misc. By visual inspection, there
  were 418 unique e-mail addresses over that period. Twenty of them
  were obviously forged or undeliverable. (I didn't actually send
  mail to the 418 addresses to verify they were real, but I did
  read all of the relevant articles and only counted those that
  were clearly munged for spam protection.)</p>

  <p>The other netiquette gripe is about trimming quoted posts and
  submitting Jeopardy-style messages &mdash; where the quoted
  article appears after the response, so that reading top-to-bottom
  the answer appears first and then the question. Only 248 of the
  314 articles with any quoting had the quoted material trimmed
  down at all. Only one person who employed Jeopardy-style quoting
  trimmed the quoted material.</p>

  <p>Of the 66 articles that weren't trimmed at all (but containted
  quoted material), 37 were Jeopardy-style and 29 were traditional
  (quoted material, then response). This seems to support the
  notion that Jeopardy-style posters do not trim at all, and make
  up the majority of those posters who don't trim.</p>

  <p>And what about the FAQs? Of the 92 on-topic questions, only 15
  were on the FAQ list (the "core" FAQ, the Win32 FAQ, or the
  Idiots Guide). Five of the remaining questions were questions
  about the FAQ &mdash; all of them because the FAQ sometimes
  presents simple and complex answers to the same question without
  clear explanation as to which should be used. In one respondent's
  words, "the FAQ tries to be too cute sometimes." This is not a
  new complaint. The 72 remaining questions could not clearly be
  answered by any of the FAQs. What I unfortunately did not analyze
  were the proportion that could have been answered by reading the
  documentation. (That is, questions that were clearly about
  well-documented features and did not need further explanation by
  someone more experienced in the field.)</p>

  <p><b>The Regulars</b></p>

  <p>Who answers all of these questions? The group has a core of
  regulars, to be sure. These folks have been reading c.l.p.misc
  for years and still find time to reply to questions and to
  monitor the group. Tom Phoenix, Randal Schwartz, and Larry
  Rossler, to name a few. These guys were posting when I was just
  learning Perl and they're still going strong.</p>

  <p>Of course, there are some who have dropped out. Larry Wall no
  longer posts to comp.lang.perl.misc, and recently Tom
  Christiansen has dropped out as well. The high volume of posts,
  the number of novices, and the frequency of FAQs contributes to
  the dropout rate. The comp.lang.perl.moderated group and the
  perl5-porters mailing list remain refuges to hear these
  voices.</p>

  <p>In addition to the hardcore old-timers are those that answer a
  question here and there. As the core gets whittled down, they
  find themselves taking on more and more questions.</p>

  <p>Why do people post? A quick survey of the regulars appearing
  in Greg Bacon's comp.lang.perl.misc statistics turned up a few
  reasons. Foremost seems to be that they're doing this as a
  learning experience for themselves. As Jonathon Stowe put it,
  "every program I write now &mdash; I treat it as if it were going
  to be exposed to the criticism of c.l.p.m. and so apply those
  coding standards to everything I write."</p>

  <p>There is also a wish not to see Perl misrepresented, and
  genuine desire to help others. The last reason common to all the
  regulars who answered was to participate in the Perl community in
  some small way.</p>

  <p><b>The Future of comp.lang.perl.misc</b></p>

  <p>Where does the group go from here? I asked the regulars if
  they were satisfied with the state of comp.lang.perl.misc, and
  almost universally they answered no. The answers were not
  unexpected:</p>

  <p>&bull; Posters need to read more documentation before
  posting.</p>

  <p>&bull; Posters need to lurk, or search newsgroup archives
  before posting.</p>

  <p>&bull; Posters need to stay on topic.</p>

  <p>For comparison's sake, I showed the messages to other Usenet
  old-timers and the reaction was "well, these apply to <i>any</i>
  group on Usenet..."</p>

  <p>Some of the regulars have taken fanatical measures to ensure
  that the group stays on track, and this lends a reputation
  (deserved or not) to c.l.p.misc that it's a newbie-hostile group.
  However, like any other static institution bombarded with change
  and youth, it has been changing and flexing to suit its
  environment. When the newbies wear down the old regulars, new
  regulars step in and take up the slack. I believe the group is
  doing just fine, and isn't getting any worse or better over the
  years. A quick survey of February 2, 1998 and February 2, 1996
  shows that the group hasn't changed much. Some of the regulars
  have gone, others have arrived. The topics have changed (more DBI
  and web, less networking and system administration), but the
  basic themes haven't.</p>

  <p>It would be nice if newbies lurked more, and read the
  documentation before posting. But even so, the group itself seems
  to be responding well and shaping itself to the trends it
  encounters. comp.lang.perl.misc should continue to be a useful
  resource for a long time to come.</p>
