  <h3>AROUND THE HUMP</h3>

  <p>Soon, all your friends and colleagues will be on their way
  through Alaska's Northwest Passage via the <b>Perl Whirl</b>,
  starting May 29. Too bad you aren't with them. Where else could
  you see polar bears and closures in the same place? The folks at
  <b>Geek Cruises</b> (<a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/"
  target="resource window">http://www.geekcruises.com/</a>) are
  planning other cruises, so fear not.</p>

  <p>The <b>German Perl Workshop</b> was held in March 2000, and
  their web site (<a href="http://www.gmd.de/Events/Perl-WS2000/"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www.gmd.de/Events/Perl-WS2000/</a>) has
  all the information about it.</p>

  <p>But it is not too late to get in on other Perl events this
  year. Yet Another Perl Conference (<b>yapc</b>) and O'Reilly's
  <b>Perl Conference</b> are on tap for this summer. Yapc 19100
  (<a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.yapc.org/America/</a>) is scheduled
  for June 21-23, once again held at Carnegie Mellon University in
  Pittsburgh, PA. The price for this low-cost, high-quality affair
  is set at $75 for the entire conference (not including housing),
  and is limited to 500 attendees (twice last year's inaugural
  event). This year's conference will feature special Lightning
  Talks (a series of consecutive five-minute talks), a Paintball
  Olympiad, and contributions from Larry Wall, Abigail, Damian
  Conway, Mark-Jason Dominus, Joseph Hall, purl, Randal Schwartz,
  Jon Orwant, and more.</p>

  <p>Perl Conference 4.0 (<a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/"
  target="resource window">http://conferences.oreilly.com/</a>)
  will for the second straight year be held in Monterey, CA, but
  for the first time it will be held in July instead of August.
  Once again, it will be part of the larger <b>O'Reilly Open Source
  Software Convention</b>, featuring Linux, Apache, Python,
  Sendmail, and Tcl/Tk as well.</p>

  <p>Lots of <b>Perl Mongers</b> groups (<a href=
  "http://www.pm.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.pm.org/</a>) have joined the fold
  since last time; welcome one and all. In America: Fairfax VA,
  Greenville SC, Ithaca NY, New Orleans LA, Newport Beach CA, San
  Marcos TX, Santa Barbara CA, and Stamford CT. In the rest of the
  world: Bursa (Turkey), Calcutta (West Bengal, India), Hanoi
  (Vietnam), Istanbul (Turkey), Milano (Italy), Odense (Denmark),
  Pirmasens (Rheinland/Pfalz, Germany), Pordenone (Italy), Quebec
  City (Quebec, Canada), Shenzhen (Guangdong, China), Southport
  (Merseyside, United Kingdom), Tijuana (Baja California, Mexico),
  Tirgu Mures (Mures, Romania), Tyumen (Russia), Venice (Italy),
  Yogyakarta (Indonesia).</p>

  <p>Joseph Hall has begun a new community project called
  <b>Perlfaq Prime</b> (<a href="http://www.perlfaq.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perlfaq.com/</a>), an ever-growing
  categorized and fully searchable set of user-supplied
  "faqtoids."</p>

  <p>Another new site, from <b>Block Stackers</b> (<a href=
  "http://www.blockstackers.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.blockstackers.com/</a>), is <b>Perl
  Monks</b> (<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perlmonks.org/</a>), a community for
  anyone trying to learn Perl or improve their current skills. Some
  of the features in the site include basic documentation,
  tutorials, question and answer forums, and sections for useful
  chunks of code.</p>

  <p>That "other" Block Stackers site, <b>Slashdot</b>, and its
  owner, <b>Andover.Net</b>, held the <b>Beanie Awards</b> in
  January. These awards, spread across various categories relating
  to the free software community, were nominated for and voted on
  by Slashdot users. The Best Perl Module award went to <b>CGI</b>,
  Best Apache Module went to <b>mod_perl</b>, and Best Book went to
  the Camel book, <b>Programming Perl</b>. Camel co-author Tom
  Christiansen won for Best Newbie Helper.</p>

  <p>Slashdot has released its current source, dubbed <b>Slash</b>,
  under the GPL. It is all done in Perl, MySQL, DBI, and mod_perl,
  and it is available at <b>Slashcode</b> (<a href=
  "http://slashcode.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://slashcode.com/</a>). For our Russian
  colleagues, there's a new site called Pref News (<a href=
  "http://simplex.ru/news/" target=
  "resource window">http://simplex.ru/news/</a>), a daily
  Russian-language e-zine dedicated to Perl, Unix, and database
  programming, with tutorials, articles, and interesting code
  snippets.</p>

  <p><b>www.perl.com</b> has been significantly active lately,
  posting a good article every other week or so. Recent offerings
  have included a continuation of Mark-Jason Dominus' series on
  dealing with spam, Kirrily Robert's defense of coding standards,
  and a debunking of the top ten myths of Perl by Simon Cozens.
  Kirrily's company, <b>Netizen</b>, has made its Perl training
  materials available for free under the <b>Open Content
  License</b> (<a href="http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml</a>),
  which allows copying, distribution, and modification of content
  for commercial and non-commercial purposes, as long as no fee is
  charged. <a href="http://netizen.com.au/services/training/"

  <p>Several new Perl books are hitting the shelves: O'Reilly has
  <b>Programming the Perl DBI</b> by Alligator Descartes and Tim
  Bunce; Advice Press has <b>Perl: Developer's Toolkit</b> by Randy
  Kobes; and SAMS has <b>Teach Yourself Perl in 24 Hours</b> by
  Clinton Pierce.</p>

  <p><b>Linux Magazine</b> published an article by Larry Wall
  called <i>Cultured Perl</i> in October 1999, and posted it online
  at <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/1999-10/uncultured_01.html"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www.linux-mag.com/1999-10/uncultured_01.html</a>.
  In the article, Wall traces the evolution of the language from
  gestation through adolescence.</p>

  <p><b>O'Reilly &amp; Associates</b> has hired Jon Orwant,
  co-author of <b>Mastering Algorithms with Perl</b> and editor of
  The Perl Journal, as Chief Technology Officer. Orwant recently
  received a Ph.D. after over a decade of work at MIT Media Lab's
  Electronic Publishing Group. "I'll be wearing a lot of hats,"
  said Orwant. "Some of those hats have to do with helping O'Reilly
  help the Perl community, some involve using Perl to streamline
  O'Reilly's internal operations, and some don't involve Perl at
  all. The hat that I may enjoy the most is making sure that Larry
  [Wall], an O'Reilly fellow, gets whatever support from us he
  needs."</p>

  <h3>Under The Belly</h3>

  <p>CPAN authors can now be mailed using their CPAN ID @cpan.org.
  Abusers of this will be shot with extreme prejudice.</p>

  <p>As of this writing, the second beta release of Perl 5.6 is
  out: version 5.5.670. It includes far too many fixes and features
  to mention here, but it is shaping up to be pretty darn cool. By
  the time you read this, Perl 5.6 should be released.</p>

  <p>ActivePerl 5.6 is also in beta, including Windows-specific
  features like Unicode system calls, Windows Installer (just in
  time for Windows 2000!), and <tt>fork()</tt> emulation. Windows
  95 and 98 are not supported in this release. However, two new
  platforms are supported. ActivePerl 5.6 comes in binary form for
  Linux on x86 platforms (with packages for Red Hat 6.0 and Debian
  2.1) and Solaris on SPARC 2.6. All versions of ActivePerl 5.6
  include Perl Package Manager support. Get ActivePerl from
  <b>ActiveState</b> at <a href="http://www.activestate.com/"
  target="resource window">http://www.activestate.com/</a>.</p>

  <p>ActiveState has also released a CD with the source code and
  binary of ActivePerl build 523, a snapshot of the ActiveState
  module repository, a debug build of ActivePerl, a Y2K advisory
  module, and unlicensed versions of the Perl Developer Kit and
  PerlEx.</p>

  <p>The <b>Perl bug database</b> (<a href="http://bugs.perl.org/"
  target="resource window">http://bugs.perl.org/</a>) has a new web
  interface, and complete source code is now available.</p>

  <p>Tom Christiansen has posted bunches of updates to his <b>Perl
  Power Tools</b> (a.k.a. The Unix Reconstruction Project) at
  <a href="http://doriath.perl.com/ppt/" target=
  "resource window">http://doriath.perl.com/ppt/</a>. The PPT
  project aims to rewrite all standard Unix tools in Perl.</p>

  <p>John Tobey released the first Hurd translator written entirely
  in Perl, called <b>pith</b> (Perl Interface to The Hurd). pith
  (<a href="http://john-edwin-tobey.org/Hurd/" target=
  "resource window">http://john-edwin-tobey.org/Hurd/</a>)
  currently allows for only trivial translators, but plans are to
  make it a full-featured set of bindings for the Hurd
  libraries.</p>

  <p><b>pesh</b> (<a href=
  "ftp://ftp.enlightenment.org/pub/enlightenment/pesh/" target=
  "resource window">ftp://ftp.enlightenment.org/pub/enlightenment/pesh/</a>)
  is a Perl interface to Englightenment IPC. <b>Enlightenment</b>

  environment similar to Zope, Mason, and Midgard).</p>

  <p>As usual, a lot is happening in the Apache namespace. Ask
  Bj&Oslash;rn Hansen wrote <b>Apache::DumpHeaders</b> for watching
  HTTP transactions, looking at client and server headers. Clinton
  Wong wrote <b>Apache::ReverseProxy</b>, which translates an
  incoming URI to another URI, and Ken Hagan authored
