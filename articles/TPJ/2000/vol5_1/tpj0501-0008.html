  <p>Writing for complete beginners is very hard. It requires
  complete comprehension of the topic, and without thorough
  planning can confuse rather than edify the intended audience.</p>

  <p>Andrew Johnson's <i>Elements of Programming with Perl</i> is
  the best Perl book for neophytes that I've found. The author
  understands Perl well, and writes transparent prose for an
  audience unclear on what a program is or how it might be written.
  Several schools will be adopting this as the textbook for an
  Introductory Perl class, and it's not hard to see why.</p>

  <p>The book spends a lot of time on the raw fundamentals of
  programming, the concepts and approaches that we old hands take
  for granted but are significant barriers for newcomers. Johnson's
  first chapter on the syntax of Perl discusses <tt>if</tt> blocks,
  variable naming, comments, and <tt>use strict</tt> in the context
  of a single program. His insistence that all beginners' programs
  be written with <tt>-w</tt> and <tt>use strict</tt> is
  admirable.</p>

  <p>The next chapter talks about actually writing programs. As the
  reader watches a simple program move from idle fantasy to
  executing code, Johnson presents the software lifecycle in an
  easy-to-understand fashion. From there on, each chapter
  introduces more new language features and then exercises
  them.</p>

  <p>It's easy to sing Johnson's praises. Here's a list of the
  shortcomings I found in the book: the sample program used in
  Chapter 2 has a dummy function which is unnecessary (Mark-Jason
  Dominus is fond of quoting Chekhov: If a cannon is hauled onto
  stage in Act 1, it had better be fired in Act 3. Johnson hauls
  out functions but doesn't give a meaningful example); the
  discussion of the software life cycle seems premature; and
  sometimes things are presented slightly out of order (for
  instance, he shows <tt>my</tt> used to declare and initialize
  multiple variables before he talks about lists. The explanation
  of lists is only three pages away, but it's still potentially
  confusing).</p>

  <p>Johnson walks the reader through many of the developed
  programs using a form of literate programming. He writes an
  outline, then refines the outline into a program showing how each
  element of the outline is expanded into code or a more detailed
  outline. This demonstrates the process of stepwise refinement,
  and brings into the open something that would normally go on
  inside a programmer's mind. However, at times I felt the
  fundamentally simple nature of a problem was being lost behind a
  series of cascading intermediate steps.</p>

  <p>To decide whether a novice really could learn from this, I
  asked a friend (Alvin Smith) who is computer-literate but not a
  Perl programmer whether he could learn Perl from it.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Johnson is utterly clear in his expositions. I picked
    this book up to give it a skim: instead, I was captured, page
    by following page, by Johnson's enthusiasm for his
    topic.</i></p>

    <p><i>This book has something of the same scope as the
    multitude of "Introduction to Pascal" books that now litter the
    remainder bins, but in Johnson's book there is an energetic
    lucidity that will make any reviewer envious, and a direct
    honesty and fraternal directness that will delight students in
    any introductory course and make the individual reader leap to
    a keyboard with enthusiasm.</i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Make no bones about it, this book is good. Damn good. It will
  prepare a novice for a job as a journeyman programmer. How's this
  for praise: I'd hire a graduate of <i>Elements of Programming
  with Perl</i> whereas I'd actively avoid graduates of several
  other introductory Perl books. Well done, Andrew Johnson.</p>

  <br>

  <p>If you haven't yet read Johnson's <i>Elements of Programming
  with Perl</i>, read it now; if you have, read it again. This book
  speaks to Perl programmers and Perl would-be programmers at all
  levels of experience and expertise. The cover of the book
  suggests that the book is "a complete introduction to programming
  using Perl, written so it's accessible to those learning Perl as
  their first programming language."</p>

  <p>I agree that Johnson has written a complete introduction to
  programming using Perl. Is it the long awaited ideal book for
  those learning Perl as a first language? For some, it meets that
  need admirably, but perhaps not for all. <i>Elements</i> is an
  extremely ambitious (and very successful) book that not only
  introduces programming and its concepts using Perl but that
  introduces an orderly software design philosophy. Within that
  framework, literate programming is both an organizing tool for
  the book and a source for examples in writing programs. The book
  accomplishes all of this in a little over 330 pages of main text
  (which is brief for Perl programming books).</p>

  <p>Johnson's approach to programming is admirable. He uses an
  incremental development philosophy that focuses on design from
  the very beginning. The attitude that a quick one-liner, or
  perhaps a ten-liner, or maybe a hundred- or thousand-liner
  emerges naturally as your fingers flow across the keyboard is the
  antithesis of Johnson's approach. He advocates thinking about
  what you are trying to do first and then writing the code. It is
  this approach that makes the book worth reading and reading
  again. Even the cautious programmer benefits from the reminder
  that programming can be as much a science as an art. Johnson
  asserts that "Programming is about solving problems" rather than
  about telling a computer what to do.</p>

  <p>Yet the book's strength in its systematic process and design
  is also a slight liability. As an introduction to programming in
  Perl as a first language, <i>Elements</i> gets off to a slow
  start. The first "complete" program is in Chapter 3, although
  "Hello, world" is shown in Chapter 1 and code snippets are
  scattered throughout the first two chapters. The impatient
  beginner who wants to get on with it may be very frustrated. This
  type of beginner would benefit from swallowing their impatience
  and working their way through those first few chapters. Once the
  beginning is well-launched, <i>Elements</i> moves quickly enough
  (though still very systematically) to satisfy even the
  impatient.</p>

  <p>Special Perl variables (<tt>$_</tt>, <tt>$.</tt>, and so on)
  are covered clearly in an unintimidating way in two or three
  pages as part of a series of short examples. This section should
  be an inspiration for other authors who would like to explain a
  potentially confusing subject to novices.</p>

  <p><i>Elements</i> covers the standard topics for an introductory
  text: files, text processing, regular expressions, lists, hashes,
  data structures, references - some of which are covered by other
  authors only in advanced sections. With the exception of the
  section on closures (and generators) - normally an advanced topic
  requiring careful reading - the material reads well either as an
  introduction or as a refresher course for a more experienced
  programmer.</p>

  <p>Johnson also covers what he calls advanced topics: modules,
  algorithms, additional information on data structures, and object
  oriented programming. The fact is that Johnson's clarity masks
  the advanced nature of these topics. My only major criticism in
  this area is that he didn't do another 300 pages on these topics,
  but given the total length of the book, the coverage is
  necessarily abbreviated.</p>

  <p>Most Perl books dispense with discussion of Perl documentation
  in a sentence or two of mothering statements. This book goes far
  beyond; Johnson discusses the Perl documentation and FAQ's in
  Chapter 1, then in Chapter 3 moves on to a program called
  <tt>faqgrep</tt> which uses Perl's text processing capability to
  search for and find relevant topics in the FAQ's. In Chapter 13,
  he extends the program to allow more sophisticated searches.</p>

  <p>Literate programming is a style of mixing program source code,
  comments, and documentation in a single document so that it is
  oriented primarily toward readability. The program itself is
  extracted from the parent document by a program called a
  <i>tangler</i>. The whole approach of literate programming is
  championed by no less of an authority than Don Knuth. Andrew
  Johnson, though he does not belittle POD, is nevertheless a
  literate programming evangelist. He introduces the topic in
  Chapter 3 as a part of the development of the first program, and
  uses a simple form of literate programming throughout much of the
  book. In Chapter 9, he provides a somewhat more detailed
  discussion and gives an extended example of using literate
  programming as well as using Perl to develop a simple tangler
  program. This approach risked spending too much time on a
  peripheral subject, but the risk paid off handsomely. The
  literate programming material (whether you choose to use it in
  the future or not) is an excellent example and fits well with
  Johnson's design and programming philosophy. (As for me, I
  subscribe to Johnson's design philosophy. For literate
  programming, he didn't quite convert me, but I'm thinking about
  it.)</p>

  <p>Selected source code, errata, and related material is
  available online at <a href="http://www.manning.com/Johnson"

  Typographical and minor errors dominate the errata list; the
  technical errors are carefully segregated and presented at the
  beginning of the list. In an ideal world, there would be no need
  for an errata list. Manning's posting of this online material
  list demonstrates an understanding of real world needs.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of this review, I said you should read
  Johnson's book. This advice holds for the experienced programmer
  who needs an injection of sanity in a too-hectic world, as well
  as for all beginners. I must admit, however, that Johnson
  indicates that the book is less for those who already know how to
  program than for the true beginning programmer. For the novice
  who wants to learn Perl as a first language, the book should be
  an excellent choice, but I fear that many will be too impatient
  to read those first three or four chapters until they get to the
  programming. If they do, they will be well rewarded; what looks
  like a slow start is instead a solid grounding in technique and
  approach.</p>

  <p>In <i>Elements of Programming with Perl</i>, Andrew Johnson
  recommends an article by Larry Wall on the natural language
  principles he applied to Perl. It's a fine article, and I wish
  Johnson himself had applied more of it in his book.</p>

  <p>Wall says that Perl was designed to allow "baby talk", so that
  it isn't necessary to learn the whole language before starting to
  use it. This should lead to a teaching approach where the student
  starts right out to learn a few simple phrases, without worrying
  unduly about a larger context or theoretical framework or even
  the full range of available choices. O'Reilly's <i>Learning
  Perl</i> very much takes this approach, leading the reader
  immediately into "Hello, world" and building up to a simple
  interactive program within a few pages.</p>

  <p><i>Elements</i> takes a very different approach, in which the
  reader does not start coding until chapter 4, after learning the
  evolution of computer languages, the location of Perl in the
  design space of such languages (both compiled and interpreted,
  weakly typed, and optionally object oriented), the process of
  software development, the concept and notation of Literate
  Programming (LP), and the appropriate placement of statements and
  blocks on the page - and all this for readers who are presumed to
  be non-programmers.</p>

  <p>This is like asking fourth graders to master Strunk and
  White's <i>Elements of Style</i> and Chomsky's <i>Aspects of the
  Theory of Syntax</i> before writing their first essay. It's
  difficult for me to picture someone learning programming this
  way.</p>

  <p>Which is not to say the book is without value: on the
  contrary, although it falls well short of its goal, it is in many
  ways an excellent book with valid uses.</p>

  <p>In particular, I think this would be a fine first book on Perl
  for students with some programming background. Several chapters
  are outstanding, such as chapters 4 through 8, which introduce
  many of the basics of Perl. Johnson has a gift for notations and
  diagrams, and his depictions of variables, references, and scope
  are unusually clear and enlightening.</p>

  <p>Chapter 9 unfortunately presents an elaborate program to
  "tangle" a literate program into an executable one. The
  presentation itself is plenty tangled, and does little to
  persuade me of the teaching value of LP.</p>

  <p>Subsequent chapters are back on track. Again, Johnson finds an
  excellent notation, this time to explain regular expressions. And
  I am particularly grateful for the sections on modules and
  debugging, topics often overlooked in books for beginners.</p>

  <p>As a text for an introductory Perl class, re-ordered (start
  with chapter 4) and supplemented with some Perl "baby talk"
  exercises, I think this book would be first-rate.</p>

  <p>As an introduction to programming, I don't think it succeeds.
  It needs to be more natural. Perl is fun, and fun is a wonderful
  learning tool. This book has little of the spirit of fun that
  pervades Randal Schwartz's <i>Learning Perl</i> and Larry Wall's
  writings, as well as Perl itself. That's it's loss, and ours.</p>
