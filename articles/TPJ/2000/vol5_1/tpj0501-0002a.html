              <p><font color="#000000">For the sake of clarity, I
              oversimplified some of the facts about objects. Here
              are a few of the gorier details:</font></p>

              <p>&#8226;&nbsp; Every example I gave of a
              constructor was a class method. But object methods
              can be constructors, too, if the class was written to
              work that way: <tt>$new = $old-&gt;copy, $node_y =
              $node_x-&gt;new_subnode</tt>, or the like.</p>

              <p>&#8226;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve given the impression that
              there&#8217;s two kinds of methods: object methods
              and class methods. In fact, the same method can be
              both, because the distinction has to do only with how
              it parses parameters.</p>

              <p>&#8226;&nbsp; The term "object value" isn&#8217;t
              something you&#8217;ll find used much anywhere else.
              It&#8217;s just my shorthand for what would properly
              be called an "object reference" or "reference to a
              blessed item". In fact, people usually say "object"
              when they properly mean a reference to that
              object.</p>

              <p>&#8226;&nbsp; I mentioned creating objects with
              <i>con</i>structors, but I didn&#8217;t mention
              destroying them with <i>de</i>structors &#8212; a
              destructor is a kind of method that you call to tidy
              up the object once you&#8217;re done with it, and
              want it to neatly go away (close connections, delete
              temporary files, free up memory, and so on). But
              because of the way Perl handles memory, most modules
              don&#8217;t require destructors.</p>

              <p>&#8226;&nbsp; I said that class method syntax has
              to have the class name, as in <tt>$session =
              <b>Net::FTP</b>-&gt;new($host)</tt>. Actually, you
              can instead use any expression that returns a class
              name: <tt>$ftp_class = 'Net::FTP'; $session =
              <b>$ftp_class</b>-&gt;new($host)</tt>. Moreover,
              instead of the method name for object- or
              class-method calls, you can use a scalar holding the
              method name: <tt>$foo-&gt;<b>$method</b>($host)</tt>.
              In practice, these formulations are rarely
              useful.</p>

              <p>Finally, to learn about objects from the
              perspective of writing your own classes, see the
              <tt>perltoot</tt> documentation, or Damian
              Conway&#8217;s exhaustive and clear book <i>Object
              Oriented Perl</i> (Manning Publications 1999, ISBN
              1-884777-79-1).</p><!--  end code listing  -->
