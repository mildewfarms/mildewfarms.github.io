  <p>The scene: A dusty afternoon in a rickety one horse town. The
  sign over the "Last Chance" saloon leans drunkenly forward and
  tumbleweed skips lazily across your path. You&rsquo;ve fought
  your way through seven ambushing web projects and just barely
  escaped to tell about them. To your left, a shifty-eyed city
  slicker named ASP hawks his miracle invention to eliminate
  work-a-day web drudgery. To your right, a young, ruddy faced
  preacher thumps his ham fist righteously on his leather bound
  Cold Fusion manual. All around you, the young and blind pound the
  dry earth, desperately trying to hold together their
  company&rsquo;s legacy home page with NotePad and Frontpage. And
  staring down at you from the end of the street, is the meanest,
  neediest, most market-driven web site east of the Mississippi
  that threatens to eat your lunch.</p>

  <p>Yep, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. You&rsquo;re in web
  country.</p>

  <p><b>What Is Mason?</b></p>

  <p>When the person responsible for designing an appealing web
  site is different from the person who writes the code to make it
  happen, traditional hard-wired CGI scripts just get in the way.
  As a web programmer, you probably don&rsquo;t have much trouble
  adding <tt>print</tt> statements to spew HTML. But every time the
  designer wants to alter the site, a traditional CGI script
  requires the programmer to implement those changes, no matter how
  small. Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather give control of the HTML to the
  designer so that you&rsquo;re not in the critical path? Mason
  solves this problem.</p>

  <p>Mason (<a href="http://www.masonhq.com" target=
  "resource window">http://www.masonhq.com</a>) is an Open Source
  project authored by Jonathan Swartz which, together with mod_perl
  and Apache, offers web developers a tool to slay the maintenance
  dragon. In the words of the FAQ, Mason is "a Perl-based web site
  development and delivery engine." HTML::Mason is a freely
  available Perl module that makes Mason available to your Perl
  programs.</p>

  <p>SSI Redux. Mason accomplishes its magic with a venerable
  trick. It allows Perl code to be embedded in an otherwise
  ordinary HTML file. In fact, these bits of embedded Perl can be
  collected into files called <i>components</i> which in turn can
  be called from other Mason-rendered HMTL files. Components are to
  Mason what subroutines are to Perl.</p>

  <p>Yes, Server Side Include (SSI) technology is alive and well.
  In fact, Mason has some very successful closed source brethren.
  Microsoft&rsquo;s Active Server Pages and Allaire&rsquo;s Cold
  Fusion also use a special SSI language. Let&rsquo;s not forget
  about Open Source competitors like Python&rsquo;s Zope, Java
  Server Pages, or PHP! SSI is here to stay.</p>

  <p>Form versus Function. To tame the wild beast of creating and
  maintaining a living web site, traditional HTML-spewing CGI
  programs are not enough. Even with a flexible language like Perl,
  changing the look and feel of a traditional CGI script often
  requires an experienced coder. "Vital" changes thought up by
  marketing folks and their graphic designers can often amount to
  several hours of patching and testing new CGI code. Even simple
  changes like moving a button or adding text can take time when a
  web site&rsquo;s presentation is tied to its functionality. This
  is the issue that transcends the choice of implementation
  language and speaks to the core of dynamic web site design.</p>

  <p>Any SSI technology will greatly reduce the friction between
  coders and graphics people. Because site functionality (a
  navigation widget, for example) can be encapsulated into a
  component which is then called from an otherwise static web page.
  The graphic designer can simply treat this code, which looks like
  a funny HTML tag, as a black box and move this widget to wherever
  his fickle heart desires. The good news is that, after
  implementing the navigation widget, the coder is no longer
  required.</p>

  <p>For those that want the benefits of code reusability and data
  hiding, HTML::Mason components can be used in an object-oriented
  fashion.</p>

  <p><b>Installation</b></p>

  <p>Mason works best with Apache and mod_perl. For the record, the
  system I used was a Celeron 400 running Red Hat 6.0 with 128M of
  RAM, Apache 1.3.9 compiled from source, mod_perl 1.21, and
  HTML::Mason 0.8. If you don&rsquo;t already have mod_perl or
  Mason, try your local CPAN mirror at <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-modules/HTML" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-modules/HTML</a>.
  Better yet, use the CPAN module. From your shell, and with
  administrator privileges if necessary, type:</p>
  <pre>
perl -MCPAN -e "install mod_perl; install HTML::Mason"
</pre>

  <p>Have I mentioned how much I love the CPAN.pm module? A
  lot.</p>

  <p>Mason comes with a very complete installation guide in the
  file <tt>Mason.html</tt>. For those familiar with Apache, the
  <tt>httpd.conf</tt> changes are trivial, although I&rsquo;m not
  sure I&rsquo;d commit my entire web directory to Mason as this
  installation guide suggests. I made a directory off the root of
  my <tt>htdocs</tt> called <tt>mason</tt>.</p>

  <p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to create a <tt>handler.pl</tt> file
  in your new mason root directory. This is where you&rsquo;ll
  <tt>use</tt> modules common to all your components, avoiding the
  overhead of including the same module in multiple components.
  You&rsquo;ll find a very serviceable <tt>handler.pl</tt> file in
  the <tt>eg</tt> subdirectory in the unpacked Mason directory. I
  recommend uncommenting this line in the <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-modules/HTML" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-modules/HTML</a>
  subroutine:</p>
  <pre>
#return -1 if $r-&gt;content_type &amp;&amp; 
                $r-&gt;content_type !~ m|^text/|io;
</pre>

  <p>This prevents Mason from trying to parse non-text files served
  from your <tt>mason</tt> directory. I suppose an entry for next
  year&rsquo;s Obfuscated Perl Contest might include a carefully
  engineered GIF meant to be parsed by Mason to produce "The Perl
  Journal", but it won&rsquo;t be submitted by me.</p>

  <p>Another source of confusion about configuring
  <tt>handler.pl</tt> has to do with the initialization of
  Mason&rsquo;s <tt>Interp</tt> (Interpreter) object, which
  requires a few user-dependent paths. Although most new users
  won&rsquo;t need to directly manipulate it, the Interpreter
  object is responsible for executing the components and directing
  the resulting output. The first path is the <tt>comp_root</tt>,
  which points to the directory where Mason will begin to search
  for components. Because I wasn&rsquo;t overly security conscious,
  I chose the <tt>mason</tt> directory. The data directory, which
  also needs to be specified, is a kind of scratch directory where
  debug files and previews are stored. Again, being a simple
  caveboy, I chose <tt>mason/data</tt>. For a production system,
  you&rsquo;ll want to choose these directories a bit more
  carefully.</p>

  <p>Mason 0.8 has some new syntax than earlier versions. While I
  believe the development is heading in the right direction, there
  are some issues worth noting. For instance, Mason 0.8 won&rsquo;t
  send HTTP headers for a page with no text. This makes redirection
  and cookie issuing less than ideal since one would need to write
  a dummy page just to serve the HTTP headers. There is a
  workaround on the Mason mailing list, but I&rsquo;d recommend
  staying with the last 0.7x version or downloading 0.81.</p>

  <p><b>Building A Dynamic Site</b></p>

  <p>The site I designed demonstrates some common tasks that most
  web designers face. Please note: I&rsquo;m no layout expert; one
  of the compelling reasons to use Mason is to bridge the gap
  between coders and designers, and I&rsquo;m a coder. The common
  task I tackled was to have a web page display information stored
  in a database. The designer wants the coder to provide a method
  for accessing this data, and this is where a Mason component
  comes in handy. I will be querying my web site Aliens, Aliens,
  Aliens (A3). It&rsquo;s about aliens. It is a MySQL-driven web
  site with a mod_perl front end.</p>

  <p><b>Headers and Footers.</b> The best place to begin a
  discussion of components is with the Mason equivalent of "Hello,
  World". Many sites have standard headers and footers that provide
  a common look and feel to pages on the site. Here&rsquo;s my
  header:</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;html&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;&lt;%$title%&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;body bgcolor="&lt;%$color%&gt;"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;%$title%&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  
  &lt;%args&gt;
  $title =&gt; 'Nonsuch'
  $color =&gt; 'FFFFFF' # white
  &lt;/%args&gt;
</pre>

  <p>From Mason&rsquo;s perspective, this is a component, because
  it&rsquo;s a mixture of HTML and specially delimited Perl code.
  For the most part, it looks like boring HTML.</p>

  <p>There are two different Mason tags to notice here. The first
  is the ubiquitous <tt>&lt;% %&gt;</tt> tag. Any arbitrary Perl
  code found inside will be evaluated and the resulting value
  displayed in the render page. <tt>&lt;% 2 + 2 %&gt;</tt> will
  display in a browser as 4.</p>

  <p>Mason also has a small set of special tags used for more
  complex or special purpose blocks of code. Here, the
  <tt>&lt;%args&gt; &lt;/%args&gt;</tt> section is used to
  "prototype" the two expected arguments for this component: title
  and color. In this case, two scalars may be passed to the header
  component; if they aren&rsquo;t, "Nonsuch" and white will be used
  as defaults. You may declare arguments without defaults, which
  forces the caller to pass parameters. These parameters are
  lexically scoped, which means these variables cease to exist
  outside of the component. For those that have wanted stronger
  subroutine prototyping in Perl, this may appeal to you.</p>

  <p>The footer component is even simpler, since it takes no
  arguments at all:</p>
  <pre>
    &lt;hr&gt;
    &lt;div align=center&gt;
    &lt;address&gt;
    &amp;copy; &lt;% 1900+(localtime)[5] %&gt; Joe Johnston&lt;BR&gt;
    Use this code to your maximium advantage, but 
    due credit is always appreciated.   
    &lt;address&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

  <p><b>Passing Parameters.</b> Mason provides many flexible ways
  to pass arguments to components. One way is to simply attach
  URL-encoded arguments (spaces become <tt>%20</tt>, for example)
  to the URL of the component, just like in a GET query. Another is
  to call the component directly from another component, as seen in
  the first line of my index page:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;&amp; header, title=&gt;'Welcome to the World of Mason',
          color=&gt;'tan' &amp;&gt;
    
&lt;P&gt;Gawk in amazement as I build an interactive, 
          database driven site before your eyes!
    
&lt;P&gt;Here's a link to a nonexistent 
&lt;a href="microsoft"&gt;subdirectory&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;Pssst! Want to look at some headlines from other sites?
&lt;UL&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;&lt;a href="news/slashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;&lt;a href="news/perl_news"&gt;Perl News&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;&lt;a href="news/a3"&gt;Aliens, Aliens, Aliens&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;&lt;a href="news/missing_uri"&gt;Microsoft News&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;&lt;FORM Method=post Action="news/dhandler"&gt;
  URL to your favorite RDF: &lt;input type=text name=RDF&gt;
&lt;input type=submit&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;&amp; departments &amp;&gt;
&lt;&amp; footer &amp;&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Mason&rsquo;s <tt>&lt;&amp; &amp;&gt;</tt> is similar to
  Perl&rsquo;s ampersand operator in that it calls a component much
  like a subroutine. The return value is discarded; the side
  effects are what&rsquo;s important. Let&rsquo;s look at the first
  line of this component more closely:</p>
  <pre>
   &lt;&amp; header, title =&gt; 'Welcome to the World of Mason', 
             color =&gt; 'tan' &amp;&gt;
</pre>

  <p><font face="verdana" size="-2"><b>Figure 1:</b> A web page
  generated by Mason.</font><br>
  <img src="images/tpj0501-0008-01.gif"></p>

  <p>This inserts the rendered version of the header, modified with
  the appropriate parameters, onto the web page. The rendered
  version of this page appears in Figure 1. Yet another way to pass
  arguments is to use default handlers and extra path
  information.</p>

  <p>Default Handlers and XML. When a component is called that
  Mason can&rsquo;t find, it looks in that directory for a file
  called dhandler. For example, I have the <tt>dhandler</tt> shown
  below in the mason directory:</p>
  <pre>
    &lt;&amp; header &amp;&gt;
    
    &lt;b&gt;Oops! I'm not certain where you were going!&lt;/b&gt;
    

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;&amp; footer &amp;&gt;
</pre>

  <p><font face="verdana" size="-2"><b>Figure 2:</b> A customized
  "File Not Found" page.</font><br>
  <img src="images/tpj0501-0008-02.gif"></p>

  <p>This is just a custom 404 Not Found document. The generated
  page is shown in Figure 2.</p>

  <p>In the <tt>news</tt> subdirectory, I have another dhandler
  meant to be called with extra path information:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;%init&gt;
my $news_site = $m-&gt;dhandler_arg;
    
my $rss = new XML::RSS;
my $rdf;
    
for ( $news_site ) { # This is like a 'switch' statement
      /slashdot/ &amp;&amp; do { 
         $rdf = get('http://slashdot.org/slashdot.rdf');    
         last;
      };
      /perl_news/ &amp;&amp; do { 
   $rdf = get('http://www.news.perl.org/perl-news.rdf');    
         last;
      };
      /a3/ &amp;&amp; do { 
   $rdf = get('http://aliensaliensaliens.com/a3.rdf');    
         last;
      };
    }  
    
    $rdf ||= get($ARGS{RDF}); # was I passed in something?
    
    unless ( $rdf ) {
      # a little tricky, use the existing mechanism
      # for this 404, use old standby CGI env hack
    
      use CGI qw/:all/;
      print redirect("http://$ENV{SERVER_NAME}/mason/tpj/404");
      return;
    }
    
    $rss-&gt;parse($rdf);
    &lt;/%init&gt;
    
    &lt;&amp; ../header, title=&gt; ($news_site||$rss-&gt;{'channel'}
                -&gt;{'title'}) &amp;&gt;
    
    

    &lt;p&gt;See the rest of &lt;a href="&lt;% $rss-&gt;{'channel'}
                -&gt;{'link'} %&gt;"&gt;
    &lt;% $rss-&gt;{'channel'}-&gt;{'title'} %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    
    &lt;UL&gt;
    
    % for my $bit ( @{ $rss-&gt;{'items'}} ){ # not very OO ;-)
    
      &lt;LI&gt;&lt;a href="&lt;% $bit-&gt;{'link'} %&gt;
                "&gt;&lt;% $bit-&gt;{'title'} %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    
    %   if( $bit-&gt;{'description'} ) {
      : &lt;% $bit-&gt;{'description'} %&gt;
    %   }
    
    % }
    
    &lt;/UL&gt;
    &lt;a href="/mason/tpj/"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;&amp; ../footer &amp;&gt;
</pre>

  <p>In this case the dhandler will try to retrieve an RSS (Rich
  Site Summary) file, an XML description that many news sites
  (including Perl News) use to broadcast their headlines. Looking
  back at the <tt>index.html</tt> component shown earlier, you can
  see that the <tt>dhandler</tt> parameter resembles a file in the
  news subdirectory. Selecting the A3 link produces the page seen
  in Figure 3. This is the kind of magic that makes some coders
  soil themselves.</p>

  <p>Something else is going on in this news/dhandler component.
  Because we want users to be able to enter an arbitrary URL to an
  RDF (Resource Description Framework) file, this component also
  accepts the more traditional parameter passing method in a
  variable called <tt>%ARGS</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Accessing MySQL.</b> If you&rsquo;re familiar with DBI,
  database access is performed no differently in Mason. In fact,
  you can use Apache::DBI to transparently give you persistent
  database handles. Aliens, Aliens, Aliens is divided up into
  several departments, which themselves contain other departments.
  The departments component generates a nice table with links to
  all the top level departments:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;%init&gt;
    my $dbh = DBI-&gt;
                connect("DBI:mysql:aliens:nfs.daisypark.org", 
                   "username", "password") or
        die "ERROR: Couldn't connect to DB $DBI::errstr";
    
# find all the top level departments
# All top level departments have 'home' as a parent
    
my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&lt;&lt;EOT) 
or die "ERROR: prepare failed ".$dbh-&gt;errstr;
select homepage_id,segment from departments 
where parent_id=1 order by segment

EOT

$sth-&gt;execute or die "ERROR: couldn't get departments! " . 
$dbh-&gt;errstr;
&lt;/%init&gt;
    
&lt;TABLE Border=1&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
% while ( my $hr = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_hashref ) {
    
&lt;TH&gt;&lt;A HREF=
    "http://nfs.daisypark.org/cgi-bin/render_article.pl?
article_id=&lt;%$hr-&gt;{homepage_id}%&gt;"&gt;
&lt;% $hr-&gt;{segment} %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/TH&gt;
    
% }
    
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;
    
&lt;%cleanup&gt;
# $dbh-&gt;disconnect;
&lt;/%cleanup&gt;
</pre>

  <p>I&rsquo;ll skip the discussion of DBI and SQL and draw your
  attention to the embedded <tt>fetchrow</tt> loop which retrieves
  all the pertinent links and labels. Notice how even though the
  <tt>while</tt> statement is preceded by the <tt>%</tt> symbol
  (meaning that the rest of the line is Perl code), the plain HTML
  is repeated as needed. Compare this to a more traditional Perl
  CGI program in which the loop has a <tt>print</tt> statement
  outputting HTML. Although this may seem like two sides of the
  same coin, the difference with Mason is that your layout expert
  can now tweak the non-code bits without bothering you. This
  generally leads to more beer time, which is the second thing any
  good job should give you.</p>

  <p>Finally, you&rsquo;ll notice the <tt>&lt;%cleanup&gt;</tt>
  section. This is Perl code to be executed when the component has
  finished. Here, I would normally kill my database handle, close
  filehandles, or free objects. However, since Apache::DBI lets me
  keep database handles open from visit to visit, I have commented
  this out.</p>

  <p><b>What Now?</b></p>

  <p>I have provided only a brief introduction to this great tool.
  Other topics that await you in Mason-land are the fabulous
  Component Manager (written by Mark Schmick), lots of
  documentation, component debugging files, and component staging.
  Do yourself a favor and check Mason out.</p>
