  <p>When I first started writing programs in Perl, I was glad to
  finally work with a scripting language with real data structures.
  I had recently written some large Korn shell scripts (upwards of
  seventy pages when printed) that would have been much more easily
  implemented in Perl. Ever since then, I've always wished I could
  work in a shell environment that used Perl syntax so I didn't
  have to remember both shell constructs and Perl constructs. In
  addition, I wanted to be able to execute experimental Perl
  fragments directly rather than having to invoke the interpreter
  manually.</p>

  <p>For a long time, I just kept these thoughts to myself, and
  didn't spend any time trying to solve the problem. But one day
  last July I was having lunch with some of my coworkers, the
  conversation turned to Perl. I was comparing and contrasting Perl
  and the Korn shell when one of the group asserted that it would
  be great to have a shell that had all the nice features of Perl.
  I couldn't stand to sit on the idea anymore, so that night in my
  hotel room I banged out what soon became known as version 0.001
  of the Perl Shell.</p>

  <p>This first version was extremely simple. The synopsis of the
  documentation read:</p>

  <blockquote>
    A fairly simple read-eval loop. The <tt>-w</tt> flag and
    <tt>use strict</tt> are not employed so that the user is not
    bound by their stipulations. Setting <tt>$^W = 1</tt> will turn
    on warnings, and calling <tt>use strict</tt> will do the usual
    thing if called by the user.
  </blockquote>

  <p>This early version simply immediately evaluated each line of
  input. However, it did have a couple of interesting additional
  features. First, it supported multiline input through Perl's
  'here-document' syntax, so you could type larger Perl fragments
  at it:</p>
  <pre>
  psh$ <b>&lt;&lt;FOO
  print "Hello";
  print ", world!\n";
  FOO</b>
</pre>

  <p>Also, an input line beginning with an exclamation point would
  be handed off to <tt>system()</tt>, providing very basic
  shell-like functionality. This first version even supported
  "dotting in" a file, and a <tt>.pshrc</tt> file, analogous to
  typical shell behavior.</p>

  <p>All of this was pretty basic, but the one feature of the first
  version that I thought showed the potential of a Perl shell was
  the ability to set the prompt string. Version 0.001 allowed you
  to set the prompt string to either a constant string value or to
  a subroutine reference. If you did the latter, the subroutine
  would be called each time a prompt was needed, allowing you to do
  whatever processing you wanted to generate a string to display. I
  provided this very simple example:</p>
  <pre>
$psh::prompt = sub { $i++; "psh [$i]\$ "; }
</pre>

  <p>which made the prompt "<tt>psh [1]$</tt> ", followed by
  "<tt>psh [2]$</tt> ", and so on.</p>

  <p>The reason I was so excited about this simple capability was
  that it was an example of going a step beyond basic expected
  shell behavior by providing extensibility in a way that is
  natural to Perl programmers. I had seen the prompt variables of
  <i>bash</i> and other shells, but hadn't used a code hook like
  this in any other shell.</p>

  <p>The next few versions saw contributions by other people, and
  the addition of ReadLine support and prompt string variables (a
  la <i>bash</i>).</p>

  <p>By November 1999, Version 0.002 Patch 5 was released, which
  added support for built-in commands (initially just <tt>cd</tt>,
  <tt>exit</tt>, and <tt>which</tt>), custom prompt variables
  (another fun extensibility feature), and history handling.</p>

  <p>It was after this release that things really began to heat up.
  I had been managing the <tt>psh-dev</tt> and
  <tt>psh-announce</tt> mailing lists in ultra low-tech mode with
  my PC and basic mail client because I didn't have control over a
  server for managing mailing lists. By late November it was
  becoming clear that I had to do something. I had heard about
  SourceForge, and one of the list subscribers suggested I check it
  out when I put out a request for comments on moving to a mailing
  list service. In early December, the Perl Shell lists were
  converted over to SourceForge, and I imported all the code into
  CVS there as well.</p>

  <p>December 1999 was a big month for the Perl Shell, with
  contributions for background jobs, signal handling, filename
  completion, pipelines, more builtins, internationalization,
  configurable evaluation strategies, a major modularization of the
  code (which had been monolithic up until this point), and a badly
  needed documentation update. These and many later changes were
  due largely to the efforts of what is now the Perl Shell Core
  Team, which consists of Markus Peter (the most prodigious
  contributor of them all), Simon Huggins, Omer Shenker, and Glen
  Whitney. Late in the month (version 0.005) saw the addition of a
  Win32 port, filename and custom completions, globbing, and more
  built-in commands.</p>

  <p>January of 2000 saw the release of version 0.006, which
  contained recursive globbing and the manifest filters described
  below. With February came version 0.007, which included some
  enhancements to builtins and evaluation strategies.</p>

  <h3>Evaluation Strategies</h3>

  <p>The Perl Shell aims to be a highly extensible shell, and has
  numerous hooks allowing the user to customize or extend its
  behavior. Even the methods used to process input are customizable
  via the evaluation strategies mechanism. The Perl Shell comes
  configured with a basic set of prioritized strategies for
  evaluating the user's input. Each time the shell processes a
  command, it presents the text of the command to the strategies in
  order until one of them claims it. Then, the strategy consumes
  the input, usually taking some action on the user's behalf.</p>

  <p>For instance, there is one strategy for detecting comment
  lines, one that handles lines beginning with "!", one that sends
  code starting with an open curly brace to Perl's <tt>eval()</tt>
  function, one that handles all the built-in commands (the list of
  which is extensible), one that handles Perl function calls with
  shell-like syntax of arguments, one that handles general
  executables, one that can provide fallback implementations of
  programs that are not present on some platforms but easily
  emulated, and finally a catch-all strategy that just sends the
  input to Perl's <tt>eval()</tt>.</p>

  <p>These strategies, when combined in this order, make for a very
  usable environment. There are some additional strategies that can
  be added to the list if desired (they are not enabled by
  default). The <tt>perlscript</tt> strategy (no relation to
  PerlScript, which embeds Perl commands in web pages) detects
  executables that are Perl scripts using the same interpreter as
  the Perl Shell itself, and simply <tt>fork()</tt>s and runs the
  new script rather than going through <tt>system()</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Globbing</h3>

  <p>The Perl Shell's globbing works mostly as would be expected,
  although it has the advanced recursive globbing feature not found
  on all shells. The example from the manpage illustrates this
  well:</p>
  <pre>
<b>grep foo lib/**/*.pm</b>
</pre>

  <p>will search for "<tt>foo</tt>" in all <tt>*.pm</tt> files
  which are somewhere (recursively) within the <tt>lib</tt>
  directory.</p>

  <h3>Manifest Filters</h3>

  <p><i>Manifest filters</i> are chunks of code that create filter
  processes. They are handy for creating simple one-time filters
  because they don't require creating a program file, setting
  permissions, and so on. There are three kinds: quick filters,
  grep filters, and substitution filters.</p>

  <p>A <i>quick filter</i> consists of a block of code surrounded
  by curly braces, with a trailing '<tt>q</tt>' modifier. The Perl
  Shell turns this into a line-by-line filter. For the code in the
  braces, <tt>$_</tt> will contain the line as it was read from
  standard input (including any end-of-line character). The filter
  block should print any lines it wants to appear on standard
  output. Here's an example that displays a directory listing with
  line numbers:</p>
  <pre>
<b>ls | { print ++$i, ": $_"; }q</b>
</pre>

  <p>A <i>grep filter</i> consists of a block of code surrounded by
  curly braces, with a trailing '<tt>g</tt>' modifier. The Perl
  Shell turns this into a line-by-line filter, printing lines for
  which the code in the braces returns true. For the code in the
  braces, <tt>@_</tt> will contain the results of splitting
  <tt>$_</tt> with the pattern <tt>\s+</tt>. Here's a grep filter
  that displays the lines of <i>netstat</i> for which the second
  column is greater than two:</p>
  <pre>
<b>netstat | { $_[1]&gt;2; }g</b>
</pre>

  <p>A substitution filter consists of a Perl-style <tt>s///</tt>
  operation. The Perl Shell turns this into a line-by-line filter
  that performs the substitution on each line, and then prints
  it:</p>
  <pre>
<b>ls | s/y/k/</b>
</pre>

  <p>A <i>substitution filter</i> is logically equivalent to a
  block filter containing the substitution and a statement to print
  the resulting line. So the example above is equivalent to:</p>
  <pre>
<b>ls | { s/y/k/; print; }q</b>
</pre>

  <h3>Comparison To Other Shells</h3>

  <p><i>psh</i> is just one of a number of Perl shells you can
  choose from. In this section, I'll briefly describe the
  others.</p>

  <h3>Larry Wall's Perl Shell</h3>

  <p>Page 161 of the Camel Book (<i>Programming Perl</i>, O'Reilly
  &amp; Associates, 2nd Edition) shows this simple Perl shell:</p>
  <pre>
  while (&lt;&gt;) { eval; print $@; }
</pre>

  <h3>lpsh</h3>

  <p>Lee Eakin wrote the Fancy Poor Man's Perl SHell (called
  <i>lpsh</i> for Lee's Perl Shell), a simple shell derived from
  Larry Wall's Shell that he has used for a number of years now. He
  has added some numeric conversion functions for use as a
  calculator. This shell is available at the URL
  http://www.dfw.nostrum.com/~leakin/psh. For brief documentation
  (and a reference to the main Perl Shell site), see <a href=
  "http://www.dfw.nostrum.com/~leakin/psh.README" target=
  "resource window">http://www.dfw.nostrum.com/~leakin/psh.README</a>.</p>

  <h3>Perl Debugger Shell</h3>

  <p>Surprisingly few people seem to know that Perl comes with its
  own symbolic debugger that functions as a shell:</p>
  <pre>
<b>perl -de 1;</b>
</pre>

  <h3>perlish</h3>

  <p>Hiroo Hayashi wrote <i>perlsh</i>, a one-line Perl evaluator
  with line editing and variable name completion, as an example of
  his Term::ReadLine::Gnu module.</p>
  <pre>
PSH.pm
</pre>

  <p>Jan Krynicky maintains a Perl shell module called PSH.pm at
  http://jenda.krynicky.cz/. It's quite similar to <i>psh</i>, and
  is designed to provide a command line that can be called inside
  another program via <tt>PSH::prompt</tt>. A small file,
  <tt>psh.pl</tt>, is also included that uses PSH to provide a
  standalone shell.</p>

  <h3>softlist</h3>

  <p>Some versions of the Perl FAQ mention an interactive Perl
  shell called SoftList, which can be found at <a href=
  "http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/perl/SoftList/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/perl/SoftList/</a>.
  It predates Term::Readline and was apparently last touched in
  1993, and so would seem to be obsolete.</p>

  <h3>timtosh</h3>

  <p>Tim Newsome, has developed a shell he calls <i>timtosh</i>
  (There Is More Than One SHell), available at <a href=
  "http://www.wiw.org/~drz/timtosh" target=
  "resource window">http://www.wiw.org/~drz/timtosh</a>. It's a
  shell written entirely in Perl. The goal is a shell which is
  extensible in Perl and applies other Perl features to shell
  tasks, like Perl regex file matching. Tim says that
  <i>timtosh</i> "is focused quite differently than <i>psh</i> is,
  but is currently still waiting for a rewrite of the command line
  parsing. (It has been for almost a year now)."</p>

  <h3>vbsh</h3>

  <p>Tom Christiansen and Nathan Torkington's book Perl Cookbook,
  published by O'Reilly in 1998, has "Example 15-4. <i>vbsh</i>" on
  page 531 for section 15.11 (Editing Input). Its name stands for
  "Very Bad SHell".</p>

  <h3>Comparison Of The Perl Shells</h3>

  <p>As an aid to comparing/contrasting these different shells, a
  brief table of features is shown in Table 1.</p><b>Table 1. A
