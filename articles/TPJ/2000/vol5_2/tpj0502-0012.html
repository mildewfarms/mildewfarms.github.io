  <h2 align="center">The Fifth Annual Obfuscated Perl Contest</h2>

  <h4><i>Nathan Torkington</i></h4>

  <p>Twelve times the priest's hand rises and falls, and twelve
  times the knife takes life from the white-clad sacrifice.
  Moonlight spills over the scene like the virgin's blood over the
  altar, and your heart races. For you are next.</p>

  <p>The priest turns to you, as the robed assistants carry away
  the last participant. Beneath the hood you can see only the
  priest's sinister mouth, curved into a bitter smile. The crowd's
  chanting increases in strength, and you take two paces
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Have you an offering for L'rep Evif T'niop Xis, most holy
  giver of time and deliverer of all that is good?" The priest's
  gravelly voice, eerily magnified by the stone platform and marble
  altar, makes your chest resonate and you feel the ball of fear in
  the pit of your stomach.</p>

  <p>"Yes," you say.</p>

  <p>"Then step forward and deliver your offering to our most
  bloody god."</p>

  <p>You take another two paces forward, until you are at the
  altar. You can see the last supplicant's blood still dripping,
  slowly, from the sides. You clear your throat and recite:</p>
  <pre>
( $ ,, $ ")=("a".."z")[0,-1]; print "sh", $ ","m";;";;"
</pre>

  <p>The crowd gasps, breaking off their chant. The priest does not
  say anything, silently moving his lips and frowning. The only
  noise that can be heard is the sound of blood drip drip dripping
  onto the stone platform. All are motionless, then...</p>

  <p>The priest gives a signal and cries: "Too simple! You're
  indexing twice into the alphabet, and then printing three strings
  separated by the now-meaningful $,". You feel the hands of the
  altar boys on your shoulders and know that all is lost.</p>

  <p>Is this <i>your</i> fate, or will you defeat the high priests?
  Do you have what it takes to construct code most obfuscated? The
  doors to the Fifth Annual Obfuscated Perl Contest are open. The
  judges are straining at their straitjackets, and their medication
  has been boosted in anticipation of the finer degrees of
  psychosis required to decipher truly obfuscated code.</p>

  <p>This year there are four categories. No external files may be
  used other than the Perl/Tk module for category 1 or the CGI
  module for category 2.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Create a Diversion

      <p>Write a game in 512 characters or less, or a video game in
      2048 characters or less if you use Perl/Tk.</p>
    </li>

    <li>World Wide Wasteland

      <p>Write a program that creates a web page most foul. You may
      use the CGI module bundled with Perl. The size limit is 512
      characters.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Inner Beauty

      <p>The program with the highest utility * prettiness / size
      wins. Maximum 512 characters.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The Old Standby</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Print "The Perl Journal" in 256 characters or less.</p>

  <p>You can find examples of previous winning entries on the TPJ
  web site, but as an example, here is the winner of category 4
  from last year: Keith Winstein's optical character recognition
  engine.</p>

</pre>

  <p>All entries must be written in Perl, and will be tested under
  Perl 5.6 with either Windows 98 or a Unix variant, whichever
  operating system the judges happen to be using at the time. The
  system will have at least 16 megabytes of memory and 16 megabytes
  of disk space; there are no other warranties, express or
  implied.</p>

  <p>Your writings belong to you, but you provide TPJ with the
  right to duplicate, quote, edit for style, and disseminate them
  freely upon an unsuspecting world.</p>

  <p>Submissions must be received by August 15, 2000, and should be
  sent to contest@tpj.com as a tar or zip file with the program, a
  README file providing attribution (including email addresses),
  and a SOLUTION file explaining your program. If you are entering
  category 1, include a RULES file containing the rules of your
  game. The subject line of your message should say which category
  you're entering. If you enter more than once per category, say
  which entry it is.</p>

  <p>The priests await your offerings.</p>_ _END_ _
