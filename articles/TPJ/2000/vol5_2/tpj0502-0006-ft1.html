  <p>I have to apologize in advance for any heartache that
  "dynamicizing" the databases may have caused the Princeton
  researchers. While they informed me that such a change had been
  considered and deemed a possibility (given the funding), I can't
  help but feel like a hack invading their esteemed lexicographer
  territory. The "5 Papers" documentation reads, "WordNet's source
  files are written by lexicographers. They are the product of a
  detailed relational analysis of lexical semantics." That means no
  adding specialized definitions for "mongers", people.</p>
