  <h2 align="center">Patterns in Perl</h2>

  <h4 align="left"><i>Sean Hunter</i></h4>

  <p>Most programmers in professional development know someone who
  speaks in awed tones of the "gang of four", and has a copy of
  Addison-Wesley's Design Patterns that is almost as well-thumbed
  as your average blue camel. Someone who starts tedious one-sided
  conversations over lunch about the intimate details of the
  "visitor pattern", and wonders why no one else understands them
  and they just don't seem to be able to attract members of the
  opposite sex. We all know a pattern junkie when we see one.</p>

  <p>Those of you who are sufficiently curious and have not simply
  moved on to the next article at the mere mention of "patterns"
  may wonder why anyone would ever be foolish enough to consider
  that sort of thing in Perl. Patterns describe commonly occurring
  problems and how they should be solved, and they're too rigid,
  too "buzzword-compliant", too abstract and dull for Perl.</p>

  <p>Well, I agree. So why use them? In general I don't. However,
  I've recently gotten pretty good results from the judicious
  application of two of these patterns, and found that they can
  solve some problems that are a little tricky or inefficient to do
  by other means. In actual practice, these patterns aren't really
  anything new, but are just a way of naming common techniques that
  most people use all the time to solve various problems. The
  unfortunate thing about the movement is that the people behind it
  all have proven very dogmatic and unflexible. "There's only one
  way to do it" is not an attitude many Perl programmers agree
  with.</p>

  <h3>The Factory Pattern</h3>

  <p>This is a fancy name for having an object that builds other
  objects for you. If you've used the DBI interface, you've used a
  Factory pattern whenever you call <tt>DBI-&gt;connect()</tt>, and
  actually get back an object that uses special magic to talk to
  your database.</p>

  <p>Factories let you abstract away the complexity of creating
  objects so that the calling code can achieve a lot, while
  remaining simple and understandable. (That's the <i>theory</i>,
  anyway.)</p>

  <h3>The Iterator Pattern</h3>

  <p>An iterator is an object that loops over a collection,
  returning one at a time. <tt>foreach (@my_list)</tt> is pretty
  much all there is to the classic iterator.</p>

  <p>So why use one? Well, in other languages, you need them to
  iterate over complex data structures like hashes. In Perl,
  however, that's already taken care of by the facilities of the
  language. You just say <tt>for (keys %my_hash)</tt> or <tt>while
  (my ($key, $value) = each %my_hash)</tt> or some variation on
  those themes. As such, this pattern adds almost nothing of value
  to Perl - but we'll see a useful iterator soon.</p>

  <p>If you know that the folks using your collection are going to
  be retrieving the items in a structured way, you can use that
  knowlege to delay processing items in the collection until the
  caller specifically asks for them. This is called <i>lazy
  evaluation</i>, and it's useful for big collections because it
  lets us return quickly, rather than performing all the processing
  in one big chunk before your program can proceed. I do this by
  using what I call a <i>Chained Iterator</i>. We'll see how this
  works in a minute.</p>

  <h3>Enough theory, let's see some code</h3>

  <p>Our code will demonstrate both a Factory and an Iterator,
  using a base object: a simple blessed hash. The constructor of
  our <tt>BaseObj</tt> class simply takes whatever arguments are
  passed to it, munges them into a hash (<tt>$self = {@_}</tt>),
  and blesses that hash into a Perl object. I always use the
  two-argument form of bless so it's clear what class the object is
  being blessed into, which will sometimes be a Factory and
  sometimes an Iterator.</p>
  <pre>
use strict;
package BaseObj;
&#13;sub new {
    my $class  = shift;
&#13;    my $self = {@_};
    bless($self, $class);
&#13;    return $self;
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>Our first Factory class is also pretty straightforward. It has
  one method, <tt>getBassists()</tt>, which simply provides a short
  list of some of the great jazz bassists and pathetically attempts
  to raise their status by uppercasing their names.</p>

  <p>Our Factory does this by returning an Iterator object. The
  Iterator takes a "chain" argument, a list of code references. The
  idea is that when someone calls <tt>next()</tt> to retrieve the
  next item from the Iterator, it secretly runs all of the
  functions in the chain, passing the output from one function into
  the input of the next. Typically, these functions retrieve a
  single item and perform various transformations on it, such as
  blessing it into an object, adding extra data, or converting data
  from one form to another. In this example we build two small
  closures (subroutines whose behavior is partially determined as
  your program runs) to run in the Iterator chain. If we wanted to
  transform the data into HTML for our "great bassists" CGI
  program, we'd just throw another closure into the chain.</p>

  <p>Note that we don't need a constructor for our Factory or
  Iterator objects because we're inheriting from the BaseObj class,
  which provides one for us. Done right, Perl OO can be a great aid
  to the lazy. This code comes from Factory1.pm.</p>
  <pre>
use strict;
package Factory1;
&#13;use BaseObj;
use Iterator;
&#13;use vars qw(@ISA);
sub getBassists {
    my @great_bassists = (
	                 'Jimmy Blanton', 'Jimmy Garrison',    
	                 'Ray Brown',     'Charlie Haden',
	                 'Steve Swallow', 'Dave Holland');
&#13;    my $get_bassists = sub { shift @great_bassists };
    my $raise_status = sub { uc(shift) };
&#13;    return new Iterator(chain=&gt;[$get_bassists, 
$raise_status]);
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>At the moment the <tt>getBassists()</tt> function simply uses
  static data, but soon we'll make it more interesting by having it
  read from a database.</p>

  <p>Now we get to the meat of our design - the Iterator object,
  defined in <tt>Iterator.pm</tt>. It has one method,
  <tt>next()</tt>, which runs all of the closures in the chain in
  turn, passing the output of each to the input of the next.
  Because of the power of Perl, the expression is elegant and
  concise.</p>
  <pre>
use strict;
package Iterator;
use BaseObj;
&#13;use vars qw(@ISA);
sub next {
    my $self = shift;
&#13;    my $row;
    for (@{$self-&gt;{chain}}) { $row = &amp;$_($row) if defined $_ }
&#13;    return $row;
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>Now here's our first test program, which I call
  <tt>fact1.pl</tt>. Here we see the primary benefit of the
  Factory: It can accomplish a lot while keeping the calling code
  very simple.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
&#13;use strict;
use Factory1;
&#13;my $fact = new Factory();
&#13;my $it = $fact-&gt;getBassists();
&#13;while (my $bass = $it-&gt;next()) {
    print "$bass\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>Here lies one of the great gotchas of OO programming. It's
  very easy to become carried away by how much is achieved behind
  the scenes, resulting in code that hides where individual
  operations are performed. Simple code becomes a maintenance
  nightmare.</p>

  <p>Now, why did we go to the bother of creating these objects
  when all we needed to do was to run <tt>for</tt> over the list
  and convert each one to upper case right there? It
  <i>wouldn't</i> make much sense if this was all you wanted to do;
  this is just an example to demonstrate how patterns work. In the
  case of larger collections with more complex transformations,
  this idea really comes into its own.</p>

  <p>Say we decide we want to spread the word about jazz, and
  publish the gory details of our (very) extensive CD collection
  online. We back this up with a SQL database to allow the hordes
  of jazz-loving web surfers to search our CD collection by
  bassist. For this example we're just going to consider one part
  of the above scenario - how to get the list of bassists and their
  recordings.</p>

  <p>Let's say we've created a set of database tables to represent
  all the data we need for our fabulous web solution. The only
  parts of relevance here are the <tt>BASSIST</tt> and
  <tt>RECORDING</tt> tables. (Although we are creating the database
  on MySQL, I am using uppercase for database objects so that once
  my CD collection site takes off and I go for an IPO, it's easier
  to port Oracle for good investor relations. It's always a good
  idea to keep possible future rquirements in mind when
  designing.)</p>

  <p>Here are our table definitions. If you don't know SQL, don't
  worry. All that matters is that we have two databases: one for
  bassists and one for recordings, and each consists of a few
  fields of data.</p>
  <pre>
create table BASSIST (
	ID     int     (10) unsigned not null auto_increment,
	NAME   varchar (50),
	primary        key     (ID)
);
&#13;
create table RECORDING (
	ID     int     (10) unsigned not null auto_increment,
	TITLE  varchar (50),
	BASSIST_ID     int     (10) unsigned not null,
&#13;       key IDX_BASSIST_ID      (BASSIST_ID),
	primary key    (ID)
);
</pre>

  <p><tt>RECORDING.BASSIST_ID</tt> is a "foreign" key referencing
  <tt>ID</tt> from the <tt>BASSIST</tt> table. This lets us record
  which bassist was on any particular recording. (Since MySQL
  doesn't actually support foreign keys, I've just made it an
  index, and would make it a proper foreign key if we migrated to
  another database engine.) The <tt>RECORDING</tt> table supports
  many recordings for each bassist. For some sample data along with
  the above table definitions, see the file bassists_dump.sql
  bundled with this article's source code.</p>

  <p>Here's a query so you can see some of the sample
  data:</p><tt>mysql&gt; <b>select B.*, R.* from RECORDING R,
  BASSIST B where B.ID = R.BASSIST_ID;</b></tt>
  <pre>
+----+----------------+----+------------------------------+------------+
| ID | NAME           | ID | TITLE                        | BASSIST_ID |
+----+----------------+----+------------------------------+------------+
|  1 | Ray Brown      |  1 | Night Train                  |          1 |
|  3 | Jimmy Garrison |  2 | Crescent                     |          3 |
|  3 | Jimmy Garrison |  3 | A Love Supreme               |          3 |
|  3 | Jimmy Garrison |  4 | Ballads                      |          3 |
|  4 | Charlie Haden  |  5 | Liberation Music Orchestra   |          4 |
|  4 | Charlie Haden  |  6 | Dreamweaver                  |          4 |
|  4 | Charlie Haden  |  7 | Shades                       |          4 |
|  5 | Paul Chambers  |  8 | Milestones                   |          5 |
|  6 | Steve Swallow  |  9 | Real Book                    |          6 |
|  7 | Dave Holland   | 10 | Conference of the Birds      |          7 |
|  7 | Dave Holland   | 11 | Gnu High                     |          7 |
+----+----------------+----+------------------------------+------------+
11 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>

  <p>As you can see, each bassist in the table has one or more
  recordings. The first ID column is <tt>BASSIST.ID</tt>, and the
  second is <tt>RECORDING.ID</tt>. We actually have another bassist
  who hasn't shown up in the above query: Jimmy Blanton has no
  entries in the sample data in the <tt>RECORDING</tt> table.
  Here's his entry in the <tt>BASSIST</tt> table:</p><tt>mysql&gt;
  <b>select * from BASSIST where ID = 2;</b></tt>
  <pre>
+----+---------------+
| ID | NAME          |
+----+---------------+
|  2 | Jimmy Blanton |
+----+---------------+
</pre>

  <p>Now, what we want to be able to do is to query the database
  dynamically, producing a list of bassists with their respective
  recordings that reflects the "one to many" structure of the above
  data. In order to take away some of the drudgery of using DBI, we
  use a small wrapper that makes the calling and error checking
  easier and more consistent. This wrapper function is in the file
  <tt>SqlTools.pm</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
package SqlTools;
use strict;
use Carp;
&#13;sub sql_hash {
    my ($sql, @rest) = @_;
    if (not defined $sql or $sql eq '') {
	    carp("doing nothing, just like you asked");
	    return;
    }
    my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($sql);
    if (!$sth) {
	    croak("Unable to prepare sql statement '$sql' " .
	        "in sql_tools:\n\t " . $dbh-&gt;errstr);
    }
    unless ($sth-&gt;execute(@rest)) {
	croak("Unable to execute sql statement '$sql' " .
	    "in sql_tools:\n\t " . $dbh-&gt;errstr); 
    }
    my $hashref;
    my @retval;
    while ($hashref = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_hashref) {
	    push @retval, $hashref;
    }
    return \@retval;
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>sql_hash()</tt> function takes a SQL query and returns
  the results as a reference to a list of hashes. The
  <tt>@rest</tt> parameter lets us support placeholders (see the
  DBI documentation for more details). Note that just because we
  are using objects for some of our design doesn't mean that
  everything we do has to fall under that model. The above
  functions work perfectly well as they are, and any further
  objectification would be gratuitous and pedantic. One of the most
  important design skills is not overapplying a favored
  technique.</p>

  <p>Here's the new version of our Factory class. I've called it
  <tt>Factory2</tt>, and the code can be found in
  <tt>Factory2.pm</tt>. The <tt>getBassists()</tt> function is
  slightly more involved now, because we query the database to
  return a collection of <tt>Bassist</tt> objects. These have an
  internal structure representing the <tt>BASSIST</tt> and
  <tt>RECORDING</tt> tables. The Bassist object is a blessed hash
  which has a key and value for each column of the <tt>BASSIST</tt>
  table, and an extra key, called <tt>RECORDINGS</tt>, holding a
  list of the bassist's recordings.</p>

  <p>For example, if we defined the desired data structure for
  Jimmy Garrison statically, it would look something like this:</p>
  <pre>
my $jimmy = {
        ID =&gt; 3,
        NAME =&gt; 'Jimmy Garrison',
        RECORDINGS =&gt; [
	        {BASSIST_ID =&gt; 3,
                ID =&gt; 2,
             TITLE =&gt; 'Crescent'},
&#13;               {BASSIST_ID =&gt; 3,
                ID =&gt; 3,
             TITLE =&gt; 'A Love Supreme'},
&#13;               {BASSIST_ID =&gt; 3,
                ID =&gt; 4,
                TITLE =&gt; 'Ballads'} ]
};
</pre>

  <p>As you may have expected, our new <tt>getBassists()</tt>
  function returns an Iterator that creates these on the fly. If
  you'd like a closer look at these data structures (or any
  others), you can display them using the Data::Dumper module or
  the Perl debugger.</p>
  <pre>
use strict;
&#13;package Factory2;
&#13;use BaseObj;
use Iterator;
use SqlTools;
use Bassist;
use vars qw(@ISA);
sub getBassists {
    my $bassists   = sql_hash("select * from BASSIST");
    my $recordings = sql_hash("select * from RECORDING");
&#13;    # turn $recordings into a hash keyed by BASSIST_ID
    my %recording_by_bassist;
    for (@$recordings) {
	    push @{$recording_by_bassist{$_-&gt;{BASSIST_ID}}}, $_;
    }
&#13;    # get a bassist
    my $get_bassist = sub { shift @$bassists }
&#13;    # add the recordings for this bassist
    my $get_recordings = sub {
	  my $bassist = shift;
	  return unless defined $bassist;
	  $bassist-&gt;{RECORDINGS} = $recording_by_bassist{$bassist-&gt;{ID}};
	  return $bassist;
    };
&#13;    # create a Bassist object
    my $make_object = sub {
	  my $data = shift;
	  return new Bassist(%$data)
	      if defined $data;
      };
    
    return new Iterator(chain=&gt;[$get_bassist,
	                             $get_recordings,
	                             $make_object]);
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>Here are the contents of <tt>Bassist.pm</tt>. At the moment,
  it has a single method, <tt>getString()</tt>, which returns a
  string containing the name of the bassist and the titles of any
  corresponding recordings. We could easilly extend this object to
  include the ability to display itself as an HTML snippet.</p>
  <pre>
package Bassist;
use strict;
use BaseObj;
&#13;use vars qw(@ISA);
sub getString {
    my $self = shift;
&#13;    my $str = "$self-&gt;{NAME}:\n";
    for (@{$self-&gt;{RECORDINGS}}) { 
         $str .= "\t$_-&gt;{TITLE}\n" 
    }
    $str .= "\n";
&#13;    return $str;
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>Finally, here is <tt>fact2.pl</tt>, our test program for
  Factory2. It calls <tt>getBassists()</tt>, using the
  <tt>getString()</tt> method on each Bassist object to print out
  each name and the corresponding recordings.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use Factory2;
&#13;my $fact = new Factory2();
&#13;my $it = $fact-&gt;getBassists();
&#13;while (my $bass = $it-&gt;next()) {
    print $bass-&gt;getString();
}
</pre>

  <p>I have found these techniques to be a good way of returning
  collections of objects to clients as the result of database
  queries. When dealing with large result sets, it is often
  beneficial to be able to return quickly, performing row
  processing "just in time" before giving each row back to the
  caller. I hope that these examples have given you some idea of
  the possible uses of Factories and Iterators in general, and
  Chained Iterators in particular. In the spirit of "There's More
  Than One Way To Do It", these can form a useful weapon in the
  Perl programmer's problem-solving arsenal - bearing in mind that
  no technique solves all possible problems.</p>
