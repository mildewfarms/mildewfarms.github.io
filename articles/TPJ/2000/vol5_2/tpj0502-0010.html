  <p>This article describes how to write eventful Perl/Tk web
  client programs using the LWP (library for WWW access in Perl)
  bundle. We'll develop a web client called <i>tkcomics</i> that
  retrieves comic strips with LWP and displays them with
  Perl/Tk.</p>

  <h3>LWP</h3>

  <p>LWP is a Perl library providing access to the web, and is used
  primarily for writing client applications that mimic what your
  browser does. It "speaks" HTTP (the Hypertext Transfer Protocol),
  and one of its most basic duties is fetching the content of URLs.
  The beauty of LWP is that it hides all the operational details
  while allowing us to do our work with simple objects and
  methods.</p>

  <p>In essence, a <i>user agent</i> object working on our behalf
  takes a <i>request</i> object and does whatever low-level
  communication and error handling is required to send a request
  for web content on its way. The user agent then waits for the
  reply (or error) and hands it back to our program in the form of
  a <i>response</i> object. Our job is to create the user agent and
  then use various LWP methods to manipulate requests and
  responses. But if all we want to do is simply fetch web content,
  we can use LWP in "simple" mode and just say "fetch this URL".
  LWP will create a user agent and request/response objects
  internally, eventually returning content data to our program.</p>

  <p>At first glance, the simple LWP mechanism would appear to
  suffice for a client like <i>tkcomics</i>, but it has some
  drawbacks. As you might suspect, they have to do with blocking:
  there might be a considerable time delay between a request and
  when the network finally delivers the content. Even manual
  handling of LWP's user agent won't surmount all of these
  problems, so we'll craft a solution that launches multiple
  processes to minimize the adverse effects of blocking.</p>

  <p>An excellent place for private viewing of your favorite comics
  is <tt><a href="http://www.comics.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.comics.com/</a></tt>, although all
  the glamour, glitz, and advertisements may be too much for the
  stomach. But there's nothing to stop us from fetching just the
  comics and using Perl/Tk to display them. We'll start by learning
  now to fetch and interpret the <tt>www.comics.com</tt> home page,
  and then build our Perl/Tk client around that framework.</p>

  <h3>Fetching Web Content With LWP::Simple</h3>

  <p>This module is so simple it's not even object oriented;
  rather, it exports a handful of subroutine for fetching and
  mirroring web content. All we're interested in is fetching
  content, which we can do with the <tt>get()</tt> subroutine:</p>
  <pre>
use LWP::Simple qw/get/;
</pre>

  <p>To retrieve a web page all we do is call <tt>get()</tt> with
  the desired URL:</p>
  <pre>
  my $comics_home = 'http://www.comics.com';
  my $comics = get $comics_home or die "Can't get $comics_home.";
</pre>

  <p>So now <tt>$comics</tt> contains a ton of raw HTML, stuff we
  normally let our browser interpret and display for us. If we
  actually did browse that URL, one of the things we'd see is the
  actual comic selector widget, what appears to be an Optionmenu
  (Figure 1):</p><font face="verdana" size="1"><b>Figure 1.</b> The
  comic selector widget</font><br>
  <img src="images/lidie-01.gif" width="200" height="23" alt=
  "The comic selector widget.">

  <p>It's not a Tk Optionmenu, of course, but it's what the browser
  renders when it encounters a <tt>&lt;SELECT&gt;</tt> tag. Looking
  at the HTML, either by printing <tt>$comics</tt> or viewing the
  page source in the browser, we see this:</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;SELECT NAME= ... &gt;
      &lt;OPTION&gt;Click to select a comic
      &lt;OPTION VALUE="/universal/adam/ab.html"&gt;Adam
      &lt;OPTION VALUE="/comics/alleyoop/ab.html"&gt;Alley Oop
      &lt;OPTION VALUE="/comics/andycapp/ab.html"&gt;Andy Capp
      &lt;OPTION VALUE="/comics/arlonjanis/ab.html"&gt;Arlo &amp; Janis
      &lt;OPTION VALUE="/comics/askshagg/ab.html"&gt;Ask Shagg
      &lt;OPTION VALUE="/comics/bc/ab.html"&gt;B.C.
&#13;  ...
&#13;      &lt;OPTION VALUE="/comics/wizardofid/ab.html"&gt;Wizard of Id
      &lt;OPTION VALUE="/universal/ziggy/ab.html"&gt;Ziggy
  &lt;/SELECT&gt;
 
</pre>

  <p>This looks promising indeed; we seem to have a list of URLs,
  one per comic. If we're lucky, we should be able to key on the
  string <tt>OPTION VALUE</tt> and then use the following code to
  pick out the comic names and their associated URLs.</p>
  <pre>
  my $n = 0;
  foreach (split /\n/, $comics) {
      next unless /OPTION\s+VALUE/i;
      if (my($comic_url, $comic) = m\"([^"]+)"&gt;(.*)\) {
          $comic =~ s/\t//g;
          $comic =~ s/\r//g;
          printf "%-30s : %s\n", $comic, $comic_url;
          $n++;
      }
  }
  print "\nfound $n comics\n";
</pre>

  <p>And luck is with us. If we run the code, this is what we'll
  see:</p>
  <pre>
  Adam  : /universal/adam/ab.html
  Alley Oop     : /comics/alleyoop/ab.html
  Andy Capp     : /comics/andycapp/ab.html
  Arlo &amp; Janis      : /comics/arlonjanis/ab.html
  Ask Shagg     : /comics/askshagg/ab.html
  B.C.  : /comics/bc/ab.html
&#13;  ...
&#13;  Wizard of Id : /comics/wizardofid/ab.html
  Ziggy : /universal/ziggy/ab.html
&#13;  found 91 comics
 
</pre>

  <p>The URLs on the right are not the comic images, but another
  page relative to the site's home address containing the actual
  URL of the comic. For instance, if we concatenate Ask Shagg's
  relative URL with <tt>$comics_home</tt> and view the HTML at
  <tt><a href="http://www.comics.com/comics/askshagg/ab.html"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www.comics.com/comics/askshagg/ab.html</a></tt>,
  we see an <tt>&lt;IMG&gt;</tt> tag with the relative URL of the
  actual GIF image:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;IMG SRC="/comics/askshagg/archive/images/askshagg21461240000515.gif" 
ALT="today's comics strip" ALIGN=TOP BORDER="0"&gt;
</pre><i>tkcomics</i> can easily extract this URL, fetch the image
file, convert it to a Tk Photo and display it. So, we have
proof-of-concept code. On the upside, it's extremely simple, but on
the downside it's blocking, and there's no timeout mechanism. Let's
try to address these concerns.

  <h3>lwp-request and fileevent</h3>

  <p>To keep Perl/Tk events flowing, we need to use a separate
  process (or thread), and ensure that the two processes can talk
  in a non-blocking way. The first process, the Tk parent, handles
  the GUI and event processing, while the child fetches comic
  images and forwards them to the parent.</p>

  <p>In the article <i>Signals</i>, <i>Sockets</i>, <i>and
  Pipes</i> from issue <a href="../vol2_1/ewtoc.html"><b>TPJ
  #5</b></a> of TPJ, we saw a Perl/Tk client program that used
  TCP/IP sockets in concert with <tt>pipe</tt>, <tt>fork</tt>,
  <tt>exec</tt>, and <tt>fileevent()</tt>, all to monitor the disk
  space utilization of a cluster of server machines. That IPC
  solution was unusually specialized because it used bi-directional
  pipes for a two-way conversation between the Perl/Tk parent and
  the child.</p>

  <p>In contrast, if the <i>tkcomics</i> child can get its URL from
  the command line and send comics to standard output, we can use
  the pipe form of the <tt>open</tt> command and let Perl do the
  hard work.</p>

  <p>Included in the LWP package is <i>lwp-request</i>, a
  standalone program perfectly matched for our needs -- it accepts
  a URL on the command line and prints the resulting web content on
  its STDOUT.</p>

  <p>So that's our plan, and with Perl 5.6.0, it might work on
  Win32 too.</p>

  <p>We start with the <i>de rigeur</i> declarations. All the comic
  images are binary data, but to use them in Perl/Tk we must first
  Base64 encode them -- that's why we need MIME::Base64.
  Additionally, although most of the comics are GIFs, a few are in
  JPEG or PNG format. Note that Tk::JPEG and Tk::PNG are not
  bundled with Perl/Tk, so you'll have to install them
  yourself.</p>
  <pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
  #
  # tkcomics - display comics courtesy of http://www.comics.com
  #
  # Because LWP::Simple and LWP::UserAgent can block, do the
  # network I/O in another thread (er, child) with fileevent().
  # Add a Stop/Cancel button that kills the pipe.
  
  use MIME::Base64;
  use Tk;
  use Tk::JPEG;
  use Tk::PNG;
  use subs qw/get_url show_comic status stop_get/;
  use strict;
</pre>

  <p>Here we open the MainWindow in the standard fashion, and then
  initialize a few global variables. <tt>$photo</tt> holds the
  comic image object reference. <tt>$status</tt> displays periodic
  status messages that keep the user informed of the state of data
  transfers. <tt>$eof</tt> is set either when the
  <i>lwp-request</i> child completes (signaling that the web fetch
  is complete), or by a user button click to prematurely interrupt
  a transfer. <tt>$pid</tt> holds the process ID of the child, used
  to kill it if we tire of waiting for the response. The
  <tt>%ext</tt> hash maps a comic file name extension to a Tk Photo
  image processor. Finally, <tt>$help</tt> is a special status
  message that's periodically displayed telling the user how to
  work the application. We'll stuff the names of all available
  comics into a List widget and use a &lt;Button-1&gt; event to
  select one for viewing. &lt;Button-2&gt;, obviously, is used to
  interrupt a long (or hung) transfer.</p>
  <pre>
  my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new;
  my $photo = '';
  my $status = '';
  my($eof, $pid);
  my %ext = qw/
               gif gif
               jpg jpeg
               png png
               tif tiff
               xbm xbm
               ppm ppm
              /;   # file extension =&gt; Photo format map
  my $help = '&lt;Button-1&gt; fetch comic, &lt;Button-2&gt; interrupt transfer';
</pre>

  <p>As Figure 2 shows, the entire application consists of just
  three Tk widgets: a Listbox that holds the names of the comics,
  one Label that displays the comic images (empty initially, of
  course), and a second Label that displays relevant status
  information.</p><font face="verdana" size="1"><b>Figure 2.</b>
  The initial <i>tkcomics</i> display</font><br>
  <img src="images/lidie-02.gif" width="359" height="125" alt=
  "The initial tkcomics display">
  <pre>
  my $s  = $mw-&gt;Label(-textvariable =&gt; \$status, -width =&gt; 100);
  my $lb = $mw-&gt;Scrolled('Listbox');
  my $l  = $mw-&gt;Label;
  $s-&gt;pack (qw/-side bottom -fill x -expand 1/);
  $lb-&gt;pack(qw/side left -fill y -expand 1 -anchor w/);
  $l-&gt;pack (-side =&gt; 'right');
</pre>

  <p>The following code is essentially our old proof-of-concept
  example, except that instead of printing comic names and URLs, we
  build a hash of comic URLs indexed by comic name. It's important
  to note that we've eliminated LWP::Simple, hence use our own
  <tt>get_url()</tt> subroutine in place of
  <tt>LWP::Simple::get()</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
  my $comics_home = 'http://www.comics.com';
  my $comics = get_url $comics_home 
or die "Can't get $comics_home.";
  
  my (%comics, $comic_url, $comic);
  foreach (split /\n/, $comics) {
      next unless /OPTION\s+VALUE/i;
      if (($comic_url, $comic) = m\"([^"]+)"&gt;(.*)\) {
          $comic =~ s/\t//g;
          $comic =~ s/\r//g;
          $comics{$comic} = $comic_url;
      }
  }
</pre>

  <p>We now display our first status message, telling us how many
  comics were found, and how to use <i>tkcomics</i>. The
  <tt>status()</tt> subroutine simply sets the status Label's
  <tt>-textvariable</tt>, and then invokes <tt>idletasks()</tt> to
  flush Tk's low priority idle events queue. This updates the
  entire Tk display so that the status message appears
  immediately.</p>
  <pre>
  status 'Found '.scalar(keys %comics).' comics, '.$help;
  
  sub status {
      $status = $_[0];
      $mw-&gt;idletasks;
  }
</pre>

  <p>Finally, we populate the Listbox with the comic names, sorted
  alphabetically, establish two button bindings that give life to
  <i>tkcomics</i>, and enter the main Perl/Tk event loop.</p>
  <pre>
  foreach (sort keys %comics) {
      $lb-&gt;insert('end', $_);
  }
  
  $lb-&gt;bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;' =&gt; \&amp;show_comic);
  $mw-&gt;bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;' =&gt; \&amp;stop_get);
  
  MainLoop;
  
</pre>

  <p>The initial <i>tkcomics</i> display is shown in Figure 2.</p>

  <p>The heart of <i>tkcomics</i> is the subroutine
  <tt>get_url()</tt>, shown below. Look it over before I explain
  it. Note that there's an implicit tradeoff between efficiency and
  simplicity. For an important program it would be better to
  <tt>fork</tt> a persistent child once and establish a dialog
  between it and the Tk parent. In this case however, it's
  considerably easier just to use a pipe open and run
  <i>lwp-request</i> for every URL.</p>
  <pre>
  sub get_url {
  
      my ($url) = @_;
      
      status "Fetching $url";
      $pid = open PIPE, "lwp-request -m GET -t 20 -e $url 2&gt;&amp;1 |" 
          or die "Open error: $!";
      binmode PIPE if $^O eq 'MSWin32';
  
      my $content;
      $mw-&gt;fileevent(\*PIPE, 'readable' =&gt; sub {
          my($stat, $data);
          while ($stat = sysread PIPE, $data, 4096) {
              $content .= $data;
          }
          die "sysread error:  $!" unless defined $stat;
          $eof = 1 if $stat == 0;
      });
      $mw-&gt;waitVariable(\$eof);
      $mw-&gt;fileevent(\*PIPE, 'readable' =&gt; '');
      close PIPE;
      
      $pid = undef;
      
      (my $response, $content) = 
$content =~ /(.*?)\n\n(.*)/is if $content;
  
      return wantarray ? ($response, $content) : $content;
                     
  } # end get_url
</pre>

  <p>Subroutine <tt>get_url()</tt> is passed a single argument, the
  URL to fetch, which is immediately posted in the status Label.
  The open statement performs the requisite <tt>pipe</tt>,
  <tt>fork</tt>, and <tt>exec</tt>ing of <i>lwp-request</i> for us,
  so all we (the Tk parent) need do is establish a
  <tt>fileevent()</tt> handler to read web content. The
  <i>lwp-request</i> option <tt>-t</tt> causes a twenty second
  timeout, and the <tt>-e</tt> option says to return the response
  headers along with the web content. The response headers are
  returned first, separated from the content by an empty line.</p>

  <p>If you're on Win32, the <tt>binmode</tt> statement is very
  important, because the comic images are binary data. On Unix,
  <tt>binmode</tt> isn't required, but it also does no harm.</p>

  <p>Now we set up the <tt>fileevent()</tt> readable callback on
  the <i>lwp-request</i> output pipe. The callback simply appends
  up to 4K of web data to the <tt>$content</tt> variable, and
  nominally ends at the end-of-file. Meanwhile, Tk event processing
  continues because the Tk parent is spinning on the
  <tt>waitVariable</tt> statement, waiting for the <tt>$eof</tt>
  variable to change. <tt>$eof</tt> changes in one of two ways,
  either when the <tt>fileevent()</tt> callback detects
  end-of-file, or, as we shall see, when the user clicks
  Button-2.</p>

  <p>Once the <tt>waitVariable</tt> is satisfied, we cancel the
  <tt>fileevent()</tt> readable callback, close the pipe handle and
  undef <tt>$pid</tt>. Notice that <tt>get_url()</tt> uses
  <tt>wantarray</tt> to determine whether it was called in scalar
  or list context. In list context, we assume the caller wants two
  strings: the response headers and the actual URL content.
  Otherwise we assume that only the content is desired.</p>

  <p>To stop a web <tt>get()</tt>, we click Button-2, which invokes
  this subroutine, <tt>stop_get()</tt>. We then set <tt>$eof</tt>
  so the <tt>fileevent()</tt> readable callback terminates, and if
  <tt>$pid</tt> is defined (that is, if the <i>lwp-request</i>
  child is still running), we <tt>kill</tt> it.</p>
  <pre>
  sub stop_get {
      status "Stopping transfer ...";
      $mw-&gt;after(5000, sub {status $help});
      $eof = -1;
      kill 'TERM', $pid if defined $pid;
  }
 
</pre>

  <h3>The Recipe for Displaying Web Images</h3>

  <p>Let's take a peek at what the <i>tkcomics</i> application
  looks like when rendering a comic. Figure 3 depicts the program
  displaying a GIF file. To see how we rendered it, read on.
  Basically, using the active Listbox element, we find the comic
  URL and fetch its contents. Within the page is an
  <tt>&lt;IMG&gt;</tt> tag with another URL pointing to the actual
  image, which we then fetch, convert to a Photo, and display.
  Periodically we examine <tt>$eof</tt> to see if any transfer was
  aborted.</p><font face="verdana" size="1"><b>Figure 3.</b> Ask
  Shagg Camel Facts</font><br>
  <img src="images/lidie-03.gif" width="440" height="142" alt=
  "Ask Shagg Camel Facts">

  <p>As with any binding callback of the form</p>
  <pre>
$lb-&gt;bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;' =&gt; \&amp; show_comic);
</pre>

  <p>Perl/Tk implicitly passes the bound widget reference -- the
  Listbox -- as the callback's first argument, which we assign to
  the variable <tt>$lb</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
  sub show_comic {
&#13;      my ($lb) = @_;
</pre>

  <p>Since we got here on a ButtonRelease-1 event, we're guaranteed
  that the active Listbox entry is our target comic. We
  <tt>get()</tt> it, and index into the <tt>%comics</tt> hash to
  get the URL of the page containing the comic image URL. We return
  immediately if the transfer was interrupted.</p>
  <pre>
      my $comic = $lb-&gt;get('active');
      my $comic_url = $comics{$comic};
      my $comic_html = get_url 
          $comic_url =~ /^http:/i ? $comic_url 
            : "$comics_home$comic_url";
      return if $eof == -1;
</pre>

  <p>Now we extract the image URL from the mass of HTML sitting in
  <tt>$comic_html</tt>, and call <tt>get_url()</tt> in list context
  to get both the response header and the binary comic image. If
  the transfer wasn't interrupted, we can assume all the returned
  data is correct.</p>
  <pre>
      my ($image_url) =
          $comic_html =~ m\.*&lt;IMG SRC="([^"]+)".*? 
ALT="(today|daily)\is;
&#13;      my ($response, $image) = 
get_url "$comics_home$image_url";
      return if $eof == -1;
	  
</pre>

  <p>Perl/Tk images can be generated either from an external file
  or embedded data. Due to its Tcl heritage where everything is (or
  more accurately, <i>was</i>) a string, embedded image data must
  be in printable characters, which is why we first Base64 encode
  the image data. Now we do a little bookkeeping with the variable
  <tt>$photo</tt> -- the second and subsequent invocations of this
  callback delete any previous image to stem a possible memory
  leak. Finally, we create an image of the appropriate format,
  configure the image Label to display it, and update the status
  help message. Q.E.D.</p>
  <pre>
&#13;      my $photo_data = encode_base64($image);
      $photo-&gt;delete 
if UNIVERSAL::isa($photo =&gt; 'Tk::Photo');
      my($ext) = $image_url =~ /\.(.*)?/;
      $ext ||= 'gif';
      status "Creating $bytes byte $ext Photo";
      $photo = $mw-&gt;Photo(-data =&gt; $photo_data, 
                        -format =&gt; $ext{lc $ext});
      $l-&gt;configure(-image =&gt; $photo);
  
      status $help;
  
  } # end show_comic
  
</pre>

  <h3>Win32 Considerations</h3>

  <p>This is all well and good; the code is sound, and
  <i>should</i> work with Perl 5.6.0 and a recent Tk, such as
  Tk800.022. But, alas, it doesn't. It hangs on the
  <tt>fileevent(</tt>), which is never triggered. What can we
  do?</p>

  <p>Threads are out, as Tk is not thread-safe. TCP/IP comes to
  mind, but I've got code that forks a child and uses local
  sockets, and it hangs on the <tt>fileevent()</tt> too. We could
  arrange for the child to write a file and signal the Tk parent by
  some means, perhaps a semaphore, but that lacks style. We can't
  use shared memory, since the Unix <tt>shm*</tt> shared memory
  functions aren't available in Win32, right? True, but Win32 has
  its own shared memory capabilities, so let's investigate
  further...</p>

  <p>A chance email message from Grant Hopwell clued me into his
  Tie::Win32MemMap module. With it, Grant would spin off Win32
  children usingWin32::Process::Create, and the two processes would
  talk using a shared Perl hash! This seemed an interesting
  possibility -- create a shared hash with two keys,
  <tt>CONTENT</tt> and <tt>COMPLETE</tt>, and have the child run
  <i>lwp-request</i> and store web content in
  <tt>$shared_hash{CONTENT}</tt>, while the Perl/Tk parent watches
  (using <tt>waitVariable</tt>) for a change in
  <tt>$shared_hash{COMPLETE}</tt>, set by the child when ready.</p>

  <p>Tie::Win32MemMap requires Storable, available from CPAN, and
  Win32::MemMap, written by Amine Moulay Ramdane, available at

  Tie::Win32MemMap itself is available from The Perl Journal
  <tt>programs</tt> web page.</p>

  <p>As it happens, we can indeed write a drop-in replacement for
  subroutine <tt>get_url()</tt>, specifically for Win32, and keep
  the rest of <i>tkcomics</i> intact. Let's look at get_url() for
  Win32 now.</p>
  <pre>
  sub get_url {
&#13;      my($url) = @_;
    
      status "Fetching $url";
	  
</pre>

  <p>Here we create and initialize a new chunk of shared memory and
  <tt>tie</tt> it to the hash <tt>%content</tt>. The shared memory
  is tagged with the name <tt>tkcomics</tt>, which any Win32
  process can access if it uses the proper MapName.</p>
  <pre>
      use Win32::Process;
      use Tie::Win32MemMap;
  
      my %content;
      tie %content, 'Tie::Win32MemMap', {
          Create  =&gt; MEM_NEW_SHARE,
          MapName =&gt; 'tkcomics',
      };
      $content{'COMPLETE'} = 0;
      $content{'CONTENT'}  = '';
	 
</pre>

  <p>Now we fire up the child process, another Perl program stored
  in the file <tt>tkcwin32.kid</tt>, whose job is to connect to the
  shared memory for <tt>tkcomics</tt>, fill the <tt>CONTENT</tt>
  entry with web data from the URL passed on the command line, and
  set the <tt>COMPLETE</tt> entry when it's finished.</p>
  <pre>
      Win32::Process::Create(
          my $child,
          'c:\\perl\\bin\\perl.exe',
          "perl tkcwin32.kid $url",
          0,
          NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS,
          '.',
      ) or die Win32::FormatMessage(Win32::GetLastError);
  
      $eof = 0;
      $mw-&gt;update;
	 
</pre>

  <p>Here we wait for the signal from the child that it has
  completed. Normally we would use the statement
  <tt>waitVariable(\$content{'COMPLETE'})</tt> to do this, but
  there is competing magic between the tie module and Tk, so we
  have to synthesize our own using this loop:</p>
  <pre>
      while ( $content{'COMPLETE'} != 1 ) {
          last if $eof == -1;
          $mw-&gt;after(10);
          $mw-&gt;update;
      }
</pre>And once the child completes, we separate the response
headers from the actual content, and return the particular data
required by our caller, just like the Unix version.
  <pre>
      my $content = $content{'CONTENT'};
      (my $response, $content) = 
$content =~ /(.*?)\n\n(.*)/is if $content;
      return wantarray ? ($response, $content) : $content;
                     
  } # end get_url
</pre>

  <p>For our purposes the child, <tt>tkcwin32.kid</tt>, must reside
  in the current working directory because we haven't qualified the
  pathname in the <tt>Win32::Process::Create()</tt> call. It's
  certainly trivial to embed the child in <i>tkcomics</i> proper
  and create it during initialization, an exercise left to the
  reader. Here, then, is the Win32 child program:</p>
  <pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
  #
  # Win32 tkcomics helper program that shovels 
  # web content to the Tk parent.
  
  use Tie::Win32MemMap;
  
  my $url = shift;
 
</pre>

  <p>Because we're not in the context of a subroutine, the naked
  shift statement uses as its argument <tt>@ARGV</tt> -- the
  command line -- rather than <tt>@_</tt>, thus providing the child
  the URL specified by the parent.</p>

  <p>By this point in real-time the Tk parent has already created
  and tied the shared memory to its hash, so all the child need do
  is tie to the same MapName in "share" mode.</p>
  <pre>
  my %content;
  tie %content, 'Tie::Win32MemMap', {
      Create  =&gt; MEM_VIEW_SHARE,
      MapName =&gt; 'tkcomics',
  };
</pre>

  <p>Once again (with Perl 5.6.0 only!) the child is free on Win32
  to do a pipe open and run <i>lwp-request</i> in the same manner
  as the Unix code. Don't forget the <tt>binmode</tt>
  statement:</p>
  <pre>
  open(PIPE, "lwp-request -m GET -t 20s -e $url|") 
                                 or die "open failure: $!";
  binmode PIPE;
</pre>

  <p>And once again, read 4K chunks of web content and build up the
  scalar <tt>$content{'CONTENT'}</tt>. When end-of-file is reached,
  close the pipe and set the <tt>COMPLETE</tt> marker, which
  signals the Tk parent to proceed.</p>
  <pre>
  my($stat, $data);
  while ($stat = sysread PIPE, $data, 4096) {
      $content{'CONTENT'} .= $data;
  }
  die "sysread error:  $!" unless defined $stat;
  close PIPE;
&#13;  $content{'COMPLETE'} = 1;
  exit(0);
</pre>

  <p>In case you don't believe all this actually works, gaze upon
  Figure 4 and witness <i>tkcomics</i> for Win32!</p><font face=
