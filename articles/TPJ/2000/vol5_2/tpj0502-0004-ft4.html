  <p>If at each move there are four pieces that can move, and they
  can each move right or left, the <i>branching factor</i> of the
  tree is eight, giving a tree with 1 (depth 0) + 8 (depth 1) + 8
  ** 2 + 8 ** 3 + 8 ** 4 = 4681 nodes in it. But, in practice, not
  all pieces can move in both directions (none of the <tt>x</tt>
  pieces in <tt>xxxx___oooo</tt> can move left, for example), and
  there may be fewer than four pieces, if some were lost. For
  example, there are 801 nodes in a tree of depth four starting
  from <tt>xxxx___oooo</tt>, suggesting an average branching factor
  of about five (801 ** (1/4) is about 5.3), not eight.</p>
