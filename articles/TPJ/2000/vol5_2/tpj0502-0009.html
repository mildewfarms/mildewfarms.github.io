  <p>It started, as so many of these things do, with one of those
  interminable debates between programmers. You know what I mean.
  They usually end up with one party shouting something like "Well,
  fine, I don't care if it's impossible, I'm going to do it
  anyway!"</p>

  <p>This time around, it was me, and the topic in question was an
  operating system user-space comprised of non-GNU components. An
  operating system consists of two components: the <i>kernel</i>,
  like Windows or Linux, which talks to the hardware and directs
  the action, and the <i>user-space</i>, which is all the programs
  that you see and use: a shell, Explorer, programs to list
  directories, move files, read your mail, play games, and so
  on.</p>

  <p>On "free" operating systems, a sizeable proportion of the
  essential user-space &mdash; not the really high-level things
  like web browsers, but the basic stuff that gets the system up
  and running &mdash; comes from the GNU project, and it was these
  programs that I wanted to replace.</p>

  <p>Don't get me wrong. This wasn't an anti-GNU jihad. But someone
  had told me it wasn't possible, which was precisely the incentive
  I needed to get stuck into an idea I'd had a while ago.</p>

  <p>Any sensible person would use BSD code here -- the BSD project
  derived their utilities from de-commercialized sources of Unix,
  and evolved independently of GNU. But that would be easy. And it
  wouldn't be fun. If you're going to prove a point, do it with
  style. So I was going to do it with Perl.</p>

  <p>Now, I assume you've heard of the Perl Power Tools; if you
  haven't, you really want to check them out! PPT is a set of Perl
  programs, masterminded by Tom Christiansen, that implement many
  standard Unix utilities. They're the first thing (other than
  Perl, of course) I'll install when I'm working on a non-Unix
  computer, and you can grab your copy from <a href=
  "http://language.perl.com/ppt/" target=
  "resource window">http://language.perl.com/ppt/</a>.</p>

  <p>Now, with these, a fair amount of the work was done for me --
  a reasonable number of the utilities I wanted to replace had
  already been rewritten in Perl. So, I took an empty filesystem,
  picked the appropriate implementations and placed them in the
  appropriate directories. If the GNU project can get away with
  sitting atop a Linux kernel until they've finished writing their
  own, I think we can too. I don't have any plans to start a Perl
  kernel at present, but maybe after a few more arguments...</p>

  <p>Next, I compiled a statically linked <tt>perl</tt> executable;
  since that was necessary for everything to work and responsible
  for providing the Perl language to all the other programs, I
  decided to put it in <tt>/lib/</tt>, just like the C library.
  (You might see a file like <tt>/lib/libc-2.1.so</tt> in a Unix
  system, which provides all the standard functions of the C
  language to most of the programs written in C.)</p>

  <p>Of course, there doesn't need to be anything else in
  <tt>/lib/</tt> -- after all, I haven't written a dynamic linker
  in Perl yet. At three meg when stripped, <tt>/lib/perl</tt> is
  smaller than its <tt>libc</tt> counterpart.</p>

  <p>We need a shell, of course, so I used Gregor Purdy's Perl
  Shell, available from <a href=
  "http://www.focusresearch.com/gregor/psh/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.focusresearch.com/gregor/psh/</a>
  and hacked together a quick <tt>/sbin/init</tt> which did very
  little other than call it. <tt>init</tt> is the program the
  kernel calls when it starts to get the rest of the operating
  system going. Some day I should write a real <tt>init</tt>; it's
  boring being in single user mode all the time. [<i>The Perl Shell
  is introduced later in this issue. -- Editor</i>]</p>

  <p>I would like to be able to say it all worked fine first time,
  but it didn't. It took me quite a few attempts to get the Perl
  Shell talking to the Term::ReadLine modules properly, and I made
  a mess of the initial Perl installation. But it certainly booted,
  and there was a complete set of basic utilities available. After
  four or five tries getting all the modules in place, I had it
  working.</p>

  <p>At this point, it stopped being an attack of hubris, and I
  started to realize quite what I had here -- a basic operating
  system, completely Perl based. Amazingly portable: just replace
  one file and you can move to a different type of machine.
  Extremely lightweight: under twenty meg for a complete
  installation, which of course includes a full Perl install. And
  surprisingly fast; since everything depends on Perl, the Perl
  image stays in memory most of the time.</p>

  <p>Of course, there are a few problems. The biggest thing at the
  moment is a lack of applications. You're limited to what's been
  done in Perl. There's no windowing system and no console
  graphics. At the moment, there's no networking and no sound
  support either. It can't regenerate itself -- when the C
  compiler's written in C you can recompile it and upgrade it, but
  since Perl isn't (yet) written in Perl, you have to upgrade it on
  a computer that has C available.</p>

  <p>What's in the future for Perlix? Well, we need an
  <tt>init</tt> and some system configuration (rc) files -- all
  done in Perl, of course. The Bourne shell's nice and portable, I
  know, but a little inflexible and slow for this sort of system
  work. After that, my priorities are networking support and a
  <tt>login</tt>. These are the most operating-system-specific
  elements, and the most difficult to do; I've just finished a
  <tt>mount</tt> (<a href="tpj0502-0009a.html">Listing 1</a>),
  which allows us to mount <tt>/proc</tt> and examine the process
  table. I'm taking the opportunity to work in support for
  configuration files in XML as well as traditional Unix-style flat
  text: <tt>mount</tt> can read either a standard
  <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> or an XML equivalent.</p>

  <p>Then, I suppose, we can start getting a few applications
  together. <tt>telnet</tt>, <tt>ftp</tt>, and their friends are
  easily taken care of with the Net:: modules, and similar tactics
  can yield <tt>expect</tt>, <tt>gzip</tt>, and a few other Unix
  mainstays. This should allow us to get the CPAN module working as
  a standalone utility, allowing for much easier installation of
  other modules.</p>

  <p>A text-mode web browser in the style of <tt>lynx</tt> or
  <tt>w3m</tt> would be extremely welcome, and we're in desperate
  need of some text editors to allow future development to proceed
  on Perlix itself.</p>

  <p>Looking to the longer term, I'm about 10% of the way through a
  TeX distribution, although I'm not planning to provide METAFONT.
  We'll also need to think about password support and
  internationalization at some point.</p>

  <p>But for the time being, it works! I'll be using Perlix as the
  primary distribution on my laptop in a few months, although I
  will have some C libraries handy just in case.</p>

  <p>If this sounds like fun to you, please feel free to
  contribute. Download a copy of Perlix, and pick some applications
  to port. (Get in touch with me first to see if anyone else is
  doing the same thing, of course.) We also need some
  mind-bogglingly crazy people to consider writing a kernel;
  Claudio Clavelli has been working on a Linux filesystem written
  in Perl, which I hope to use eventually: you can find that at
  <tt><a href="http://www.assurdo.com/perlfs" target=
  "resource window">http://www.assurdo.com/perlfs</a></tt>.</p>

  <p>If you don't want to be quite so extreme, consider helping out
  with -- or at the very least, downloading and trying out -- the
  Perl Power Tools project I mentioned above; there's a natural
  link between the two, and I hope we can produce some work of
  mutual benefit. Alternately, you might want to join the Perl
  Shell development effort over at <a href=
  "http://www.sourceforge.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.sourceforge.com/</a>.</p>
