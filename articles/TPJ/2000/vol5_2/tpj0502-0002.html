  <p>Let's face it. <i>procmail</i> is horrid. But for most of us,
  it's the only sensible way to handle mail filtering. I used to
  tolerate <i>procmail</i>, with its grotesque syntax and its
  less-than-helpful error messages, because it was the only way I
  knew to separate out my mail. One day, however, I decided that
  I'd been told "delivery failed, couldn't get lock" or similar
  garbage for the very last time, and decided to sit down and write
  a <i>procmail</i> replacement.</p>

  <p>That's when it dawned on me that what I really disliked about
  <i>procmail</i> was the recipe format. I didn't want to handle my
  mail with a collection of colons, zeroes, and single-letter
  commands that made <tt>sendmail.cf</tt> look like a Shakespearean
  sonnet; I wanted to program my mail routing in a nice, high-level
  language. Something like Perl, for instance.</p>

  <p>The result is the astonishingly simple Mail::Audit module. In
  this article, we'll examine what we can do with Mail::Audit and
  how we can use it to create mail filters. We'll also look at the
  News::Gateway module for turning mailing lists into newsgroups
  and back again.</p>

  <h3>What Is It?</h3>

  <p>Mail::Audit itself isn't a mail filter - it's a toolkit that
  makes it very easy for you to build mail filters. You write a
  program that describes what should happen to your mail, and this
  replaces your <i>procmail</i> command in your <tt>.forward</tt>
  or <tt>.qmail</tt> file.</p>

  <p>Mail::Audit provides the functionality for extracting mail
  headers, bouncing, accepting, rejecting, forwarding, and
  filtering incoming mail.</p>

  <h3>A Very Simple Mail Filter</h3>

  <p>Here's the simplest filter program we can make with
  Mail::Audit.</p>
  <pre>
    use Mail::Audit;
    my $incoming = Mail::Audit-&gt;new;
    $incoming-&gt;reject;
</pre>

  <p>If you save this as <tt>~/bin/chuckmail</tt>, then you can put
  the following in a <tt>.forward</tt> file:</p>
  <pre>
    |~/bin/chuckmail
</pre>

  <p>or in a <tt>.qmail</tt> file:</p>
  <pre>
    preline ~/bin/chuckmail
</pre>

  <p>Every mail message you receive will now pass through this
  program. The mail comes into the program via standard input, and
  the <tt>new()</tt> method takes it from there and turns it into a
  Mail::Audit object:</p>
  <pre>
    my $incoming = Mail::Audit-&gt;new;
</pre>

  <p>Next, we bounce it as undeliverable:</p>
  <pre>
    $incoming-&gt;reject;
</pre>

  <p>We could even get fancy, and supply a reason with the
  bounce:</p>
  <pre>
$incoming-&gt;reject(&lt;&lt;EOF);
    The local user was silly enough to leave chuckmail as his
    mail filter.  Too bad you can't mail him to let him know.
EOF
</pre>

  <p>This reason will be relayed back to the sender as part of the
  bounce message.</p>

  <h3>Separating Mail Into Folders</h3>

  <p>The one thing most people use <i>procmail</i> for is to
  separate mail out into several mail folders. Here's an example of
  how we'd do this:</p>
  <pre>
    use Mail::Audit;
    my $item = Mail::Audit-&gt;new;

    if ($item-&gt;from =~ /perl5-porters/) {
        $item-&gt;accept("/home/simon/mail/p5p")
    }

    $item-&gt;accept;
</pre>

  <p>Now any mail with <tt>perl5-porters</tt> in the <tt>From:</tt>
  line will be added to the file <tt>mail/p5p</tt> under my home
  directory. Any other mail will be accepted into my inbox as
  normal.</p>

  <p>Two things to note here:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Once the mail has been filed to <tt>mail/p5p</tt> via
    <tt>accept()</tt>, it leaves the program. Game over, end of
    story. The same goes for the other methods such as
    <tt>reject()</tt>, <tt>pipe()</tt>, and <tt>bounce()</tt>.</li>

    <li>The last line in the program should probably be an
    <tt>accept()</tt> call; mail that reaches the end of the
    program without being deposited in a mailbox or rejected will
    be silently ignored. (This may change to an implicit
    <tt>accept()</tt> in a later version, to be more
    <i>procmail</i>-like.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you've got a few mailing lists or people you want to
  filter, you could do this:</p>
  <pre>
  use Mail::Audit;
  my $item    = Mail::Audit-&gt;new;
  my $maildir = "/home/simon/mail/";

  my %lists = (
      perl5-porters    =&gt; "p5p",
      helixcode        =&gt; "gnome",
      uclinux          =&gt; "uclinux",
      'infobot\.org'   =&gt; "infobot",
      '@dion\.ne\.jp'  =&gt; "yamachan"
  );

  for my $pattern (keys %lists) {
      $item-&gt;accept($maildir.$lists{$pattern})
          if $item-&gt;from =~ /$pattern/ 
             or $item-&gt;to =~ /$pattern/;
  }

  $item-&gt;accept;
</pre>

  <p>This time, we perform a regular expression match to see if
  either the <tt>From:</tt> line or the <tt>To:</tt> line match any
  of the patterns in our hash keys, and if they do, direct the mail
  to the corresponding folder. Since we're using ordinary Perl
  regular expressions, we can do this sort of thing:</p>
  <pre>
  '\bxxx.*\.com$'  =&gt; "spam"
</pre>

  <p>(And you'd be surprised at quite how much junk mail that one
  traps.)</p>

  <p>Here's another simple but remarkably effective spamtrap
  recipe:</p>
  <pre>
  $item-&gt;accept("questionable")
      if $item-&gt;from !~ /simon/i and $item-&gt;cc !~ /simon/i;
</pre>

  <p>We check the <tt>From:</tt> and <tt>CC:</tt> headers for my
  name, and if it's not in either - the mail probably isn't to me.
  This one only makes sense after we've filtered out mailing list
  messages, which could validly be sent from a subscriber to a
  generic list address.</p>

  <h3>Mail and News</h3>

  <p>I much prefer reading mailing lists as newsgroups; while a
  good mail client like <i>mutt</i> can display mail as threaded
  discussions, I personally prefer navigating in a newsreader. So,
  how do we gate mailing lists to newsgroups and back? Russ
  Allbery's News::Gateway module helps do just that - it provides a
  program called <i>listgate</i> which takes an incoming mailing
  list message, reformats it as a valid news article, and then
  posts it to the news server. We can plug this into our mail
  filter quite easily; assuming we've got the group
  <tt>lists.p5p</tt> set up on the local news server and we've
  configured listgate appropriately, we can just say:</p>
  <pre>
  $item-&gt;pipe("listgate p5p") if $item-&gt;from =~ /perl5-porters/;
</pre>

  <p>Again, if we've got multiple groups, we can use a hash to
  correlate patterns to groups as we did with mailing lists
  above.</p>

  <p>So much for getting incoming mail to news - what about getting
  posted articles back into the mailing list? The key to this is in
  the newsgroup moderation system - when you post to a moderated
  newsgroup, the article is mailed to a moderator for approval. If
  we set the moderator of <tt>lists.p5p</tt> to the list address,
  we can get our outgoing posts sent to the list. In
  <tt>/usr/news/etc/moderators</tt>, you'd say</p>
  <pre>
    lists.p5p:  perl5-porters@perl.org
</pre>

  <p>Very easy. The only problem is that it doesn't work. Mail
  messages and news articles have a slightly different format, and
  some mailing list managers will reject mail messages that look
  like news articles. So we need to send our message through a
  clean-up phase first. Instead of sending it to
  <tt>perl5-porters@perl.org</tt>, we'll instead send it to
  <tt>news-outgoing@localhost</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
    lists.*:    news-outgoing@localhost
</pre>

  <p>Mail arriving at that account needs to go through another Perl
  program to clean up and dispatch the outgoing article, and that
  looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use News::Gateway;
    my $gw=News::Gateway-&gt;new(0);
    $gw-&gt;modules( 'newstomail', 'headers');
    $gw-&gt;config_line("newstomail /home/simon/bin/news2mail.h");
    $gw-&gt;config_line("header newsgroups drop");
    $gw-&gt;config_line("header organisation drop");
    $gw-&gt;config_line("header nntp-posting-host drop");
    $gw-&gt;read(*STDIN) or die $!;
    $gw-&gt;apply();
    $gw-&gt;mail();
</pre>

  <p>This reads an article from standard input, drops the
  <tt>Newsgroups</tt>, <tt>Organisation</tt>, and
  <tt>NNTP-Posting-Host</tt> headers, reformats it as a mail
  message using the configuration file
  <tt>/home/simon/bin/news2mail.h</tt> to find the address, and
  then sends it. That config file is just a list of newsgroups and
  the addresses they belong to:</p>
  <pre>
    lists.p5p perl5-porters@perl.org
    lists.tlug tlug@tlug.gr.jp
    lists.advocacy advocacy@perl.org
    lists.linux-kernel linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu
    lists.perl-friends perl-friends@perlsupport.com
</pre>

  <p>So here's the recipe for filtering news to mail and back
  again:</p>

  <p>&bull; Incoming messages</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>will be trapped by a rule in your mail filter, and be piped
    to <tt>listgate</tt> via a line like</p>
    <pre>
    $item-&gt;pipe("listgate p5p")
                if $item-&gt;from =~ /perl5-porters/;
</pre>

    <p><tt>listgate</tt> will then post them to your news server,
    to the group <tt>lists.p5p</tt>.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&bull; Outgoing articles</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>will be sent to the moderator address,
    <tt>news-outgoing@localhost</tt> for cleanup. The cleanup
    program will drop unnecessary headers, reformat as a mail
    message, and then look at the configuration file to determine
    where to send them on. They'll be sent to the mailing list, and
    sometime later will be returned to you by mail, to appear in
    the newsgroup as above.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>A Complete Filter</h3>

  <p>Here, to show off exactly what I do with Mail::Audit, is a
  suitably anonymized and annotated version of the filter I
  currently use to process my incoming mail.</p>
  <pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use Mail::Audit;
    $folder = "/home/simon/mail/";
</pre>

  <p>Anything that actually reaches me is going to be logged so
  that I can <tt>tail -f</tt> a summary of incoming mail to one of
  my terminals.</p>
  <pre>
    open (LOG, "&gt;/home/simon/.audit_log");
</pre>

  <p>Read in the new mail message, and extract the important
  headers from it:</p>
  <pre>
    my $item = Mail::Audit-&gt;new;
    my $from = $item-&gt;from();
    study $from;
    my $to = $item-&gt;to();
    my $cc = $item-&gt;cc();
    my $subject = $item-&gt;subject();
    chomp($from, $to, $subject);
</pre>

  <p>If I'm likely to be at the office, I appreciate a copy of all
  mail I receive, in case there's something I need to deal with
  immediately. So I need <i>time-controlled</i> filtering. Try
  doing this with <i>procmail</i>:</p>
  <pre>
    my ($hour, $wday) = (localtime)[2,6];
    if ($wday !=0 and $wday !=6         # Not Saturday/Sunday
        and $hour &gt; 9 and $hour &lt; 18) { # Between 9am and 6pm
        print LOG "$subject: $from: Bouncing to work\n";
        $item-&gt;resend('simon@theoffice.com');
        # resend is the only action
        # which doesn't end the program.
    }
</pre>

  <p>One of my users didn't have their own email address for a
  while, so they had their friends send mail to me instead. Now
  they have their own address, so the mail is bounced across to
  them:</p>
  <pre>
    $item-&gt;bounce('ei@somewhere.com') if $subject =~ /^For Ei:/;
</pre>

  <p>I maintain two FAQs: the perl5-porters FAQ and the Tokyo high
  speed connectivity FAQ. The mail comes to different email
  addresses, but it all ends up at my box. They need to go in
  separate folders.</p>
  <pre>
    $item-&gt;accept("$folder/p5p-faq")   if $to=~ /p5p-faq/;
    $item-&gt;accept("$folder/tokyo-faq") if $to=~ /faq/;
</pre>

  <p>I get some mail in Greek which needs to be processed with
  <tt>metamail</tt> to sort out the character sets. The pipe method
  squirts the mail to a separate program:</p>
  <pre>
    $item-&gt;pipe("metamail -B -x &gt; $folder/greek")
                                if $from =~/hri\.org$/;
</pre>

  <p>Some people I definitely want to hear from, so they get
  accepted at this stage to save time:</p>
  <pre>
    for (qw(goodguy dormouse locust)) {
        if ($from =~ /$_/) {
            print LOG "$from:$subject:Exception, 
                                accepting into inbox\n";
            $item-&gt;accept;
        }
    }
</pre>

  <p>Some people I very definitely do not want to hear from:</p>
  <pre>
    for (qw(badguy nasty enemy)) {
        if ($from =~ /$_/) {
            print LOG "$from:$subject:Dumped\n";
            $item-&gt;reject("Go away! Stop emailing me!");
        }
    }
</pre>

  <p>Some people or mailing lists I currently just don't have time
  for, so they get silently ignored:</p>
  <pre>
    for (qw(freshmeat.net microsoft news\@myhost cron)) {
        if ($from =~ /$_/) {
            print LOG "$from:$subject:Ignored\n";
            $item-&gt;ignore;
        }
    }
</pre>

  <p>Some mailing lists I want to stay as lists:</p>
  <pre>
    my %lists = (
        "pound.perl.org"      =&gt; "purl",
        "helixcode"           =&gt; "gnome",
        "uclinux"             =&gt; "uclinux",
        "infobot"             =&gt; "infobot",
        "european-"           =&gt; "yapc",
        "tpm\@otherside"      =&gt; "tpm",
        "hellenic"            =&gt; "greeknews",
    );
    for my $what (keys %lists) {
        next unless $from =~ /$what/i or 
                        $to =~ /$what/i or $cc =~/$what/i;
        my $where = $lists{$what};
        print LOG "$from:$subject:List, 
                        accepting to folder $where\n";
        $item-&gt;accept($folder.$where);
    }
</pre>

  <p>And some I want to pipe to <tt>listgate</tt> as
  newsgroups:</p>
  <pre>
    my %gated = (
        "tlug"        =&gt; "tlug",
        "advocacy"    =&gt; "advocacy",
        "security-sig"        =&gt; "security",
        "iss.net"     =&gt; "security",
        "securityfocus"       =&gt; "security",
        "perl5-porters"       =&gt; "p5p",
        "linux-kernel"        =&gt; "linux-kernel",
        "perlsupport" =&gt; "perl-friends",
    );

    for my $what (keys %gated) {
        next unless $from =~ /$what/i or 
                        $to =~ /$what/i or $cc =~/$what/i;
        my $where=$gated{$what};
        print LOG "$from:$subject:Gated to lists.$where\n";
        $item-&gt;pipe("/usr/local/bin/listgate $where");
    }
</pre>

  <p>Some spammers just don't give up, so we actually reject their
  messages. We do this based on subject, which is a bit risky but
  seems to work:</p>
  <pre>
    for ("Invest", "nude asian"))  {
        $item-&gt;reject("No! Go away!")
                                if $subject=~/\b$_\b/;
    }
</pre>

  <p>Before we let the article in to the inbox, there's a long list
  of patterns at the end of the program which match known spam
  senders. We check the incoming mail against this list, and save
  it for analysis and reporting:</p>
  <pre>
    while (&lt;DATA&gt;) {
        chomp;
        next unless $from =~ /$_/i or $to =~ /$_/i;
        print LOG "$from:$subject:Spam?\n";
        $item-&gt;accept($folder."spam");
    }
</pre>

  <p>Now our final check for mail which doesn't appear to be for
  us:</p>
  <pre>
    if ($item-&gt;from !~ /simon/i and $item-&gt;cc !~ /simon/i) {
        print LOG "$from:$subject:Badly addressed mail\n";
        $item-&gt;accept("questionable")
    }
</pre>

  <p>Finally, we let the mail in:</p>
  <pre>
    print LOG "INCOMING MAIL:$from:$subject:
                        Accepting to inbox\n";
    $item-&gt;accept();
</pre>

  <h3>Caveats</h3>

  <p>I'm perfectly happy to trust Mail::Audit with all my incoming
  email. For a while it was running alongside <i>procmail</i>, but
  now it rules the roost. However, there are some things which you
  do need to take care about if you want to run it yourself.</p>

  <p>Mail::Audit has been tested on <tt>qmail</tt> and
  <tt>postfix</tt> - it should work fine on other MTAs (Message
  Transfer Agents), so long as they believe that <tt>exit 100</tt>;
  means reject. If they don't, you can override the <tt>reject</tt>
  method like this:</p>
  <pre>
    $item = Mail::Audit-&gt;new(
            reject =&gt; sub { exit 67; }
    );
</pre>

  <p>It also assumes that the default mailbox is
  <tt>/var/spool/mail/name</tt> where <tt>name</tt> is user ID of
  the current user. If this isn't the case, (I believe <tt>mh</tt>
  doesn't work like this) say <tt>accept("Mailbox")</tt> or
  override <tt>accept</tt> with a subroutine of your own.</p>

  <p>Finally, Mail::Audit isn't sophisticated. It's little other
  than a wrapper around Mail::Internet. While it's probably
  perfectly fine for most filters you want to write, don't expect
  it to do everything for you.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>Mail::Audit and News::Gateway are both available from CPAN;
  together they allow you to very easily construct mail filters and
  newsgroup gateways in Perl. It's a great way to filter your mail
  with Perl, and an excellent replacement for moldy old
  <i>procmail</i>.</p>_ _END_ _<br>
