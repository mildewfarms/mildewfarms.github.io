  <h3>On Deck</h3>

  <p>It is official: <b>Perl 5.6</b> is out and in use around the
  known universe. There are not a lot of new features for the
  average user, but there are a ton of enhancements under the
  hood.</p>

  <p><b>ActiveState</b> has been busy, most notably with its
  release of <b>ActivePerl 5.6</b>, which is now available not only
  for Win32/x86 platforms, but for Linux/x86 and Solaris/SPARC as
  well. Microsoft is bundling ActivePerl 5.6 in its <b>Services for
  Unix 2.0</b>, too.</p>

  <p>As I write this, the <b>Perl Whirl</b>, an Alaskan cruise and
  mini-Perl conference rolled into one, has set sail; hackers are
  making ready to converge on <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b> in
  Pittsburgh for yet <b>another perl conference 19100</b> in June;
  and others are registering for the <b>O'Reilly Open Source
  Software Convention and Perl Conference 4.0</b> in Monterey, CA
  in July.</p>

  <p>One event that has already taken place this year is the
  <b>Second German Perl Workshop</b>, held May 8-10, 2000 at
  Bonn-Rhein-Seig in Sankt Augustin, Germany. About 100 people
  attended, paying only a nominal fee (as with yapc). Next year's
  event is scheduled for February 28 to March 2, and all the
  information about it can be found at <a href=
  "http://www.perl-workshop.de/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl-workshop.de/</a>.</p>

  <p>A year-long event in the USA is the <b>U.S. Census</b>, the
  constitutionally mandated decennial tabulation of the population
  living in each part of the country. In a note to the Perl
  advocacy mailing list, Lisa Nyman of the U.S. Census Bureau wrote
  that "the Census 2000 Internet Form is a great example of a
  government agency implementing essential (Constitutional even)
  operations with Perl." Find out more at <a href=
  "http://www.2000.census.gov/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.2000.census.gov/</a>.</p>

  <p>In March, Chip Salzenberg, Perl Pumpking for maintenance
  versions 5.004 and 5.005, started a kinder, gentler mailing list
  for discussion of Perl, <a href=
  "mailto:perl-friends@perlsupport.com">perl-friends@perlsupport.com</a>.
  "Perl-Friends is a mailing list about everything Perl. It has
  only one hard and fast rule: Verbal abuse will not be
  tolerated."</p>

  <p>Along similar lines, a new web site for discussion of Perl
  news and issues is online: <b>use Perl</b>, at <a href=
  "http://use.perl.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://use.perl.org/</a>. It's built on the
  <b>Slash</b> engine (from Slashdot) and shares the same news as
  the <b>Perl News</b> site, but with additional stories about
  issues and advocacy and whatever else might have some interest to
  the readers, as well as headlines from other related sites.</p>

  <p>Many web sites these days (including the aforementioned Perl
  News and use Perl sites) distribute <b>RSS</b> (Rich Site
  Summary) files with the latest headlines, stories, posts, and so
  on. Now <b>CPAN Search</b> can be added to the list; you can find
  recent uploads to CPAN at the URL <a href=
  "http://search.cpan.org/recent.rdf" target=
  "resource window">http://search.cpan.org/recent.rdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Damian Conway, the Mad Scientist of Perl and author of the
  <b>Coy</b> module, along with fellow judges Elaine Ashton and
  Mark-Jason Dominus, started a Perl Haiku Contest, at <a href=
  "http://history.perl.org/CHI/" target=
  "resource window">http://history.perl.org/CHI/</a>, with winners
  to be announced at the O'Reilly Perl Conference 4.0.</p>

  <p>Some new Perl books are being published, as usual. For the
  Win32 set, published by <b>Wiley</b>, there's Tobias Martinsson's
  <b>ActivePerl with ASP and ADO</b>, a guide to using PerlScript
  (the ActiveX scripting engine from ActiveState), focusing on
  Active Server Pages and ActiveX Data Objects. <b>Wrox</b> Press
  has Simon Cozens' <b>Beginning Perl</b>, looking to satisfy the
  needs of novices.</p>

  <p>O'Reilly is publishing <b>Perl for System Administration</b>
  by David N. Blank-Edelman and a second edition of <b>CGI
  Programming with Perl</b> by Scott Guelich, Shishir Gundavaram,
  and Gunther Birznieks. O'Reilly has also put its <b>Web Client
  Programming with Perl</b>, by Clinton Wong, online at <a href=
  "http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/webclient/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/webclient/</a>.</p>

  <p>Also coming out from O'Reilly are third editions of Johan
  Vromans' <b>Perl 5 Pocket Reference</b> and the Camel itself,
  <b>Programming Perl</b>, by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, and Jon
  Orwant, with new and updated content for Perl 5.6.</p>

  <h3>In The Bullpen</h3>

  <p>ActiveState is branching out a bit from Perl these days. The
  company is working on ports of Perl and Python to the
  <b>Itanium</b> (IA-64) processor, Intel's next-generation chip.
  They've also announced <b>Komodo</b>, a cross-platform
  development environment for Perl and Python built on
  <b>Mozilla</b>, the open source browser and application framework
  from <b>Netscape</b>. This will involve creating Perl bindings to
  the Mozilla API. ActiveState is also working with <b>Sendmail</b>
  to embed Perl into the Sendmail API.</p>

  <p>Since we have Perl everywhere, we need a Perl shell to run it
  from, right? Greg Purdy's <b>psh</b> might fit our needs here. It
  is in development; see <a href=
  "http://www.focusresearch.com/%20gregor/psh/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.focusresearch.com/ gregor/psh/</a>
  for more information, or the article later in this issue.</p>

  <p>Purdy also wrote <b>Lip::Pod</b>, bringing Literate
  Programming - Donald Knuth's concept that source code and its
  documentation should be combined in a coherent whole - to Perl.
  <b>Lip::Pod</b> uses Brad Appleton's <b>Pod::Parser</b>, which is
  now included with the Perl distribution.</p>

  <p>Speaking of Knuth and pod, Tim Jenness has written
  <b>Pod::LaTeX</b> and <b>pod2latex</b> for converting pod
  documents into LaTeX. Alan Fry's <b>pod2pdf</b> at <a href=
  "http://www.afco.demon.co.uk/xplat.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.afco.demon.co.uk/xplat.html</a>
  turns pod into Adobe's PDF (Portable Document Format).</p>

  <p>Mark Summerfield wrote <b>Image::Xbm</b> and
  <b>Image::Xpm</b>, and a related class, <b>Image::Base</b>, for
  loading, manipulating, and saving images. Martien Verbruggen's
  <b>GDtextUtil</b> distribution includes modules for working with
  text and the <b>GD</b> module.</p>

  <p>J. David Lowe penned the fun <b>HTML::Munger</b> for creating
  HTML filters. It was first written to create the Pootifier,
  online at http://pootpoot.com/?pootify. <b>HTML::TableExtract</b>
  by Matt Sisk, unsurprisingly, extracts data from HTML tables.</p>

  <p>Benjamin Franz's <b>CGI::Minimal</b> is a lightweight
  alternative to the <b>CGI</b> module distributed with Perl.
  <b>HTTP::BrowserDetect</b>, by Lee Semel, does a number of tests
  on the <tt>HTTP_USER_AGENT</tt> string to guess which browser a
  user is using.</p>

  <p>Bunches of modules are on CPAN for SAX, the Simple API for
  XML. Michael Koehne's <b>XML::Handler::YAWriter</b> is Yet
  Another SAX writer, and his <b>XML::Filter::Hekeln</b> is a SAX
  filter.</p>

  <p>Jochen Wiedmann's <b>XML::EP</b> is a framework for publishing
  XML documents, based on Cocoon. Matt Sergeant wrote AxKit, the
  Apache XML Delivery Toolkit, for delivering XML-based content to
  all kinds of web clients.</p>

  <p>As usual, lots of new Apache modules are out. J. David Lowe's
  <b>Apache::Backhand</b> forms a bridge between mod_perl and
  mod_backhand, and Geoffrey Young's <b>Apache::DebugInfo</b>
  provides debugging info on a per-request basis. Young's
  <b>Apache::RequestNotes</b> passes form and cookie data in
  pnotes, and his <b>Apache::Wrapper</b> provides a simple
  framework for creating uniform, template driven content.</p>

  <p>Stas Bekman wrote <b>Apache::GTopLimit</b> for limiting the
  number of Apache processes. <b>Apache::TicketAccess</b>, from
  Michael Schout, is a module for cookie-based authentication.
  Lincoln Stein's <b>Apache::MP3</b> generates browsable
  directories of MP3 files and playlists for them, and can stream
  those files. The version of <b>Apache::MP3</b> on CPAN is
  substantially different from the one described in Stein's article
  in TPJ #16; see the documentation for more information.</p>

  <p>Stein also released <b>MP3::Napster</b>, for fetching files
  from the controversial MP3 exchange service (described in TPJ
  #17), and <b>Bundle::MP3</b>, which includes several MP3-related
  modules. <b>MPEG::MP3Info</b>, a module providing basic
  information about an MP3 file, was renamed to <b>MP3::Info</b>.
  Similarly, Sander van Zoest's <b>MPEG::ID3v1Tag</b> was renamed
  to <b>MP3::ID3v1Tag</b>.</p>

  <p>Mike Blazer wrote <b>Crypt::CBCeasy</b> for easier access to
  <b>Crypt::CBC</b>. Marc Lehmann's Crypt::Twofish2 is a
  <b>Crypt::CBC-compliant</b> implementation of the twofish cipher.
  Ashish Gulhati's <b>Crypt::PGP5</b> provides access to PGP 5.</p>

  <p>The Perl interface to GnuPG (an open source alternative to
  PGP) was written by Frank J. Tobin, called
  <b>PGP::GPG::MessageProcessor</b>. Finding that package was "too
  inextensible to carry on further," Tobin rewrote it as
  <b>GnuPG::Interface</b>.</p>

  <p>Kevin Meltzer's Untaint detects and launders tainted data.</p>

  <p>Abigail's <b>Algorithm::Numerical::Shuffle</b> performs a one
  pass, fair shuffle on a list.</p>

  <p><b>Statistics::Distributions</b>, by Michael Kospach,
  calculates critical values of common statistical
  distributions.</p>

  <p>Randy Kobes' <b>Math::Cephes</b> is an interface to the cephes
  math library. John Peacock wrote <b>Math::FixedPrecision</b> for
  decimal math without floating point errors. <b>Math::Logic</b>
  from Mark Summerfield provides pure binary, trinary, or
  multi-value logic.</p>

  <p>Graham Barr wrote <b>Convert::ASN1</b> to encode and decode
  ASN.1 data structures using BER/DER rules, as a replacement to
  his <b>Convert::BER</b> module.</p>

  <p>Ned Konz wrote <b>Archive::Zip</b> to create, read, write, and
  manipulate Zip archive files.</p>

  <p>Until now, you couldn't easily control those cool little Lego
  MindStorms with Perl. Enter John C. Quillan and his
  <b>LEGO::RCX</b> for controlling a MindStorms RCX brick.</p>

  <p>Michael Schwern, always coming up with something to make us
  scratch our heads, wrote Sex, which creates a new package based
  on the symbols available in two (or more) other packages.</p>

  <p><b>Befunge::Interpreter</b> by Joshua Harding interprets
  Befunge programs (those literally and figuratively twisted
  programs demonstrated in Chris Howe's grand-prize-winning
  Obfuscated Perl Contest entry from TPJ #15).</p>

  <p>Ariel Brosh wrote a MUMPS to Perl compiler, called Mumps. Greg
  London's <b>Hardware::Verilog::Parser</b> uses
  <b>Parse::RecDescent</b> to parse Verilog code.</p>

  <p>Dan Campbell wrote <b>String::RexxParse</b> to provide REXX's
  template-based text parsing capabilities to Perl.</p>

  <p>Barrie Slaymaker's <b>Regexp::Shellish</b> provides shell-like
  regular expressions. <b>Regex::PreSuf</b> from Jarkko Hietaniemi
  creates regular expressions to match a given list of words. Marc
  Lehmann's String::Similarity calculates the similarity of two
  strings.</p>

  <p>Les Howard's <b>Number::Spell</b> spells out numbers. Kim
  Ryan's <b>Lingua::EN::Fathom</b> provides readability and general
  measurements of English text, including the Fog and Flesch
  Kincaid indices. <b>Lingua::Ident</b>, from Michael Piotrowski,
  attempts to statistically identify what language text is written
  in.</p>

  <p>Ryan also wrote <b>Locale::RegionAbbrev</b> to convert to and
  from region abbreviations for states, counties, and provinces in
  the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and
  <b>Locale::SubCountry</b> to convert to and from country names
  and their commonly used postal codes.</p>

  <p>LinePrinter is an interface to the lpd printer utility by
  Chris Fuhrman.</p>

  <p>Jamie McCarthy's <b>Tie::CacheHash</b> maintains sorted lists
  of top entries in a hash. Brent B. Powers wrote
  Memoize::ExpireLRU to expire least-recently used elements from a
  Memoize cache.</p>

  <p>DeWitt Clinton's <b>File::Cache</b> allows processes to
  communicate via the filesystem. Sam Tregar's
  <b>IPC::SharedCache</b> manages a cache in SysV shared
  memory.</p>

  <p><b>IPC::Session</b>, from Steve Traugott, encapsulates open3()
  and provides a persistent remote shell session object, suitable
  for calling ssh. Mmmmm.</p>

  <p>Barrie Slaymaker's Eesh is an interface to the Enlightenment
  Window Manager IPC Library. Dermot Musgrove's Glade-Perl
  distribution is an interface to Glade, the GTK+ user interface
  builder.</p>

  <p>Ian Robertson's <b>Solaris::ACL</b> provides access to Solaris
  access control lists for files.</p>

  <p><b>Mail::Audit</b> creates mail filters without having to
  resort to procmail, thanks to Simon Cozens (and described later
  in this issue). Adam Spiers wrote <b>Mail::Field::Received</b> to
  parse Received headers in mail messages.</p>

  <p><b>Net::DLookup</b> does lookups on 410 different two- and
  three-letter top-level domains. <b>Net::Syslog</b> from Lee
  Howard sends syslog messages to a remote syslogd.</p>

  <p>Hajimu Umemoto's Socket6 brings IPv6 support to Perl.</p>

  <p><b>DBD::RAM</b>, by Jeff Zucker, allows DBI access to Perl
  data structures, which can be especially useful for prototyping.
  DBD::RAM is used by a new project by some folks from the DBI
  mailing list, a SQL server written in Perl called Anubis. It is
  still early in development; check out PerlDB on SourceForge for
  more information (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/" target=
  "resource window">http://sourceforge.net/</a>).</p>

  <p><b>DBIx::KwIndex</b> by Steven Haryanto creates and maintains
  keyword indices in DBI tables. Jason McIntosh's
  <b>DBIx::Schema</b> is a module for working with schemas. Simon
  Matthews' <b>Template::Plugin::DBI</b> is a plugin for the
  Template module for making DBI calls.</p>

  <p>In the world of Windows, Mike Blazer wrote
  <b>Win32::DriveInfo</b> to get information about a disk drive and
  <b>Win32::RASE</b> for managing dialup entries and network
  connections, implementing the client API for Win32 RAS.
