  <p>In <a href="../vol5_1/ewtoc.html">TPJ #17</a>, Ken
  MacFarlane's article <i>Parsing HTML with HTML::Parser</i>
  describes how the HTML::Parser module scans HTML source as a
  stream of start tags, end tags, text, comments, and so on. In
  <a href="../vol5_2/ewtoc.html">TPJ #18</a>, my <i>Trees</i>
  article kicked around the idea of tree-shaped data structures.
  Now I'll tie it together by discussing trees of HTML.</p>

  <p>The CPAN module HTML::TreeBuilder takes the tags that
  HTML::Parser extracts, and builds a <i>parse tree</i> -- a
  tree-shaped network of objects representing the structured
  content of an HTML document.(And if you need a quick explanation
  of objects, see my <a href="../vol5_1/ewtoc.html">TPJ #17</a>
  article <i>A User's View of Object-Oriented Modules</i>, or go
  whole hog and get Damian Conway&rsquo;s excellent book
  <i>Object-Oriented Perl</i>, from Manning Publications.) Once the
  document is parsed as a tree, you'll find the common tasks of
  extracting data from that HTML document/tree to be quite
  straightforward.</p>

  <h3>HTML::Parser, HTML::TreeBuilder, and HTML::Element</h3>

  <p>HTML::TreeBuilder can construct a parse tree out of an HTML
  source file simply by saying:</p>
  <pre>
  use HTML::TreeBuilder;
  my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new();
  $tree-&gt;parse_file('foo.html');
</pre>

  <p><tt>$tree</tt> now contains a parse tree built from the HTML
  in <tt>foo.html</tt>. The parse tree is represented as a network
  of objects -- <tt>$tree</tt> is the root, an element with tag
  name <tt>html</tt>. Its children typically include <tt>head</tt>
  and <tt>body</tt> elements, and so on. Each element in the tree
  is an object of the class HTML::Element.</p>

  <p>So, if you take this source:</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Doc 1&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  Stuff &lt;hr&gt; 2000-08-17
  &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

  <p>and feed it to HTML::TreeBuilder, it'll return a tree of
  objects that looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
               html
             /      \
         head        body
        /          /  |  \
     title    "Stuff"  hr  "2000-08-17"
       |
    "Doc 1"
</pre>

  <p>This is a pretty simple document. If it were any more complex,
  it'd be a bit hard to draw in that style, since it sprawls left
  and right. The same tree can be represented a bit more easily
  sideways, with indenting:</p>
  <pre>
&#13;  &bull; html
     &bull; head
        &bull; title
           &bull; "Doc 1"
     &bull; body
        &bull; "Stuff"
        &bull; hr
        &bull; "2000-08-17"
</pre>

  <p>Both representations express the same structure. The root node
  is an object of the class HTML::Element,(Actually, the root is of
  the class HTML::TreeBuilder, but that's just a subclass of
  HTML::Element, plus a few extra methods like
  <tt>parse_file</tt>.) with the tag name <tt>html</tt>, and with
  two children: an HTML::Element object whose tag names are
  <tt>head</tt> and <tt>body</tt>. And each of those elements have
  children, and so on down. Not all elements have children -- the
  <tt>hr</tt> element doesn't, for instance. And not all nodes in
  the tree are elements -- the text nodes ("<tt>Doc 1</tt>",
  "<tt>Stuff</tt>", and "<tt>2000-08-17</tt>") are just
  strings.</p>

  <p>Objects of the class HTML::Element have three noteworthy
  attributes:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><tt>_tag</tt>, best accessed as <tt>$element-&gt;tag</tt>.
    The element's tag name, lowercased (e.g., <tt>em</tt> for an
    <tt>EM</tt> element).(Yes, this is misnamed. In proper SGML
    lingo, this is instead called a <tt>GI</tt> (short for "generic
    identifier") and the term "tag" is used for a token of SGML
    source that represents either the start of an element (a start
    tag like "<tt>&lt;em lang='fr'&gt;</tt>") or the end of an
    element (an end tag like "<tt>&lt;/em&gt;</tt>"). However,
    since more people claim to have been abducted by aliens than to
    have ever seen the SGML standard, and since both encounters
    typically involve a feeling of "missing time", it's not
    surprising that the terminology of the SGML standard is not
    closely followed.)<br>
    <br></li>

    <li><tt>_parent</tt>, best accessed as
    <tt>$element-&gt;parent</tt>. The element that is the element's
    parent, or <tt>undef</tt> if this element is the root.<br>
    <br></li>

    <li><tt>_content</tt>, best accessed as
    <tt>$element-&gt;content_list</tt>. The list of nodes (i.e.,
    elements or text segments) that are the element's
    children.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Moreover, if an element has any attributes, those are readable
  as <tt>$element-&gt;attr('name')</tt> -- for example, with the
  object built from <tt>&lt;a
  <b>id='foo'</b>&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;</tt>, the method call
  <tt>$element-&gt;attr('id')</tt> returns the string <tt>foo</tt>.
  Furthermore, <tt>$element-&gt;tag</tt> on that object returns the
  string a, <tt>$element-&gt;content_list</tt> returns a list
  consisting of just the single scalar <tt>bar</tt>, and
  <tt>$element-&gt;parent</tt> method returns the parent of this
  node -- which might be, for example, a <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
  element.</p>

  <p>And that's all that there is to it -- you throw HTML source at
  TreeBuilder, and it returns a tree of HTML::Element objects and
  some text strings.</p>

  <p>However, what do you <i>do</i> with a tree of objects? People
  code information into HTML trees not for the fun of arranging
  elements, but to represent the structure of specific text and
  images -- some text is in this <tt>li</tt> element, some other
  text is in that heading, some images are in this table cell with
  those attributes, and so on.</p>

  <p>Now, it may happen that you're rendering that whole HTML tree
  into some layout format. Or you could be trying to make some
  systematic change to the HTML tree before dumping it out as HTML
  source again. But in my experience, the most common programming
  task that Perl programmers face with HTML is trying to extract
  some piece of information from a larger document. Since that's so
  common (and also since it involves concepts required for more
  complex tasks), that is what the rest of this article will be
  about.</p>

  <h3>Scanning HTML trees</h3>

  <p>Suppose you have a thousand HTML documents, each of them a
  press release. They all start out:</p>
  <pre>
[...lots of leading images and junk...]
&lt;h1&gt;ConGlomCo to Open New Corporate Office in Ougadougou&lt;/h1&gt;
BAKERSFIELD, CA, 2000-04-24 -- ConGlomCo's vice president in
charge of world conquest, Rock Feldspar, announced today the
opening of a new office in Ougadougou, the capital city of
Burkina Faso, gateway to the bustling "Silicon Sahara" of
Africa...
[...etc...]
</pre>

  <p>What you've got to do is: For each document, copy whatever
  text is in the <tt>h1</tt> element, so that you can make a table
  of its contents. Now, there are three ways to do this:</p>

  <p>&bull; You can just use a regex to scan the file for a text
  pattern.</p>

  <blockquote>
    For simple tasks, this will be fine. Many HTML documents are,
    in practice, very consistently formatted with respect to
    placement of linebreaks and whitespace, so you could just get
    away with scanning the file like so:
    <pre>
  sub get_heading {
      my $filename = $_[0];
      local *HTML;
      open(HTML, $filename)
        or die "Couldn't open $filename);
      my $heading;
    Line:
      while (&lt;HTML&gt;) {
          if( <b>m{&lt;h1&gt;(.*?)&lt;/h1&gt;}i</b> ) {
              $heading = $1;
              last Line;
          }
      }
      close(HTML);
      warn "No heading in $filename?"
        unless defined $heading;
      return $heading;
  }
</pre>This is quick, fast, and fragile -- if there's a newline in
the middle of a heading's text, it won't match the above regex, and
you'll get an error. The regex will also fail if the <tt>h1</tt>
element's start tag has any attributes. If you have to adapt your
code to fit more kinds of start tags, you'll end up basically
reinventing part of HTML::Parser, at which point you should
probably just stop and use HTML::Parser itself.
  </blockquote>

  <p>&bull; You can use HTML::Parser to scan the file for an
  <tt>h1</tt> start tag token and capture all the text tokens until
  the <tt>h1</tt> end tag. This approach is extensively covered in
  Ken MacFarlane's <a href="../vol5_1/ewtoc.html">TPJ #17</a>
  article <i>Parsing HTML with HTML::Parser</i>. (A variant of this
  approach is to use HTML::TokeParser, which presents a different
  and handier interface to the tokens that HTML::Parser
  extracts.)</p>

  <blockquote>
    Using HTML::Parser is less fragile than our first approach,
    since it is insensitive to the exact internal formatting of the
    start tag (much less whether it's split across two lines).
    However, when you need more information about the context of
    the <tt>h1</tt> element, or if you're having to deal with
    tricky HTML bits like tables, you'll find that the flat list of
    tokens returned by HTML::Parser isn't immediately useful. To
    get something useful out of those tokens, you'll need to write
    code that knows which elements take no content (as with
    <tt>hr</tt> elements), and that <tt>&lt;/p&gt;</tt> end tags
    are optional, so a <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt> ends any currently open
    paragraph. You're well on your way to pointlessly reinventing
    much of the code in HTML::TreeBuilder,(And, as the person who
    last rewrote that module, I can attest that it wasn't terribly
    easy to get right! Never underestimate the perversity of people
    creating HTML.) at which point you should probably just stop
    and use HTML::TreeBuilder itself.
  </blockquote>

  <p>&bull; You can use HTML::Treebuilder and scan the tree of
  elements it creates.</p>

  <p>The last approach, using HTML::TreeBuilder, is diametrically
  opposed to the first approach, which involves just elementary
  Perl and one regex. The TreeBuilder approach involves being
  comfortable with the concept of tree-shaped data structures and
  modules with object-oriented interfaces, as well as with the
  particular interfaces that HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element
  provide.</p>

  <p>However, the TreeBuilder approach is the most robust, because
  it involves dealing with HTML in its "native" format -- the tree
  structure that HTML code represents, without any consideration of
  how the source is coded and with what tags are omitted.</p>

  <p>So, to extract the text from the <tt>h1</tt> elements of an
  HTML document:</p>
  <pre>
  sub get_heading {
      my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new;
      $tree-&gt;<b>parse_file</b>($_[0]);
      my $heading;
      my $h1 = $tree-&gt;<b>look_down</b>('_tag', 'h1');
      if ($h1) {
          $heading = $h1-&gt;<b>as_text</b>;
      } else {
          warn "No heading in $_[0]?";
      }
      $tree-&gt;<b>delete</b>;     # clear memory
      return $heading;
  }
</pre>

  <p>This uses some unfamiliar methods. The <tt>parse_file</tt>
  method that we've seen before builds a tree based on source from
  the file given. The <tt>delete</tt> method is for marking a
  tree's contents as available for garbage collection when you're
  done. The <tt>as_text</tt> method returns a string that contains
  all the text bits that are children (or otherwise descendants) of
  the given node -- to get the text content of the <tt>$h1</tt>
  object, we could just say:</p>
  <pre>
  $heading = join '', $h1-&gt;content_list;
</pre>

  <p>but that will work only if we're sure that the <tt>h1</tt>
  element's children will be only text bits. If the document
  contained:</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;h1&gt;Local Man Sees &lt;cite&gt;Blade&lt;/cite&gt; Again&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>

  <p>then the sub-tree would be:</p>
  <pre>
  &bull; h1
    &bull; "Local Man Sees "
    &bull; cite
      &bull; "Blade"
    &bull; " Again'
</pre>

  <p>so <tt>join '', $h1-&gt;content_list</tt> will result in
  something like this:</p>
  <pre>
  Local Man Sees HTML::Element=HASH(0x15424040) Again
</pre>

  <p>Meanwhile, <tt>$h1-&gt;as_text</tt> would yield:</p>
  <pre>
  Local Man Sees Blade Again
</pre>

  <p>Depending on what you're doing with the heading text, you
  might want the <tt>as_HTML</tt> method instead. It returns the
  sub-tree represented as HTML source. <tt>$h1-&gt;as_HTML</tt>
  would yield:</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;h1&gt;Local Man Sees &lt;cite&gt;Blade&lt;/cite&gt; Again&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>

  <p>However, if you wanted the contents of <tt>$h1</tt> as HTML,
  but not the <tt>$h1</tt> itself, you could say:</p>
  <pre>
  join '',
    map(
      ref($_) ? $_-&gt;as_HTML : $_,
      $h1-&gt;content_list
    )
</pre>

  <p>This <tt>map</tt> iterates over the nodes in <tt>$h1</tt>'s
  list of children, and for each node that's just a text bit (as
  "<tt>Local Man Sees</tt> " is), it just passes through that
  string value, and for each node that's an actual object (causing
  <tt>ref</tt> to be true), <tt>as_HTML</tt> will be used instead
  of the string value of the object itself (which would be
  something quite useless, as most object values are). So for the
  <tt>cite</tt> element, <tt>as_HTML</tt> will be the string
  <tt>&lt;cite&gt;Blade&lt;/cite&gt;</tt>. And then, finally,
  <tt>join</tt> just combines all the strings that the <tt>map</tt>
  returns into one string.</p>

  <p>Finally, the most important method in our <tt>get_heading</tt>
  subroutine is the <tt>look_down</tt> method. This method looks
  down at the sub-tree starting at the given object (here,
  <tt>$h1</tt>), retrieving elements that meet criteria you
  provide.</p>

  <p>The criteria are specified in the method's argument list. Each
  criterion consists of two scalars: a key and a value expressing
  an element and attribute. The key might be <tt>_tag</tt> or
  <tt>src</tt>, and the value might be an attribute like
  <tt>h1</tt>. Or, the criterion can be a reference to a subroutine
  that, when called on an element, returns true if it's a node
  you're looking for. If you specify several criteria, that means
  you want all the elements that satisfy <i>all</i> the criteria.
  (In other words, there's an implicit "and.")</p>

  <p>And finally, there's a bit of an optimization -- if you call
  the <tt>look_down</tt> method in a scalar context, you get just
  the <i>first</i> node (or <tt>undef</tt> if none) -- and, in
  fact, once <tt>look_down</tt> finds that first matching element,
  it doesn't bother looking any further.</p>

  <p>So the example:</p>
  <pre>
  $h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down('_tag', 'h1');
</pre>

  <p>returns the first element at or under <tt>$tree</tt> whose
  "<tt>_tag</tt>" attribute has the value <tt>h1</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Complex Criteria in Tree Scanning</h3>

  <p>Now, the above <tt>look_down</tt> code looks like a lot of
  bother, with barely more benefit than just grepping the file! But
  consider a situation in which your criteria are more complicated
  -- suppose you found that some of your press releases had several
  <tt>h1</tt> elements, possibly before or after the one you
  actually want. For example:</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;center&gt;Visit Our Corporate Partner
   &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="/dyna/clickthru"&gt;
       &lt;img src="/dyna/vend_ad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;center&gt;ConGlomCo President Schreck to Visit Regional HQ
   &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="/photos/Schreck_visit_large.jpg"&gt;
       &lt;img src="/photos/Schreck_visit.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Here, you want to ignore the first <tt>h1</tt> element because
  it contains an ad, and you want the text from the second
  <tt>h1</tt>. The problem is how to formalize what's an ad and
  what's not. Since ad banners are always entreating you to "visit"
  the sponsoring site, you could exclude <tt>h1</tt> elements that
  contain the word "visit" under them:</p>
  <pre>
  my $real_h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    sub {
      $_[0]-&gt;as_text !~ m/\bvisit/i
    }
  );
</pre>

  <p>The first criterion looks for <tt>h1</tt> elements, and the
  second criterion limits those to only the ones whose text doesn't
  match <tt>m/\bvisit/</tt>. Unfortunately, that won't work for our
  example, since the second <tt>h1</tt> mentions "ConGlomCo
  President Schreck to <i>Visit</i> Regional HQ".</p>

  <p>Instead, you could try looking for the first <tt>h1</tt>
  element that doesn't contain an image:</p>
  <pre>
  my $real_h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    sub {
      not $_[0]-&gt;look_down('_tag', 'img')
    }
  );
</pre>

  <p>This criterion subroutine might seem a bit odd, since it calls
  <tt>look_down</tt> as part of a larger <tt>look_down</tt>
  operation, but that's fine. Note if there's no matching element
  at or under the given element, <tt>look_down</tt> returns false
  (specifically, <tt>undef</tt>) in a boolean context. If there are
  matching elements, it returns the first. So this means "return
  true only if this element has no <tt>img</tt> element as
  descendants and isn't an <tt>img</tt> element itself."</p>
  <pre>
  sub {
    not $_[0]-&gt;look_down('_tag', 'img')
  }
</pre>

  <p>This correctly filters out the first <tt>h1</tt> that contains
  the ad, but it also incorrectly filters out the second
  <tt>h1</tt> that contains a non-advertisement photo near the
  headline text you want.</p>

  <p>There clearly are detectable differences between the first and
  second <tt>h1</tt> elements -- the only second one contains the
  string "Schreck", and we can just test for that:</p>
  <pre>
  my $real_h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    sub {
      $_[0]-&gt;as_text =~ m{Schreck}
    }
  );
</pre>

  <p>And that works fine for this one example, but unless all
  thousand of your press releases have "Schreck" in the headline,
  it's not generic enough. However, if all the ads in <tt>h1</tt>s
  involve a link whose URL involves "<tt>/dyna/</tt>", you can use
  that:</p>
  <pre>
  my $real_h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    sub {
      my $link = $_[0]-&gt;look_down('_tag','a');
      # no link means it's fine
      return 1 unless $link;
&#13;      # a link to there is bad
      return 0 if $link-&gt;attr('href') =~ m{/dyna/};
&#13;      return 1;   # otherwise okay
    }
  );
</pre>

  <p>Or you can look at it another way, and say that you want the
  first <tt>h1</tt> element that either contains no images, or else
  whose image has a <tt>src</tt> attribute whose value contains
  "<tt>/photos/</tt>":</p>
  <pre>
  my $real_h1 = $tree-&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    sub {
      my $img = $_[0]-&gt;look_down('_tag','img');
&#13;      # no image means it's fine
      return 1 unless $img;
&#13;      # good if a photo
      return 1 if $img-&gt;attr('src') =~ m{/photos/};
&#13;      return 0; # otherwise bad
    }
  );
</pre>

  <p>Recall that this use of <tt>look_down</tt> in a scalar context
  returns the first element at or under <tt>$tree</tt> matching all
  the criteria. But if you can formulate criteria that match
  several possible <tt>h1</tt> elements, with the <i>last</i> one
  being the one you want, you can use <tt>look_down</tt> in a list
  context, and ignore all but the last element of the returned
  list:</p>
  <pre>
  my @h1s = $tree-&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    ...maybe more criteria...
  );
  die "What, no h1s here?" unless @h1s;
  my $real_h1 = $h1s[-1];  # last or only element
</pre>

  <h3>A Case Study: Scanning Yahoo! News</h3>

  <p>The above (somewhat contrived) case involves extracting data
  from a bunch of pre-existing HTML files. In such situations, it's
  easy to know when your code works, since the data it handles
  won't change or grow, and you typically need to run the program
  only once.</p>

  <p>The other kind of situation faced in many data extraction
  tasks is where the program is used recurringly to handle new data
  -- such as from ever-changing Web pages. As a real-world example
  of this, consider a program that you could use to extract
  headline links from subsections of Yahoo! News (<a href=
  "http://dailynews.yahoo.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/</a>). Yahoo! News
  has several subsections, such as:</p>&bull; <a href=
  "http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/tc/" target=
  "resource window">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/tc/</a> for
  technology news<br>
  &bull; <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/sc/" target=
  "resource window">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/sc/</a> for
  science news<br>
  &bull; <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/hl/" target=
  "resource window">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/hl/</a> for health
  news<br>
  &bull; <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/wl/" target=
  "resource window">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/wl/</a> for world
  news<br>
  &bull; <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/en/" target=
  "resource window">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/en/</a> for

  <p>All of them are built on the same basic HTML template -- and a
  scarily complicated template it is, especially when you look at
  it with an eye toward identifying the real headline links and
  screening out the links to everything else. You'll need to puzzle
  over the HTML source, and scrutinize the output of
  <tt>$tree-&gt;dump</tt> on the parse tree of that HTML.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the only way to pin down what you're after is by
  position in the tree. For example, headlines of interest may be
  in the third column of the second row of the second table element
  in a page:</p>
  <pre>
  my $table = ( $tree-&gt;look_down('_tag','table') )[1];
  my $row2  = ( $table-&gt;look_down('_tag', 'tr' ) )[1];
  my $col3  = ( $row2-&gt;look-down('_tag', 'td')   )[2];
  ...then do things with $col3...
</pre>

  <p>Or they might be all the links in a <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt> element
  with more than two <tt>&lt;br&gt;</tt> elements as children:</p>
  <pre>
  my $p = $tree-&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'p',
    sub {
      2 &gt; grep { ref($_) and $_-&gt;tag eq 'br' }
              $_[0]-&gt;content_list
    }
  );
  @links = $p-&gt;look_down('_tag', 'a');
</pre>

  <p>But almost always, you can get away with looking for
  properties of the thing itself, rather than just looking for
  contexts. If you're lucky, the document you're looking through
  has clear semantic tagging, perhaps tailored for CSS (Cascading
  Style Sheets):</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;a href="...long_news_url..." <b>class="headlinelink"</b>&gt;Elvis
  seen in tortilla&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

  <p>If you find anything like that, you could leap right in and
  select links with:</p>
  <pre>
  @links = $tree-&gt;look_down('class', 'headlinelink');
</pre>

  <p>Regrettably, your chances of observing such semantic markup
  principles in real-life HTML are pretty slim.(In fact, your
  chances of finding a page that is simply free of HTML errors are
  even slimmer. And surprisingly, sites like Amazon or Yahoo! are
  typically worse as far as quality of code than personal sites
  whose entire production cycle involves simply being saved and
  uploaded from Netscape Composer.)</p>

  <p>The code may be "accidentally semantic", however -- for
  example, in a set of pages I was scanning recently, I found that
  looking for <tt>td</tt> elements with a <tt>width</tt> attribute
  value of <tt>375</tt> got me exactly what I wanted. No one
  designing that page ever conceived of <tt>width=375</tt> as
  <i>meaning</i> "this is a headline", but if you take it to mean
  that, it works.</p>

  <p>An approach like this happens to work for the Yahoo! News
  code, because the headline links are distinguished by the fact
  that they (and they alone) contain a <tt>b</tt> element:</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;a href="...long_news_url..."&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elvis seen in tortilla&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Or, diagrammed as a part of the parse tree:</p>
  <pre>
  &bull; a  [href="...long_news_url..."]
    &bull; b
      &bull; "Elvis seen in tortilla"
</pre>

  <p>A rule that matches these can be formalized as "look for any
  <tt>a</tt> element that has only one daughter node, which must be
  a <tt>b</tt> element". And this is what it looks like when cooked
  up as a <tt>look_down</tt> expression and prefaced with a bit of
  code to retrieve the Yahoo! News page and feed it to
  TreeBuilder:</p>
  <pre>
use strict;
use HTML::TreeBuilder 2.97;
use LWP::UserAgent;
sub get_headlines {
    my $url = $_[0] || die "What URL?";
    
    my $response = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new-&gt;request(
      HTTP::Request-&gt;new( GET =&gt; $url )
    );
  
    unless ($response-&gt;is_success) {
      warn "Couldn't get $url: ", 
$response-&gt;status_line, "\n";
      return;
    }
    
    my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new();
    $tree-&gt;parse($response-&gt;content);
    $tree-&gt;eof;
    
    my @out;
    foreach my $link (
      <b>$tree-&gt;look_down(
        '_tag', 'a',
        sub {
          return unless $_[0]-&gt;attr('href');
          my @c = $_[0]-&gt;content_list;
          @c == 1 and ref $c[0] and $c[0]-&gt;tag eq 'b';
        }
     )</b>
    ) {
        push @out, [$link-&gt;attr('href'),$link-&gt;as_text ];
    }
    
    warn "Odd, fewer than 6 stories in $url!" if @out &lt; 6;
    $tree-&gt;delete;
    return @out;
}
</pre>

  <p>And we add a bit of code to call <tt>get_headlines</tt> and
  display the results:</p>
  <pre>
foreach my $section (qw[tc sc hl wl en]) {
    my @links = get_headlines(
      "http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/$section/"
    );
    print
      $section, ": ", scalar(@links), " stories\n",
      map(("  ", $_-&gt;[0], " : ", $_-&gt;[1], "\n"), @links),
      "\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>Now we have our own headline extractor service! By itself, it
  isn't so amazingly useful (since if you want to see the
  headlines, you can just look at the Yahoo! News pages), but it
  could easily be the basis for features like filtering the
  headlines for particular topics of interest.</p>

  <p>One of these days, Yahoo! News will change its HTML template.
  When this happens, it will appear to the above program as though
  there are no links meeting our criteria; or, less likely, dozens
  of erroneous links will meet the criteria. In either case, the
  criteria will have to be changed for the new template; they may
  just need adjustment, or you may need to scrap them and start
  over.</p>

  <h3><i>Regardez, duvet!</i></h3>

  <p>It's often a challenge to write criteria that match the
  desired parts of an HTML parse tree. Very often you can pull it
  off with a simple <tt>$tree-&gt;look_down('_tag', 'h1')</tt>, but
  sometimes you have to keep adding and refining criteria, until
  you end up with complex filters like what I've shown in this
  article. The benefit of HTML parse trees is that one main search
  tool, the <tt>look_down</tt> method, can do most of the work,
  making simple things easy while keeping hard things
  possible.</p>_ _END_ _<br>
