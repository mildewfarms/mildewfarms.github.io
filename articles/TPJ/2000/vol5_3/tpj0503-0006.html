  <p>If you have a reason to watch the world's financial markets,
  and you know a little Perl, you may find the Finance::Quote
  module handy. I personally use it to remind myself that I should
  never buy stocks, as I have a good history of losing money in the
  market. However, you can use Finance::Quote to help track those
  tasty stock options you've been offered, or even to help you
  build dynamic artwork driven by fluctuations in the world
  markets. (Yes, thisactually exists and uses Finance::Quote under
  the hood: <a href=
  "http://www.terrestrialmap.org/StockPuppets.htm" target=
  "resource window">http://www.terrestrialmap.org/StockPuppets.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>Finance::Quote is a Perl module that makes accessing financial
  information easy. You can look up stocks and shares, managed
  funds, currency rates, and all for a variety of countries and
  markets. It's even easy to add your own specialized sources if
  you find something not covered by the module.</p>

  <h3>History</h3>

  <p>Finance::Quote started as the Quote module which was
  distributed as part of Gnucash (<a href="http://www.gnucash.org"
  target="resource window">http://www.gnucash.org</a>). This module
  (simply called "Quote") was a modified version of
  Finance::YahooQuote written by DJ Padzensky (<a href=
  "http://www.padz.net/~djpadz/YahooQuote/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.padz.net/~djpadz/YahooQuote/</a>).
  Linas Vepstas and Yannick Le Ny added extra sources for GnuCash,
  at which point I asked if anyone had any objections to me
  breaking it off into a separate project with a range of uses
  outside of GnuCash.</p>

  <p>Since that time, many people have contributed to
  Finance::Quote, including Xose Manoel Ramos (for inheritable
  Yahoo! methods), Brent Neal, Keith Refson, and Volker Stuerzl for
  writing pluggable modules, and Peter Thatcher, Jacinta
  Richardson, and Steven Murdoch for various bugfixes and
  improvements. Ben Hemming was kind enough to save the world from
  my poor web design skills and supply a web page look and
  feel.</p>

  <h3>Legality</h3>

  <p>When discussing Finance::Quote, one question which often
  arises is "How legal is all this?" Finance::Quote obtains quotes
  from various organizations who make this information available
  via the web. Fetching the data is legal; web browsers do it all
  the time, and Finance::Quote is just a rather specialized web
  browser. (Although there have been a couple of court cases where
  "deep linking" into web pages has been cast into legal shadow.)
  The main problems occur with the use of that data.</p>

  <p>Each organization has a different set of restrictions and
  conditions pertaining to the data you obtain from them. The most
  common restriction is forbidding redistribution, although some of
  them are so odd as to limit the number of copies you can have in
  memory at any one time! The Finance::Quote manual pages provide
  some pointers as to where these licenses can be found, and it
  would be wise to check those licenses to stay in safe legal
  waters.</p>

  <p>In general, obtaining information and displaying it or
  processing it into some useful form for personal use should be
  okay. After all, that's what your web browser does. Obtaining the
  information and re-branding it as your own is probably a no-no.
  If in doubt, check with a lawyer.</p>

  <h3>Terminology</h3>

  <p>Before we begin, it's worth taking the time to explain a few
  pieces of terminology that might confuse. For simplicity, a
  stock, mutual fund, index, or other parcel of information which
  can be fetched using Finance::Quote we will refer to as a
  "stock".</p>

  <p>All stocks have a unique <i>symbol</i>, an identifier which we
  can use to look them up; and an <i>exchange</i>, a locality in
  which they exist. For example, VA Linux has the symbol "LNUX" on
  the NASDAQ stock exchange. Symbols are traditionally all
  upper-case, but there exist some symbols (such as the
  pseudo-symbols used in the TIAA-CREF module,
  Finance::Quote::Tiaacref) that are mixed case.</p>

  <p>Finance::Quote essentially provides a way of taking a list of
  symbols for a given exchange, and returning information about
  those symbols. Each bit of information has a "label" (such as
  volume, close, high, low, and so on), identifying what that
  information is. All making sense? Good. Let's do something fun
  then.</p>

  <h3>Using Finance::Quote: The Basics</h3>

  <p>I'll demonstrate the usage of Finance::Quote by way of a
  useful example, which will be expanded upon as we go. For
  starters, let's just say you're interested in stocks from a
  single market, and wish to print their current value and volume
  traded.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use Finance::Quote;


my $exchange = shift;   # Where we fetch our stocks from.
my @symbols = @ARGV;    # Which stocks we want.

my $quoter = Finance::Quote-&gt;new;      # Create the F::Q object.

$quoter-&gt;timeout(30);        # Cancel fetch operation if it
                                        # takes longer than 30 seconds.

# Grab our information and place it into %info.
my %info = $quoter-&gt;fetch($exchange, @symbols);

foreach my $stock (@symbols) {
        unless ($info{$stock, "success"}) {
                warn "Lookup of $stock failed - ".$info{$stock, "errormsg"}.
                     "\n";
                next;
        }
        print "$stock:\t\t",
              "Volume: ", $info{$stock, "volume"}, "\t",
              "Price: " , $info{$stock, "price"}, "\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>If our script was called showstocks, and you were interested
  in Australian supermarkets, you could call it like this:</p>
  <pre>
  showstocks australia CML WOW
</pre>

  <p>This provides you with information about Coles-Myer and
  Woolworths.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, if you were interested some U.S. technology
  stocks, you could try this:</p>
  <pre>
  showstocks usa LNUX RHAT MSFT IBM
</pre>

  <p>which provides you with information about VA Linux, Red Hat,
  Microsoft, and International Business Machines.</p>

  <p>This script demonstrates a number of capabilities of
  Finance::Quote. In particular:</p>

  <p>&bull; Finance::Quote is object-oriented, and a Finance::Quote
  object can be generated using
  <tt>Finance::Quote-&gt;new()</tt>.</p>

  <p>&bull; The <tt>fetch()</tt> method can be used for retrieving
  information. This method is very powerful, and will be explained
  in depth later in this article.</p>

  <p>&bull; The <tt>fetch()</tt> method returns a two-dimensional
  hash. This is the topic of our next section.</p>

  <h3>The Return Hash</h3>

  <p>Finance::Quote's most useful function, <tt>fetch()</tt>,
  returns a two-dimensional hash. This contains a variety of
  information about the stocks you requested, including volume,
  price, highs and lows, percentage changes, and other information.
  Each key in the hash has two parts:</p>
  <pre>
  $info{$symbol,$label}
</pre>

  <p><tt>$symbol</tt> is the symbol that you've requested. In the
  examples above, RHAT and LNUX are examples of symbols. The label
  refers to a specific type of information about that stock, such
  as <tt>volume</tt>, <tt>price</tt>, <tt>close</tt>,
  <tt>p_change</tt>, or <tt>name</tt>. Labels are always
  lowercase.</p>

  <p>There exist some very special labels you should be aware of.
  The label <tt>success</tt> is used to indicate if the information
  could be successfully retrieved. If the value of the success
  label for a given stock is false, then no useful information
  could be gained about that symbol at this time. If a failure did
  occur, the reason for that failure will be in the label
  <tt>errormsg</tt>.</p>

  <p>The special label <tt>price</tt> is used to indicate the value
  of the given stock. This varies a little depending on what
  information you're fetching. For stocks, it's usually the last
  price the stock was traded at. For some investments, it's the
  current yield (a percentage per-annum). For currencies it's the
  exchange rate, and for indexes it's the last value of that index
  (in points).</p><a href="tpj0503-0006a.html" target=
  "resource window">Standard Finance::Quote Labels</a>

  <p>The reason the price label is important is that it allows for
  applications to track movements without having to know what it is
  we're tracking: a stock, a managed fund, or an indicator. The
  price label provides us with the information we want. This is
  particularly useful for stock ticker programs, allowing them to
  use Finance::Quote to track things other than just stocks.</p>

  <p>For applications that care about the details, there are a wide
  range of labels that can be returned. These include the highest
  and lowest prices for the day, dividend yields and dates, the
  time and date that the information is current for, the volume
  traded, the name of the stock, and many others. The standard
  labels are listed in the sidebar.</p>

  <p>It's important to remember that the information fetched by
  Finance::Quote is usually delayed, and so is often 30 minutes or
  more behind what's really happening. If you're doing currency
  conversions as well, then the currency conversion rate may also
  be delayed. You can use the labels <tt>date</tt> and
  <tt>time</tt> to determine when the data was registered &mdash;
  it's not unknown for some sources to provide data that is a week
  old or more.</p>

  <h3>Advanced Usage</h3>

  <p>The basics of Finance::Quote are pretty simple. You create
  yourself a Finance::Quote object, ask it for some information,
  and you get that information back in a hash. For most
  applications, this is all you really need. However,
  Finance::Quote provides a wide range of extra features to help
  make your life easier.</p>

  <h3>Currency Conversion</h3>

  <p>Finance::Quote has the ability to look up currency rates, and
  can even automatically convert foreign stocks into local
  currencies. Let's say you live in Australia, but own some
  American stocks. You may be interested in knowing the value of
  those stocks in Australian dollars, which have more meaning to
  you than US dollars. Here's how:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use Finance::Quote;

my $market = shift;
my @stocks = @ARGV;
my $quoter = Finance::Quote-&gt;new();
$quoter-&gt;set_currency("AUD"); # Aussie dollars.
my %info = $quoter-&gt;fetch($market,@stocks);
# Print the info here.
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>set_currency()</tt> method asks Finance::Quote to
  convert all values into the given currency before returning them
  to you. Finance::Quote knows which things it can convert (like
  prices and ranges), and which it cannot (like percentage changes
  and volumes). It's even smart enough to (usually) not touch
  indexes and other abstract indicators that don't have currencies
  attached to them.</p>

  <p>Be aware that <tt>set_currency()</tt> can significantly
  increase the time of a query, as currency lookup information has
  to be fetched as well as the stock information.</p>

  <p>It's also possible to fetch currency exchange rates directly.
  This is done using the currency() method. For example:</p>
  <pre>
  my $exchange_rate = $quoter-&gt;currency("USD","AUD");
  print "1 US dollar is $exchange_rate Australian dollars.\n";
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>currency()</tt> method can also do clever things like
  take a prefix for the currency being converted from. The
  following script is a quick and dirty command-line utility to
  convert between currencies:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use Finance::Quote;

# Command-line currency conversion.

die "Usage: $0 FROM TO\n" unless defined($ARGV[1]);

my $quoter = Finance::Quote-&gt;new();
my $exchange_rate = $quoter-&gt;currency($ARGV[0],$ARGV[1]);

die "Don't know how to convert $ARGV[0] to $ARGV[1]\n" unless $exchange_rate;

print "$ARGV[0] -&gt; $ARGV[1] = $exchange_rate\n";
</pre>

  <p>If this script were to be called <tt>currency-lookup</tt>, you
  could show the going rate between Australian and American dollars
  like this:</p>
  <pre>
  currency-lookup AUD USD
</pre>

  <p>If you wanted to know how much 95 Australian dollars were in
  French francs, you could do this:</p>
  <pre>
  currency-lookup "95 AUD" FRF
</pre>

  <h3>Fail-over Support and Custom Modules</h3>

  <p>Finance::Quote provides automatic fail-over support if you
  specify the market that you're interested in and not the actual
  source from which you want to fetch it. This means that if you
  use <tt>nasdaq</tt> instead of <tt>yahoo</tt> as your source,
  Finance::Quote will automatically try all sources of NASDAQ data
  in case the first one failed. Fail-over support is turned on by
  default in all Finance::Quote objects.</p>

  <p>Fail-over support can increase the time of a query, especially
  if you're searching for a non-existent stock. It's possible to
  (un)set fail-over support explicitly like this:</p>
  <pre>
  $quoter-&gt;failover(0);   # Disable failover.
</pre>

  <p>Likewise, when you create your Finance::Quote object, it's
  possible to state which modules you'd like to be able to fetch
  information from. For example, this uses only the
  Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Australia module for queries:</p>
  <pre>
  my $quoter = 
                Finance::Quote-&gt;new("Yahoo::Australia");
</pre>

  <p>This style of invocation is useful if you prefer a particular
  information supplier, or otherwise wish to restrict where
  Finance::Quote can search for information.</p>

  <p>Also, specifying modules to load at creation time lets you
  load custom modules that are not part of the standard
  Finance::Quote distribution.</p>
  <pre>
  my $quoter = 
                Finance::Quote-&gt;new("-defaults", "MyBank");
</pre>

  <p>Here we would load the Finance::Quote:: MyBank module, as well
  as all the default modules packaged with Finance::Quote. Note
  that the <tt>-defaults</tt> argument is only magical when passed
  as the first argument (although in the future it might be legal
  to pass it anywhere in the arguments list).</p>

  <p>If you're interested in writing your own modules for
  Finance::Quote, you should read the Hacker's Guide that comes
  with Finance::Quote, or which can be found in the Finance::Quote
  documentation manager at <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/docman/index.php?group_id=4232" target=
  "resource window">http://sourceforge.net/docman/index.php?group_id=4232</a>.</p>

  <h3>Required Labels</h3>

  <p>Fail-over support is a wonderful thing &mdash; the source
  you're fetching data from can disappear and you'll never have to
  know. Unfortunately, not all sources provide all the information
  you're looking for, and having bits of information disappear when
  you're used to them can be a little surprising.</p>

  <p>Rather than having to worry about your fail-over sources not
  providing the information you're looking for, Finance::Quote
  allows you to define a list of things that are important to you,
  using the <tt>require_labels()</tt> method. Say that your program
  relies upon the price, date, high, low, and volume labels. You
  can express this to your Finance::Quote object like so:</p>
  <pre>
    $quoter-&gt;require_labels(qw/price date high low volume/);
</pre>

  <p>If you now use the <tt>$quoter-&gt;fetch()</tt> to obtain
  information, you can be guaranteed that those fields will be
  available when they make sense for whatever you've requested.
  This means you can use fail-over methods safe in the knowledge
  that the information you actually care about won't
  disappear.</p><a href="tpj0503-0006b.html" target=

  Finance::Quote.</a>

  <h3>Tricks With The User Agent</h3>

  <p>If you've ever used LWP::UserAgent before, then you'll be
  pleased to know that you can customize the underlying
  LWP::UserAgent object in Finance::Quote. For example, this causes
  the <tt>$quoter</tt> object to identify itself as
  <tt>MyTicker/0.1</tt> in HTTP sessions.</p>
  <pre>
  $quoter-&gt;user_agent-&gt;agent("MyTicker/0.1");
</pre>

  <p>Likewise, this lets you set your proxy explicitly:</p>
  <pre>
  $quoter-&gt;user_agent-&gt;proxy('http', $MY_PROXY);
</pre>

  <p>Note that the UserAgent respects proxy environment variables
  (such as <tt>http_proxy</tt>) at creation time. For more
  information on what you can and cannot do here, check out the
  documentation for LWP::UserAgent.</p>

  <h3>Rolling Your Own Finance::Quote Module</h3>

  <p>As well as using the standard Finance::Quote modules, it's
  also possible to write your own module for Finance::Quote to use.
  Writing such a module can be a tricky task, and is beyond the
  scope of this article.</p>

  <p>The Finance::Quote package does come with its own Hacker's
  Guide explaining how to write a Finance::Quote module. This can
  be found with other documentation at <a href=
  "http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/documentation.html" target=
  "resource window">http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/documentation.html</a>.</p>

  <h3>An Example Stock Ticker Program</h3>

  <p>On the previous page is an example of a useful, real,
  text-based stock ticker. The code is intentionally simple to
  display the features of Finance::Quote, but it provides a very
  clear and useful display for stocks that you may have your eye
  on.</p><b>_ _END_ _</b><br>
