  <p>I've been loosely following the recent litigation over the
  DeCSS program. DeCSS is a C program floating around the Internet
  that decrypts data encoded in CSS (Content Scrambling System),
  the encryption scheme used by DVDs. Sites posting the source code
  have been the victim of legal action, sometimes under the
  justification that source code is not speech, and therefore isn't
  protected by the First Amendment in the U.S.</p>

  <p>Should source code be regarded as a form of protected
  expression? I think it should, and so I wrote a program called
  <i>c2eng</i> that takes ANSI C code and translates it to
  grammatically correct and descriptive English sentences. For
  instance, that means taking the C preprocessing statement
  <tt>#include &lt;math.h&gt;</tt> and turning it into "<tt>This
  program makes use of the system file math.h.</tt>", and turning
  <tt>#define Pi 3.14159265358979</tt> into "<tt>Note: we define Pi
  to mean '3.14159265358979'</tt>". With <i>c2eng</i>, the global
  declaration <tt>int I,J,K;</tt> becomes "<tt>Specifying the type
  integer, allocate the variables 'I', 'J', and 'K'.</tt>"
  Naturally, the tool I chose for this task is Perl.</p>

  <p>The first thing I did was to ask around Usenet for suggestions
  about how to go about this project. Several folks pointed me in
  the direction of Damian Conway's Parse::RecDescent module. After
  downloading the module, I read more about a similar utility
  called <i>yacc</i>, which takes a description of a language
  (called a <i>grammar</i>) and generates a program that can
  <i>parse</i> (or "understand", in a weak sense) texts conforming
  to that grammar. You might use <i>yacc</i> to create a compiler
  for a language of your own design; in fact, <tt>perl</tt> itself
  uses a heavily-modified variant of <i>yacc</i> to parse Perl
  programs.</p>

  <p>In this article, I'll explain how I arrived at a
  fully-functioning C to English translator. You'll get the most
  out of it if you already know the basics of parsing; see Damian
  Conway's article on Parse::RecDescent in <a href=
  "../vol3_4/ewtoc.html">TPJ #12</a> for a thorough introduction to
  parsing in general, and his module in particular.</p>

  <h3>Why Parse::RecDescent?</h3>

  <p>Parse::RecDescent offers several advantages over other parsers
  for this task. The primary advantage is that a typical entry in a
  grammar looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
	  Rule : Subrule1 Subrule2
</pre>But with Parse::RecDescent, you can include arbitrary bits of
Perl code to be executed during the parse:
  <pre>
	  Rule : Subrule1 Subrule2
	        { $return = $item{subrule2} . $item{subrule1}; }
</pre>

  <p>This lets us assemble a string (<tt>$return</tt>) and return
  it to whatever superrule called <tt>Rule</tt>. This was exactly
  the flexibility that I needed. It let me store English strings
  like "<tt>specified as the type</tt>" in <tt>$return</tt> and
  pass them from rule to rule.</p>

  <p>So what's the top-level rule, the one that actually does the
  printing? The first construct you find in a C program can be a
  global variable declaration, a function prototype or definition,
  a comment, or a preprocessor directive. Our top-level rule looks
  like this:</p>
  <pre>
  startrule : (
	preproc {print $item{preproc};}
	| comment {print $item{comment};}
	| global_var_declaration {print $item{global_var_declaration};} 
	| function_definition {print $item{function_definition};}
	| function_prototype {print $item{function_prototype};}
  )(s)
</pre>

  <p>This tells Parse::RecDescent to collect the return string from
  any of those constructs and print the result to STDOUT. The
  parentheses around the subrules indicate that we might find more
  than one <tt>startrule</tt> in the program. (Usually, we
  will.)</p>

  <p>Note that <tt>startrule</tt> is the <i>only</i> rule allowed
  to print anything. As <i>c2eng</i> meanders through a C program
  trying to figure out how the component characters are divided
  into higher-order terms, expressions, and statements, it will try
  out multiple interpretations as it moves through the program,
  only to realize later that an interpretation is wrong. At that
  point it backs up and try another interpretation -- but once
  you've printed something you can't undo it, so we have to
  constrain the printing to this top-level rule.</p>

  <p>As I wrote <i>c2eng</i>, I posted several questions to the
  comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and received assistance from Damian
  and Randal Schwartz. (And by "assistance", I mean being walked
  through many problems step-by-step.) Damian sent me a C grammar
  that had been written for Parse::RecDescent, which I used as the
  basis for my work.</p>

  <h3>Math Is English, Too</h3>

  <p>In 1557, a scholar named Robert Recorde wrote a treatise on
  arithmetic containing this famous quote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>To avoide the tediouse repetition of these woordes:
    <b>is</b><br>
    <b>equalle to:</b> I will settle as I doe often in woorke
    use,<br>
    a paire of paralleles, or gemowe [twin] lines of one<br>
    lengthe: =, bicause noe .2. thynges, can be moare<br>
    equalle.</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Yes, the universal language of our mathematical notation began
  with the impatience of a man writing an entire book by hand, in a
  dank unlit room, with inkwell and quill. If our mathematical
  symbols are simply contractions for normal English woordes, we
  should be able to take any equation and translate it into a
  grammatically correct sentence.</p>

  <p>Once I figured out how to descend recursively through a
  grammar and translate algebraic equations into mechanical English
  prose, I just needed to put in the Perl code to construct it.
  Enter the <tt>%item</tt> and <tt>$return</tt> variables, which
  <i>c2eng</i> uses to amass the English output. At the end of
  every rule we can have what Parse::RecDescent calls an "action";
  in most of our rules, the action is to assign a value to
  <tt>$return</tt>. For instance, here's a rule involved in parsing
  mathematical expressions:</p>
  <pre>
  rel_add_mul_shift_expression : 
	  &lt;leftop: cast_expression rel_mul_add_ex_op cast_expression&gt;
  {
	  $return = join('',@{$item[1]}); 
  }
</pre>

  <p>Parse::RecDescent provides <tt>@item</tt> and <tt>%item</tt>
  variables that let a rule find out what a subrule returned. The
  act of parsing is sufficient for determining which characters
  combine into expressions, but the extra meaning of those
  expressions -- their English representation -- has to be passed
  upward to superrules through variables like <tt>$return</tt> that
  gather the meaning of the current rule and store it for the
  superrule.</p>

  <p>That's all very abstract. What it means in this case is that
  the <tt>rel_add_mul_shift_expression</tt> rule, which parses a
  mathematical expression like <i>a + b</i>, is able to examine the
  English strings associated with <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and join
  them together. It turns this:</p>
  <pre>
  prod[2][1] = a[2][1]*b[1][1]+a[2][2]*b[2][1];
</pre>to this:
  <pre>
Assign to array prod's element at address (2,1) the value "array a's
element at address (2,1) times array b's element at address (1,1) plus
array a's element at address (2,2) times array b's element at address
(2,1)".
</pre>

  <p>It's not poetry. But it is, at least, pronounceable.</p>

  <p>There's much more to say about the difficulties of parsing C
  with an eye toward generating readable English output. For
  instance, the statement <tt>bar = baz</tt>; can be translated as
  "<tt>Assign to 'bar' the value of 'baz'</tt>." That suggests a
  certain way of writing the rule that handles assignment
  statements. But an overly simplistic implementation might turn a
  statement like <tt>foo = bar = baz</tt>; into "Assign to 'foo'
  the value of assign to 'bar' the value of 'baz'", which doesn't
  quite roll off the tongue. Instead, <i>c2eng</i> performs a
  slightly more rigorous analysis, yielding the more palatable
  <tt>Assign to 'foo' the value 'bar' which is assigned to be
  'baz'</tt>.</p>

  <p>In some situations, we need to know what comes <i>after</i> a
  rule we've parsed. For example, when we use - as a unary operator
  (e.g. <tt>foo = -bar</tt> or <tt>baz = -1</tt>), we say "minus"
  if what follows is a constant, and "negative" if it's not.
  Parse::RecDescent lets us peek ahead with the ... construct:</p>
  <pre>
unary_operator : [ other things] 
	| '-' ...constant {$return  = 'negative ';}
	| '-' {$return = 'minus ';}
</pre>This translates <tt>-1</tt> to "<tt>negative one</tt>" while
<tt>-x</tt> is translated to "<tt>minus x</tt>".

  <p><i>Simple</i> mathematical expressions aren't that hard to
  express in English: we just need to imitate a very boring math
  teacher. In comparison, flow control statements and function
  definitions are easy to verbalize. It's easy to translate
  <tt>foo(bar)</tt> to "<tt>Perform the function 'foo' as applied
  to the argument 'bar'</tt>." What's hard, however, are
  parentheses.</p>

  <p>Parentheses are critical in mathematics, but they
  unfortunately don't translate very well into English because of
  their stackable nature. We can handle stacks of concepts when we
  talk or read, as long as the stack doesn't get too deep. (And
  "too deep" means more than about six levels. (For more about
  this, read Douglas Hofstadter's "G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach, an
  Eternal Golden Braid". (Basic Books, 1979.)))</p>

  <p>When a math teacher says something like "the quantity x plus
  y, all over z...", the phrases "the quantity" and "all" signal to
  the listener that the stack depth is changing. In spoken
  conversations, hand gestures are sometimes used to indicate
  particular depths as well.</p>

  <p>Which leaves us in a quandary. What do we do with
  parenthetical expressions in C code? We could replace each
  opening parenthesis with "the quantity" and each closing
  parenthesis with "now", but what about nested parentheses?
  Mechanical repetitions of "the quantity" or "now" would convey
  the meaning of the underlying C, but it wouldn't sound pleasant
  since we'd never talk that way in real life, even if we were
  trying to convey a complicated mathematical expression. The
  parenthesis-handling portion of <i>c2eng</i> is displayed in
  <a href="tpj0503-0012a.html">Listing 1.</a></p>

  <p>When <i>c2eng</i> encounters a set of nested parentheses, it
  displays a phrase like "<tt>the 22-layered parenthetical
  expression</tt>". If it encounters multiple parentheses in a row,
  it says so: "<tt>(now drop 22 layers of context)</tt>". Since
  phrases like these interrupt the flow of communication,
  <i>c2eng</i> puts them in, yes, parentheses.</p>

  <p><i>c2eng</i> works, and can translate the vast majority of C
  programs into readable, if boring, English. I'm continuing to
  refine the program to improve the output, but the proof of
  concept is there. There are still many issues to be worked out;
  for instance, when a C compiler parses a C program, it
  immediately strips out comments and runs the C preprocessor.
  <i>c2eng</i> doesn't, because I want the English output to
  contain all of the information in the C program. This is
  important, because we want our translation to be perfectly
  reversible, converting from C to English, and then from English
  back into C. Perhaps this will help courts understand that to
  code is to talk and to talk is to code.</p>_ _END_ _<br>
