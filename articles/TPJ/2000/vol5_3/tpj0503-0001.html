  <p><b>Perl</b> 6 is in development. In case you think this is a
  typographical error, it is version <b>six</b>. Not five, not
  five-dot-six, not the-version-formerly-known-as-five. Six. It
  isn't the <b>Topaz</b> project from <b>Chip Salzenberg</b> (an
  attempted rewrite of Perl in C++), but a complete rewrite, from
  scratch, by the Perl community. It is slated for alpha in July
  2001, with a release six months later.</p>

  <p>On July 18, the day before the sessions started at <b>The
  O'Reilly Perl Conference 4.0</b> in Monterey, CA, a small group
  of Perl people, including Salzenberg, Perl creator <b>Larry
  Wall</b>, current pumpkings <b>Gurusamy Sarathy</b> and <b>Jarkko
  Hietaniemi</b>, and <b>Nathan Torkington</b> met to discuss
  Perl's future. After much gnashing of teeth, they decided that
  Perl should be rewritten. The consensus was that Perl is
  difficult to improve, extend, and embed, and these problems can
  only really be fixed by rewriting. And since there will be a
  rewrite, developers could take the opportunity to clean out some
  of the cruft, including bad and seldom-used features, and to
  implement some long-wanted features.</p>

  <p>Later that same day, they brought their findings to a meeting
  for members of <b>perl5-porters</b>, the mailing list for core
  Perl development. After a consensus was reached there, a basic
  roadmap for the development of Perl 6 was forged. A core group of
  workers was selected (with Wall as language designer and
  Torkington as project manager), and a basic framework for moving
  forward was developed, noting that the old monolithic mailing
  list just wouldn't work any longer.</p>

  <p>"Perl 5 was my rewrite of Perl," Wall said. "I think this
  should be the community's rewrite of Perl, and the community's
  rewrite of the community."</p>

  <p>Since then, the community has been actively discussing
  development on a dozen mailing lists, creating Requests For
  Comment (RFCs), which will form the basis for the technical work
  ahead. A lot is happening (252 RFCs as this issue goes to press),
  a lot of people are working, and a lot is left to do. See the
  Perl 6 page at <a href="http://www.perl.org/perl6/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.org/perl6/</a> for more
  information.</p>

  <p>Although Perl 6 is moving full speed ahead, Perl 5 is not
  being abandoned. Gurusamy Sarathy is maintaining 5.6, and Jarkko
  Hietaniemi, the newest pumpking, is hard at work on 5.7, the
  development branch leading up to 5.8.</p>

  <p>The Perl 6 work begins as the Perl conference season begins to
  wrap up. In May, the <b>Perl Whirl</b> set sail, taking Perl
  programmers and teachers, and their families, to Alaska.</p>

  <p>In June, the second <b>yet another perl conference</b> took
  place at <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b>. The location is quite
  important, because CMU has a campus-wide 802.11 wireless network,
  which conference attendees took full advantage of, carrying their
  Vaios and PowerBooks from room to room while checking email and
  chatting on IRC.</p>

  <p>Larry Wall gave the keynote, comparing the journey of
  Christian in <b>Pilgrim's Progress</b> by <b>John Bunyan</b> to
  that of a Perl programmer. <b>Damian Conway</b>, however, stole
  the show with his mind-jarring paper on Quantum Superposition and
  the First Virtue, which is far too interesting and complex to be
  described here. See his <b>Quantum::Superpositions</b> module on
  CPAN.</p>

  <p><b>Mark-Jason Dominus</b> ran the popular <b>Lightning
  Talks</b> segment of yapc, where people were enjoined to give
  five-minute prepared talks about any subject they wished. Later,
  <b>Jon Orwant</b> gave the second talk in his nine-part series,
  <b>Rebuilding Post-Apocalyptic Civiliation with Perl</b>, and how
  Perl programmers will be the ones to survive, and about how a lot
  of art is really bad.</p>

  <p><b>Kevin Lenzo</b>, the man behind yapc, started <b>Yet
  Another Society</b> to be the parent organization behind yapc.
  More information can be found at <a href=
  "http://www.yetanother.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.yetanother.org/</a>. Lenzo et al.
  are looking for a venue for next year's North American yapc
  (either Boston or Montreal), while the first <b>yapc::Europe</b>
  is also being held this year, September 22-24, 2000, at the
  <b>Institute for Contemporary Arts</b> in London.</p>

  <p>While Perl 6 was the big news at the Perl Conference, other
  things happened. One of the coolest things was that, because many
  participants were addicted to the wireless access found at yapc,
  Yet Another Society set up a wireless network covering many of
  the conference rooms at TPC, too, and <b>Tim O'Reilly</b> will be
  trying to get wireless access for future O'Reilly Perl
  Conferences.</p>

  <p>The conference had two days filled with tutorials, and two
  more filled with talks, with BOFs, parties, and more sprinkled
  about. Wall again gave the keynote, this year focusing on music.
  He brought out a plethora of pitchmakers and discussed
  similarities and differences between programming Perl and playing
  music.</p>

  <p>Bunches of awards were given out at the conference. The annual
  Perl Conference awards from O'Reilly were given to <b>Nathan
  Bailey</b>, <b>Andrew Bromage</b>, and <b>Andrew Creer</b> for
  <b>Best Web Application</b> (My.University); <b>Bradley M.
  Kuhn</b> for <b>Best Technical Paper</b> (perljvm); and <b>Andy
  Wardley</b> for <b>Best New Module</b> (Template Toolkit). Damian
  Conway again won the <b>Larry Wall Award</b> for his
  <b>Text::Autoformat</b> module. Damian was withdrawn from future
  consideration, and the Best Technical Paper award will henceforth
  be known as the <b>Damian Conway Award</b>.</p>

  <p>The <b>Perl Mongers</b> and O'Reilly gave out the <b>White
  Camel</b> awards, given to people with significant non-technical
  contributions to Perl: <b>Elaine Ashton</b> for <b>Perl User
  Groups</b>, <b>Chris Nandor</b> for <b>Perl Community</b>, and
  Nathan Torkington for <b>Perl Advocacy</b>.</p>

  <p>Ashton, Conway, and Dominus judged a Perl poetry contest.
  Honorable mentions went to <b>R. Geoffrey Avery</b>, <b>Brad
  Baxter</b>, and <b>Steve Trigg</b>. Nathan Torkington's wife
  <b>Jenine Abarbanel</b> won third place for her "Perl widow"
  haiku; <b>Paul Makepeace</b> took second with his Latin haiku;
  and <b>Ronald J. Kimball</b> won first for his haiku that was not
  only about nature, as all haikus should be, but was also written
  in Perl.</p>

  <p><b>ActiveState</b> had a contest, too; the <b>Perl Power
  Contest</b> for innovative programs using Perl. <b>Michael G.
  Schwern</b> won for his <b>Tie::Math</b> module, which lets you
  tie a hash to mathematical functions.</p>

  <p>O'Reilly has released the long-awaited third edition of the
  <b>Camel</b> book, a.k.a. <b>Programming Perl</b> by Larry Wall,
  <b>Tom Christiansen</b>, and Jon Orwant; and the second edition
  of <b>CGI Programming with Perl</b> by <b>Scott Guelich</b>,

  Press</b> has published <b>Beginning Perl</b>, by <b>Simon
  Cozens</b>.</p>
