  <h2 align="center">Microperl</h2>

  <h4 align="left"><i>Simon Cozens</i></h4>

  <p>Perl 5.7.0 shipped with an obscure and barely announced new
  feature -- <tt>microperl</tt>. <tt>microperl</tt> is something
  I've worked on for quite a few months now and, while I expect it
  to be useful to a tiny fraction of Perl users, I'd like to
  explain why it's included and what's so cool about it.</p>

  <p>First, though, what is it? Well, when you compile a version of
  Perl, the first thing that gets built is a program called
  <tt>miniperl</tt>. <tt>miniperl</tt> is more or less just like
  your ordinary <tt>perl</tt>, except that it doesn't have the
  DynaLoader XS module linked in. An XS module is a C extension
  module, allowing Perl to run C code, and it's usually written in
  a special glue language, XS, rather than in C.</p>

  <p>What makes DynaLoader special is that it's the module which
  allows Perl to load other XS modules dynamically -- without that,
  you can't use modules like IO::File, your DBM database library
  (DB_File, SDBM_File or equivalent) or any of the modules on CPAN
  with XS components.</p>

  <p><tt>miniperl</tt>, however, has just enough brains to run a
  program which translates the XS language in which DynaLoader is
  written into a C program; once we've done that, we can compile
  DynaLoader and link it into <tt>perl</tt>. In effect, we're
  building <tt>perl</tt> in stages: first without XS support, and
  then using that first effort to help build the next stage with XS
  support.</p>

  <h3>Bootstrapping</h3>

  <p>This process -- starting small and using the result to build
  up to the next stage -- is called "bootstrapping", since you've
  started from the ground and are pulling yourself up by your own
  bootstraps. In fact, it's exactly what happens when you turn up
  your computer and it "boots up" -- the raw circuitry knows enough
  to activate the BIOS, the BIOS knows enough to find and run the
  first block on the disk, which is a program which in turn knows
  enough to find the boot loader, which finds and runs the
  operating system.</p>

  <p>The idea behind <tt>microperl</tt> is to take the
  bootstrapping nature of <tt>miniperl</tt> and <tt>perl</tt> to
  its logical conclusion. <tt>microperl</tt> is a very, very simple
  build of <tt>perl</tt> which will hopefully one day be used to
  build <tt>miniperl</tt>.</p>

  <p>At the moment, before <tt>miniperl</tt> can be built, a
  program called <tt>Configure</tt> must be run. To make sure that
  <tt>perl</tt> builds properly on the plethora of different
  computers it supports, <tt>Configure</tt> performs hundreds of
  tests to work out the characteristics of the current system --
  which character set is being used, how large the various C
  datatypes are on the machine, what libraries are available, how
  to use the C compiler, and so on.</p>

  <p>The problem with <tt>Configure</tt> is that you need to make a
  few assumptions about the system in order to run it.
  <tt>Configure</tt> is written in Bourne shell, so you need a copy
  of <tt>sh</tt> around. It also uses <tt>grep</tt>, <tt>awk</tt>,
  <tt>sed</tt> and a bunch of other Unix utilities to probe the
  system. Of course, this will only work on something that smells
  like Unix. It would be a lot better if <tt>Configure</tt> was
  written in something portable -- something like Perl, for
  instance. Of course, you'd need a Perl interpreter to be able to
  run it, and since the purpose of the exercise is to build a Perl
  interpreter, we've hit a chicken-and-egg problem.</p>

  <p>This is where <tt>microperl</tt> comes in. The aim of
  <tt>microperl</tt> is to be a Perl interpreter which can be built
  on as many machines as possible, even small operating systems
  like WinCE and PalmOS, before any probing of the system occurs.
  Simply unpack your Perl distribution, compile it, and go. In
  fact, let's do that.</p>

  <h3>Building Microperl</h3>

  <p>Unpack Perl 5.7.0, and change to the directory
  <tt>perl5.7.0/</tt>. Now issue this command:</p>
  <pre>
        <b>% make -f Makefile.micro</b>
</pre>

  <p>If all goes well, you should see something like this
  happen:</p>
  <pre>
  cc -c -o uav.o -DPERL_CORE -DPERL_MICRO av.c
  cc -c -o udeb.o -DPERL_CORE -DPERL_MICRO deb.c
  cc -c -o udoio.o -DPERL_CORE -DPERL_MICRO doio.c
  cc -c -o udoop.o -DPERL_CORE -DPERL_MICRO doop.c
  [... time passes ...]
  cc -c -o uutil.o -DPERL_CORE -DPERL_MICRO util.c
  cc -c -o uperlapi.o -DPERL_CORE -DPERL_MICRO perlapi.c
  cc -o microperl uav.o udeb.o udoio.o udoop.o udump.o uglobals.o ugv.o 
  uhv.o umg.o uperlmain.o uop.o uperl.o uperlio.o uperly.o upp.o upp_ctl.o 
  upp_hot.o upp_sys.o uregcomp.o uregexec.o urun.o uscope.o usv.o utaint.o 
  utoke.o uuniversal.o uutf8.o uutil.o uperlapi.o -lm
</pre>

  <p>You might see a few warnings, which are probably harmless. If
  you don't get past the first file, check that your C compiler is
  available and replace the line <tt>CC = cc</tt> in
  <tt>Makefile.micro</tt> with <tt>CC = /path/to/your/cc</tt>. If
  you use a separate linker, alter the line <tt>LD = $(CC)</tt> to,
  for example, <tt>LD = ld</tt>. Eventually, you should end up with
  an executable file called <tt>microperl</tt>. (If you get stuck
  between the first file and the big statement at the end, then we
  probably have a bug.)</p>

  <p><tt>microperl</tt> is a real, honest-to-goodness Perl
  interpreter; no core elements of the Perl language have been
  removed. The regular expression engine is exactly the same, the
  language is exactly the same, it has the same Unicode support,
  and so on. The only things that have been removed from it are
  functions that are completely system-specific, like
  <tt>crypt</tt> and <tt>readdir</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
        % <b>./microperl -le 'print q/Hello world/'</b>
        Hello world
        % <b>./microperl t/base/cond.t</b>
        1..4
        ok 1
        ok 2
        ok 3
        ok 4
</pre>

  <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>

  <p>The idea for <tt>microperl</tt> came from Ilya Zakharevich,
  who produced a package called <tt>crazyperl</tt> very much along
  the same lines. What I've done, together with a lot of help from
  Jarkko Hietaniemi, is to make it easy to build, extend the number
  of systems it can work on, and keep up it to date with the
  changes as Perl develops.</p>

  <p>To understand how it works, however, we've got to go back to
  looking at how <tt>perl</tt> is built. Once <tt>Configure</tt>
  has tested the system and found everything it needs to know, it
  writes out its results to a shell file, <tt>config.sh</tt>. This
  file is then re-arranged into a C header file, <tt>config.h</tt>,
  and the rest of the Perl source files use the values from that as
  they are compiled.</p>

  <p>You can examine the <tt>config.sh</tt> file that was used to
  build your version of Perl through the <tt>Config</tt>
  module:</p>
  <pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use warnings;
    use strict;
    use Config qw(config_sh);
    print config_sh();
</pre>

  <p>This should print out something like the following:</p>
  <pre>
    archlibexp='/usr/local/lib/perl5/5.7.0/cygwin'
    archname='cygwin'
    cc='gcc'
    ccflags='-fno-strict-aliasing -I/usr/local/include'
    cppflags='-fno-strict-aliasing -I/usr/local/include'
    ...
</pre>

  <p>This tells us that this Perl will store its machine-specific
  modules in the directory
  <tt>/usr/local/lib/perl5/5.7.0/cygwin</tt>, that the architecture
  we're running on is <tt>cygwin</tt>, and the flags passed to the
  C compiler and C preprocessor respectively; you can find
  documentation on what the rest of the options mean with
  <tt>perldoc Config</tt>. You can use this to determine
  characteristics about the current Perl build:</p>
  <pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use warnings;
    use strict;
    use Config;
    ...
    if ($Config{use5005threads}) {
        # OK, we have threads:
        require Threads; import Threads;
        threading_child();
    } else {
        # Make do with fork:
        forking_child();
    }
</pre>

  <p><tt>microperl</tt> provides a <tt>config.sh</tt> which
  specifies the lowest common denominator: almost all optional
  items are turned off, all tests are set to have failed, and so
  on. We then build a version of Perl with this minimal
  configuration -- since Perl is able to cope with pretty much
  every combination that can be thrown at it, it does its best to
  work around everything that we claim is lacking.</p>

  <h3>Why?</h3>

  <p>What's the point? Is <tt>microperl</tt> anything more than a
  cool hack?</p>

  <p>Well, it certainly is a cool hack, and I quite like it just
  for that, but here are three real, practical uses for
  <tt>microperl</tt>.</p>

  <p>&bull; Hacking</p>

  <blockquote>
    When you're working on the Perl core, you'll naturally end up
    doing a load of tweaking, testing ideas, and so on. This means
    a lot of recompiling, and recompiling a full <tt>perl</tt> --
    or even just <tt>miniperl</tt> -- takes a lot of time.
    <tt>microperl</tt> builds fast. Furthermore, it's simple and
    uncluttered, and therefore useful for debugging and making
    patches; the <tt>microperl</tt> kit, if placed in a separate
    directory, would be a core of 71 files, (29 C program files)
    rather than the 1700-or-so files in a full Perl distribution.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    It's also great for checking out a fresh Perl distribution
    without having to take the time to plod through
    <tt>Configure</tt>; <tt>Configure</tt> is pretty slow, taking
    between ten and twenty minutes on my old machine.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    On top of this, because <tt>microperl</tt> assumes the absolute
    minimum permissible, it can help root out edge cases in the
    configure process -- if a function is used on the assumption
    that everyone has it, for instance. <tt>microperl</tt> has
    already found a few assumptions in the Perl source, and will
    hopefully guard against any more.
  </blockquote>

  <p>&bull; Porting</p>

  <blockquote>
    Because <tt>microperl</tt> is a lowest common denominator, it's
    very, very easy to port to new systems: you don't need to know
    anything about the characteristics of the system you're
    compiling on. Replace <tt>CC</tt> in <tt>Makefile.micro</tt>
    with a cross-compiler, and you can instantly port a version of
    Perl to another operating system. (In fact, this is what I'm
    doing to put Perl onto the Palm Pilot port of Linux, but there
    are a few wrinkles left to be smoothed.)
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Further, since you can build <tt>microperl</tt> with nothing
    other than a C compiler and <tt>make</tt>, it's useful for
    porting to systems which don't have <tt>sh</tt>, <tt>awk</tt>,
    <tt>grep</tt>, and all the other things <tt>Configure</tt>
    demands. Once you have experience of how <tt>config.sh</tt>
    works, you can build up a version of Perl by steadily adding
    features to <tt>microperl</tt>.
  </blockquote>

  <p>&bull; Bootstrapping</p>

  <blockquote>
    As mentioned before, we can theoretically use
    <tt>microperl</tt> to bootstrap a Perl build; the "steadily
    adding features" part mentioned above can be automated and run
    by the machine itself. Ideally, you'd unpack your Perl kit,
    type <tt>make</tt>, and a <tt>microperl</tt> would be built,
    which would run a Perl version of <tt>Configure</tt> and then
    build a full <tt>perl</tt>.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Now, when someone says "theoretically", they usually mean "not
    really", but let's have a look at a simple proof of concept.
    One of the tests we need to do is to examine the size of C
    integer storage:
  </blockquote>
  <pre>
    $ <b>./microperl.exe fixbytes.pl</b>
    Checking to see how big your integers are...
    ints are 4, longs are 4, shorts are 2
    Fixing uconfig.sh
    Reprocessing uconfig.sh
    Extracting uconfig.h (with variable substitutions)
    Making myself!
    cc -c -o uav.o -DPERL_CORE -DPERL_MICRO av.c
    ...
        cc -o microperl uav.o udeb.o udoio.o udoop.o udump.o 
        uglobals.o ugv.o uhv.o umg.o uperlmain.o uop.o uperl.o 
        uperlio.o uperly.o upp.o upp_ctl.o 
        upp_hot.o upp_sys.o uregcomp.o uregexec.o urun.o
        uscope.o usv.o utaint.o utoke.o uuniversal.o uutf8.o 
        uutil.o uperlapi.o -lm
    I'm still here.
</pre>

  <blockquote>
    Now we've built a new version of <tt>microperl</tt> using the
    information we've discovered. Here's the code which did that:
  </blockquote>
  <pre>
    require "bootstrap.pl";
    print "Checking to see how big your integers are...\n";
    open (OUT, "&gt;intsize.c") or die $!;
    print OUT &lt;&lt;'EOF';
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    int main()
    {
        printf("$intsize=%d;\n",   (int)sizeof(int)  );
        printf("$longsize=%d;\n",  (int)sizeof(long) );
        printf("$shortsize=%d;\n", (int)sizeof(short));
        exit(0);
    }
    EOF
    close OUT;
    system("cc -o intsize intsize.c");
    if (!-x "./intsize") { die "Didn't compile" }
    $sizes = './intsize';
    unlink "intsize", "intsize.c";
    eval $sizes;
    print "ints are $intsize, longs are $longsize, shorts are $shortsize\n";
    changeit ( intsize   =&gt; $intsize,
              longsize  =&gt; $longsize,
              shortsize =&gt; $shortsize
    );
    rebuild();
</pre>

  <blockquote>
    Of course, it'll take a lot of work before we can bootstrap
    Perl to the same degree as an ordinary <tt>Configure</tt> run.
    But I'll get there!
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Problems</h3>

  <p>The major problem I've had developing <tt>microperl</tt> is
  that the definitions that <tt>config.sh</tt> needs to provide to
  <tt>config.h</tt> constantly change, and so I've had to add new
  entries to <tt>microperl</tt>'s <tt>config.sh</tt>.</p>

  <p>To avoid doing this manually, I wrote a little Perl program
  that checks for undefined symbols during the <tt>make</tt>
  process and attempts to divine what they should be for
  <tt>microperl</tt>, adds in the relevant entries to
  <tt>config.sh</tt> and tries again. It's a crude future-proofing,
  but it saves me a lot of work.</p>

  <p>Apart from that, it's been a question of re-arranging things
  in the Perl core to make them more friendly to completely
  impotent configurations like <tt>microperl</tt>'s: signal
  handling, for instance, had to be excised, and file modes such as
  <tt>O_CREAT</tt> generated for systems without the relevant
  system header files.</p>

  <h3>The Future</h3>

  <p>Where do I see <tt>microperl</tt> going? Hopefully, it'll one
  day be more than just a toy for me. It's certainly useful for
  anyone working on the Perl core to quickly check out their
  changes or Perl's operation; it's good for people learning the
  internals of Perl because it strips away everything but the
  essentials. I'd like to see it building itself and hopefully
  making an attack on the current <tt>Configure</tt> system.</p>

  <p>But no matter what happens to it, it's still a neat
  hack.</p><b>_ _END_ _</b><br>
