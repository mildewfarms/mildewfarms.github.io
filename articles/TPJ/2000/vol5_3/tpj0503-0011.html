  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>Working in the Microsoft world of Windows, Office, Visual
  Basic, and loosely structured user documents, there are a few
  problems that regularly appear where you'd like to use Perl to
  tweak a piece of data or perform some task, but can't, because
  you're deep in the Microsoft way of doing things. Normally this
  level of integration is hard to achieve, but this article
  describes how you can grab just that little bit of Perl when you
  want it using tools from ActiveState's Perl Development Kit.</p>

  <p>Microsoft tools tend to integrate well with other Microsoft
  tools, and not at all with anything else. And when it comes to
  writing code, you're often forced to use VB or a derivative,
  which is not an ideal tool for manipulating text. But invoking
  your favorite bit of Perl, simply and transparently, deep within
  the internals of Excel, Word, VB and the like is now much easier,
  thanks to ActiveState's PerlCOM and PerlCtrl, parts of their Perl
  Development Kit.</p>

  <p>This article is describes a scenario in which a complete Perl
  solution (using an external Perl script to automate Office)
  wasn't appropriate, but a hybrid Perl/non-Perl approach was, and
  how PerlCOM made that hybrid solution almost trivially
  simple.</p>

  <p><b>Warning:</b> There is VB code in the following example.
  It's the subject of the article, so I can't really skip it. You
  shouldn't need to know VB in order to read the examples; they're
  fairly simple, and as long as you get the gist of what the VB
  code does, you'll be fine.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>

  <p>More frequently than we'd prefer, UK telephone numbers are
  subject to wide-reaching changes combined with promises that
  "this will be the last time." The most recent of these changes is
  the overnight change to London and five other city codes,
  covering over a quarter of the UK population, and all mobile and
  pager numbers. (See <a href="http://www.numberchange.org/"
  target="resource window">http://www.numberchange.org/</a> for the
  gritty details.) For the sake of this article, I'll limit the
  discussion to just the London numbers, for which the seven-digit
  local codes became eight-digit codes overnight:</p>
  <pre>
  0171 xxx xxxx (Central London) becomes 020 7xxx xxxx

  0181 xxx xxxx (Outer London) becomes 020 8xxx xxxx
</pre>

  <p>In any large company, there are plenty of data sources that
  need updating, and it's the semi-structured and unstructured data
  sources that are hardest to change.</p>

  <p>Databases with proper telephone number fields, where area
  codes and numbers are properly separated, are easy to change with
  one-time scripts. The trouble arises in the messy areas: text
  files, word processing documents, and all those ubiquitous
  spreadsheets (I work for investment banks; I've seen people write
  essays in Microsoft Excel because "it's the only program I
  understand"). If you just blindly modify every cell, you risk
  converting data that shouldn't really be touched.</p>

  <h3>The Problem</h3>

  <p>We have quite a few spreadsheets (such as telephone books)
  with contact information scattered throughout. Many of these had
  old-style (seven-digit) Central London telephone numbers, or were
  loosely formatted:</p>

  <table border="0" cellpadding="3">
    <tr>
      <td><small>Tim Meadowcroft</small></td>

      <td><small>220 8537</small></td>

      <td><small>(0171 implied)</small></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><small>Reception</small></td>

      <td><small>8000</small></td>

      <td><small>(0171 220 implied)</small></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><small>Tim's Fax</small></td>

      <td><small>220-8375/6/7</small></td>

      <td><small>(0171 implied, multiple numbers)</small></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><small>Tim's Department</small></td>

      <td><small>800 0001</small></td>

      <td><small>(not a phone number, but a department
      code)</small></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>This is easy to convert with a cute application of a Perl
  regular expression or two. The usual approach is to automate
  Excel with Win32::OLE,(OLE Automation is a system where Microsoft
  exposes all the innards of an application so that programs able
  to talk to OLE objects can operate the application. This is very
  powerful for the right type of problem, and the Win32::OLE module
  makes this possible. Effectively, your program drives the
  application, rather than the application invoking your
  program.)but then my standalone script isn't interacting with the
  user, and I don't want to just blindly modify all cells, which
  would cause a problem with the last example above. I could
  automate Excel and make it ask the user before each modification,
  but that would be tedious. What I'd really like to do is let the
  user control the process from within Excel, let them select the
  cells they'd like to modify, and then invoke my conversion script
  on all those cells, whether it's one or a thousand.</p>

  <p>Microsoft provides a built-in programming environment for
  this, using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) as an embedded
  scripting language based on VB (it used to be a subset, but now
  it has extra features and is best considered a different, but
  related, product). VBA, being embedded in Office tools, is great
  for putting a "fix the selected cells" button on the Excel
  Toolbar, but not so great for actually coding the change, as
  anyone who's tried to write text manipulation code in VB will
  tell you.(The pedantic might note that the later versions of
  VBScript have a RegExp object, which should be callable from VBA,
  but after a couple of hours downloading and registering objects I
  still couldn't call it from Excel. And there are plenty of other
  problems where Perl is going to be "just right" anyway.)</p>

  <p>The basic VBA routine is as simple as shown below. This is
  written within Excel, and so can be easily attached to a new
  button on an Excel toolbar. It loops over all the cells that are
  currently selected, and calls a <tt>FixPhone()</tt> function with
  the contents of the cell. <tt>FixPhone()</tt> returns a empty
  string if it can't convert the string, or the new value if it
  can. We then either replace the cell contents, or highlight it to
  signal an error to the user. Now we just need to write
  <tt>FixPhone()</tt>.</p>
  <pre>

  Sub FixPhoneOnSelection()
    On Error Resume Next
    If TypeOf Selection Is Range Then
        'we don't try to fix a chart, ... just cells
        Dim c As Range
        For Each c In Selection.Cells
            If Not IsEmpty(c.Value) Then
                dim t as string
                t = FixPhone(c.Text)
                If t &lt;&gt; "" Then
                    ' replace cell with new value - remove coloring
                    c.Value = t
                    c.Interior.ColorIndex = xlNone
                Else
                    ' leave cell alone, but color it to show error
                    c.Interior.Color = RGB(255, 255, 0)
                End If
            End If
        Next
    End If
  End Sub
</pre>

  <h3>The Solution</h3>

  <p>Perl programmers are probably thinking that the ideal solution
  would be to spawn a Perl script and capture the output, using
  backticks or a similar mechanism, but unfortunately VB isn't very
  good at things like spawning a process and capturing and parsing
  the STDOUT stream. It can call DLLs, but stumbles if the call is
  complicated, and mapping parameter and return types can be
  complex and error-prone. But one thing it can do very well is
  make and use COM or OLE objects.</p>

  <p>OLE was the original name for a compound document technology
  Microsoft wrote. As OLE evolved, COM was written as a Component
  Object Model technology that OLE could be based upon. At this
  stage, the naming got a bit complex as Microsoft started
  referring to "OLE objects", "COM objects", "OLE technologies",
  and then also introduced the "ActiveX" name to mean the whole
  OLE/COM arena as it affected component developers. Nowadays it is
  easiest, and approximately correct, to consider all the names as
  interchangeable, with COM being the core name.</p>

  <p>PerlCOM, part of the ActiveState Perl Development Kit, exposes
  a generic Perl interpreter as a COM object -- that is, an
  "object" as defined by most OO definitions (a combined chunk of
  data and functionality with a callable interface) -- that can be
  used by any environment that "talks COM". Functions defined in a
  Perl script, when given to the PerlCOM object, appear as methods
  on that PerlCOM object. They can be simply called from VB with
  parameters properly mapped and return values properly
  returned.</p>Given a <tt>FixPhone()</tt> function, the VB to make
  and invoke the relevant Perl is shown here:
  <pre>
  sub FixPhone( byval text as string ) as string
    'Declare an object variable and make an instance of PerlCOM
    Dim perlObj as Object
    Set perlObj = CreateObject("PerlCOM.Script")

    'OK then, check it worked
    If perlObj Is Nothing Then
        MsgBox ("Sorry, No PerlCOM on this machine")
        exit
    End If

    'Create Perl routine
    Call perlObj.EvalScript("sub FixPhone { return '020 7'.$_[0]; }")

    'Invoke my perl subroutine
    Dim t as String
    t = perlObj.FixPhone(text)
    FixPhone = t
  end sub
</pre>

  <p>Notice that for the sake of simplicity, we make a PerlCOM
  object, give it a small inline script to parse, and then we can
  invoke the Perl function we want as a new method on the PerlCOM
  object.</p>

  <p>From here, writing a bit of Perl to fix up the numbers is
  fairly simple. The neat thing is the tidy way that I can invoke a
  Perl subroutine as if it were VB, by creating new methods on a
  COM object.</p>

  <p>Of course, in the real code I don't want to make a new Perl
  interpreter and then destroy it for every cell, so I hide the
  "create the Perl object and initialize the code" in a separate
  routine that creates the object on first invocation and caches it
  thereafter:</p>
  <pre>

  function GetMyPerlObj as Object
    'Declare an object variable and make it on first call only
    static perlObj as Object
    if perlObj is nothing then
      Set perlObj = CreateObject("PerlCOM.Script")

      'OK then, check it worked
      If perlObj Is Nothing Then
        MsgBox ("Sorry, no PerlCOM on this machine")
        exit
      End If

      'Make a nice Perl routine 
      Call perlObj.EvalScript("sub FixPhone { return '020 7'.$_[0]; }")
    end if

    ' this is how you return a value in VB...
    set GetMyPerlObj = perlObj
  end function
 
</pre>and then, in the original routine, where I had
  <pre>
  t = FixPhone(c.Text)
</pre>I can now simply call
  <pre>
  t = GetMyPerlObj.FixPhone( c.text )
</pre>

  <p>Those with a purist OO background may raise complaints here
  that a COM object is effectively changing its interface by having
  new methods made suddenly available. Well, that's how it's done
  in the COM world. It looks a little unusual, but anyone who's
  used to <tt>AUTOLOAD</tt> methods in Perl shouldn't have a
  problem reading the code.</p>

  <p>To do the same from Microsoft Word (or Powerpoint, or
  Publisher, or Visio, or any other VBA enabled product) you simply
  write a new outer routine that grabs and modifies the appropriate
  selected item.</p>

  <p>An example for Word is shown below (this assumes the same
  <tt>GetMyPerlObj</tt> function has been included).</p>
  <pre>

  Sub FixPhoneOnWordSelection()
    If Selection.Text &lt;&gt; "" Then
      Dim t As String
      t = GetMyPerlObj.FixPhone(Selection.Text)
      If t &lt;&gt; "" Then
          ' replace selection with new value
          Selection.Text = t
      Else
          ' couldn't convert - pop up a message
          MsgBox ("Couldn't find a suitable phone number to convert")
      End If
    End If
  End Sub
</pre>

  <p>This is a much simpler routine than the Excel example, as
  there's only one selection to fix, and no cells to enumerate.
  Accordingly, I've decided to report errors directly to the user,
  whereas in the Excel code I changed the coloring of cells to
  indicate errors. (This is important: if the user selects the
  wrong column for changes, you don't want him or her to have to
  dismiss a thousand dialog boxes, one for each cell.)</p>

  <p>And for those of you who are really interested, the Perl code
  I actually used to fix up our phone numbers (as opposed to the
  trivial version above) looked like this. It's not very complex
  and it doesn't solve everything, but it saved us a lot of time
  converting a lot of numbers.</p>
  <pre>
 # Tests:
 #  020 xxxx xxxx : fine as is
 #  xxx xxxx      : assume 020 7xxx xxxx
 #  2xxx          : Building 1 extension, assume 020 7457 2xxx
 #  8xxx          : Building 2 extension, assume 020 7220 8xxx
 #  0171 xxx xxxx : convert to 020 7xxx xxxx
 #  0181 xxx xxxx : convert to 020 8xxx xxxx
 # Anything else is an error and should be hand converted....
 #
 sub FixPhone {
     local $_ = shift;
     return $_ if /^020 \d{4} \d{4}$/;
     return $_ if s/^\s*(\d{3})[-\s]+(\d{4})\s*$/020 7$1 $2/;
     return $_ if s/^\s*(\d{3})[-\s]+(\d{4})[-\s]+(\d{4})\s*$/$1 $2 $3/;
     return $_ if s/^\s*(2\d{3})\s*$/020 7457 $1/;
     return $_ if s/^\s*(8\d{3})\s*$/020 7220 $1/;
     return $_ if s/^\s*0171[-\s]+(\d{3})[-\s]+(\d{4})\s*$/020 7$1 $2/;
     return $_ if s/^\s*0181[-\s]+(\d{3})[-\s]+(\d{4})\s*$/020 8$1 $2/;
     return '';
 }
</pre>

  <h3>But Wait, There's More</h3>

  <p>PerlCOM exposes much more than what I've shown here. It
  provides simple mechanisms for loading modules and calling
  functions in a scalar or array context. It can make and return
  instances of a Perl object, and even makes the raw Hash datatype
  available to poor VB programmers who've suffered with the
  atrocious Collection class for so long:</p>
  <pre>
  dim hash as Object
  set hash = perlObj.CreateHash   'imagine this as $hash = { };
  hash.name = "Tim"              '$hash{name} = "Tim"
  hash.surname = "Meadowcroft"
</pre>

  <p>As wordy as this is, it's nothing compared to a VB Collection
  object!</p>

  <p>For the examples I've shown so far, I needed a licensed PDK on
  the machine where I'm running the scripts. But if I wanted to
  make a VB/Perl hybrid that I could distribute to others, what
  would I do?</p>

  <p>The PDK also includes PerlCtrl, which makes ActiveX components
  from a script. Whereas PerlCOM exposes a generic Perl
  interpreter, PerlCtrl wraps up a selected script into an ActiveX
  DLL(There's that jargon again. An ActiveX DLL is a Dynamically
  Linked Library containing one or more COM objects. It registers
  itself under Windows so that when someone asks for an instance of
  the appropriate object, Windows knows how to load the DLL and
  create the object automatically without the caller needing to
  know where the object came from.) that can be distributed freely
  and invoked in a manner similar to the above example (but without
  the <tt>EvalScript()</tt> call).</p>

  <p>I won't go into much detail about PerlCtrl. When you've
  written some useful functions (say, invoking WWW::Search on the
  selected words in a document) that you want to use from inside
  some visually pretty (but feature poor) VB GUI, PerlCtrl comes in
  handy. Much like PerlApp compiles a Perl script into a
  stand-alone EXE file, PerlCtrl compiles Perl code into DLL
  components.</p>

  <p>And PerlApp is thrown in with the PDK too. Unix hackers may
  well wonder what all the fuss is about, but for those of us
  locked behind Windows it's a breath of fresh air.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>If you start working with the innards of Microsoft products,
  you're going to need some help. In the "integrate with anything
  as long as it's Microsoft" world of Win32 programming, which a
  lot of us unfortunately inhabit, the COM integration that the PDK
  offers is well worth the $95.</p>_ _END_ _<br>
