  <p>Convergence! The latest buzzword of the dot com era.
  Convergence is the magical integration of the desktop computer,
  the Internet, television, radio, and the telephone. In the words
  of the industry pundits, convergence will change everything, and
  the technology hailed as the forerunner of convergence is IP
  telephony, which allows you to make long distance calls with
  nothing more than an Internet connection and a high quality sound
  card.</p>

  <p>I hate being left behind on the technology curve, so I decided
  to write my own IP telephone application in Perl. It isn't
  elegant, and it lacks most of the functions of real IP telephony
  applications, but it works. In this article, I'll show you the
  two versions of the application: a simple one which requires
  ISDN-speed connections to work well, and a somewhat more
  sophisticated version that uses the MP3 format to reduce the
  bitrate for slower connections.</p><font size="+1">Soundcards and
  <font face="courier new"><b>/dev/dsp</b></font></font>

  <p>IP telephony requires three things:</p>

  <p>1. Reading sound data from the microphone</p>

  <p>2. Writing sound data to the system speaker</p>

  <p>3. Moving sound data across the network</p>

  <p>We know how to do item three with Berkeley sockets, but what
  about items one and two?</p>

  <p>On Unix systems, the answer is simple. Audio-capable Unix
  systems have a special device file for communicating with the
  digital signal processor (DSP) driver. Common names include
  <tt>/dev/dsp</tt>, <tt>/dev/audio</tt>, and <tt>/dev/sound</tt>.
  Just open the device like an ordinary file, read from it to
  capture sound data from the microphone, and write to it to send
  sound data to the speaker.</p>

  <p>The programs in this article runs on Linux systems, and
  assumes the sound device is named <tt>/dev/dsp</tt>. Linux sound
  drivers are available from a number of sources, including the
  kernel itself and an open source project called ALSA (for
  Advanced Linux Sound Architecture, available at <a href=
  "http://www.alsa-project.org" target=
  "resource window">http://www.alsa-project.org</a>). A commercial
  vendor called 4Front Technologies sells an inexpensive package of
  sound drivers that work with a large number of sound cards on a
  variety of Unix operating systems, including FreeBSD, Solaris,
  HPUX, and AIX (<a href="http://www.opensound.com" target=
  "resource window">http://www.opensound.com</a>). Although I
  haven't tested it, the program should work fine on any system
  equipped with the 4Front drivers.</p>

  <p>Only duplex-capable sound cards are suitable for telephony,
  because a telephone isn't much good if it can't send and receive
  at the same time. The sound <i>driver</i> must also support
  duplex operation, something that gave me a great deal of trouble
  on my Linux laptop until I discovered that the ALSA driver for my
  sound card lacked duplex support.</p>

  <p>When you read from <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> (or equivalent), the data
  is usually returned in PCM (pulse code modulation) format.
  Incoming sound is sampled at some number of times per second, and
  the amplitude of the sound is reported as a positive integer.
  Typical sampling rates range from 4000 Hz (samples per second) to
  44,100 Hz. Each sample may be 8 or 16 bits and may be mono (one
  channel) or stereo (two channels). To send sound data from one
  sound card to another, the drivers for both cards have to be
  configured to accept data at the same sampling rate, sample size,
  and number of channels.</p>

  <p>Unix provides a set of <tt>ioctl</tt> calls that let you
  adjust the sound card properties. More portably, you can use Seth
  Johnson's Audio::DSP module (available on CPAN) to change the
  sound settings for OSS and ALSA drivers. Unfortunately, Seth's
  module doesn't provide the direct filehandle access that we
  require for the more sophisticated telephony application, as we
  shall see later.</p>

  <p>I don't know anything about working with audio on Win32 or
  Macintosh platforms. Please let me know if there's a way to do
  this.</p>

  <h3>The Simple Version</h3>

  <p>The simple version of the application is shown in Listings 1
  and 2. There are two programs: You run <tt>simple_send.pl</tt> to
  place a call, and <tt>simple_recv.pl</tt> to accept incoming
  connections. <tt>simple_recv.pl</tt> has to be running on the
  destination machine in order for <tt>simple_send.pl</tt> to
  work.</p>

  <p>Here's what <tt>simple_send.pl</tt> looks like when running on
  my laptop, which is named <tt>pesto</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
  pesto&gt; <b>simple_send.pl prego.lsjs.org</b>
  Connected, go ahead...
</pre>

  <p>And here's what <tt>simple_recv.pl</tt> looks like, running on
  my desktop machine, <tt>prego</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
  prego&gt; <b>simple_recv.pl</b>
  waiting for a connection...
  accepting connection from 192.168.3.2
</pre>

  <p>As soon as a connection is established, the two programs
  activate their audio systems, and you can conduct a telephone
  conversation across the network. It's particularly cool across my
  home wireless network -- like a high-tech walkie-talkie!</p>

  <p>Halting the conversation is very crude in my current version.
  One or the other of the parties must kill the application with
  the interrupt key.</p>

  <p>Conceptually, both programs are simple. They first establish a
  network connection using the IO::Socket interface. They then open
  up the DSP. Audio data read from the DSP is sent to the remote
  host via the socket, and data received from the socket is written
  to the DSP. The primary difference between the two programs is
  that <tt>simple_send.pl</tt> actively establishes the connection,
  while <tt>simple_recv.pl</tt> passively waits for incoming
  connections. The conversation itself is two way: both programs
  send and receive audio data.</p>

  <p><tt>simple_send.pl</tt> is the simpler of the two, so let's
  walk through it first. It's shown in <a href=
  "tpj0503-0002a.html">Listing 1</a>, which we'll walk through line
  by line.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0503-0002a.html">Listing 1.
  <tt>simple_send.pl</tt></a></p>

  <p>Lines 1-3: Load modules</p>

  <blockquote>
    We turn on strict type checking and load the IO::File and
    IO::Socket modules, providing an object-oriented interface to
    filehandles.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 4-5: Define constants</p>

  <blockquote>
    We pick an arbitrary buffer size for buffering data passing
    between the network and the sound device. We also define a
    constant for the path to the DSP device.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Line 6: <tt>sigCHLD</tt> handler</p>

  <blockquote>
    Later you will see that when we establish a connection, we fork
    so that one process can read from the sound card while the
    other one writes to it. The <tt>CHLD</tt> handler helps ensure
    that when one process dies, the other dies with it.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 7-10: Set up socket</p>

  <blockquote>
    We get the name and port of the destination machine from the
    command line, and call IO::Socket::INET's <tt>new()</tt> method
    to establish a connection. If successful, this returns a socket
    object for communication with the remote host.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Line 11: Open DSP</p>

  <blockquote>
    We use IO::File to open the digital signal processor driver in
    read/write mode, using a file access mode of <tt>r+</tt> for
    this purpose.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 12-13: Fork</p>

  <blockquote>
    We call <tt>fork</tt> to separate our work among two processes.
    The parent process will read from the socket and write to the
    sound card, while the child performs the opposite task. In the
    parent process, the value returned by <tt>fork</tt> will be the
    process number of the child. In the child process, the value
    returned by <tt>fork</tt> is zero.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 14-17: Parent process</p>

  <blockquote>
    The parent process is a tight loop, which reads
    <tt>BUFSIZE</tt> bytes of data from the socket and immediately
    sends it to the DSP using <tt>print</tt>. If the read from the
    socket returns 0, indicating that the remote end has hung up,
    we kill the child by sending it a <tt>TERM</tt> signal, and
    exit.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 18-20: Child process</p>

  <blockquote>
    The child has the opposite task. It reads from the sound card
    and writes to the socket until either an error occurs while
    reading, or the parent kills it.
  </blockquote>

  <p>The receiver application, <tt>simple_recv.pl</tt>, has a
  slightly harder job because it has to wait for an incoming
  connection, dispatch it, and then wait for another. Only one
  connection will be handled at a time because there's only one
  microphone and speaker system.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0503-0002b.html">Listing 2.
  <tt>simple_recv.pl</tt></a></p>

  <p>Lines 1-3: Load modules</p>

  <blockquote>
    We turn on strict type checking and load the IO::Socket and
    IO::File modules as before.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 4-6: Define constants and <tt>CHLD</tt> handler</p>

  <blockquote>
    We define the <tt>DSP</tt> and <tt>BUFSIZE</tt> constants as
    before. We will also be forking when incoming connections come
    in, but in this case we don't want to terminate the parent
    process. We simply wait on the child process in order to reap
    its status code (which we ignore). Otherwise we will accumulate
    zombie processes; see the <tt>perlipc</tt> documentation
    bundled with Perl for more details.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 7-10: Open listening socket</p>

  <blockquote>
    We get the port number from the command line, or assume a
    default. We call <tt>IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new()</tt> to create
    a listening socket, passing it values for the local port, the
    size of the listen queue, and the <tt>Reuse</tt> flag, which
    prevents problems reopening the socket when the server is
    killed and immediately relaunched.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 11-20: Main accept loop</p>

  <blockquote>
    We enter an infinite loop. Each time through the loop we print
    a message and call the socket's <tt>accept</tt> method, which
    blocks until an incoming connection is received. When this
    happens, <tt>accept</tt> returns a connected socket. We print
    out an informational message containing the dotted IP address
    of the remote host, and open a filehandle on the DSP in the
    same manner as before. If the open is unsuccessful, we print a
    warning message and hang up. Otherwise we call
    <tt>handle_connect()</tt> to do the data transfer.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 22-26: <tt>handle_connection()</tt></p>

  <blockquote>
    The <tt>handle_connection()</tt>subroutine works a lot like the
    main section of <tt>simple_send.pl</tt>. After forking, our
    parent process handles copying data from the socket to the DSP,
    while the child process handles the reverse operation.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 27-33: Parent process</p>

  <blockquote>
    The part of the subroutine that handles the parent process is
    very slightly different from the corresponding section of
    <tt>simple_send.pl</tt>. Instead of terminating when the user
    hits the interrupt key, we want to intercept this fact,
    gracefully close the connection, and go back to listening for a
    new connection.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    In order to achieve this, we use an <tt>eval{}</tt> block as an
    exception handler. The <tt>eval{}</tt> creates a local INT
    signal handler which simply calls <tt>die</tt>. This is
    followed by the tight read/write loop that we saw before. When
    the user hits the interrupt key, the <tt>eval{}</tt> block
    terminates with <tt>die</tt>, and execution resumes with the
    next statement following the block. We close the socket, send a
    <tt>TERM</tt> signal to the child, and return from
    <tt>handle_connection()</tt> to resume the main <tt>accept</tt>
    loop.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 34-38: Child process</p>

  <blockquote>
    The child process is identical to the one in
    <tt>simple_send.pl</tt>, except that we close our copy of the
    listening socket since we won't be needing it.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Adding an MP3 Encoder</h3>

  <p>This pair of programs works great across a LAN or a fast
  Internet connection. However, the conversation breaks up
  periodically on slower connections. The default sample rate for
  <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> is 8 kHz at one byte per sample, monoaural,
  which means that the connection must support at least 8000 * 8 =
  64,000 bits per second for one way communication and 128,000 bits
  per second for duplex communication. This can only be achieved
  with a really good dual-channel ISDN connection, or a DSL, cable,
  or leased line. Making matters worse, the connection must sustain
  this speed even if nobody's talking, because a second of silence
  generates just as much data as a second of conversation. Slower
  connections cannot keep up with these requirements.</p>

  <p>There are several ways to reduce the bandwidth requirements.
  We could reduce the sampling rate and sacrifice the audio
  quality, but 8 kHz is already pretty low. We could apply a
  general compression algorithm, such as <i>gzip</i>, to the data
  stream. However, audio data is relatively uncompressible with
  text-oriented algorithms like <i>gzip</i> due to the noisy,
  rapidly-varying nature of the data. Or we could redesign the
  application entirely, using discontinuous UDP packets rather than
  a continuous TCP stream and adjusting the UDP transmission rate
  dynamically to meet bandwidth availability. This is how it's done
  in the voice-over-IP (VoIP) protocol, which is popular in
  commercial IP telephony applications.</p>

  <p>For fun, I tried a different approach. The popular MP3 audio
  compression format can achieve 10:1 or greater compression of
  audio streams. Furthermore, there are a number of Unix
  command-line tools for compressing and decompressing MP3s. My
  favorites are <i>mpg123</i> (<a href=
  "http://www.sfs.nphil.uni-tuebingen.de/~hipp/mpg123.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.sfs.nphil.uni-tuebingen.de/~hipp/mpg123.html</a>)
  for decompressing and playing MP3s, and <i>lame</i> (<a href=
  "http://www.sulaco.org/mp3" target=
  "resource window">http://www.sulaco.org/mp3</a>) for creating
  them. In principle, one can simply interpose <i>lame</i> between
  the DSP and the socket in order to compress the data, and
  uncompress it at the other end using <i>mpg123</i>. Although this
  will not work for reasons described below, conceptually we would
  want to open up two pipes:</p>
  <pre>
  open COMPRESS,   "lame - - &lt;/dev/dsp |";
  open UNCOMPRESS, "| mpg123 -s &gt;/dev/dsp";
</pre>

  <p>The first pipe reads <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> and passes it to
  <i>lame</i> for MP3 encoding. The encoded data is written to
  standard output, where it is piped to our program. We would read
  from it like this:</p>
  <pre>
  print $socket $data while sysread(COMPRESS, $data, BUFSIZE);
</pre>

  <p>The second pipe tells <i>mpg123</i> to read MP3-encoded data
  from our program, uncompress it into PCM data, and write it to
  <tt>/dev/dsp</tt>. We'd use it like this:</p>
  <pre>
  print UNCOMPRESS $data while sysread($sock, $data, BUFSIZE);
</pre>

  <p>However, when I tried this, I found a couple of hitches. One
  is that <i>lame</i> will not accept 8-bit PCM data, requiring
  16-bit data sampled at 16 kHz or higher. This was solved by
  calling the proper <tt>ioctl</tt>s to put the DSP into the proper
  mode. The other hitch is that some sound drivers do not allow you
  to open the <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> driver twice, so the
  straightforward strategy of opening two pipes would not work. I
  solved that one by opening <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> once read/write, and
  then reopening <tt>STDIN</tt> and <tt>STDOUT</tt> on it, so that
  <i>lame</i> and <i>mpg123</i> wouldn't try to open
  <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> a second time.</p>

  <p>To simplify matters, I put all the DSP-manipulating code in a
  self-contained module named DSP.pm, shown in <a href=
  "tpj0503-0002c.html">Listing 3</a>. The module is
  object-oriented. You create a new DSP handle by calling
  <tt>DSP-&gt;new</tt>. The object that is returned is a read/write
  IO handle attached to <tt>/dev/dsp</tt>. The <tt>compress()</tt>
  method returns a pipe that you can read from to retrieve
  MP3-compressed audio date. The <tt>uncompress()</tt> method
  returns a second pipe that you can write MP3 data to. The data
  will be uncompressed and sent to the speakers. The following
  example reads MP3-compressed data from the microphone and
  immediately writes it back to the speaker, creating an awful
  racket:</p>
  <pre>
  my $dsp = DSP-&gt;new;
  my $compress = $dsp-&gt;compress;
  my $uncompress = $dsp-&gt;uncompress;
  print $uncompress $data while 
                        sysread($compress, $data, 1024);
</pre>

  <p><a href="tpj0503-0002c.html">Listing 3. <tt>DSP.pm</tt>
  module</a></p>

  <p>Lines 1-5: Module setup stuff.</p>

  <blockquote>
    The module begins by bringing in the modules we need. We
    inherit from IO::Handle to get all the available
    object-oriented filehandle methods.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 6-10: Load <tt>ioctl</tt> definitions</p>

  <blockquote>
    We need to call a set of <tt>ioctl</tt>s to configure the sound
    card driver. The constants for these <tt>ioctl</tt>s are
    available in the file <tt>sys/soundcard.ph</tt>. If you don't
    already have this file in your Perl library directory, you'll
    need to run <tt>h2ph</tt> on your system's include files, as
    described in the documentation for <tt>h2ph</tt> bundled with
    Perl.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Many <tt>ioctl</tt> constants are calculated using a hash
  called <tt>%sizeof</tt>, which contains the sizes of various
  system-specific data types, such as integers. Although this is
  not well-documented, you have to create <tt>%sizeof</tt> before
  loading any <tt>.ph</tt> file that depends on it. A quick
  examination of <tt>soundcard.ph</tt> showed that it needs to know
  the size of <tt>int</tt>. Rather than code this in a nonportable
  way, we get the size of <tt>int</tt> from Perl's <tt>Config</tt>
  module and use it to initialize a global variable named
  <tt>%sizeof</tt> before loading the <tt>.ph</tt> file.</p>

  <p>Lines 11-15: Constants</p>

  <blockquote>
    We declare a constant for the path to the DSP device special
    file, and constants containing the invocations of the
    <i>lame</i> MP3 encoder and the <i>mpg123</i> MP3 decoder. The
    various command-line options passed to <i>lame</i> specify
    PCM-format input, monaural sound, a maximum bitrate of 32 kbs,
    a sample rate of 16 kHz, and standard input and output for
    input and output. The only complication here is the <tt>-x</tt>
    flag, which must be set for little-endian architectures so that
    <i>lame</i> will byteswap the incoming PCM data. We determine
    the endian-ness of our architecture on the fly by looking at
    <tt>$Config{byteorder}</tt>.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    The flags to <i>mpg123</i> specify monaural sound and tell the
    program to send uncompressed PCM data to standard output.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 16-23: <tt>new()</tt> method</p>

  <blockquote>
    The <tt>new()</tt> method opens the DSP for reading and
    writing. After successfully opening the device special file, we
    call <tt>ioctl</tt> three times. The first call sets the sample
    size to 16 bits (2 bytes). The second call sets the sampling
    rate to 16 kHz, and the third puts the DSP into monaural mode
    by setting the <tt>STEREO</tt> flag to false. Notice that the
    second argument to each <tt>ioctl</tt> call is a constant
    defined in <tt>sys/soundcard.ph</tt>, while the third is a
    packed integer.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    We return the handle, blessed into the DSP class.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 25-32: <tt>compress()</tt> method</p>

  <blockquote>
    The <tt>compress()</tt> method will return a pipe suitable for
    reading MP3-compressed data. The trick here is to replace
    <tt>STDIN</tt> with the DSP handle, so that <i>lame</i> takes
    its input from <tt>/dev/dsp</tt>, reading directly from the
    microphone. We save the current value of <tt>STDIN</tt> in a
    temporary filehandle, and then reopen <tt>STDIN</tt> onto the
    <tt>DSP</tt> filehandle, using the object-oriented
    <tt>fdopen()</tt> method. We now call
    <tt>IO::File-&gt;new()</tt> to open the <i>lame</i> pipe. We
    restore <tt>STDIN</tt>, and return the pipe to the caller.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lines 35-44: <tt>uncompress()</tt> method</p>

  <blockquote>
    The <tt>uncompress()</tt> method will return a pipe suitable

    current value of <tt>STDOUT</tt> in a temporary filehandle, we
    reopen it onto the DSP, and call <tt>IO::File-&gt;new()</tt> to
    open the <i>mpg123</i> pipe. We don't want data getting held up
    in standard IO buffering, so we activate the pipe's autoflush
    property. After restoring <tt>STDOUT</tt>, we return the pipe
    to the caller.

  <p>Listings <a href="tpj0503-0002d.html">4</a> and <a href=
  "tpj0503-0002e.html">5</a> show <tt>mp3_send.pl</tt> and
  <tt>mp3_recv.pl</tt>, versions of the earlier simple scripts
  modified to transmit MP3-encoded audio streams. Because they're
  nearly identical, we don't need to walk through them again. There
  are two important changes:</p>

  <p>1. Instead of opening <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> directly, the scripts
  load the DSP.pm module and create a new <tt>DSP</tt> object.</p>

  <p>2. Instead of writing or reading to <tt>/dev/dsp</tt>
  directly, the scripts invoke the DSP object's <tt>compress()</tt>
  and <tt>uncompress()</tt> method to retrieve the filehandles for
  reading and writing.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the scripts are identical to the simple
  versions.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, when I tested these scripts on my LAN, I
  discovered an annoying one-to-two second delay between speaking
  into the microphone at one end and hearing the sound at the
  other. Although the MP3 encoder and decoder can keep up with the
  data, there seems to be some latency. Perhaps the encoder needs
  to accumulate a certain amount of buffered sound data before it
  will encode it, or perhaps I just need faster computers. The main
  testing platform was a pair of 300 MHz Pentium II desktops. In
  any case, I couldn't eliminate this delay by playing with the
  script's transmission buffer, and the delay is long enough to
  make a normal conversation very difficult.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the program does allow voice transmissions in
  real time across slow network connections. Although the nominal
  MP3 bitstream rate is 32 kilobits, in practice less bandwidth is
  required because of the long pauses in speech. I expect it to
  work between two moderately well-connected sites on the Internet,
  and perhaps even between hosts connected by 56K modems. Although
  it doesn't make much of an IP telephone, you could use the system
  as an intercom, a baby monitor, or just surprise your work
  associates by suddenly speaking to them from an idle
  computer!</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>With a little ingenuity and a dab of Perl, you can turn your
  desktop into an IP telephony platform. Getting IP telephony to
  work across fast network connections is easy, but working with
  limited bandwidth is more of a challenge.</p>

  <p>These scripts are the mere beginnings of a real application.
  They need all the bells and whistles, such as a built-in
  telephone directory, an auto-dial function, a way to screen
  calls, and cute little sound effects for the dialtone, busy
  signal and ringing. Feel free to take the source and start doing
  a little bit of your own convergence!</p><b>_ _END_ _</b><br>
