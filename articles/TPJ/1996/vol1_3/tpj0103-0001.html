  <h4><i>Jon Orwant</i></h4>

  <p>Publishers haven't yet decided whether the Internet is friend
  or foe. Some of them see it merely as a new medium for hawking
  their wares. They get web sites. Others predict that it will
  radically transform - or doom - their industry as content
  inevitably migrates online. They get indigestion.</p>

  <p>Sometimes people ask me why TPJ is printed on paper; after
  all, most Perl programmers have ready access to the net, and are
  comfortable navigating the web, so why not have an online (and
  cheaper, if not free) TPJ? One reason is that, alas, ink on
  crushed trees is much better suited to reading than any computer
  screen. The resolution is higher, it's more portable, and the
  interface is intuitive. And no one wants to lug a laptop into the
  bathroom.</p>

  <p>The MIT Media Laboratory, where I work in the Electronic
  Publishing Group, is building an electronic book that mimics the
  look and feel of traditional books. You download new texts (hey,
  it's only software) into RAM embedded in the book's spine. The
  pages are paper, but have no ink. Instead, they have arrays of
  tiny pixels: spheres of indium tin oxide, each 40 microns in
  diameter, whose opacity changes when they rotate in response to
  an electric impulse. The book doesn't exist yet, but a printer
  which uses this paper does, and I had the pleasure of being the
  first to adapt a book to it: a Choose Your Own Adventure
  interactive novel, in which the reader makes a decision at the
  bottom of each page and feeds the page back into the printer to
  see the outcome.</p>

  <p>But I digress. The other fear of publishers is copying. Uh oh,
  they think, here comes the big bad Internet, where ne'er-do-wells
  will liberate that Top Ten List you were about to sell to Bantam
  and let it loose on the Internet. It's not surprising that one of
  the questions we hear most is: How can publishers and authors be
  compensated for their work when it's so easy to copy information?
  Slapping a copyright symbol on documents is easy. But copyright
  law provides for a corrective, not preventative, remedy: you must
  first detect that a violation has occurred before you can recover
  damages in court.</p>

  <p>Publishers could try to prevent copyright violations from
  occurring in the first place - when distributing an online book
  or magazine, they could package it "inside" its own software, so
  that only those who have licensed the text can read it, and even
  then they can see only one page at a time. That makes copying a
  book harder, but not impossible; it will never be completely
  impossible as long as people still use their eyes to read -
  because if you can see it, a camera/computer can too.</p>

  <p>We'll probably start to see such digital books soon. Such a
  technique is appropriate for some uses, but not most. It's
  awkward, it's expensive, and it won't thwart the truly dedicated.
  Some less intrusive techniques can be used to help computers
  identify when a document has been copied from another source by
  embedding a statement of ownership in the text. The study of
  hiding clandestine messages in plain sight has a suitably
  mysterious name: steganography.</p>

  <p>Steganography research at the Media Lab focuses on images,
  video, and audio more than text. Images let you hide messages in
  high frequency areas, like fields of grass or heads of hair. The
  redundancy in video can be exploited to bury fleeting messages in
  imperceptible noise. In speech you can add a barely perceptible
  echo to certain segments, or modulate the signal and embed your
  message in the least significant bits. The techniques have a
  common premise: some bits are less important than others, so we
  can jiggle them in ways that encode our message. The more
  attributes we can vary, the more bits we can encode, and the
  longer our message can be. That's the problem with text: While
  you can mutate a few pixels in an image without harm, you can't
  do the same to a book, because the individual elements (letters
  instead of pixels) can't be changed at whim.</p>

  <p>One of the most effective text safeguards relies on economics
  instead of technology. Consider paperbacks: No one's stopping you
  from photocopying your own. It's just not worth your time.
  Inconvenience makes a great license manager.</p>

  <p>What makes paperbacks hard to copy is that the text is
  effectively an image, not ASCII, and copying an image is
  expensive and tedious compared to copying eight-bit bytes. Can
  the the flexibility of text be merged with the message-hiding
  properties of images?</p>

  <p>A crude method is demonstrated in this paragraph. You'd have a
  hard time photocopying this paragraph without retaining the
  copyright message, but the text itself is rather unattractive
  because the message isn't hidden too well.</p>

  <p>A similar but subtler scheme: ink the copyright message
  faintly into the background as a makeshift watermark.</p>

  <p><i>Here's</i> another bad scheme, but an intellectually
  <i>interesting</i> one. <i>The copyright</i> message is
  <i>encoded</i> as the <i>pattern of</i> italicized words: an
  <i>italicized</i> word <i>is</i> a <i>1</i>, and all <i>other
  words are 0</i>. <i>This</i> entire <i>paragraph</i> merely
  <i>spells out</i> PERLJOURNAL, <i>in</i> ASCII, which
  <i>isn't</i> a particularly long message - and it impairs the
  <i>readability</i> somewhat, <i>as you</i> can tell.</p>

  <p>Here's a message that you can't discern - but if it were
  ASCII, your computer (or your Web browser) could. Each line in
  this paragraph has some spaces at the end. The precise number of
  spaces varies from line to line, and those choices are used to
  encode the message.</p>

  <p>The most common English letter is <i>e</i>. One could have
  some fun with the <i>e's</i> in a document, varying their widths
  so that choices between elongation and diminution encode the bits
  that conceal a secret message. The shorter the encoded message,
  and the larger the text to hide it in, the less you need to
  resort to <font size="+1">e</font>xtr<font size=
  "+1">e</font>m<font size="+1">e</font> sizes. It doesn't have to
  be an e, of course: any symbol will do, so long as it appears
  frequently.</p>

  <p>(Assuming many such symbols in your paragraphs, you won't
  usually vary widths much - but c.f. this paragraph, and a book,
  "Gadsby." Both lack that most common symbol.)</p>

  <p>One could, in theory, encode the entire Library of Congress in
  a single period, by choosing its diameter very precisely. If you
  could choose between 128 different sizes, you could store a
  single seven-bit character. With 10<sub>15,000,000</sub> choices,
  you could store a book. And 10<sub>5,000,000,000,000</sub>
  choices would be needed for the ten terabytes contained in the
  Library of Congress. Of course, such resolution is beyond the
  capability of any physical device - for comparison, there are
  about 10<sub>70</sub> atoms in the universe and 10<sub>120</sub>
  possible chess games.</p>

  <p>Now, spaces are about as common as <i>e's</i> and more common
  than periods, and allow for more variation in size. I've written
  a simple program that processes PostScript documents and hides
  messages in the text by changing the width of the spaces between
  the words. It varies the spacing so that it's no longer uniform
  within each line, yet retains the justification so that the text
  remains aligned with both margins.</p>

  <p>The program, called CopySight, was used to process that last
  paragraph (did you notice?) as well as this one, and the next,
  hiding a message in each. In the previous paragraph, spaces were
  adjusted only a little; in this one a bit more, and in the next
  sentence most of all.</p>
