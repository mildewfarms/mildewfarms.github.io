  <h2 align="center">FTP: File Transfer Using Perl</h2>

  <h4><i>Graham Barr</i></h4>In my last article I showed you how to
  use Perl to create, process and send e-mail. I also gave a brief
  introduction to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), one of
  the many protocols used across the Internet. In this article and
  those that follow I'll introduce some of the others.

  <p>In particular, this article will show you how to create an FTP
  (File Transfer Protocol) client. You've probably used the program
  <i>ftp</i>, a program which is a <i>user interface</i> to the FTP
  protocol. The difference between the two is subtle but important,
  because the program I'll develop in this column is also an
  interface to FTP.</p>

  <p>It might not surprise you to hear that most of the work has
  already been done: a Perl 5 module, Net::FTP, interprets the FTP
  protocol for you. So you won't have to mess with the nuts and
  bolts of FTP (defined in RFC 959) to have your program send and
  receive files all by itself.</p>

  <p>FTP is a client-server protocol. That is, there's a server
  which listens for connections on an agreed-upon port address (FTP
  uses 21 by default). Once a connection is made, the server
  allocates a new port for communication with the client. This
  leaves port 21 free to accept the connection from the next
  client. The client and server communicate conversationally, with
  the client sending commands defined in the FTP protocol to the
  server, and the server sending responses back to the client. This
  is the architecture for many well known protocols on the Internet
  such as SMTP, NNTP, and HTTP.</p>

  <p>Here's an example of a conversation between an FTP server and
  a client. It shows what communication is necessary to connect,
  login, change directory and retrieve a file. The commands sent
  from the client to the server are shown in bold.</p>
  <pre>
220 ftphost FTP server (SunOS 4.1) ready. 
<b>USER anonymous</b> 
331 Guest login ok, send ident as password. 
<b>PASS perl-journal-staff@perl.com</b>
230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply. 
<b>CWD pub</b> 
250 CWD command successful. 
<b>PWD</b> 
257 "/pub" is current directory. 
<b>PORT 127,0,0,1,16,110</b> 
200 PORT command successful. 
<b>RETR testfile</b> 
150 ASCII data connection for testfile (127.0.0.1,4206) (0 bytes).
226 ASCII Transfer complete. 
<b>QUIT </b>
221 Goodbye. 
 
</pre>

  <p>The FTP protocol actually uses two connections: one for the
  commands just shown, and one for the actual data transfer. The
  PORT command tells the server which socket address the client is
  using. The server uses this information (4 IP octets and a 2-byte
  port address) to make the data connection.</p>

  <p>You will see from the examples that Net::FTP simplifies this
  interface by keeping track of the status and providing methods
  for each of the commands.</p>

  <p>My first program contacts a Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
  (CPAN) site and retrieves all modules that have been uploaded
  within a given number of days. First, initialization:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl  
# Load the Net::FTP package 
use Net::FTP;  
use File::Listing qw(parse_dir);  
&#13;# Look for files under 7 days (in seconds),    
$age =      7*24*60*60;  
&#13;# Change this to the name of your nearest CPAN host,
$CPANhost = 'CPAN';  
&#13;# A likely path to the CPAN/modules directory  
$CPANpath = '/mirrors/CPAN/modules';  
</pre>

  <p>Now we need to construct a Net::FTP object which will talk to
  the remote server. The Net::FTP constructor takes, as arguments,
  the FTP hostname followed by some options:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Port: the port number (or name) for the remote host</li>

    <li>Time: the initial timeout value, in seconds, for responses
    (defaults to 120)</li>

    <li>Debug: the debug level</li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
# Create a new Net::FTP object, changing the
# timeout to 60 seconds
$ftp = Net::FTP-&gt;new($CPANhost, Timeout =&gt; 60) 
               or die "Cannot contact $CPANhost: $!";  
</pre>

  <p>Once a connection has been made, the login() method must be
  called before any other methods. login() takes three optional
  arguments: login, password and account.</p>

  <p>If no arguments are supplied, Net::FTP searches the
  <tt>.netrc</tt> file in your home directory (on UNIX machines).(
  Net::Netrc, which is what interprets the .netrc file, has only
  been tested on UNIX platforms.) If no login information is found,
  the login defaults to "anonymous."</p>

  <p>When doing <tt>.netrc</tt> lookups, Net::FTP performs certain
  security checks, just like the ftp program. You must own the
  file, and nobody else should be able to read or write to it. If
  these checks fail, Net::FTP ignores your <tt>.netrc</tt>.</p>

  <p>If no password is given and the login is 'anonymous' then
  Net::FTP guesses your e-mail address and sends it as the
  password.</p>

  <p>The third argument is account information which might be
  required by the FTP server. For anonymous FTP it's
  unnecessary.</p>
  <pre>
# We'll login to the ftp server as anonymous; 
# specifying a login id prevents a .netrc lookup. 
&#13;$ftp-&gt;login('anonymous') 
   or die "Can't login ($CPANhost):" . $ftp-&gt;message;  
</pre>

  <p>O.K. - so the server has accepted us. Little does it know that
  we aren't mere surfers! First we need to change directory to the
  root of the CPAN modules and retrieve a recursive directory
  listing.(Recursive directory listings take a long time on large
  filesystems. That can annoy FTP site maintainers, so only do this
  when necessary.) By changing directories first, we reduce the
  size of the listing and therefore the time required to transmit
  it.</p>
  <pre>
# Change the working directory  
$ftp-&gt;cwd($CPANpath) or 
    die "Can't change directory ($CPANhost):" . 
        $ftp-&gt;message;  
&#13;# Retrieve a recursive directory listing 
@ls = $ftp-&gt;ls('-lR');  
</pre>

  <p>Before we start to transfer the files we need to tell the FTP
  server what type of file we're expecting. Different machines
  store files in different ways - what a wonderful world we live
  in. That's why FTP supports multiple transfer modes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>ASCII: Data is transferred as 8-bit bytes with &lt;CRLF&gt;
    denoting end-of-line. This is the default mode.</li>

    <li>EBCDIC: This type is intended for transfer between the few
    hosts which still use EBCDIC instead of ASCII.</li>

    <li>IMAGE: The data are sent as contiguous bits which, for
    transfer, are packed into the 8-bit transfer bytes. The
    receiving site must store the data as contiguous bits. Also
    called BINARY.</li>

    <li>LOCAL: The data is transferred in logical bytes of a size
    chosen by the client.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, only two of these are supported by Net::FTP: ASCII
  and IMAGE. In binary (IMAGE) mode the files are transferred as
  is, but in ASCII mode some translations, such as &lt;CRLF&gt; to
  &lt;NL&gt;, can be performed.</p>
  <pre>
  
# We probably want binary, 
# although some files may be ASCII
$ftp-&gt;binary();  
</pre>

  <p>Now we have a recursive directory listing in @ls and an FTP
  connection in <tt>$ftp</tt>. We use the parse_dir() subroutine in
  the File::Listing module to split our directory listing into its
  components. (File::Listing is available in the libwww
  distribution in the CPAN.)</p>

  <p>From these components we can access the filename, the last
  time the file was written, and its type, which can be one of l,
  d, or f, representing links, directories, and files.</p>
  <pre>
foreach $file (parse_dir(\@ls)) {           
    my($name, $type, $size, $mtime, $mode) = @$file;  
&#13;    # We only want to process plain files,         
    # we shall ignore symbolic links        
    next unless $type eq 'f';  
&#13;    # Check age of file against $age       
    # $mtime is a UNIX time: seconds since 1 Jan 1970
    # $^T is the time this script started.
    if ($^T - $mtime &lt; $age) {               
        print "Retrieving ", $name, "\n";  
&#13;        # Get the file from the ftp server             
        $ftp-&gt;get($name) or 
            warn "Couldn't get '$name', skipped: $!";
    }
}
# Close the connection to the FTP server. 
&#13;$ftp-&gt;quit or die "Couldn't close the connection 
                      cleanly: $!";  
&#13;# We're done! 
exit;  
</pre>

  <p>Before I go into more detail you'll need to know the four
  commands made available by FTP for retrieving and storing
  files:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>RETR: Retrieve (get) a file from the server.</li>

    <li>STOR: Store (put) a file on the server, overwriting it if
    it's already there.</li>

    <li>STOU: Store (put) a file on the server by generating a
    unique name.</li>

    <li>APPE: Append to a file on the server.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Now if you want to get adventurous and speed up transfer, you
  can use multiple FTP connections managed either by multiple
  processes or by a select() call. The latter is demonstrated
  below, with several Net::FTP objects, one per connection.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl  
&#13;use Net::FTP;  
use File::Listing qw(parse_dir);        
&#13;# We'll need to open and write some files      
use FileHandle;   
&#13;# Look for files under 7 days (in seconds), 
$age = 7*24*60*60;  
&#13;# Change this to the name of your nearest CPAN host
$CPANhost = 'CPAN';  
&#13;# The path to the CPAN/modules directory on most CPAN hosts
$CPANpath = '/mirrors/CPAN/modules';  
&#13;# Create the initial connection        
$ftp = connection();  
&#13;# Retrieve a recursive directory listing 
@ls = $ftp-&gt;ls('-lR');  
&#13;# Set the transfer mode to binary      
$ftp-&gt;binary or die "Cannot set binary mode: $!";  
&#13;# Create a list of files we want to get        
@files = ();    
foreach $file (parse_dir(\@ls)) {           
    my($name, $type, $size, $mtime, $mode) = @$file;  
&#13;           # We only want to process plain files           
    next unless $type eq 'f';  
&#13;           # Compare the age of file to $age       
    if ($^T - $mtime &lt; $age) { push(@files, $name) }  
&#13;       }
# The maximum number of connections to make     
$max_connection = 4;    
$max_connection = @files   if @files &lt; $max_connection;  
&#13;# Create a list of connections. We already have one: $ftp.
@ftp = ($ftp);  
&#13;for($i = 1 ; $i &lt; $max_connection ; $i++) {             
    my $ftp = connection();  
	$ftp-&gt;binary or die "Cannot set binary mode: $!";  
	push(@ftp, $ftp);      
}  
&#13;print "Using ", scalar(@ftp), " connections,\n";       
print " to download ",scalar(@files)," files.\n";  
&#13;# Keep a list of data connections      
@data = ();  
&#13;# We'll start off with an empty file set.
$fdset = "";  
&#13;# Prime the ftp servers with RETR commands 
while(@ftp &amp;&amp; @files) {             
    my $ftp  = shift @ftp;          
    my $file = shift @files;        
    my($data,$fh) = init_xfer($ftp, $file);                     
	push(@data, [$data, $fh]);     
}  
&#13;# Close any unused connections         
while (@ftp) {      
    my $ftp  = shift @ftp;          
    $ftp-&gt;close or warn "Can't close connection cleanly: $!";        
} 
</pre>

  <p>We now have several FTP data connections to the same server,
  each in charge of one file. To service all of these connections
  simultaneously, we need select() to tell us when there's data to
  be read. We loop for as long as there is data to read; on each
  iteration, up to 1024 bytes are read from any descriptor with
  data available. If an EOF is found, the descriptor is closed. If
  there are still more files to be retrieved, a new file is
  requested on the corresponding command socket. This creates
  another descriptor. If there are no more files to transfer, the
  command socket is closed - when the list of data descriptors is
  empty, we'll know the transfer is complete.</p>
  <pre>
# Loop while we have connections. They'll be closed and
# removed from @data when transfers finish and @files
# is empty.
&#13;while (@data) {
      $nfound = select($rout=$fdset, undef, undef, undef);
      next unless $nfound; 
      die "select: $!"          if ($nfound == -1); 
      my @d = @data;
&#13;      # Empty @data, connections will be added back into @data
      # if they're still in use later.
&#13;           @data = ();  
	    foreach $con (@d) {                
                my($data, $fh) = @$con;  
                # Do we have data waiting on this connection?  
                if (vec($rout, fileno($data),1)) {                  
                    my $buf = "";
&#13;                    # Read some data. This may block if there's
                    # less than 1024 bytes ready for reading. To
                    # reduce the blocking time, use a smaller number.
&#13;                    my $l = $data-&gt;read($buf, 1024); 
                    die "Error reading data: $!"  if $l &lt; 0; 
                    if ($l) {
&#13;                            # Write the data to the local file 
                            syswrite($fh, $buf, $l)
&#13;            } else {
&#13;                # The data transfer is complete, so we can 
                # close the data connection 
&#13;                my $ftp = finish_xfer($data, $fh); 
  
                # Reuse the FTP connectiopn if there are
                # files left to retrieve.
&#13;                if (@files) { 
                    my $file = shift @files;
                    @$con = init_xfer($ftp, $file);
                } else { 
&#13;                # close the FTP connection and remove it
                # from @data
&#13;                        $ftp-&gt;close or
                           warn "Can't close connection: $!";
&#13;                        # the connection is no longer in use 
                        undef $con;
                } 
            } 
                } 
&#13;        # If the connection is still in use, return it to
        # @data 
        push(@data, $con) if defined $con; 
    } 
	} 
</pre>

  <p>And finally, the three subroutines we've been using:
  connect(), init_xfer(), and finish_xfer().</p>
  <pre>
# Create a new connection to the ftp server  
sub connection {    # Create a new NET::FTP object

&#13;         return $ftp; 
	}  
</pre>

  <p>As you can see, the whole problem becomes a lot more complex,
  fun, or obscure, depending on how twisted you are.</p>

  <p>So far we've looked at transferring files to and from one
  server. But what if we have two remote servers and want to
  transfer a file from one to the other? FTP contains a powerful
  facility for doing this, but first let's consider the obvious
  solution.</p>

  <p>You could transfer the remote file to the local filesystem and
  then transfer it to the other remote server. Better would be to
  connect to each of the servers simultaneously, and perform
  sequential reads and writes between them using the local machine
  as a waystation. The code for this is shown below.</p>
  <pre>
 
#!/usr/bin/perl  
&#13;use Net::FTP;  
&#13;# Create connections to both remote servers...
$ftpf = Net::FTP-&gt;new('from') or die 
   "Cannot connect to 'from': $!";  
$ftpd = Net::FTP-&gt;new('dest') or die 
   "Cannot connect to 'dest': $!";  
&#13;# ...and login to them.
$ftpf-&gt;login('anonymous') or die "Can't login to 'from'";  
$ftpd-&gt;login('anonymous') or die "Can't login to 'dest'";  
&#13;# Place both servers into the correct transfer mode. 
# In this case I'm using ASCII. 
$ftpf-&gt;ascii() &amp;&amp;  $ftpd-&gt;ascii() or die 
    "Can't set ASCII mode: $!";  
&#13;# Send the RETR command to the source server   
# and obtain a file descriptor  
$ffile = '/pub/testfile';  
$fdf = $ftpf-&gt;retr($ffile) 
    or die "Can't retrieve '$ffile': $!";  
&#13;# Send the STOR command to the destination server      
# and obtain a file descriptor  
$sfile = '/pub/outfile';  
$fdd = $ftpd-&gt;stor($sfile) or die "Cannot store '$sfile': $!";  
&#13;# Read and write the data between the two file descriptors  
<b>while ($fdf-&gt;read($buf,1024)) { </b>      
    <b>$fdd-&gt;write($buf, length $buf);</b>   
}  
&#13;$fdf-&gt;quit() &amp;&amp;  $fdd-&gt;quit() or die 
    "Can't close connections: $!";  
$ftpf-&gt;quit() &amp;&amp; $ftpd-&gt;quit() or die 
    "Can't quit ftp connections: $!";  
</pre>

  <p>While this is better than reading the whole file to the local
  filesystem and re-sending it, this process is still not as good
  as it could be. Consider the situation when the file in question
  is rather large, say over 10MB. It takes a long time to transfer
  just once, and here we're actually transferring it <i>twice</i>
  which could, potentially, double the transfer time. For those who
  pay by the minute, this could get expensive.</p>

  <p>This is where the PASV ("passive") command comes in handy.
  Assuming that both of the remote servers can connect to one
  another, you can transfer the file directly:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl  
&#13;use Net::FTP;  
&#13;# Create connections to both remote servers...
$ftpf = Net::FTP-&gt;new('from') or die 
    "Can't connect to 'from': $!";  
$ftpd = Net::FTP-&gt;new('dest') or die 
    "Can't connect to 'dest': $!";  
&#13;# ...and login to them.
$ftpf-&gt;login('anonymous') or die "Can't login to 'from'";  
$ftpd-&gt;login('anonymous') or die "Can't login to 'dest'";  
&#13;# Place both servers into the correct transfer mode. 
# In this case I'm using ASCII. 
$ftpf-&gt;ascii() &amp;&amp;  $ftpd-&gt;ascii() or die 
    "Can't set ASCII mode: $!";  
&#13;# Send the PASV command to the destination server. 
# This returns a port address.
<b>$port = $ftpd-&gt;pasv or die 
    "Can't put FTP host in passive mode: $!";</b>  
&#13;# Send the port address to the source server so it 
# knows where to send the data.
$ftpf-&gt;port($port) or die "Error sending port: $!";

  <p>After creating the connections, and placing them in the
  correct transfer mode, we send the destination server a PASV
  command. This tells the server, for the next command, that it
  should listen on a port for a connection instead of making the
  connection itself. The PASV command returns the port at which it
  is listening. We then send this information to the source server
  with a PORT command, which tells the server where to make the
  data connection for the next command. Once this is done we send
  the two commands, which start the transfer between the two
  servers, and wait for the transfer to complete.</p>
