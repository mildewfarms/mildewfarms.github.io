  <h4><i>Lincoln Stein</i></h4>

  <p>In the last installment of this column I promised to talk
  about MiniSvr, a central part of the CGI::* modules and an easy
  way to maintain state within a CGI script. Unfortunately I've
  made several changes to my system in the last few weeks
  (upgrading to Perl 5.003 and Apache 1.1b4), and MiniSvr broke. At
  press time, I still haven't figured out what's gone wrong. So
  today I'm going to talk about a sweeter subject, cookies.</p>

  <p>What's a cookie? The folks at Netscape came up with the idea
  for Navigator 1.1. It's just a name=value pair, much like the
  named parameters used in the CGI query string. When a Web server
  or CGI script wants to save some state information, it creates a
  cookie or two and sends them to the browser inside the HTTP
  header. The browser keeps track of all the cookies sent to it by
  a particular server and stores them in an on-disk database so
  that the cookies persist even when the browser is closed and
  reopened later. The next time the browser connects to a Web site,
  it searches its database for all cookies that belong to that
  server and transmits them back to the server within the HTTP
  header.</p>

  <p>Cookies can be permanent or set to expire after a number of
  hours or days. They can be made site-wide, so that the cookie is
  available to every URL on your site, or restricted to a partial
  URL path. You can also set a flag in the cookie so that it's only
  transmitted over the Internet when the browser and server are
  communicating by a secure protocol such as SSL. You can even
  create promiscuous cookies that are sent to every server in a
  particular Internet domain.</p>

  <p>The idea is simple but powerful. If a CGI script needs to save
  a small amount of state information, such as the user's preferred
  background color, it can be stored directly in a cookie. If lots
  of information needs to be stored, you can keep the information
  in a database on the server's side and use the cookie to record a
  session key or user ID. Other browsers have begun to adopt
  cookies (notably Microsoft in its Internet Explorer), and cookies
  are on their way to becoming a part of the HTTP standard.</p>

  <p>So how do you create a cookie? If you use the CGI.pm library
  it's a piece of cake:</p>
  <pre>
0  #!/usr/bin/perl  
1
2  use CGI qw(:standard);   
3     
4  $cookie1 = cookie(-name  =&gt; 'regular', 
5                    -value =&gt; 'chocolate chip');   
6  $cookie2 = cookie(-name  =&gt; 'high fiber', 
7                    -value =&gt; 'oatmeal raisin');   
8  print header(-cookie =&gt; [$cookie1, $cookie2]); 
</pre>

  <p>Line 2 loads the CGI library and imports the :standard set of
  function calls using a syntax that's new in library versions 2.21
  and higher. This syntax allows you to call all of the CGI
  object's methods without explicitly creating a CGI instance - a
  default CGI object is created for you behind the scenes. Lines 4
  through 7 create two new cookies using the CGI <tt>cookie()</tt>
  method. The last step is to incorporate the cookies into the
  document's HTTP header. We do this in line 8 by printing out the
  results of the <tt>header()</tt> method, passing it the
  <tt>-cookie</tt> parameter along with an array reference
  containing the two cookies.</p>

  <p>When we run this script from the command line, the result
  is:</p>
  <pre>
  
   Set-cookie: regular=chocolate%20chip 
   Set-cookie: high%20fiber=oatmeal%20raisin 
   Content-type: text/html  
</pre>

  <p>As you can see, CGI.pm translates spaces into %20's, as the
  Netscape cookie specification prohibits whitespace and certain
  other characters, such as the semicolon. (It also places an upper
  limit of a few kilobytes on the size of a cookie, so don't try to
  store the text of Hamlet in one.) When the browser sees these two
  cookies it squirrels them away and returns them to your script
  the next time it needs a document from your server.</p>

  <p>To retrieve the value of a cookie sent to you by the browser,
  use <tt>cookie()</tt> without a <tt>-value</tt> parameter:</p>
  <pre>
 
0  #!/usr/bin/perl   
1     
2  use CGI qw(:standard);   
3     
4  $regular    = cookie('regular');   
5  $high_fiber = cookie('high fiber');   
6     
7  print header(-type =&gt; 'text/plain'),   
8      "The regular cookie is $regular.\n",   
9      "The high fiber cookie is $high_fiber.";  
</pre>

  <p>In this example, lines 4 and 5 retrieve the two cookies by
  name. Lines 7 through 9 print out an HTTP header (containing no
  cookie this time), and two lines of text. The output of this
  script, when viewed in a browser, would be</p>
  <pre>
        The regular cookie is chocolate chip. 
        The high fiber cookie is oatmeal raisin.  
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>cookie()</tt> method is fairly flexible. You can save
  entire arrays as cookies by giving the <tt>-value</tt> parameter
  an array reference:</p>
  <pre>
 
        $c = cookie(-name =&gt; 'specials', 
           -value =&gt; ['oatmeal',
                      'chocolate chip','alfalfa']);  
</pre>

  <p>Or you can save and restore whole associative arrays:</p>
  <pre>
 
$c = cookie(-name =&gt; 'prices', 
           -value =&gt; {      'oatmeal' =&gt; '$0.50',
                     'chocolate_chip' =&gt; '$1.25',
                            'alfalfa' =&gt; 'free'});
</pre>

  <p>Later you can recover the two cookies this way:</p>
  <pre>
 
        @specials = cookie('specials'); 
        %prices   = cookie('prices'); 
</pre>

  <p>By default, browsers will remember cookies that only until
  they exit, and will only send the cookie out to scripts with a
  URL path that's similar to the script that generated it. If you
  want them to remember the cookie for a longer period of time,
  pass an <tt>-expires</tt> parameter to <tt>cookie()</tt>
  containing the cookie's shelf life. To change the URL path over
  which the cookie is valid, pass its value in <tt>-path</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
        $c = cookie(-name =&gt; 'regular', 
           -value =&gt; 'oatmeal raisin', 
            -path =&gt; '/cgi-bin/bakery', 
         -expires =&gt; '+3d'); 
</pre>

  <p>This cookie will expire in three days' time (<tt>'+3d'</tt>).
  Other <tt>cookie()</tt> parameters allow you to adjust the domain
  names and URL paths that trigger the browser to send a cookie,
  and to turn on cookie secure mode. The <tt>-path</tt> parameter
  shown here tells the browser to send the cookie to every program
  in <tt>/cgi-bin/bakery</tt>.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/stein-fig1.gif"><img src=
  "images/stein-fig1_small.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 1: Fill Out Form" border="0" width="250" height=
  "285"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> Fill Out
  Form</font></p>

  <p>The next page shows a CGI script called
  <tt>configure.cgi</tt>. When you call this script's URL you're
  presented with the fill-out form shown above. You can change the
  page's background color, the text size and color, and even
  customize it with your name. The next time you visit this page
  (even if you've closed the browser and come back to the page
  weeks later), it remembers all of these values and builds a page
  based on them.</p>

  <p>This script recognizes four CGI parameters used to change the
  configuration:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>background</tt>: Set the background color.</li>

    <li><tt>text</tt>: Set the text color.</li>

    <li><tt>size</tt>: Set the size to the indicated value
    (1-7).</li>

    <li><tt>name</tt>: Set the username.</li>
  </ul>Usually these parameters are sent to the script via the fill
  out form that it generates, but you could set them from within a
  URL this way:
  <pre>
  
/cgi-bin/configure.pl?background=silver&amp;text=blue&amp;name=Stein
</pre>

  <p>Let's walk through the code. Line 2 imports the CGI library,
  bringing in both the standard method calls and a number of
  methods that generate HTML3-specific tags. Next we define a set
  of background colors and sizes. The choice of colors may seem
  capricious, but it's not. These are the background colors defined
  by the newly-released HTML3.2 standard, and they're based on the
  original colors used by the IBM VGA graphics display.</p>

  <p>Line 9 is where we recover the user's previous preferences, if
  any. We use the <tt>cookie()</tt> method to fetch a cookie named
  "preferences," and store its value in a like-named associative
  array.</p>

  <p>In lines 12 through 14, we fetch the CGI parameters named
  <tt>text, background, name</tt>, and <tt>size</tt>. If any of
  them are set, it indicates that the user wants to change the
  corresponding value saved in the browser's cookie. We store
  changed parameters in the <tt>%preferences</tt> associative
  array, replacing the original values.</p>
  <pre>

30  # Create the HTML page.  We use several of the HTML 3.2 
    # extended tags to control the background color

</pre>

  <p>To try out this script online, point your browser at:</p>

  <p>
  http://www.genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/examples/customize.cgi</p>

  <p>Line 17 and 18 set the text and background colors to
  reasonable defaults if they can't be found in either the cookie
  or the CGI script parameters.</p>

  <p>Lines 21 through 25 generate the page's HTTP header. First we
  use the <tt>cookie()</tt> method to create the cookie containing
  the user's preferences. We set the expiration date for the cookie
  for 30 days in the future so that the cookie will be removed from
  the browser's database if the user doesn't return to this page
  within that time. We also set the optional <tt>-path</tt>
  parameter to <tt>/</tt>. This makes the cookie valid over our
  entire site so that it's available to every URL the browser
  fetches. Although we don't take advantage of this yet, it's
  useful if we later decide that these preferences should have a
  site-wide effect. Lastly we emit the HTTP header with the
  <tt>-cookie</tt> parameter set.</p>

  <p>In lines 30 to 36 we begin the HTML page. True to the intent
  of making it personalizable, we base the page title on the user's
  name. If it's set, the title and level 1 header both become
  "Welcome back <tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt>!" Otherwise, the title
  becomes an impersonal "Customizable page." Line 32 calls the
  <tt>start_html()</tt> method to create the top part of the HTML
  page. It sets the title, the background color and the text color
  based on the values in the <tt>%preferences</tt> array. Line 36
  sets the text size by calling the <tt>basefont()</tt> method.
  This simply generates a <tt>&lt;BASEFONT&gt;</tt> HTML tag with
  an appropriate SIZE attribute.</p>

  <p>Lines 38 and up generate the content of the page. There's a
  brief introduction to the page, followed by the fill-out form
  used to change the settings. All the HTML is generated using
  CGI.pm "shortcuts," in which tags are generated by like-named
  method calls. For example, the <tt>hr()</tt> method generates the
  HTML tag <tt>&lt;HR&gt;</tt>. As shown in the first column in
  this series, we start the fill-out form with a call to
  <tt>start_form()</tt>, create the various form elements with
  calls to <tt>textfield()</tt>, <tt>popup_menu()</tt>, and
  <tt>submit()</tt>, and close the form with
  <tt>end_form()</tt>.</p>

  <p>When I first wrote this script, the popup menus and popup
  menus in the form didn't line up well. Because all the elements
  were slightly different widths, everything was crooked. To fix
  this problem, I used the common trick of placing the form
  elements inside an invisible HTML3 table. Assigning each element
  to its own cell forces the fields to line up. You can see how I
  did this in lines 52 through 77, where I define a table using a
  set of CGI.pm shortcuts. An outer call to <tt>table()</tt>
  generates the surrounding <tt>&lt;TABLE&gt;</tt> and
  <tt>&lt;/TABLE&gt;</tt> tags. Within this are a series of
  <tt>TR()</tt> methods, each of which generates a
  <tt>&lt;TR&gt;</tt> tag. (In order to avoid conflict with Perl's
  built-in <tt>tr///</tt> operator, this is one instance where
  CGI.pm uses uppercase rather than lowercase shortcut names.)
  Within each <tt>TR()</tt> call, in turn, there are several
  <tt>td()</tt> calls that generate the <tt>&lt;TD&gt;</tt> ("table
  data") cells of the HTML table.</p>

  <p>Fortunately my text editor auto-indents nicely, making it easy
  to see the HTML structure.</p>

  <p>On a real site, of course, you'd want the user's preferences
  to affect all pages, not just one. This isn't a major
  undertaking; many modern Web servers now allow you to designate a
  script that preprocesses all files of a certain type. You can
  create a variation on the script shown here that takes an HTML
  document and inserts the appropriate <tt>&lt;BASEFONT&gt;</tt>
  and <tt>&lt;BODY&gt;</tt> tags based on the cookie preferences.
  Now just configure the server to pass all HTML documents through
  this script and you're set.</p>

  <p>Cringe, Microsoft, cringe!</p>
