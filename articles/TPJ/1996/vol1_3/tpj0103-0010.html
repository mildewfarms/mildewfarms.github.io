  Results</h2>

  <h4><i>Felix S. Gallo</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  First, I'd like to say that this contest was an amazing and
  therefore highly regrettable success. Yes, some members of the
  elite judging team are now trying to fit square pegs into round
  holes in a mental rehabilitation ward, and one of the judges was
  last seen washing his hands obsessively and muttering something
  about never being able to get clean again, but they gave
  themselves heroically in the line of duty.

  <p>The people to really <i>worry</i> about are the various
  entrants. These seriously warped individuals' efforts went far
  beyond what we thought we'd get with our pleasant little contest.
  No, they each created code so vicious, so grotesque, that if the
  U.S. State Department were to find out about obfuscated Perl code
  of this caliber, they'd immediately declare it an unexportable
  munition. Actually, some theorize this has already happened. Pay
  no attention to the front cover. Onwards.</p>

  <p>In the spirit of true obfuscation, upon receiving the complete
  set of entries, we decided to modify the rules of the contest.
  Every entry was considered for every category - and in fact, some
  did well outside their chosen category.</p>

  <p>Besides the best medicine for nausea, if there's one thing the
  judges learned from this contest, it's that there is much to
  learn from this contest. Each of the entries demonstrated from
  one to ten hideously powerful and educational Perl constructs; in
  terms of time spent, there can be few better methods of learning
  how Perl works than examining these expert-crafted hacks. We
  recommend that anyone who wants to advance their Perl knowledge
  download these entries and try to decipher them. The especially
  masochistic and adventuresome may wish to stop reading right
  here; some of the below passages will contain giveaways.</p>

  <p>Last chance to stop reading before the awards are presented
  and the code is deconstructed...</p>

  <p>Still with us? Great.</p>

  <h3>Best Four Line Signature</h3>

  <p>3rd Place Tie: Krishna Sethuraman, Sriranga Veeraraghavan.
  Krishna did a good job of hiding the index function which
  extracted 'Just another Perl hacker' from a string. Extra bonus
  points for using the @bar{@array} feature. Sriranga's code,
  studded with dollar signs, won high aesthetic formatting
  marks.</p>

  <p>2nd Place: Poul S&oslash;rensen. Poul's code was fairly
  straightforward; at least one of the judges managed to understand
  what it would do without running it. However, it's a clever and
  cute hack which runs a capital letter up and down the lower-case
  string 'the Perl journal'.</p>

  <p>1st Place: Robert Klep. Robert's code wasn't highly
  obfuscated; most of the difficulty of reading it came from the
  fact that it's got a lot of math in it. However, it won big in
  the amusement department by calculating and printing out the
  Mandelbrot set in ASCII in only 2.5 lines.</p>

  <h3>Most Powerful</h3>

  <p>3rd Place: Robert Klep, for his Mandelbrot set generator.</p>

  <p>2nd Place: Gordon Lack. Here's Gordon's entire program:</p>

  <p><tt>#!/usr/bin/perl l -w015l12pi.bak.</tt> Which, as you can
  plainly see, converts Mac-format text files into UNIX-format text
  files.</p>

  <p>1st Place: Russell Caton, who managed to squeeze a clever
  program which searches through your (optionally unordered)
  password file to find the first unused UID into only 1.5 lines of
  Perl. It's a genuinely useful piece of code for sysadmins
  disguised as line noise.</p>

  <h3>Most Creative</h3>

  <p>3rd Place: Stephen McCamant. Stephen's obfuscation is mostly
  in the math, but he gets great style points for having the last
  statement be <tt>goto</tt> a and for the execution of the
  program, which calculates and prints out pi.</p>

  <p>2nd Place: Steve Lidie (see the 'The Perl Journal' category,
  below).</p>

  <p>1st Place: Bob Sidebotham, whose submission was unbelievably
  hilarious. We recommend you go check out the original version.
  Needless to say, his program does not use pi as it would have you
  believe, nor does it compute anything having to do with circles,
  nor are the comments true in the slightest. It's a big, majestic
  lie - its output is THE PERL JOURNAL spaced across the screen in
  five-character-high letters. Bob wins this category hands down,
  for apparently discovering that a higher power, &aacute; la Carl
  Sagan's Contact, has hidden the name of the best programming
  journal ever in a fundamental mathematical constant.</p>

  <h3>Best 'The Perl Journal'</h3>

  <p>This award goes to the best program which produces the words
  'The Perl Journal'. There were some scintillating gems in this
  category, which made picking winners very difficult.</p>

  <p>(Dis-)Honorable Mentions: Poul S&oslash;rensen for his neat
  streaming banner hack and Krishna Sethuraman for an elegant
  little haiku (reminiscent of the bad old days of Perl poetry)
  which compiles and runs.</p>

  <p>3rd Place: our own Steve Lidie, who threw the proverbial
  kitchen sink of obfuscation at the problem, including
  <tt>__DATA__</tt>, random numbers, cunningly commented code which
  has nothing to do with the solution, and a trashed out string
  which gets transformed into Perl code and evaluated. His effort
  was not only gorgeous, but awe-inspiring.</p>

  <p>2nd Place: Bill Pollock, whose code contains a big 'The Perl
  Journal' mural formatted prettily in comments. The code quickly
  reads itself in and uses characters from <i>inside</i> the
  comments to generate 'The Perl Journal'. While the code isn't
  highly obfuscated, the idea of a program reading itself and then
  using a mural to make a string is pretty nifty.</p>

  <p>1st Place: Gisle Aas. Gisle's entry only serves to strengthen
  our deepening suspicion that something is seriously amiss in
  Norway. Gisle's entry is so magnificently obfuscated that it's in
  a class by itself; in only 143 characters, Gisle manages to
  confuse Perl's namespace, Perl's notion of numbers, use the tenth
  day after the epoch began, and put together a tour-de-force
  substitution which one of the judges still doesn't understand. A
  hearty congratulations to both Gisle and his future therapist.
  With this entry, Gisle goes on to win the coveted Best of Show
  award and a mandatory seat on next year's judging committee.</p>

  <p>Congratulations also go out to all the winners, who each
  richly deserve their titles and the trophies en route, and also
  to all who participated. We fully expect that next year, not only
  will all of the judges return to a state of mental competency,
  but the contest will be even fiercer!</p>
