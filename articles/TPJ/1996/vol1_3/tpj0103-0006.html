  <h2 align="center">Perl and the Tk Extension: Events And Other
  Things</h2>

  <h4><i>Steve Lidie</i></h4>event (i-vent'): something that
  happens: a noteworthy occurrence or happening: something worthy
  of remark: an unusual or significant development. (Paraphrased
  from Webster's Third New International Unabridged Dictionary.)

  <p>Events are what drive Perl/Tk programs. In the past I've
  described these events superficially, sweeping lots of detail
  under the <tt>MainLoop()</tt> rug, all for the sake of
  simplicity. <tt>MainLoop()</tt> is our friend, since it's all
  that is needed for nearly every Perl/Tk program. But there are
  few times when it's not up to the task at hand.</p>

  <p>Today's featured program is a simple Pong-like game sporting a
  new widget <i>derived</i> from the Canvas class, which we'll
  compare to last issue's Odometer, a <i>composite</i> widget. Our
  Pong game doesn't use <tt>MainLoop()</tt>, but handles events
  itself with <tt>DoOneEvent()</tt>.</p>

  <p>Before discussing <i>pong</i> we'll examine some other
  programs, including a simple animation called <i>neko</i>, which
  demonstrates the Photo widget and some other Tk commands. Tk
  defines four broad event categories: X, timer, input/output, and
  idle. <i>X events</i> are generated in response to mouse motion,
  button and keyboard actions and window changes. You already know
  that many of these events have builtin Tk bindings, and that you
  can create your own bindings, so all you need to do is define the
  event handler, or callback. (There are lots of other X events
  which we'll examine in detail in future issues.) Timer events are
  used for periodic happenings, from blinking items to animating
  images. <i>Input/output events</i> help prevent your application
  from freezing when reading and writing to terminals, pipes, or
  sockets. Finally, <i>idle</i> events are low priority callbacks
  invoked only when all events from the previous three event queues
  have been processed. Tk uses the idle events queue to redraw
  widgets, since it's generally a bad idea to redisplay a widget
  after every change of state. By deferring redraws until there is
  nothing left to do, widgets presumably reach their "steady
  state." The result is improved performance and a flicker-free
  screen.</p>

  <h3>Timer Events</h3>

  <p>Last time we saw a useful idiom for scheduling asynchronous
  tasks, shown at the top of the next column:</p>
  <pre>
modo();  

...
sub modo { # Do stuff, then reschedule myself.
        $MW-&gt;after($MILLISECOND_DELAY, \&amp;modo); 
}  
</pre>

  <p>Before modo() returns, it uses after() to schedule a timer
  event and define the handler (callback). This idiom is so common
  that Perl/Tk provides <tt>repeat()</tt> as a shortcut, so the
  above code can be condensed like so:</p>
  <pre>
$MW-&gt;repeat($MILLISECOND_DELAY, \&amp;modo);
</pre>

  <p>A working example named <i>rpt</i> is available on the TPJ web
  site.</p>

  <p>Tk uses timer events to flash the insertion cursor for entry
  widgets. After the widget gets the keyboard focus, it displays
  the cursor and queues a timer callback. Then the callback erases
  the cursor and the cycle repeats, several times per second. This
  technique is often used to flash alert messages or special
  buttons. You can use <tt>repeat()</tt>, but this is the idiom
  you'll almost always see:</p>
  <pre>
  
my $b = $MW-&gt;Button(-text =&gt; 'Hello World!', 
                 -command =&gt; \&amp;exit)-&gt;pack; 
flash_widget($b, -background, qw(blue yellow), 500);
MainLoop;  

sub flash_widget {  
    # Flash a widget attribute periodically.  
    my ($w, $opt, $val1, $val2, $interval) = @ARG;  
    $w-&gt;configure($opt =&gt; $val1);     
    $MW-&gt;after($interval, [\&amp;flash_widget, $w, $opt,
                           $val2, $val1, $interval]);  
}  
</pre>

  <p>As you see, the code is quite simple. On the first call to
  <tt>flash_widget()</tt>, the button's background is configured
  blue. A timer event is then scheduled, reversing the background
  colors, so next time the widget is configured yellow. The
  periodic change in background color every 500 milliseconds yields
  the desired flashing effect. A working example, named
  <i>flash</i>, is on the TPJ web site.</p>

  <p>You can also perform crude animations with nothing more than
  standard Tk timer events. To demonstrate, I created a basic
  <i>neko</i> program, using frames borrowed from Masayuki Koba's
  well known <i>xneko</i>. In case you're unfamiliar with
  <i>xneko</i>, a cat chases the cursor around an X window. When
  you stop moving the cursor, the cat gives a mighty yawn and
  settles down to take a nap. When the cursor moves again, neko
  wakes up and resumes the chase. My rendition of neko doesn't
  follow the cursor and moves solely in one dimension. (Readers
  with free time on their hands should note that I've laid the
  groundwork for implementing a full-fledged <i>tkneko</i>. Use
  ideas from last issue's Mouse Odometer program, throw in a little
  trigonometry and mix well with my neko code, and let me see what
  you can do!)</p>

  <p>In the US, television creates the illusion of motion by
  flashing 30 full images per second. Movies show 24 images per
  second, but flash each image three times to lessen the flicker.
  Psychophysicists have determined that 10 images per second is, on
  average, the minimum number needed to perceive motion, so that's
  what we'll use for neko. I don't actually have ten images to
  show, just two: one of neko with his feet together, and one with
  his feet apart.</p>

  <p>When you run <i>neko</i>, the following screen, depicting the
  six frames used by the application, is momentarily displayed:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/neko1.gif"><img src=
  "images/neko1_small.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 1: Presenting Neko" border="0" width="256" height=
  "90"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> Presenting
  Neko</font></p>

  <p>To make use of these frames we need to create Tk
  <i>images</i>. An image is just another Tk object with special
  methods for image manipulations. Once created, images are then
  imported into other widgets, such as a button, canvas or label.
  For example, this code creates a button with neko's icon on it
  instead of text:</p>
  <pre>
  
my $i = $MW-&gt;Photo(-file =&gt; 'images/icon.ppm'); 
my $b = $MW-&gt;Button(  -image =&gt; $i, 
                    -command =&gt; sub {print "Meow\n"})-&gt;pack; 
</pre>

  <p>Images come in two flavors, <i>bitmaps</i>, which have only
  two colors, and <i>photos</i>, which are photographic quality
  objects having millions of colors. The six <i>neko</i> frames
  were originally plain X bitmaps, but have since been converted to
  colorized PPM files, a format (like GIF) suitable for input to
  the <tt>Photo()</tt> command.</p>

  <p>The canvas widget provides an ideal backdrop for the
  animation, since images can be drawn on it and moved using
  standard canvas methods. Here's the code that created much of the
  above figure:</p>
  <pre>
# Create the six Photo images from the color PPM files
# and display them in a row. The canvas image IDs
# are stored in the global array @IDS for use by the
# rest of the neko code.  For instance, to perform a
# canvas operation on the neko icon, simply fetch its
# item ID from $IDS[5]. Sorry for using hardcoded 
# values, but this is just "proof of concept" code!  

my $x = 125; 

foreach ( qw(left1 left2 sleep1 sleep2 awake icon) ) {
    push @IDS, $C-&gt;create('image', $x, $SCAMPER_Y,                     
         -image =&gt; $MW-&gt;Photo(-file =&gt; "images/$ARG.ppm"));
    $x += 50; 
}  

# Wait for the main window to appear before hiding the neko
# frames. (Otherwise you might never get to see them.)

$MW-&gt;waitVisibility($MW); 
$MW-&gt;after(2000, \&amp;hide_nekos); 
MainLoop;  
</pre>

  <p>An immediate problem arises: the animation demands that only
  one frame be visible at any point in time, so we need to hide
  arbitrary frames (including the six frames currently on the
  canvas). One way might be to create and delete the images
  continually, but that's messy. Instead, neko uses a trick based
  on the canvas' <i>display</i> list.</p>

  <p>Tk uses the display list to control the order in which canvas
  items are displayed, so that items created later are displayed
  after items created earlier. If two items are positioned at the
  same (or overlapping) coordinates, the item earliest in the
  display list is obscured because the other item is displayed on
  top of it. Thus, the rightmost item in <a href=
  "images/neko1.gif">Figure 1</a>, the <i>neko</i> icon, is on top
  of the display list. We'll move the icon off to the side, hide
  all inactive images under it, and no one will be the wiser!</p>
  <pre>
 
my($i, $done, $rptid, $cb) = ($#IDS, 0, 0, 0);  

$cb = sub { 
            my($ir) = @ARG; 
            hide_frame $IDS[$$ir--];
            $done++ if $$ir&lt; 0
          }; 
my $rptid = $MW-&gt;repeat(1000 =&gt; [$cb, \$i]);  

$MW-&gt;waitVariable(\$done); 
$MW-&gt;afterCancel($rptid);  
</pre>

  <p>There's more to these five statements than meets the eye, so
  let's examine them one by one. We want to move the icon image
  first, so set <tt>$i</tt> to its index in the <tt>@IDS</tt>
  array. Even though the icon is the first image moved it will
  nevertheless obscure the remaining images because it's at the end
  of the display list.</p>

  <p>The second statement defines a timer callback, <tt>$cb</tt>,
  whose sole purpose is to hide one neko frame, decrement the index
  <tt>$i</tt> and set the <tt>$done</tt> flag after the last image
  has been moved. Here's where it gets tricky: the parameter passed
  to the anonymous subroutine is not the value of <tt>$i</tt>
  itself, but <tt>$$i</tt>, a reference to <tt>$i</tt>. Passing
  <tt>$i</tt> directly would only postdecrement the copy local to
  the subroutine, <tt>$ir</tt>, and not the "real" <tt>$i</tt>.
  Thus, only the icon frame would be moved, and the callback would
  never set the <tt>$done</tt> flag.</p>

  <p>The <tt>repeat()</tt> queues a timer event which, until
  cancelled, repeats once a second, forever. However, the callback
  has been designed to modify the <tt>$done</tt> variable after the
  last image has been hidden. Notice that <tt>repeat()</tt>, like
  all asynchronous timer event scheduling methods, returns a timer
  ID, used to subsequently remove the event from the timer
  queue.</p>

  <p>The <tt>waitVariable()</tt> waits until the value of
  <tt>$done</tt> changes. Although the application's flow is
  logically suspended, it still responds to external events, and so
  is not frozen.</p>

  <p>The <tt>afterCancel()</tt> cancels the <tt>repeat()</tt>
  event. The end result is that the images shown in <a href=
  "images/neko1.gif">Figure 1</a> are hidden, one at a time, once a
  second, from right to left. You can see below what the window
  looks like after all the <i>neko</i> images have been moved off
  to the side. Note the neko icon, sitting in the upper left
  corner, hiding most of the other images. The snoozing neko has
  subsequently been unhidden and animated for your viewing
  pleasure. So, how do we make neko scamper across the canvas? This
  code snippet does just that:</p>
  <pre>
 
# Move neko right to left by exposing successive
# frames for 0.1 second.  

my $cb = sub {$done++}; 
my($i, $k) = (0, -1); 
$delay = 100; 

for ($i = 460; $i &gt;= 40; $i -= $DELTA_X) {
    $id = $IDS[++$k % 2];     
    move_frame($id, $i, $SCAMPER_Y);     
    if ($BLOCK) {       $MW-&gt;after($delay) } 
    else {      
        $MW-&gt;after($delay =&gt; $cb);        
        $MW-&gt;waitVariable(\$done);     
    }     
    hide_frame $id; 
}  

snooze;
 
</pre>

  <p>Take one last look at Figure 1 and note the two leftmost
  images. Essentially, all we need to do is periodically display
  those images, one after another, at slightly different positions
  on the canvas. The scamper code shown above does just that: move
  one image from underneath the <i>neko</i> icon, wait for 0.1
  second, hide it, unhide the second image and display it slightly
  to the left of the previous, wait for 0.1 second, and repeat
  until neko reaches the left edge of the canvas. The exhausted
  neko then takes a well deserved nap.</p>

  <p>It's possible to animate neko using a blocking or non-blocking
  technique, depending on the state of the <tt>Block?</tt>
  checkbutton. Try each alternative and note how the buttons
  respond as you pass the cursor over them. <tt>$DELTA_X</tt>
  controls how "fast" neko runs, and is tied to the slender scale
  widget to the right of the window. Varying its value by moving
  the slider makes neko either moonwalk or travel at relativistic
  speeds!</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/neko2.gif"><img src=
  "images/neko2_small.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 1: Blocking or not Blocking Neko" border="0" width="261"
  height="88"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2:</b> Blocking or
  not Blocking Neko</font> Before we move on, here is how
  <i>neko</i> images are actually translated (moved) across the
  canvas (or "hidden" and "unhidden"):</p>
  <pre>
sub move_frame {  

    # Move a neko frame to an absolute canvas 
    # position.  

    my($id, $absx, $absy) = @ARG;     
    my ($x, $y) = $C-&gt;coords($id);     
    $C-&gt;move($id, $absx-$x, $absy-$y);     
    $MW-&gt;idletasks; 
}  
</pre>

  <p>The canvas <tt>move()</tt> method moves an item to a new
  position on the canvas <i>relative</i> to its current position.
  Here we don't even know the <i>absolute</i> coordinates, so we
  use <tt>coords()</tt> to get the neko's current position and
  perform a subtraction to determine the X and Y differences
  needed. When a neko image is hidden it's simply moved to the
  "hide" coordinates occupied by the <i>neko</i> icon. The
  <tt>idletasks()</tt> statement flushes the idle events queue,
  ensuring that the display is updated immediately.</p>

  <h3>I/O Events</h3>

  <p>If you think about it, a Tk application is somewhat analogous
  to a multi-tasking operating system: event callbacks must be
  mutually cooperative and only execute for a reasonable amount of
  time before relinquishing control to other handlers; otherwise,
  the application might freeze. This is an important consideration
  if your Tk application performs terminal, pipe, or socket I/O,
  since these operations might very well block, taking control away
  from the user.</p>

  <p>Suppose you want to write a small program where you can
  interactively enter Perl/Tk commands, perhaps to prototype small
  code snippets of a larger application. The code might look like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
use Tk; 
while (&lt;&gt;) { 
    eval $ARG; 
}         
</pre>

  <p>When prompted for input you could then enter commands like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
  
my $MW = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
my $b = $MW-&gt;Button(-text =&gt; 'Hello world!')-&gt;pack;  
</pre>

  <p>What happens now? Actually, nothing! Is the button displayed?
  No! Why not? Easy: no <tt>MainLoop()</tt> statement has been
  executed, so no events are processed, and the display isn't
  updated!</p>

  <p>Realizing what's happening, you then enter a
  <tt>MainLoop()</tt> statement, and lo and behold, something
  appears! But now you're stuck, because <tt>MainLoop()</tt> never
  returns until the main window is destroyed,* so once again you're
  blocked and prevented from entering new Tk commands!</p>

  <p>One solution is to rewrite your Perl/Tk shell using
  <tt>fileevent()</tt>, the I/O event handler:</p>
  <pre>
$MW-&gt;fileevent('STDIN', 'readable' =&gt; \&amp;user_input); MainLoop;  

sub user_input {  

    # Called when input is available on STDIN.  

    $ARG =&lt;&gt;;     
    eval $ARG; 
}  
</pre>

  <p>The key difference is that the read from <tt>STDIN</tt> is now
  a non-blocking event, which is invoked by <tt>MainLoop()</tt>
  whenever input data is available. The fileevent() command expects
  three arguments: a file handle, an I/O operation
  ('<tt>readable</tt>' or '<tt>writable</tt>'), and a callback to
  be invoked when the designated file handle is ready for input or
  output.</p>

  <p>Although not necessary here, it's good practice to delete all
  file event handlers, in the same spirit as closing files and
  canceling timer events:</p>
  <pre>
$MW-&gt;fileevent('STDIN', 'readable' =&gt; ''); 
</pre>

  <p>The entire ptksh1 program is on the TPJ web site. Another
  program, tktail, demonstrating a pipe I/O event handler, is
  available from Peter Prymmer's Perl/Tk FAQ at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/ptkFAQ.html"
  target=
  "resource window">http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/ptkFAQ.html</a></p>

  <h3>Idle Events</h3>

  <p>The idle event queue isn't restricted to redisplaying. You can
  use it for low priority callbacks of your own. This silly example
  uses <tt>afterIdle()</tt> to ring the bell after 5 seconds:</p>
  <pre>
 
#!/usr/bin/perl -w 
# 
# Demonstrate use of afterIdle() to queue a 
# low priority callback.  

require 5.002; 
use English; 
use Tk; 
use Tk::DoOneEvent; 
use strict;  

my $MW = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
$MW-&gt;Button(-text =&gt; 'afterIdle', 
         -command =&gt; \&amp;queue_afterIdle)-&gt;pack; 
MainLoop;  

sub queue_afterIdle {     
    $MW-&gt;afterIdle(sub {$MW-&gt;bell});     
    print "afterIdle event queued, block for 5 seconds...\n";
    $MW-&gt;after(5000);     
    print "It's 5 seconds later, call idletasks() ",
          "to activate the handler.\n";     
    $MW-&gt;idletasks;     
    print "The bell should have sounded ...\n";     
    $MW-&gt;destroy; 
}  

DoOneEvent()  
</pre>

  <p>To recap, we are responsible for three event-related
  activities: registering events, creating event handlers and
  <i>dispatching</i> events. Until now <tt>MainLoop()</tt> has
  dispatched events for us, running in an endless loop, handing off
  events to handlers as they arise, and putting the application to
  sleep if no events are pending. When the application's last main
  window is destroyed, <tt>MainLoop()</tt> returns and the program
  terminates.</p>

  <p>Perl/Tk allows low-level access to Tk events via
  <tt>DoOneEvent()</tt>. This event dispatcher is passed a single
  argument: a bit pattern describing which events to process. As
  you might guess, the event categories are those we've just
  explored. Direct access to <tt>DoOneEvent()</tt> from the Tk
  level is normally unavailable, but the C interface exports it
  specifically for Perl/Tk. The C interface has a header file that
  defines event symbols, but these symbols haven't reached the Tk
  level yet. To avoid the dubious use of numeric values, here is a
  small package that you can <tt>use()</tt> to import the
  appropriate bit patterns (shown below):</p>
  <pre>
  
package Tk::DoOneEvent;  

require Exporter; 
@Tk::DoOneEvent::ISA = qw(Exporter); 
@EXPORT = qw($TK_WAIT $TK_DONT_WAIT $TK_X_EVENTS     
             $TK_FILE_EVENTS $TK_TIMER_EVENTS
             $TK_IDLE_EVENTS     $TK_ALL_EVENTS);  

# Bit patterns describing what you want DoOneEvent() to do,
# swiped directly from the Tk distribution.  If you know where
# tk.h resides, I suggest using "h2ph" to generate the symbol
# definitions in case the header file changes.  

$TK_WAIT         = 0x00; 
$TK_DONT_WAIT    = 0x01; 
$TK_X_EVENTS     = 0x02; 
$TK_FILE_EVENTS  = 0x04; 
$TK_TIMER_EVENTS = 0x08; 
$TK_IDLE_EVENTS  = 0x10; 
$TK_ALL_EVENTS = $TK_X_EVENTS | $TK_FILE_EVENTS |
                 $TK_TIMER_EVENTS | $TK_IDLE_EVENTS;  

1;  
</pre>

  <p>As it turns out, <tt>MainLoop()</tt> is implemented using
  <tt>DoOneEvent()</tt>, similar to this meta-code:</p>
  <pre>
MainLoop { 
    while (NumMainWindows &gt; 0) {         
        DoOneEvent(TK_WAIT)     
    } 
}  
</pre>

  <p>When passed <tt>$TK_WAIT</tt> or <tt>$TK_ALL_EVENTS</tt>,
  <tt>DoOneEvent()</tt> processes events as they arise, and puts
  the application to sleep when no further events are outstanding.
  <tt>DoOneEvent()</tt> first looks for an X or I/O event and, if
  found, calls the handler and returns. If there is no X or I/O
  event, it looks for a single timer event, invokes the callback,
  and returns. If no X, I/O or timer event is ready, all pending
  idle callbacks are executed. In all cases <tt>DoOneEvent()</tt>
  returns 1.</p>

  <p>When passed <tt>$TK_DONT_WAIT</tt>, DoOneEvent() works as
  above, except that if there are no events to process, it returns
  immediately with a value of 0, indicating it didn't find any work
  to do.</p>

  <p>With this new knowledge, here is another implementation of our
  Perl/Tk shell that doesn't need <tt>fileevent()</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
  
#!/usr/bin/perl -w 
# 
# ptksh2 - another Perl/Tk shell using DoOneEvent()
# rather than fileevent().  

require 5.002; 
use English; 
use Tk; 
use Tk::DoOneEvent; 
use strict;  

my $MW = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
$MW-&gt;title('ptksh2'); 
$MW-&gt;iconname('ptksh2');  

while(1) {     
    while(1) {        
        last unless DoOneEvent($TK_DONT_WAIT);     
    }     
    print "ptksh&gt; ";     
    { no strict; eval&lt;&gt;; }
    print $EVAL_ERROR if $EVAL_ERROR; 
}  
</pre>

  <p>The outer while loop accepts terminal input, and the inner
  while loop cycles as long as Tk events arise as a result of that
  input.</p>

  <h3>Pong</h3>

  <p>At the risk of creating mass depression, I must confess that
  this implementation of pong isn't the real thing. You won't see
  multiple game levels of ever increasing difficulty, or even a
  database of high scores. Nope, all you get is a basic paddle, one
  ball, and the chance to bounce the ball around until you grow
  bored, which for me took less than a minute. The idea in this
  game is to keep the ball confined within the playing field; you
  get a point every time you hit the ball with the paddle, but lose
  a point every time the ball hits the floor or ceiling. This means
  that the paddle is tied to your mouse and follows its every
  motion. If at game's end the score is positive you win, else you
  lose. pong is derived in large part from bounce, the widget
  bouncing ball simulation written by Gurusamy Sarathy.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/breakout.gif"><img src=
  "images/breakout_small.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 3: Breakout Simulator" border="0" width="151" height=
  "145"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 3:</b> Breakout
  Simulator</font></p>

  <p>Of course <i>pong</i> isn't meant to be fun, but to showcase
  Perl/Tk features: events, canvas commands and the Pong derived
  widget.</p>

  <p><i>pong</i> really wants to be a CPU resource hog in order to
  keep the ball and paddle lively, but at the same time it needs to
  allow Tk events safe passage, so it has its own version of
  MainLoop():</p>
  <pre>
 
while (1) {  
   exit if $QUIT;     
   DoOneEvent($RUNNING ? $TK_DONT_WAIT : $TK_WAIT);
   $pong-&gt;move_balls($SPEED-&gt;get / 100.0) if $RUNNING;  
} 
</pre>The variable <tt>$RUNNING</tt> is a boolean indicating
whether the game is in progress or has been paused. If the game has
been paused (<tt>$RUNNING = 0</tt>), <tt>DoOneEvent()</tt> is
called with <tt>$TK_WAIT</tt>, and sleeps until Tk events arise,
but the ball and paddle aren't moved. Otherwise,
<tt>DoOneEvent()</tt> is called with <tt>$TK_DONT_WAIT</tt>, which
may process one or more events (but certainly won't block), and
then the game's ball and paddle are moved.

  <p>If this is the entire <i>pong</i> MainLoop, obviously the
  <tt>$PONG</tt> widget must be handling a lot behind the scenes.
  Indeed, the heart of the game is this single widget, which
  maintains the entire game state: paddle and ball position and
  movement, and game score. <tt>$PONG</tt> is a widget
  <i>derived</i> from a canvas, meaning that it automatically
  assumes all methods inherent in a canvas (and may provide more of
  its own, like <tt>move_balls()</tt>).</p>

  <p>A properly defined derived widget like Pong follows standard
  Perl/Tk conventions:</p>
  <pre>
 
$PONG = $drawarea-&gt;Pong(
        -relief =&gt; 'ridge', 
        -height =&gt; 400,
        -width  =&gt; 600, 
        -bd     =&gt; 2, 
        -balls  =&gt; [{-color    =&gt; 'yellow', 
                     -size     =&gt; 40,
                     -position =&gt; [90, 250]}]
);  
</pre>

  <p>This command creates a 400x600 pixel <i>canvas</i>, with one
  paddle and one ball (but there could have been more). The ball is
  yellow, 40 pixels in diameter, and is placed at canvas
  coordinates (90,250). Because the Pong widget <tt>ISA</tt>
  canvas, anything you can do with a canvas you can do with a Pong
  widget. Defining a derived widget class is similar to defining a
  composite class (like Odometer from last issue).</p>
  <pre>
package Tk::Pong; 
require 5.002; 
use English; 
use Tk::Canvas; 
@Tk::Pong::ISA = qw(Tk::Derived Tk::Canvas); 
Tk::Widget-&gt;Construct('Pong');  

sub Populate {  # the Pong constructor
    my($dw, $args) = @ARG;  
    $dw-&gt;SUPER::Populate($args);     

    # Create needed canvas items here.     
    $dw-&gt;ConfigSpecs( ... );         

    return $dw;  
} 

1;  
</pre>

  <p>These statements</p>

  <ul>
    <li>define the new Tk::Pong class.</li>

    <li>import canvas definitions and methods.</li>

    <li>declare the @ISA list, which specifies how Perl looks up
    object methods. One difference between a derived widget and a
    composite widget is inclusion of Tk::Derived in the @ISA
    list.</li>

    <li>create the Pong class constructor.</li>

    <li>provide a <tt>Populate()</tt> method (the class
    constructor), called when a Pong widget is created, that
    customizes the canvas.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><i>pong's</i> <tt>Populate()</tt> procedure is really quite
  simple because it relies on existing canvas methods to create the
  game interface. This code automatically creates the paddle and
  one or more balls:</p>
  <pre>
my $paddle = $dw-&gt;create('rectangle', @paddle_shape,
                          -fill    =&gt; 'orange',
                          -outline =&gt; 'orange',     
);     
$dw-&gt;{paddle_ID} = $paddle;     
$dw-&gt;Tk::bind('&lt;Motion&gt;' =&gt; \&amp;move_paddle);  

$dw-&gt;ConfigSpecs( 
    -balls  =&gt; ['METHOD', undef, undef, [{}]], 
    -cursor =&gt; ['SELF', undef, undef,
                  ['@images/canv_cur.xbm', 
                   'images/canv_cur.mask',
              ($dw-&gt;configure(-background))[4], 'orange'] 
                ]
);   
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>create('rectangle')</tt> statement makes an orange
  paddle, whose shape is defined by the canvas coordinates of
  diagonally opposed rectangle corners. The paddle's canvas ID is
  saved in the object as an instance variable so that
  <tt>move_paddle()</tt> can move the paddle around the canvas -
  this private class method is bound to pointer motion events.</p>

  <p>Once again, in general, <tt>Populate()</tt> should not
  directly configure its widget. That's why there's no code to
  create the ball. Instead, <tt>ConfigSpecs()</tt> is used to
  define the widget's valid configuration options (<tt>-balls</tt>
  is one) and how to handle them. When <tt>Populate()</tt> returns,
  Perl/Tk then examines the configuration specifications and
  auto-configures the derived widget.</p>

  <p>A call to <tt>ConfigSpecs()</tt> consists of a series of
  <tt>keyword =&gt; value</tt> pairs, where the widget's keyword
  value is a list of 4 items: a string specifying exactly how to
  configure the keyword, its name in the X resource database, its
  class name, and its default value.</p>

  <p>We've seen the <tt>ConfigSpecs()</tt> 'METHOD' option before:
  when Perl/Tk sees a <tt>-balls</tt> attribute it invokes a method
  of the same name, minus the dash: <tt>balls()</tt>. And if you
  examine the source code on the TPJ web site, you'll note that all
  <tt>subroutine balls()</tt> really does is execute a
  <tt>$PONG-&gt;create('oval')</tt> command.</p>

  <p>The <tt>-cursor ConfigSpecs()</tt> option is moderately
  interesting. '<tt>SELF</tt>' says to apply the option to the
  derived widget itself. But why do we want to change the canvas'
  cursor? Well, just waggle your mouse around and watch the cursor
  closely. Very often it's shaped like an arrow, or perhaps an
  underscore, rectangle, I-beam, or X. But in a Pong game, when you
  move the mouse you only want to see the paddle move, not the
  paddle and a tag-along cursor. So <i>pong</i> defines a cursor
  consisting of a single orange pixel and associates it with the
  Pong widget, neatly camouflaging the cursor.</p>

  <p>Like <i>neko</i>, the Pong widget uses the canvas
  <tt>move()</tt> method to move the paddle around, but is driven
  by X motion events rather than timer events. An X motion event
  invokes <tt>move_paddle()</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
  
sub move_paddle {  
    my($canvas) = @ARG;  
    my $e = $canvas-&gt;XEvent;     
    my($x, $y) = ($e-&gt;x, $e-&gt;y);     

    $canvas-&gt;move($canvas-&gt;{paddle_ID}, 
        $x - $canvas-&gt;{last_paddle_x}, 
        $y - $canvas-&gt;{last_paddle_y});     

    $canvas-&gt;{last_paddle_x}, $canvas-&gt;{last_paddle_y})
        = ($x, $y);
} 
</pre>

  <p>This subroutine extracts the cursor's current position from
  the X event structure, executes <tt>move()</tt> using instance
  data from the Pong widget, and saves the paddle's position for
  next time.</p>

  <p>That takes care of paddle motion, but ball motion we handle
  ourselves, via the class method <tt>move_balls()</tt>, which has
  its own <tt>DoOneEvent()</tt> mini MainLoop. Ball movement boils
  down to yet another call to the <tt>move()</tt> canvas method,
  with incidentals like checking for collisions with walls or the
  paddle. Here's the code:</p>
  <pre>
 
sub move_balls {  

    # Move all the balls one "tick." We call DoOneEvent()
    # in case there are many balls; with only one it's
    # not strictly necessary.

    my($canvas, $speed) = @ARG;  
    my $ball;     
    foreach $ball (@{$canvas-&gt;{balls}}) {         
        $canvas-&gt;move_one_ball($ball, $speed); 

        # be kind and process XEvents as they arise     
        DoOneEvent($TK_DONT_WAIT); 
    }  
} 
</pre>Although the details of reflecting a ball and detecting
collisions are interesting, they're not relevant to our discussion,
so feel free to examine <tt>move_one_ball()</tt> yourself.

  <h3>Miscellaneous Event Commands</h3>

  <p>There are three other event commands that merit a little more
  explanation: <tt>update()</tt>, <tt>waitWindow()</tt>, and
  <tt>waitVisibility()</tt>. The <tt>update()</tt> method is useful
  for CPU-intensive programs in which you still want the
  application to respond to user interactions. If you occasionally
  call <tt>update()</tt> then all pending Tk events will be
  processed and all windows updated.</p>

  <p>The <tt>waitWindow()</tt> method waits for a widget, supplied
  as its argument, to be destroyed. For instance, you might use
  this command to wait for a user to finish interacting with a
  dialog box before using the result of that interaction. However,
  doing this requires creating and destroying the dialog each time.
  If you're concerned about efficiency, try <i>withdrawing</i> the
  window instead. Then use <tt>waitVisibility()</tt> to wait for a
  change in the dialog's visibility state.</p>

  <p>And so, until next time, when you manage events, think
  "mutually cooperative."</p>
