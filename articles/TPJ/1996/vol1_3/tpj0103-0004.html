  <h2 align="center">Penguin: The First Tentative Waddle</h2>

  <h4><i>Felix S. Gallo</i></h4>Last issue, we took a broad look at
  the Penguin modules and the fashion in which they implement
  secure "remotable" computing. This time around, your faithful
  servant weaves details into the tapestry as we examine the
  development of a neat 'place' and a nifty 'agent'.

  <p>Before we begin, let me note that Penguin, like Perl, is a
  continuing work. This code is written using 'One Penguin,' the
  first Penguin release; future releases may have slightly
  different (and hopefully superior) semantics, which will be
  explained in the release notes.</p>

  <p>Now that the disclaimers are over, let's set the stage. By its
  nature, Perl seems to attract writers, linguists, packrats,
  hackers, sharers and cooperators. Let's imagine that we're all of
  these rolled into one, and that we're a public-minded language
  hacker with a big collection of assorted text. Further, although
  we're generally trusting, we want to address the net
  defensively.</p>

  <p>We've decided to make our large collection of text available
  to the public's agents. Actually, it's all in the form of
  individual paragraphs, ranging from Shakespeare and Plato to
  fragments of UNIX manual pages and talk.bizarre articles.
  Further, we'd really rather enlarge our collection than merely
  slap it up on a web page for hordes of bored click-surfers.</p>

  <p>So we hatch a cunning plan, inspired by Big Bill Burroughs,
  the author who (notably and notoriously) wrote books by writing
  hundreds of paragraphs, cutting them out, and rearranging them
  more-or-less randomly on a page. We will let agents retrieve
  randomly selected paragraphs from our database two at a time.
  After an agent has received two paragraphs, we expect that she
  will also send us a brand new paragraph. Perhaps the agent will
  display the two paragraphs to her human master, who will then
  mull them over for a bit and try to write a paragraph which could
  naturally follow from both. Perhaps the agent has no human
  master, and instead pretends to have one by grabbing a paragraph
  from Usenet and submitting it blithely. Or perhaps the agent is
  another Burroughs server trading paragraphs with us. We don't
  care; we only wish to provide the mechanisms and a loose set of
  expected rules.</p>

  <p>So our plan is set. But before we start scribbling code
  willy-nilly, it may be illuminating to spend a moment visiting
  the Penguin architecture.</p>

  <p>Penguin is written in object-oriented Perl. It has three main
  classes: Channels, Frames and Wrappers. A Channel is an abstract
  conduit through which two Penguin programs communicate; as an
  example, a TCP Channel is included with Penguin which uses
  sockets to make the connection. A Frame is the basic unit of
  communication over a Channel; two Penguin programs chat by
  sending various kinds of Frames to each other. A Wrapper is an
  object which knows how to translate usable information (i.e.,
  code and data) into Frames and vice versa, possibly digitally
  signing it or verifying the signature at the same time.</p>

  <p>These concepts may seem alien, but in practice they flow
  fairly naturally. And, if you get lost, the documentation goes
  into relatively lavish detail.</p>

  <p>Without further ado, a-coding we will go!</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl   

use Penguin;              
use Penguin::Rights; 

# we want to receive code
use Penguin::Frame::Code; 

# we want to send data
use Penguin::Frame::Data; 

# PGP-signed frames are OK
use Penguin::Wrapper::PGP; 

# but we'll accept transparent ones too
use Penguin::Wrapper::Transparent; 

# required for execution of foreign code 
use Penguin::Compartment;

# we'll serve Penguin on a TCP port
use Penguin::Channel::TCP::Server; 

# where getparagraphs, etc. are implemented 
require 'paragraph_db_funcs.pl'; 
</pre>

  <p>Note that 'paragraph_db_funcs.pl' is not explicated here for
  reasons of space and tediousness. However, it is available, along
  with the rest of this source code, inside the Penguin
  distribution and on the TPJ web site.</p>
  <pre>
$PGP_PASSWORD = "kwisatz haderach"; 
</pre>

  <p>If we receive PGP-signed frames, PGP will need to be able to
  open the local PGP keyfile to find out who signed them; hence, we
  must provide it with our password. If this were a real
  application, we'd probably have the program turn echoing off and
  issue a prompt for the password instead of storing it in
  plaintext.</p>
  <pre>
$rightsdb = new Penguin::Rights;  

$rightsdb-&gt;get();
</pre>

  <p>Every Penguin program that cares about security instantiates a
  <tt>Rights</tt> object. This object (along with an associated
  file, usually called <tt>.rightsfile</tt>) keeps track of the
  people allowed to connect to a Penguin service and their
  associated access levels. See the pod pages for the exhaustively
  gory details.</p>
  <pre>
$mychannel = new Penguin::Channel::TCP::Server 
    Bind =&gt; 8585, Listen =&gt; 5; 
</pre>

  <p>Our Burroughs server will listen on port 8585, and will
  maintain a queue of 5 agents waiting for a connection.</p>
  <pre>
while(1) {     

    # blocks waiting for an agent to connect  
    $mychannel-&gt;open(); 

    ($remotehost, $remoteport) = $mychannel-&gt;getinfo();
    print "agent arrived from $remotehost, ". 'date' . "\n";

    # blocks waiting for a frame  
    $frame = $mychannel-&gt;getframe(); 

    if ($frame eq undef) {         
        print "agent was confused.\n";         
        $mychannel-&gt;close();         
        next;     
    }  

    ($title, $signer, $wrapmethod, $code) = 
          $frame-&gt;disassemble(Password =&gt; $PGP_PASSWORD); 
</pre>

  <p>If the frame was signed, and that person's PGP key is on our
  PGP keyring, then we'll know who they were and possibly be able
  to give them a higher (or, imaginably, lower) level of access. If
  the frame is not signed, then they'll get 'default' rights. For
  the Burroughs server, the 'default' rights are pretty permissive;
  default users can execute a fairly large set of opcodes, notably
  excepting file access and many opcodes which could deny service.
  See the 'SECURITY' file included with the Penguin distribution
  for a lengthy discussion of same.</p>
  <pre>
    $userrights = 
        $rightsdb-&gt;getrights(User =&gt; $signer);  

    print "agent is $title from $signer,", 
          " rights: $userrights\n";  

    $compartment = new Penguin::Compartment;     
    $compartment-&gt;initialize(Operations =&gt; $userrights);  

    $compartment-&gt;register(Share =&gt; "getparagraphs");    
    $compartment-&gt;register(Share =&gt; "putparagraph"); 
</pre>

  <p>Above we create a new compartment in which the foreign code
  will execute; because we don't want the foreign agent to be able
  to rummage through all of our files, we supply two "helper
  functions" which are the agent's only access to our paragraph
  database.</p>
  <pre>
    $result = $compartment-&gt;execute(Code =&gt; $code);     
    if ($@) { # illegal code tried to execute 
</pre>

  <p>Naughty, naughty! We report the misdeed in case someone was
  trying to make a nuisance out of themselves, and also return the
  agent's error message in case a human at the other end made a
  mistake.</p>
  <pre>
        $result = $@;         
        print "agent overstepped: $code\n";     
    } 
</pre>

  <p>Lastly, we put together a data frame containing the results of
  the execution of the agent in the code frame, send it back to the
  waiting application on the other side, and merrily wait for the
  next agent to arrive.</p>
  <pre>
 
    $resultframe = new Penguin::Frame::Data;     

    # Data frames always Transparent     
    $resultframe-&gt;assemble(Text =&gt; $result); 

    $mychannel-&gt;putframe(Frame =&gt; $resultframe); 
    $mychannel-&gt;close(); 
} 
</pre>

  <p>As may be evident, Penguin's syntax is fairly simple once you
  grasp the 'channel' and 'frame' metaphors. Because this
  application is fairly trusting, non-complex and not particularly
  demanding, it doesn't perform extensive checking. A more rigorous
  application might demand that all incoming code packets be
  PGP-signed, and further that the signer be known to the
  application before any execution is attempted. Penguin allows for
  this level of security awareness as well.</p>

  <p>So what have we done so far? We've implemented a Penguin
  server which sits on port 8585, waiting for agents to come
  calling. When an agent arrives, the server will set up a secure
  compartment, place the <tt>getparagraphs()</tt> and
  <tt>putparagraph()</tt> functions and the agent in that
  compartment, and then execute it. The result of the compartment
  is then sent back across the wire.</p>

  <p>But as those of us who were nerds in high school know, it's no
  fun going to a dance if you go solo. So here's a sample client
  which connects to our Burroughs server. It's named chick, and its
  call syntax is <tt>'chick &lt;hostname&gt;
  &lt;portnumber&gt;'</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl  

use Penguin; 
use Penguin::Rights; 
use Penguin::Frame::Code; 
use Penguin::Frame::Data; 

# We're not going to PGP-sign our frames.
use Penguin::Wrapper::Transparent;  

use Penguin::Compartment; 
use Penguin::Channel::TCP::Client;  

$targethost = shift; 
$targetport = shift;  

$mychannel = new Penguin::Channel::TCP::Client 
    Peer =&gt; $targethost,
    Port =&gt; $targetport;  

$mychannel-&gt;open() or die 
    "couldn't connect there.\n";  

$frame = new Penguin::Frame::Code 
    Wrapper =&gt; 'Penguin::Wrapper::Transparent'; 
</pre>

  <p>This program will actually connect to the server twice; each
  time, it will send one eentsy agent. Note that it would be very
  easy to modify this program to perform interesting processing on
  the server (if the server so allows).</p>
  <pre>
# frames not signed, password not needed
$frame-&gt;assemble( Password =&gt; '', 
                      Text =&gt; "&amp;getparagraphs()\n", 
                     Title =&gt; "Chick",              
                      Name =&gt; "Joe Random User");  

$mychannel-&gt;putframe(Frame =&gt; $frame);
</pre>

  <p>Having dropped a frame on the server, we now switch roles and
  wait for the server to let us know how our little agent did.
  Since our agent is composed of merely the 'getparagraphs'
  function call, we won't even check to see if there was a problem.
  More conscientious (and conscious) agents would probably work
  differently.</p>
  <pre>
$returnframe = $mychannel-&gt;getframe();  

$results = $frame1-&gt;disassemble(Password =&gt; '');  

print "Paragraphs from $targethost, $targetport\n"; 
print "Enter your paragraph following the second line.\n"; 
print "Terminate it with a blank line.\n"; 
print "--------------\n"; 
print $results, "\n"; 
print "--------------\n";  

$paragraph = ""; 
</pre>Now we ask our user for a paragraph so we can send it to the
server. It's important to note that the server, being somewhat
simplistic, has hung up on us by now, so we'll have to reattach; on
the other hand, this is a good thing, because if the user is
playing by the rules, she may be sallying forth on a serious
literary effort.
  <pre>
while (chomp($line = &lt;STDIN&gt;)) {     
    last if $line eq '';     
    $paragraph = $paragraph . $line . "\n"; 
}  

# make minor attempt to escape single quotes to prevent 
# agent from screwing up  
$paragraph =~ s/\'/\\\'/; 

$mychannel-&gt;close();  

$mychannel = new Penguin::Channel::TCP::Client 
    Peer =&gt; $targethost, 
    Port =&gt; $portnumber;  

$frame = new Penguin::Frame::Code 
    Wrapper =&gt; 'Penguin::Wrapper::Transparent'; 

# frames not signed, password not needed.
$frame-&gt;assemble( Password =&gt; '', 
    Text  =&gt; "&amp;putparagraph('$paragraph')\n"; 
    Title =&gt; "Chick",
    Name  =&gt; "Joe Random User"); 

$mychannel-&gt;putframe(Frame =&gt; $frame); 
$returnframe = $mychannel-&gt;getframe();  

$results = $frame1-&gt;disassemble(Password =&gt; ''); 
print "Server says: $results\n";
</pre>

  <p>At last, a pair of programs that can make beautiful music
  together. Here's a sample run of <tt>chick</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
 
$ chick coriolan.amicus.com 8585 
Paragraphs from coriolan.amicus.com, 8585 
Enter your paragraph following the second line. 
Terminate it with a blank line. 
-------------- 
Breathes there a man with soul so dead, that to himself has 
never said, this is my home, my native net?  

Gosling crouched behind the burning trashcan, the wild flames 
dancing in the twin moons of his glasses.  Must keep moving, he 
thought to himself.  In the store window across the street, a 
wall of televisions kept replaying the footage of the black 
wave that still streamed into California, waddling towards 
JavaSoft headquarters... 
-------------- 
And thus falls the great chilly tuxedoed wrath upon all who 
create ugly languages!  

Server says: Thanks! 
$  
</pre>

  <p>Whups, got carried away for a minute. As you can see, the
  operation was a success; with just a few lines of Perl, we have
  created a full fledged interactive Internet literary depository.
  With just a little imagination, the methods and code we've used
  could be put to use in games, distributed prime number factoring
  platforms, shared address books, and object brokers, just to name
  a few applications.</p>

  <p>Grab Penguin and waddle forth!</p>

  <p>A brief word about the Burroughs server: as of this writing,
  this server does exist, and stands ready to serve paragraph
  requests and accept submissions. <tt>chick</tt>, the client
  program depicted above, is available from the Penguin
  distribution site; however, I'd be happy to see other agents
  working on the Burroughs server, doing whatever they felt like
  doing. Modify <tt>chick</tt> for your own nefarious purposes, or
  assemble your own agent.</p>

  <p>The Penguin distribution site is currently alive and well at
  http://coriolan.amicus.com/penguin.html; however, Penguin is also
  available through CPAN, so you may wish to try there first. The
  Penguin mailing list, penguin@amicus.com, is a good place to ask
  questions; subscribe and unsubscribe to it by sending mail to
  penguin-request@amicus.com.</p>

  <p>Next issue, in Penguin: Safe and Secure, we travel to distant
  lands and other modules to explore in depth how Penguin
  implements its security model. Until then, stay frosty!</p>
