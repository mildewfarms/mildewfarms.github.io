  <h4><i>Jon Orwant</i></h4>A module, for those of you who don't
  know, is a self-contained package of Perl code designed for
  re-use and placed in a file ending in <i>.pm</i>. The module's
  contents are imported into your program when you <tt>use()</tt>
  it. There's a worldwide, replicated repository of free modules
  called the CPAN (for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, modeled
  after TeX's CTAN), so when someone writes a subroutine to, say,
  decode Base 64-encoded text, he or she can upload the module to
  the CPAN for everyone's benefit.

  <p>In futue issues, this column that will provide brief
  descriptions of the latest modules. But to launch the column,
  I'll serve up a CPAN buffet: a listing of the all the CPAN
  bundles and a sampling of modules from each. The modules I've
  chosen aren't necessarily the most popular or the most useful,
  but those most likely to give you an inkling of what you'll find
  when you browse through the hundreds of modules available. Be
  sure to check the exhaustive (90K) module list, tirelessly edited
  by Tim Bunce and Andreas K&ouml;nig. You can find copies at:</p>

  <p>Secure your place in the Perl pantheon by writing a module of
  your own and contributing to the CPAN: <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/04pause.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/04pause.html</a>
  for details. Tim and Andreas' module list contains some excellent
  tips about how to write, document, and name your module.</p>

  <p>You probably already have a few of the modules listed here,
  such as English, POSIX, Env, Math::BigFloat, and Socket. They're
  bundled with the standard Perl distribution, and you can find
  them in your lib directory. The location of lib depends on your
  Perl configuration; execute perl <tt>-e 'print "@INC"'</tt> to
  see where your Perl looks for modules, or use the Config module
  to see where modules were installed on your system: <tt>perl -e
  'use Config; print $Config{privlib}'</tt>.</p>

  <p>If your module is stable and of general interest to Perl
  programmers, let me know by sending a brief description (no more
  than a short paragraph) to perl-journal-submissions@perl.com for
  inclusion in this column.</p>
