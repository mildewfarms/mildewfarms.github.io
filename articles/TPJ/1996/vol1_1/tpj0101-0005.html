  <p>In this first installment of my Web CGI column, I'll introduce
  you to the elements of CGI scripting using the basic CGI module,
  CGI.pm. In later installments I'll cover the more advanced CGI::*
  library, a collection of modules providing an object-oriented
  class hierarchy which gives you more control over the behavior of
  CGI scripts.</p>

  <p>CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface; it's the standard way
  to attach a piece of software to a World Wide Web URL. The
  majority of URLs refer to static files. When a remote user
  requests the file's URL, the Web server translates the request
  into a physical file path and returns it. However, URLs can also
  refer to executable files known as CGI scripts. When the server
  accesses this type of URL, it executes the script, sending the
  script's output to the browser. This mechanism lets you create
  dynamic pages, questionnaires, database query screens, order
  forms, and other interactive documents. It's not limited to text:
  CGI scripts can generate on-the-fly pictures, sounds, animations,
  applets or anything else.</p>

  <p>The basic CGI script is simple:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

print "Content-type: text/html\r\n";
print "\r\n";
chomp($time = 'date');
print&lt;&lt;EOF;
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Virtual Clock&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Virtual Clock&lt;/H1&gt;
At the tone, the time will be 
&lt;STRONG&gt;$time&lt;/STRONG&gt;.
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
EOF
</pre>

  <p>This script begins by printing out an HTTP header. HTTP
  headers consist of a series of e-mail style header fields
  separated by carriage-return/newline pairs - in Perl, "\r\n".</p>

  <p>After the last field, the header is terminated by a blank line
  - another "\r\n" sequence. Although HTTP recognizes many
  different field names, the only one you usually need is
  "Content-type", which tells the browser the document's MIME
  (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) type, determining how it
  will be displayed. You'll often want to specify "text/html" for
  the value of this field, but any MIME type, including graphics
  and audio, is acceptable.</p>

  <p>Next, the script uses the Unix date command to place the
  current time in the Perl variable $time. It then proceeds to
  print a short HTML document, incorporating the timestamp directly
  into the text.</p>

  <p>The output will look something like this on a browser:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/stein-fig1.gif"><img src=
  "images/stein-fig1_small.gif" width="264" height="125" border="0"
  alt=""></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 4:</b> Virtual Clock
  Script</font></p>

  <p>Each time you reload this script you'll see a different time
  and date.</p>

  <p>Things get trickier when you need to process information
  passed to your script from the remote user. If you've spent any
  time on the Web, URLs invoking CGI scripts will look familiar.
  CGI scripts can be invoked without any parameters:</p>
  <pre>
http://some.site/cgi-bin/hello_world.pl
</pre>

  <p>To send parameters to a script, add a question mark to the
  script name, followed by whatever parameters you want to
  send:</p>
  <pre>
http://some.site/cgi-bin/index_search.pl?CGI+perl
</pre>
  <pre>
http://some.site/cgi-bin/order.pl?cat_no=3921&amp;quantity=2
</pre>

  <p>The examples above show the two most commonly used styles for
  parameter passing. The first shows the <i>keyword list</i> style,
  in which the parameters are a series of keywords separated by +
  signs. This style is traditionally used for various types of
  index searches. The second shows a <i>named parameter list</i>: a
  series of "parameter=value" pairs with "&amp;"s in between. This
  style is used internally by browsers to transmit the contents of
  a fill-out form.</p>

  <p>Both the script's URL and its parameters are subject to URL
  escaping rules. Whitespace, control characters, and most
  punctuation characters are replaced by a percent sign and the
  hexadecimal code for the character. For example, the space
  between the words "John Doe" should be passed to a CGI script
  like this:</p>
  <pre>
http://some.site/cgi-bin/find_address.pl?name=John%20Doe
</pre>

  <p>since spaces are ASCII 32, and 32 is hexadecimal 20.</p>

  <p>The problem with processing script parameters is that, for
  various historical reasons, the rules for fetching and
  translating the parameters are annoyingly complex. Sometimes the
  script parameters are found in an environment variable. But they
  can also be accessed via the command line (<tt>@ARGV</tt>) array.
  Or, they can be passed via standard input. Usually you'll have to
  recognize the URL escape sequences and translate them, but in
  some circumstances the server will do that for you. Which rules
  apply depend on whether your script was generated by a
  <tt>GET</tt> or <tt>POST</tt> request (the former is usually
  generated when a user selects a hypertext link; the latter when a
  browser submits the contents of a fill-out form), whether the
  parameters are formatted using the keyword list or named
  parameter styles, and whether the browser takes advantage of the
  Netscape 2.0 file upload feature.</p>

  <p>Fortunately CGI.pm (and the CGI::* modules discussed in later
  columns) knows the rules. It takes care of the details so that
  you can concentrate on your application.</p>

  <p>CGI.pm combines several functions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It parses and decodes CGI parameter lists.</li>

    <li>It provides access to HTTP header information provided by
    the browser and server.</li>

    <li>It provides an easy way of generating HTTP header
    responses.</li>

    <li>It acts as a shortcut HTML generator for creating fill-out
    forms, and produces HTML that helps maintain the state of a
    form from page to page.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>CGI.pm requires Perl 5.001 or higher. Its home base is:</p>

  <p><a href=
  "http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/cgi_docs.html"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/cgi_docs.html</a></p>

  <p>It's also widely distributed via the <a href=
  "http://perl.com/CPAN" target="resource window">CPAN</a>. It
  installs like any other Perl module. You can either copy it
  directly to your Perl library directory, or you can use the Perl5
  MakeMaker program to locate the library directory and install
  CGI.pm for you.</p>

  <p>Using CGI.pm, we can enhance the simple virtual clock script
  to allow the remote user some control over the time format. This
  script allows the user to control whether the time, day, month,
  and year are displayed, and toggle between displaying the time in
  12-hour or 24-hour format.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI;

$q = new CGI;
if ($q-&gt;param) {
    if ($q-&gt;param('time')) {
        $format = ($q-&gt;param('type') eq '12-hour') ? 
                              '%r ' : '%T ';
    }
    $format .= '%A ' if $q-&gt;param('day');
    $format .= '%B ' if $q-&gt;param('month');
    $format .= '%d ' if $q-&gt;param('day-of-month');
    $format .= '%Y ' if $q-&gt;param('year');
} else { $format = '%r %A %B %d %Y' }

chomp($time = 'date '+$format'');
 
# print the HTTP header and the HTML document
print $q-&gt;header;
print $q-&gt;start_html('Virtual Clock');

print "&lt;H1&gt;Virtual Clock&lt;/H1&gt;At the tone, 
       the time will be &lt;STRONG&gt;$time&lt;/STRONG&gt;.";
print "&lt;HR&gt;&lt;H2&gt;Set Clock Format&lt;/H2&gt;";

# create the clock settings form
print $q-&gt;start_form, "Show: ";
print $q-&gt;checkbox(-name=&gt;'time', -checked=&gt;1), 
          $q-&gt;checkbox(-name=&gt;'day',-checked=&gt;1);
print $q-&gt;checkbox(-name=&gt;'month',-checked=&gt;1),
          $q-&gt;checkbox(-name=&gt;'day-of-month',-checked=&gt;1);
print $q-&gt;checkbox(-name=&gt;'year', -checked=&gt;1), 
                          "&lt; P&gt;";
print "Time style: ", $q-&gt;radio_group(-name=&gt;'type',
           -values=&gt;['12-hour','24-hour']),"&lt; P&gt;";

print $q-&gt;reset(-name =&gt; 'Reset'), 
            $q-&gt;submit(-name =&gt; 'Set'); 
print $q-&gt;end_form;
print $q-&gt;end_html;
</pre>

  <p>Before I explain how this program works, let's see what it
  does:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/stein-fig2.gif"><img src=
  "images/stein-fig2_small.gif" width="273" height="125" border="0"
  alt=""></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 5:</b> Regenerating
  Virtual Clock Script</font></p>

  <p>Let's walk through this script step by step:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>We load the CGI module and send a <tt>new()</tt> message to
    the CGI class. This creates a new CGI object, which we store in
    the Perl variable <tt>$q</tt>. Parameter parsing takes place
    during the <tt>new()</tt> call, so you don't have do it
    explicitly.</li>

    <li>Next, using specifications determined by the script
    parameters, we create a format string to pass to the UNIX date
    command. The key to accessing script parameters is the CGI
    <tt>param()</tt> call. <tt>param()</tt> is designed for the
    named parameter list style of script argument (another method
    call, <tt>keywords()</tt>, is used to access keyword lists).
    Called without arguments, <tt>param()</tt> returns an array of
    all the named parameters. Called with the name of a parameter,
    <tt>param()</tt> returns its value, or an array of values if
    the parameter appears more than once in the script parameter
    list. In this case, we look for parameters named <i>time, day,
    month, day-of-month, year and style</i>. Using their values, we
    build up a time format specifier to pass to the date command
    (see its manual page for details). If no parameters are present
    - for instance, if the script is being called for the very
    first time - we create a default format specifier. Then we call
    the date command and save its value in <tt>$time</tt> as
    before.</li>

    <li>We create the HTTP header using the CGI <tt>header()</tt>
    method. This method returns a string containing a fully-formed
    HTTP header, which the program immediately prints out. Called
    without any parameters, <tt>header()</tt> returns a string
    declaring that the document is of the content type "text/html".
    To create documents of other MIME types, you can call
    <tt>header()</tt> with the MIME type of your choice, e.g.
      <pre>
print $q-&gt;header('image/gif');
</pre>

      <p>You can also use the named-parameter style of calling to
      produce headers containing any of the fields defined in the
      HTTP protocol:</p>
      <pre>
print $q-&gt;header(-Status =&gt; 200,
                    -Type =&gt; 'image/gif',
                    -Pragma =&gt; 'no cache',
                    '-Content-length' =&gt; 8457);
</pre>

      <p>You don't have to remember to write that blank line after
      the HTTP header. <tt>header()</tt> does it for you.</p>
    </li>

    <li>We start the HTML document by printing out the string
    returned by <tt>start_html()</tt>. Called with just one
    argument, this method returns an HTML &lt;HEAD&gt; section and
    the opening tag for the HTML &lt;BODY&gt;. The argument becomes
    the title of the document. As in <tt>header()</tt> you can call
    <tt>start_html()</tt> with named parameters to specify such
    things as the author's e-mail address, or the background color
    (a Netscape extension):
      <pre>
print $q-&gt;start_html(
               -Title =&gt; 'Virtual Document',
               -Author =&gt; 'andy@putamen.com',
               -BGCOLOR =&gt; '#00A0A0');
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>The program then spits out a few lines of HTML, including
    the formatted time string.</li>

    <li>This is followed by a horizontal line and a fill-out form
    that allows the user to adjust the format of the displayed
    time. CGI.pm has a whole series of HTML shortcuts for
    generating fill-out form elements. We start the form by
    printing out the

      <form>
        string returned by the <tt>start_form()</tt> method, and
        then create a series of checkboxes (using the
        <tt>checkbox()</tt> method), a pair of radio buttons (using
        the <tt>radio_group()</tt> method), and the standard Reset
        and Submit buttons (using the <tt>reset()</tt> and
        <tt>submit()</tt> methods). There are similar methods for
        creating text input fields, popup menus, scrolling lists
        and clickable image maps. One of the features of these
        methods is that if a named parameter is defined from an
        earlier invocation of the script, its value is "sticky": a
        checkbox that was previously turned on will remain on. This
        feature makes it possible to keep track of a series of user
        interactions in order to create multipart questionnaires,
        shopping-cart scripts, and progressively more complex
        database queries. Each of these methods accepts optional
        arguments that adjust the appearance and behavior; for
        example, you can adjust the height of a scrolling list with
        the -size parameter. After we finish the form, we close it
        with a call to <tt>end_form()</tt>.

        <ul>
          <li>We end the virtual document by printing the string
          returned by <tt>end_html()</tt>, which returns the
          &lt;/BODY&gt; and &lt;/HTML&gt; tags.</li>
        </ul>
      </form>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>In addition to its basic parameter-parsing, HTTP
  header-creating, and HTML shortcut-generating abilities, CGI.pm
  contains functions for saving and restoring the script's state to
  files and pipes, generating browser redirection instructions, and
  accessing useful information about the transaction, such as the
  type of browser, the machine it's running on, and the list of
  MIME types it canl accept.</p>

  <p>The next column will discuss how to handle errors generated by
  CGI scripts, and additional techniques for maintaining state in
  CGI transactions.</p>
