  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  April 5, 1998. FBI agents break down your door and hustle you
  downtown for interrogation. Seems you've been using illicit
  cryptography to exchange information about - well, they're not
  exactly sure, because you used cryptography, but they know it
  must be sinister because, hey, you used cryptography. And they
  know who you were talking to: the FBI's packet sniffers (and
  subpoenaed router logs) revealed that you were communicating with
  your friend a few miles away. They've arrested him too.

  <p>You're going to jail. The question is, for how long?</p>

  <p>The FBI doesn't have enough evidence to convict you of the new
  crime, Encoding In The First Degree, which carries a penalty of
  five years in jail. But they can convict you of Second Degree
  Encoding, and that's two long years in the overcrowded Dubuque
  Minimum Security Federal Penitentiary for Computer Abusers.</p>

  <p>They offer you a deal: if you agree to confess, and testify
  against your friend, they'll let you go free. They offer your
  friend the same deal. But if you both decide to testify against
  one another, you each get four years in jail. You must both
  decide what to do in solitude, without communicating. (That's why
  they split you up.)</p>

  <p>You can either Testify (T) or Hold Out (H), and your friend
  can do the same. The outcomes are shown in this payoff
  matrix:</p>

  <table width="260" align="center" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
  border="1">
    <tr>
      <td colspan="4" align="center"><b>Your Friend</b></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td width="25" rowspan="3" valign="middle"><b>You</b></td>

      <td width="15">&nbsp;</td>

      <td width="115" align="center"><b>T</b></td>

      <td width="115" align="center"><b>H</b></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td width="15"><b>T</b></td>

      <td width="85">You get 4 years<br>
      Friend gets 4 years</td>

      <td width="85">You get 0 years<br>
      Friend gets 5 years</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td width="15"><b>H</b></td>

      <td width="85">You get 5 years<br>
      Friend gets 0 years</td>

      <td width="85">You get 2 years<br>
      Friend gets 2 years</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>What should you do? You might think to yourself, <i>"If I
  testify, I'll get either four years or zero years. And if I hold
  out, I'll get either five years or two years. I have no idea what
  my friend will do, and I can't talk to him. Maybe I should assume
  that he'll choose at random, in which case I'm better off
  testifying."</i></p>

  <p>If your friend thinks the same way, you'll both testify and
  get four years each. That's unfortunate, since the outcome with
  the fewest number of man-years in jail occurs when you both hold
  out.</p>

  <p>This problem is called the Prisoner's Dilemma, and it's the
  foundation for a mathematical discipline called game theory. It's
  been used to represent scenarios in gambling, genetics, business,
  and thermonuclear war, by using different payoffs: money,
  offspring, more money, and death.</p>

  <h3>The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma</h3>

  <p>There's not a whole lot to say about the "one-shot" Prisoner's
  Dilemma: either you should testify or you shouldn't, and you can
  construct compelling arguments for both decisions.</p>

  <p>Here's when things get interesting: forget about the prison
  terms and think of the payoff matrix as abstract "points". Now
  pit you and your friend against one another in a series of
  matches, say 100. Your goal is to minimize the number of points
  you accrue during the 100 matches.</p>

  <p>Now there's a little bit of communication between you and your
  friend: for any given match, you can consider all of the previous
  matches before making your decision. If your friend held out on
  all the previous matches, you might think that he'll remain
  consistent, and hold out again. But maybe that's just what he
  wants you to think, so that he can testify, adding five points to
  your score and none to his. (Remember, he's a criminal too!)</p>

  <p>Here's a simple always-hold-out strategy:</p>
  <pre>
sub nice_guy {
    return "H";
}
</pre>

  <p>Here's a strategy that chooses at random:</p>
  <pre>
sub random {
    return "H" if rand() &lt; 0.5;
    return "T";
}
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>Here's <tt>parting_shot()</tt>, which holds out on the first
  99 matches, and testifies on the last (100th) match. The history
  of your choices is stored in the array reference
  <tt>$my_choices_ref</tt> (which becomes the array
  <tt>@my_choices</tt>). <tt>parting_shot()</tt> only uses that
  array to determine when the 100th match has been reached.</p>
  <pre>
sub parting_shot {
  my ($my_ref,$friend_ref) = @_;
  my (@my_choices) = @$my_ref;
&#13;  if (@my_choices == 99) {
      return "T"
  } else { return "H" }
}
</pre>

  <p>Here's a strategy called tit-for-tat, which says, "I'll hold
  out on the first match, after which I'll choose whatever you
  chose last time."</p>
  <pre>
sub tit_for_tat {
    my ($my_ref, $friend_ref) = @_;
    my (@friend_choices) = @$friend_ref;
&#13;    return "H" unless @friend_choices;
    return $friend_choices[$#friend_choices];
}
</pre>

  <p>Tit-for-tat variants usually perform well in Prisoner's
  Dilemma contests. Random strategies aren't so bad either. Of
  course, that all depends on which other strategies participate.
  There's no single best strategy - just the best strategy for a
  given match.</p>

  <h3>The Three-way Prisoner's Dilemma</h3>

  <p>Let's add another level of complexity: a three-person
  Prisoner's Dilemma, in which three strategies compete
  simultaneously. Here's the payoff matrix (actually a payoff
  cube):</p>

  <table width="460" align="center" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
  border="1">
    <!-- row 1 -->

    <tr>
      <td colspan="6" align="center"><b>(Friend 1, Friend
      2)</b></td>
    </tr><!-- row 2 -->

    <tr>
      <td width="25" rowspan="3" valign="middle"><b>You</b></td>

      <td width="15">&nbsp;</td>

      <td width="105" align="center"><b>(T, T)</b></td>

      <td width="105" align="center"><b>(T, H)</b></td>

      <td width="105" align="center"><b>(H, T)</b></td>

      <td width="105" align="center"><b>(T, H)</b></td>
    </tr><!-- row 3 -->

    <tr>
      <td width="15"><b>T</b></td>

      <td width="105" align="center">You: 4<br>
      Friend 1: 4<br>
      Friend 2: 4</td>

      <td width="105" align="center">You: 1<br>
      Friend 1: 1<br>
      Friend 2: 7</td>

      <td width="105" align="center">You: 1<br>
      Friend 1: 7<br>
      Friend 2: 1</td>

      <td width="105" align="center">You: 0<br>
      Friend 1: 5<br>
      Friend 2: 5</td>
    </tr><!-- row 4 -->

    <tr>
      <td width="15"><b>H</b></td>

      <td width="105" align="center">You: 7<br>
      Friend 1: 1<br>
      Friend 2: 1</td>

      <td width="105" align="center">You: 5<br>
      Friend 1: 0<br>
      Friend 2: 5</td>

      <td width="105" align="center">You: 5<br>
      Friend 1: 5<br>
      Friend 2: 0</td>

      <td width="105" align="center">You: 2<br>
      Friend 1: 2<br>
      Friend 2: 2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>When one person testifies and the other two hold out, the fink
  gets off scot-free, and the holdouts get five years each. When
  two people testify, they get one year each, and the holdout gets
  seven.</p>

  <p>As before, the only communication between the prisoners is
  through their actions on previous matches. Here's a sample
  strategy for a three-way contest:</p>
  <pre>
# Testify only if both friends testified 
# during the last match.
&#13;sub fool_me_twice {
  my ($my_ref, $friend1_ref, $friend2_ref) = @_;  
  my (@friend1_choices) = @$friend1_ref;
  my (@friend2_choices) = @$friend2_ref;
&#13;  if ($friend1_choices[$#friend1_choices] eq "T" &amp;&amp;
      $friend2_choices[$#friend2_choices] eq "T") {       
           return "T";
  } else { return "H" }
}
</pre>

  <h3>The Prisoner's Dilemma Programming Contest</h3>We invite you
  to design your own three-way strategy, to be pitted against the
  rest of the Perl community.

  <p>Every strategy should be a single subroutine. During a match,
  the subroutine will be passed three array references (as with
  fool_me_twice() above): the first will contain an array of your
  past decisions, and the second and third will contain the
  decision arrays for friend1 and friend2 respectively.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your subroutine must always return either "H" or "T".</li>

    <li>Your subroutine will play every other subroutine at least
    once, in a series of exactly 100 matches.</li>

    <li>The winning strategy will be the one with the lowest
    cumulative score over all matches.</li>

    <li>Your entry must have comments before the subroutine with
    your name, e-mail address, and a truthful explanation of the
    strategy.</li>

    <li>The random number generator will be initialized before
    every series of 100 matches, should you care to use it.</li>

    <li>One entry per person.</li>

    <li>Mail entries to perl-journal-contest@perl.com. Entries must
    be received by midnight EST on May 1, 1996.</li>

    <li>The best strategies will be announced in the <a href=
    "../vol1_2/tpj0102-0009.html">Summer (June) issue of TPJ</a>,
    and on our Web site, and on comp.lang.perl.misc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Good luck!</p>
