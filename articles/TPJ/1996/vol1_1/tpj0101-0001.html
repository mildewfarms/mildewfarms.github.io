  <h3>Welcome to The Perl Journal.</h3>

  <p>Why hasn't there been a publication devoted to Perl until now?
  It's not that there haven't been enough Perl programmers. It's
  certainly not that Perl is a "niche" language (whatever that is).
  And it's not even that we needed the yeastlike explosion of the
  Web to swell our ranks by the thousands. Perhaps it's simply that
  those of us devoted enough to create TPJ were having too much fun
  programming to calm down and write.</p>

  <p>Perl is like that. I'll leave it to the sociologists to
  discuss the addictive qualities of computer programming, and I'll
  leave it to Larry Wall to talk about the seductive qualities of
  Perl in particular (Wherefore Art, Thou?).</p>

  <p>But Perl is a pleasure to write about: it's quirky and useful
  and fun. We hope the same will be said of TPJ. Most computer
  magazines are educational but unentertaining: recipe books for
  busy programmers. We're aiming a bit higher, for an
  intellectually stimulating publication that explores the craft of
  Perl, the craft of programming, and a few other crafts as well:
  our next issue features Lincoln Stein's piece, "How Perl Saved
  The Human Genome Project," which has a dash of Perl and a healthy
  dose of biology, and is a good example of the eclectic articles
  we plan to provide.</p>

  <p>Sometimes it's easy to forget that computer languages, like
  human languages, aren't merely ways to accomplish tasks, but
  tools for thinking about the world. It would be easier for us to
  concentrate on the "how" of Perl rather than the "why" or the
  "what now", but not as much fun. We want TPJ to be intricate and
  interesting, like Perl itself.</p>

  <p>Whenever I catch myself marveling at something intricate and
  interesting, like watches or automobiles or televisions, I ask
  myself, "Does the design of this thing follow from its function?
  If the inventor hadn't existed, would it have been invented by
  someone else?" It's a question about the uniqueness of the
  design: if the Wright brothers had never lived, the airplane
  would just have been invented by someone else, because the
  principle that imparts lift to wings is easily discovered,
  conceptually simple, and overwhelmingly useful. On the other
  hand, televisions can be built in many different yet perfectly
  workable ways - the TVs we have now are quite similar to the
  original 1940s-era sets, not because the current broadcasting
  scheme is ideal (far from it) but because it was chosen as the
  standard back then. Another equally valid scheme might have "won"
  just as easily.</p>

  <p>Now consider computer languages: which ones needed to be
  invented? Certainly LISP, with its elegance of design and origins
  in mathematics, and probably C as well, as a natural evolution
  from assembly language. But not Perl - it's too weird.</p>

  <p>In part, that weirdness derives from its heritage - Perl is a
  melting pot of computer languages. It has quite a few parents:
  BASIC and shells and awk and sed and Modula-2 and C. C has only
  one parent: assembly language (well, not counting BCPL or B), and
  LISP has none at all, having sprung fully formed from the brains
  of Smart People. Perl was the result of eugenics, from the
  premise that anything done often should be done concisely, and by
  considering the typical errors made by novices (or careless
  experts).</p>

  <p>Weirdness doesn't mean instability. True, Perl has grown a lot
  since its birth in 1987. But it's middle-aged now, and barring a
  mid-life crisis, will change less and less in the future. The
  language remains as fertile as ever, however, thanks to Perl 5
  modules and their availability in a centralized (but replicated)
  location, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (see page 29)
  which helps the worldwide library of Perl code grow at a
  phenomenal rate. It also ensures that TPJ will always have enough
  material.</p>

  <p>However, I'll occasionally exercise every editor's right to
  waste valuable column-inches commenting about minor stylistic
  changes to the publication: "We've now switched our font to
  Gutenberg Triply Aliased Semibold" or "our paper is now made from
  recycled Python books." Sorry if these comments don't interest
  you - they're my consolation for having to spend time managing
  instead of writing.</p>

  <p>A few words about managing: we're starting small, but hope to
  grow rapidly, with more pictures, pages, and issues per year. But
  we plan to achieve our dream of solvency from advertising
  revenue, not subscriptions. (For $25 per twelfth-of-a-page, you
  can say whatever you want to our readership. End of sales
  pitch.)</p>

  <p>If you have any comments about TPJ, drop us a note at
  perl-journal-letters@perl.com. Negative criticism is welcome, too
  - editors always like to include a little vitriol so that they're
  not accused of bias. Not that we intend to be fair. On the
  contrary, we intend to be blind fanatics when it comes to Perl.
  If it can't be done in our precious language, it's obviously not
  worth doing. This is not Byte. It's not even Dr. Dobbs. We're a
  lot smaller, and the size of a magazine is inversely proportional
  to its chutzpah. That's why 'zines are full of bad drawings and
  bad attitude, and Newsweek is, well, Newsweek.</p>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>
