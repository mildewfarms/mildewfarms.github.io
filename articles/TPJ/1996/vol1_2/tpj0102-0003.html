  <h2 align="center">Perl and the Tk Extension - The Mouse
  Odometer</h2>

  <h4><i>Steve Lidie</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->

  <p>Hopefully you read my last column which discussed Perl/Tk
  fundamentals, and you're now at least a seasoned Tk novice.
  Assuming so, let's move right along and examine the Perl/Tk
  implementation of The Mouse Odometer, named <i>modo</i>.</p>

  <p><i>modo</i> has got to be one of the most pointless programs
  ever written, but hey, it illustrates numerous Perl/Tk features
  so it does have some value. I first saw similar code for the
  MacIntosh, written by Sean P. Nolan, that simply tracked a
  machine's cursor. Currently I have logged well over 51 kilometers
  on my cursor, while my mouse has careened around its pad some 14
  kilometers. <i>modo</i> as described here runs with Perl 5.002
  and Tk-b11, available from a friendly CPAN site near you.</p>

  <p>Most of this column is not about <i>modo</i> and how it works,
  but rather the Perl/Tk features it uses. This time we'll learn
  how to schedule asynchronous timer events, look more closely at
  window manager commands, menus, menubuttons and the ColorEditor,
  and create and explain in detail an object oriented Perl/Tk
  composite widget, the Odometer. Like a car's odometer, we want
  our mouse odometer to record the <i>physical distance</i>
  traveled by the mouse, not the number of pixels. In a car, you
  want to know how many miles you've traveled, not the number of
  tire-lengths; after all, those vary from car to car. In the X
  window system you can use the <tt>xdpyinfo</tt> command to find
  out the number of millimeters-per-pixel of your display, and
  that, multiplied by a pixel count, gives the distance in
  millimeters. Unfortunately, pixels aren't always square, so there
  are actually two numbers to worry about:
  <tt>millimeters_x/pixels_x</tt> and
  <tt>millimeters_y/pixels_y</tt>. Once we know those numbers, we
  can figure out the distance <i>D</i> given the number of pixels
  traversed in the X and Y directions, which we'll call <i>dX</i>
  and <i>dY</i>:</p>
  <pre>
  D = sqrt((dX * (mmX/pixelsX)) ** 2 +
           (dY * (mmY/pixelsY)) ** 2);
</pre>

  <p>How can we figure out <i>dX</i> and <i>dY</i>? Well, Tk
  provides the command <tt>pointerxy()</tt>, which returns a
  two-element list: the cursor's absolute X and Y coordinates. (In
  deference to Einstein, who taught us that nothing is absolute,
  we'll say "relative to the root window of your display.") So if
  we call <tt>pointerxy()</tt> twice, we can subtract the results,
  yielding our dX and dY. Then we can just apply the above formula.
  (Which is thankfully just the Pythagorean Theorem, since we're
  dealing with a non-curved two-space. Otherwise we might need
  Albert's ten-dimensional tensors!)</p>

  <p>The major components are a row of menubuttons (often called a
  <i>menubar</i>), two sets of odometers (one for the cursor and
  one for the pointer), and a status line showing the distance
  units and cursor coordinates. Here is <i>modo</i>'s main loop,
  with a tiny amount of code dealing with pointing device distance
  removed for clarity:</p>
  <pre>
sub <i>modo</i> { 
    # Track the cursor forever, periodically updating the
    # odometer file. 
    my($x, $y) = $MW-&gt;pointerxy;    
    $W_MISC_TEXT = sprintf("U=%-3s (%4d,%4d)",
                                     $modo_UNITS_HUMAN, $x, $y);    
    my($dx, $dy) = (abs($x - $LAST_X), abs($y - $LAST_Y));
    ($LAST_X, $LAST_Y) = ($x, $y);    
    my($dxmm,$dymm) = ($dx*$MM_PIXEL_X, $dy*$MM_PIXEL_Y);
    my $d = sqrt( ($dxmm * $dxmm) + 
                  ($dymm * $dymm) ); 
    $W_CODO-&gt;add($d,$modo_UNITS) if $d &gt; 0;
    if ($AUTOSAVE_COUNT-- &lt;= 0) {       
        $AUTOSAVE_COUNT = $AUTOSAVE_TICKS; 
        eval {save_<i>modo</i>}; 
    } 
    $MW-&gt;after($MILLISECOND_DELAY, \&amp;<i>modo</i>); 
}
</pre>

  <p>Upon startup, <i>modo</i>() is called once, and exactly once.
  The subroutine performs several tasks:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>it fetches the pointer's X/Y information and updates the
    variable <tt>$W_MISC_TEXT</tt> with the current display units
    and cursor's root window coordinates. This variable has been
    specified as the -<i>textvariable</i> option of the label
    widget packed at the bottom of <i>modo</i>'s window. As you
    learned last time, changing a -<i>textvariable</i> updates the
    display immediately.</li>

    <li>it calculates the distance the cursor has moved, in
    millimeters.</li>

    <li>it adds a non-zero distance to the cursor Odometer widget
    <tt>$W_CODO</tt>. Note that <tt>add()</tt> is a method of class
    Odometer. Later we'll see how the Odometer class was created
    and why it behaves like a standard Perl/Tk widget.</li>

    <li>it periodically saves the distance data to a file so that
    useless odometer data is not lost. The tick count is based on
    how often you want the state information saved and the time
    interval between invocations of <tt>modo()</tt>.</li>

    <li>it reschedules itself via a call to <tt>after()</tt>. There
    are several ways to invoke <tt>after()</tt>, but in Tk-land the
    form shown above is the most common. The first parameter is the
    delay time in milliseconds after which the second parameter, a
    standard Tk callback, is executed. Since this event is
    asynchronous <tt>modo()</tt> returns and "pops the stack."
    After the delay the callback is invoked and <tt>modo()</tt> is
    called once again, does its thing, reschedules itself, and
    returns. (Note that no matter how many times <tt>modo()</tt> is
    called there is no memory leak - or at least there shouldn't
    be.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are many aspects to designing and writing a robust
  application, and one of them is to give the user adequate
  real-time feedback so they know things are "working". Since
  <i>modo</i> takes some time to startup, we'll open a new toplevel
  window that displays its current initialization state, along
  these lines:</p>
  <pre>
$QUIT_COMMAND = sub {save_modo; exit}; 
$MW = MainWindow-&gt;new($OPT{'display'}); 
$MW-&gt;withdraw; 
$MW-&gt;title($OPT{'title'}); 
$MW-&gt;iconname('modo'); 
$MW-&gt;iconbitmap("\@$LIBDIR/icon.xbm"); 
$MW-&gt;minsize(50, 50); 
$MW-&gt;protocol('WM_DELETE_WINDOW' =&gt; $QUIT_COMMAND); 
unless ($OPT{'iconic'}) { 
    # Realize a transient toplevel to display modo's  
    # initialization status. 
    $STATUS = $MW-&gt;Toplevel; 
    $STATUS-&gt;positionfrom('user'); 
    $STATUS-&gt;geometry('+100+100'); 
    $STATUS-&gt;title('Initializing modo'); 
    $STATUS_B = $STATUS-&gt;Label(-bitmap =&gt; 
                           "\@$LIBDIR/icon.xbm")-&gt;pack; 
    $STATUS_L = $STATUS-&gt;Label( -text =&gt; 'Main Window ...', 
                              -width =&gt; 25, )-&gt;pack; 
    $MW-&gt;idletasks; 
} 
update_status 'Global Stuff'; 
</pre>

  <p>Hmm, what is that dangling anonymous subroutine doing there at
  the top? Well, it simply defines what needs to be done when
  terminating <i>modo</i>. There are at least two ways to exit:
  either by selecting Quit or by having the window manager close
  the main window, so it makes sense to define a subroutine. Thus,
  <tt>$QUIT_COMMAND</tt> is initialized with a code reference which
  can then be used whenever necessary.</p>

  <p>As always, we first open the main window on some display - the
  <tt>new()</tt> method accepts an optional parameter specifying
  the particular display desired. (Be aware that <i>modo</i> uses a
  special hash, named <tt>%OPT</tt>, indexed by argument name, that
  holds argument values, either default or extracted from the
  command line.) Next there is a series of main window method calls
  known as <i>window manager commands</i>, because they are used to
  interact with the window manager.</p>

  <p>We <tt>withdraw()</tt> the main window to <i>unmap</i> it from
  the display so only the (soon to be created) status window is
  visible. The <tt>title()</tt> method draws text at the top of the
  decorative border provided by the window manager, and the two
  "icon" methods obviously specify a name and X bitmap for the
  application's icon. <tt>minsize()</tt> restricts the user from
  resizing the window smaller than 50 pixels in either dimension
  (there is also a related <tt>maxsize()</tt> method). Finally,
  note the idiom for registering a callback with the window manger
  to terminate an application: simply associate a standard Perl/Tk
  callback with the <tt>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</tt> protocol.</p>

  <p>Assuming the user didn't fire up <i>modo</i> iconified, we
  next create the toplevel status widget. The methods
  <tt>positionfrom()</tt> and <tt>geometry()</tt> are suggestions
  to the window manager on where to place the new toplevel. Some
  window managers, fvwm for instance, normally require you to
  explicitly place toplevel windows; <tt>positionfrom('user')</tt>
  overrides this behavior. Finally two label widgets are packed in
  the toplevel, the first containing <i>modo's</i> X bitmap and the
  second containing the current initialization state. Since the X
  server tries to buffer events to improve performance,
  <tt>idletasks()</tt> is used to flush idle callbacks and hence
  keep the display responsive. (We'll see more of event management
  in the next column.) Here's a snapshot of the status window:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/blue-init.gif" width="187" height="89" border=
    "0" alt="">
  </div>

  <p>Lastly note the first call to subroutine
  <tt>update_status()</tt>, which simply uses <i>configure</i> to
  change the text in the status window via <tt>$STATUS_L;</tt>
  there are numerous calls to this subroutine sprinkled throughout
  <i>modo</i>'s initialization code. Doing this keeps users
  happy.</p>

  <p>Another key aspect in user-friendly GUI design is providing a
  reasonably consistent "look and feel." Whether an application is
  written for X, Windows, or the Mac, you find, and indeed
  <i>expect</i>, a row of menubuttons (the menubar) at the top of
  the program's main window. And the leftmost button is a File
  menubutton which at least allows you to exit the application. So
  to be conformant, <i>modo</i> too has a <i>File</i> menubutton,
  which we'll examine now.</p>

  <p>A <i>menubutton</i> is a subclass of a button, meaning that it
  shares, or inherits, many of a button's characteristics. The big
  difference is that pushing a button executes a callback whereas
  pushing a menubutton posts a menu. A <i>menu</i> is simply a
  rectangular widget that contains one or more <i>menu items</i>
  that when pressed, might execute a callback, set a Perl variable,
  or invoke yet another menu (called cascading). Pressing the
  <i>File</i> menubutton posts this menu:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/lightblue-filemenu.gif" width="84" height=
    "108" border="0" alt="">
  </div>

  <p>The <i>File</i> menu itself is composed of simple button-like
  objects bound to callbacks. More precisely, we call these command
  menu items because they execute a command (callback) when
  pressed. Other types of menu items include <i>cascade,
  checkbutton, radiobutton</i> and <i>separator</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>File</i> menu has three thin lines: <i>separator</i>
  menu items, whose sole purpose is to visually separate logically
  distinct portions of the menu.</p>

  <p>The <i>File</i> menu also has a <i>tear-off</i>, which is the
  dashed line above Abort. Pressing a tear-off <i>reparents</i> the
  menu and puts it under control of the window manager. Thus, it
  gets its own decorative border, can be moved, iconifed, closed,
  and so on. By default all Perl/Tk menus have a tear-off.</p>

  <p>Here are some other facts you need to know about menus:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>As a convenience, Perl/Tk automatically generates a
    menubutton's associated menu widget when the first menu item is
    created. Two common cases where you need to manually create a
    menu are to disable the tear-off and to create menu
    cascades.</li>

    <li>Menu items can be manipulated in several ways: <i>added,
    configured, deleted</i>, or <i>invoked</i>. To manipulate a
    menu item you refer to it either by its ordinal in the menu
    (starting at zero) or by its text label. If there is a tear-off
    it is assigned index zero, making first menu item index one.
    Since a separator is a menu item, it too has a menu index. (I
    highly recommend referencing menu items by label name rather
    than index. You'll know why as soon as you insert a new menu
    item in the middle of a menu and then have to hunt through your
    code changing index values!)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In case that was all as clear as mud, maybe some code will
  clarify matters. Let's create the application's menubar using a
  frame,<tt>$mb</tt>, and pack our menubuttons in a row, from left
  to right:</p>
  <pre>
# File menu. 
my $mbf=$mb-&gt;Menubutton(-text =&gt; 'File',-underline =&gt; 0... ); 
$mbf-&gt;pack(qw(-side left)); 
$mbf-&gt;command(-label   =&gt; 'Abort', -underline =&gt; 0, 
              -command =&gt; \&amp;exit); 
$mbf-&gt;separator; 
my $close_command = [$MW =&gt; 'iconify']; 
$mbf-&gt;command(-label       =&gt; 'Close', -underline =&gt; 0, 
              -command     =&gt; $close_command, 
              -accelerator =&gt; 'Ctrl-w'); 
$MW-&gt;bind('&lt;Control-Key-w&gt;' =&gt; $close_command); 
</pre>

  <p>When Perl/Tk finishes building the <i>Abort</i> menu item we
  know that a menu widget has been generated with a tear-off (index
  0) and one command menu item (index 1, name "Abort"). (An often
  asked question is: "How do I make a menu without a tear-off?" The
  answer is you must explicitly create a menu with <tt>-tearoff
  =&gt; 0, configure()</tt> the menubutton with <tt>-menu =&gt;
  $your_menu</tt>, and then proceed normally.)</p>

  <p>The <i>Close</i> menu item (index 2, name "Close") has an
  associated keyboard accelerator. However, this just adds more
  text to the menu item label; you still have to create the key
  binding. Since the close code is needed in two places, just
  create a code reference and use that.</p>

  <p>Another common menu item is the <i>cascade</i>, illustrated
  below:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/lightblue-prefs.gif" width="171" height="79"
    border="0" alt="">
  </div>

  <p>Pressing the <i>Prefs</i> menubutton from the menubar displays
  the leftmost menu, containing a cascade and command menu item.
  Pressing the <i>Odometers</i> cascade displays the cascade's
  menu, containing three <i>radiobutton</i> menu items. (Of course,
  the cascade menu could contain another cascade, which could have
  another cascade, which ..., well, you get the picture.) Cascades
  are handled pretty much like menus without a tear-off, in that
  you create a menu widget manually and then <tt>configure()</tt>
  the cascade to point to it, like this:</p>
  <pre>
# Prefs menu. 
my $mbp = $mb-&gt;Menubutton(-text =&gt; 'Prefs', ... ); 
$mbp-&gt;pack(qw(-side left)); 
my $odometers = 'Odometers'; 
$mbp-&gt;cascade(-label =&gt; $odometers, -underline =&gt; 0); 
$mbp-&gt;separator; 
$mbp-&gt;command(-label =&gt; 'Color Editor', -underline =&gt; 0, 
              -state =&gt; $COLOR_STATE, ...); 
</pre>

  <p>So far, only <tt>-state</tt> might be unfamiliar. Many widgets
  have this option, which can have one of three possible values:
  <i>normal, active</i> or <i>disabled</i>. Widgets start in the
  normal state, and when the cursor passes over them they become
  active. If you place a widget in the disabled state, it is dimmed
  and becomes unresponsive to button presses and other bindings.
  We'll see how <tt>$COLOR_STATE</tt> is initialized shortly.</p>
  <pre>
my $mbpm = $mbp-&gt;cget(-menu); 
my $mbpmo = $mbpm-&gt;Menu; 
$mbp-&gt;entryconfigure($odometers, -menu =&gt; $mbpmo); 
$mbpmo-&gt;radiobutton(-label    =&gt; 'Cursor', 
                    -variable =&gt; \$OPT{'odometer'}, 
                    -value    =&gt; 'cursor'); 
$mbpmo-&gt;radiobutton(-label    =&gt; 'Pointer', 
                    -variable =&gt; \$OPT{'odometer'}, 
                    -value    =&gt; 'pointer'); 
$mbpmo-&gt;radiobutton(-label    =&gt; 'Both', 
                    -variable =&gt; \$OPT{'odometer'}, 
                    -value    =&gt; 'both'); 
</pre>

  <p>Pay attention please: the <i>Odometers</i> cascade menu must
  be a child of the menu containing the <i>Odometer</i> cascade
  itself (here, the <i>Prefs</i> menu), hence the <tt>cget()</tt>
  call to fetch the menu reference. Note that
  <tt>entryconfigure()</tt> is to menus as <tt>configure()</tt> is
  to other widgets, except you need to tell it which menu entry
  needs attention (which is analogous to <tt>itemconfigure()</tt>
  for canvas items). Notice also that the menu entry is referenced
  by name rather than index.</p>

  <p>Finally, three radiobutton menu items are added to the cascade
  menu. Just like ordinary radiobutton widgets, they allow you to
  select a single item from a list, and store its value in a
  variable. The actual value stored in the common variable depends
  on which radiobutton was pressed. (These widgets got their name
  because using them is similar to tuning an old fashioned car
  radio: selecting a station by pushing one button deselects all
  the other buttons by popping them out.)</p>

  <p>If you'd like to see a complicated cascade created from a Perl
  list-of-list-of-list data structure, take a gander at the
  <i>modo</i> source code responsible for generating the
  <i>Units</i> cascades; that'll fry your eyes.</p>

  <p>Speaking of eyes, they come in various colors. Speaking of
  colors, let's add some, and incorporate ColorEditor into the
  application. ColorEditor lets you select a color attribute, say
  <i>foreground</i>, edit a color swatch and then apply the final
  color by calling a special ColorEditor subroutine (the colorizer)
  which descends through the application's widgets and configures
  each in turn.</p>

  <p>A ColorEditor widget is created in the standard manner:</p>
  <pre>
$COLOR_STATE = $MW-&gt;depth &gt; 1 ? 'normal' : 'disabled'; 

if ($COLOR_STATE eq 'normal') {
    $CREF = $MW-&gt;ColorEditor(-title =&gt; '<i>modo</i>');
}
</pre>

  <p>But there's no need for one if your display can't support it,
  so first check the pixel depth of the display using the <i>window
  information</i> command <tt>depth()</tt>. For monochrome displays
  we don't even bother creating the ColorEditor, and the menu item
  to invoke it, which we just discussed, is dimmed.</p>

  <p>Once the ColorEditor is created and initialized, you can use
  it like a Dialog - just invoke its <tt>Show()</tt> method. The
  most important thing to remember about the ColorEditor is that it
  maintains a list of widgets to colorize: <i>every</i> widget in
  the application present when the ColorEditor was created.
  Sometimes this is good, sometimes bad, and in <i>modo</i>'s case
  it's bad. Bad because when <tt>$CREF</tt> is created some of the
  applicable widgets aren't there yet, and there are some that are
  present that shouldn't be colorized in the first place. Of
  course, there are methods to deal with this, so as the last step
  of initialization:</p>
  <pre>
$CREF-&gt;configure(-widgets =&gt; [$MW, $MW-&gt;Descendants]); 
$CREF-&gt;delete_widgets( 
   [$CREF,                # ColorEditor... 
    $CREF-&gt;Descendants,   # and all its descendant widgets
    $W_CODO-&gt;Descendants, # Odometer descendants because
    $W_PODO-&gt;Descendants, # the class handles configuration
   ]);                    # changes
</pre>

  <p>The first line ensures that the main window, <tt>$MW</tt>, and
  all of its descendants in the widget hierarchy are part of the
  color list. The second line then removes particular widgets that
  should not be colorized. As a rule of thumb, leave the
  ColorEditor alone in case you really mess things up, like setting
  the foreground and background to the same color! And the two
  composite odometers are excluded for the simple reason that the
  foreground and background colors of digits to the right of the
  "units" point are reversed, just like real odometers. How we deal
  with this is somewhat subtle, as you'll see in the next
  section.</p>

  <p>And at last it's time to discuss Perl/Tk composites featuring,
  of course, the odometer widget. The OO tables have turned and now
  you become an implementer rather than a mere user! An odometer
  widget "ISA" frame, that is, it's a subclass of a frame widget:
  odometer objects are simply "mega-widgets" composed of standard
  Tk widgets packed inside a frame (we'll see what "ISA" is all
  about shortly). There are other kinds of extended widgets: a
  dialog widget ISA a toplevel, while an axis widget is
  <i>derived</i> from, or "kind of", a canvas. A common attribute
  of all these extended widgets is that they behave just like
  standard Tk widgets, basically because Nick took great pains to
  ensure they do!</p>

  <p>Since an odometer is contained in a frame you can create an
  instance and pack it inside your application just like, say, a
  button. Let's create a default odometer, add one millimeter to
  it, and see what we have:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <pre>
$MW-&gt;Odometer-&gt;add(1, 1)-&gt;pack;
</pre>
  </div>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/lightblue-odometer.gif" width="67" height="61"
    border="0" alt="">
  </div>

  <p>(Notice how methods such as <tt>add()</tt> and <tt>pack()</tt>
  can be strung together, as long as they return an object
  reference for the next method to operate on.) The odometer is
  composed of six widgets: the odometer label, left and right
  labels indicating total distance, a trip reset button, and left
  and right labels indicating trip distance. Two labels are used
  for total and trip distances so that foreground and background
  colors can be reversed on either side of the "units" point. When
  <i>modo</i> creates its odometers it supplies some arguments in
  the Perl/Tk "key =&gt; value" style, including
  <i>-odometerlabel</i>, a keyword unique to class Odometer:</p>
  <pre>
$W_CODO = $w-&gt;Odometer( 
                   -odometerlabel =&gt; 'Cursor', 
                   -font          =&gt; $OPT{'fontname'}, 
                   -foreground    =&gt; $OPT{'foreground'},
                   -background    =&gt; $OPT{'background'}, 
                   -cursor        =&gt; $CURSOR
                  ); 
</pre>

  <p>In order to see the primary features of a frame-like composite
  I need to gut Odometer.pm, which later I'll reconstruct piece by
  piece:</p>
  <pre>
package Tk::Odometer; 
require 5.002; 
use English; 
use Tk::Frame; 
@Tk::Odometer::ISA = qw(Tk::Frame); 
Tk::Widget-&gt;Construct('Odometer'); 

sub Populate { 

    my($cw, $args) = @ARG; 

    $cw-&gt;SUPER::Populate($args);

</pre>

  <p>What we have here is the definition of a new Perl/Tk widget
  class named "Tk::Odometer", having these salient features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a unique package (or <i>class</i>) name.</li>

    <li>a "use Tk::Frame" that imports frame definitions and
    methods.</li>

    <li>declaration of the @ISA list, which is how Perl implements
    method inheritance. For instance, when you <tt>configure()</tt>
    an odometer Perl first looks for that method in class
    Tk::Odometer. But as you'll see there is no such method in this
    class, so Perl tries to locate that method by looking at the
    class(es) in the @ISA list. As it turns out, Tk::Frame has no
    <tt>configure()</tt> method either, but a frame has its own
    @ISA list, so the search continues up the class hierarchy. Rest
    assured that Perl/Tk does indeed provide a <tt>configure()</tt>
    method somewhere, but you don't have to know just where; OO at
    its best - neat.</li>

    <li>a call to <tt>Construct()</tt> that dynamically creates the
    class constructor. Among other things, this magic arranges a
    call to the class method <tt>Populate()</tt> when a new object
    is instantiated.</li>

    <li>the actual code for <tt>Populate()</tt>, written by the
    class implementor, that populates the incoming frame with the
    requisite component widgets, specifies the widget's
    configuration options, and returns a composite reference.</li>

    <li>zero or more class specific methods (not shown here) to
    manipulate objects of the new class. We already know of one for
    odometers: <tt>add()</tt>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><tt>Tk::Odometer::Populate()</tt> is called with two
  arguments. <tt>$cw</tt> is a reference to the partially completed
  composite widget and $args is a reference to the argument
  <i>hash</i> (i.e. the keyword/value pairs from the widget
  creation command). By convention <tt>$args</tt> is immediately
  passed to <tt>SUPER::Populate()</tt>, where, sometimes,
  behind-the-scenes bookkeeping like modifying configuration
  specifications is performed.</p>

  <p>Now, in standard Perl/Tk fashion, we create and arrange the
  component widgets of the composite, using <tt>$cw</tt> as their
  parent (the list @PACK holds common pack attributes):</p>
  <pre>
 
# Odometer label. 

my $l = $cw-&gt;Label-&gt;pack(@PACK); 

# Odometer total distance, left and right labels. 

$cw-&gt;make_odo('total')-&gt;pack(@PACK); 

# Odometer trip reset button. It's placed inside a container 
# frame so there is a background to color, since trying to
# configure the composite containing frame results in nasty
# recursion problems. The button is anchored southwest so it
# stays "attached to" the trip odometer. 

my $rbf = $cw-&gt;Frame(-relief =&gt; 'flat')-&gt;pack(@PACK); 
my $rb = $rbf-&gt;Button( 
               -height             =&gt; 2, 
               -width              =&gt; 5,
               -bitmap             =&gt; 'gray50', 
               -relief             =&gt; 'flat', 
               -command            =&gt; [$cw =&gt; 'reset_trip'], 
               -highlightthickness =&gt; 0 
             )-&gt;pack(-anchor =&gt; 'sw', -expand =&gt; 1); 

# Odometer trip distance, left and right labels. 
$cw-&gt;make_odo('trip')-&gt;pack(@PACK); 

# Maintain instance variables in the composite widget hash.
# Instance variables hold data particular to one instance of
# an Odometer object. 
# 
# reset = widget reference to trip reset button for bind() 
# total_mm = total distance in millimeters 
# total_left = total distance left label for add() 
# total_right = total distance right label for add() 
# total_right_label = widget reference for colorizing 
# (ditto for trip_mm, trip_left, trip_right, and 
#  trip_right label.)

$cw-&gt;{'reset'} = $rb; 
$cw-&gt;{'total_mm'} = 0; 
($cw-&gt;{'total_left'}, $cw-&gt;{'total_right'}) = ($Z, $Z); 
$cw-&gt;reset_trip; 
</pre>

  <p>Once again there are several items worthy of note:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the <i>-text</i> attribute of the odometer label $l is not
    specified. So, just when does this happen and who does it? The
    answer follows shortly.</li>

    <li>the <i>-command</i> attribute of the reset button $rb
    invokes the class method <tt>reset_trip()</tt>, emulating the
    reset button on a real odometer.</li>

    <li><tt>make_odo()</tt> packs the left and right labels side by
    side in a frame and creates the <i>-textvariable</i> references
    pointing to the above instance variables.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I hinted at this, but one job <tt>Populate()</tt> should not
  do, generally, is directly <tt>configure()</tt> its components;
  instead it makes a call to <tt>onfigSpecs()</tt> to specify
  configuration options and default values. Then, when
  <tt>Populate()</tt> returns, Perl/Tk auto-configures the
  composite, supplying <tt>ConfigSpec</tt> values or perhaps values
  from the X options database:</p>
  <pre>
# Now establish configuration specs
# so that the composite behaves like a
# standard Perl/Tk widget. Each 
# entry is a list of 4 items describing the
# option: how to process a configure
# request, its name in the resource
# database, its class name, and its default
# value. 
# 
# The Tk::Configure-&gt;new() specification renames 
# -odometerlabel to -text, which is what Labels want, 
# because -odometerlabel IS a Label. 
# 
# The DESCENDANTS specification applies configure() 
# recursively to all descendant widgets. 
# 
# The METHOD specification invokes a method by the same name
# as the option (without the dash), e.g.: 
# 
# $cw-&gt;background($bg); 
# 
# Normally you don't need configurators just for 
# background and foreground attributes, but an Odometer is
# special since the colors are reversed for the right half
# of the odometers. 
# 
# The -cursor specification says to configure only the
# indicated list of widgets (in this case there is but one,
# $rb, the trip reset button.) 

$cw-&gt;ConfigSpecs( 
    -odometerlabel =&gt; [[Tk::Configure-&gt;new($l =&gt; '-text')],
                      'odometerlabel','odometerLabel','Odometer'], 
    -font          =&gt; ['DESCENDANTS','font','Font','fixed'],
    -background    =&gt; ['METHOD','background','Background','#d9d9d9'],
    -foreground    =&gt; ['METHOD','foreground','Foreground','black'],
    -cursor        =&gt; [[$rb],'cursor','Cursor',['left_ptr']]
                   ); 
return $cw; 
</pre>

  <p>There's still more work left, however. So far, we've created a
  class constructor, but no methods to manipulate the objects it
  creates. So let's look at a few, starting with the simplest,
  <tt>$W_CODO-&gt;get_total_distance()</tt>. <i>modo</i> uses this
  method to save its state information):</p>
  <pre>
 sub get_total_distance {shift-&gt;{'total_mm'}}
</pre>

  <p>This method just returns the value from an odometer's total_mm
  instance variable. The <i>shift</i> idiom is a shortcut for
  Perl's builtin <tt>shift()</tt> function, returning the odometer
  reference. Here <tt>bind()</tt> is overridden by providing a
  version specific to our class:</p>
  <pre>
sub bind { 
    # Override bind() to select trip reset button, 
    # the only sensible widget. 
    # Build an argument list to bind() so that the call
    # behaves normally. 

    my($odo, $event, $code) = @ARG; 
    my @args = (); 
    push @args, $event if defined $event; 
    push @args, $code  if defined $code; 
    $odo-&gt;{'reset'}-&gt;bind(@args); 
    return $odo; 
}  

</pre>

  <p>Finally here is <tt>add()</tt>, which displays the millimeter
  count (modulus 100,000) in the user's units. The only thing new
  is the use of <tt>BackTrace()</tt>, the Perl/Tk way of including
  traceback information:</p>
  <pre>
sub add {  
    my($odo, $d, $u) = @ARG; 
    $odo-&gt;BackTrace('Usage: $odo-&gt;add($distance, $units)') if @ARG != 3; 
    $odo-&gt;{'total_mm'} += $d; 
    $odo-&gt;{'trip_mm' } += $d; 
    my($n1, $f1, $n2, $f2, $s); 
    $n1 = $odo-&gt;{'total_mm'} * $u; 
    $f1 = $n1 - int($n1); 
    $n2 = $odo-&gt;{'trip_mm' } * $u; 
    $f2 = $n2 - int($n2); 
    $s = sprintf("%011.5f%011.5f", ($n1 % 100000) + $f1,
                                   ($n2 % 100000) + $f2);
    $odo-&gt;{'total_left'}  = substr($s, 0, 5); 
    $odo-&gt;{'total_right'} = substr($s, 6, 5); 
    $odo-&gt;{'trip_left'}   = substr($s, 11, 5); 
    $odo-&gt;{'trip_right'}  = substr($s, 17, 5); 
    return $odo; 
} 
</pre>

  <p>The Odometer class has several private methods too. Unlike
  C++, in Perl a private method is only private because the class
  implementor doesn't document it. Be polite and only use
  documented public methods. Here, I need to show you three private
  methods to complete the ColorEditor discussion.</p>

  <p>Now, <tt>Populate()</tt> used <tt>ConfigSpecs()</tt> for
  foreground and background <tt>configure()</tt> options.
  <tt>ConfigSpecs()</tt> is a method, so when either of these
  odometer attributes are configured, one of the following
  subroutines is called with two parameters: an odometer widget
  reference and a color value.</p>
  <pre>
# Odometer background/foreground color subroutines. 
sub background {
    shift-&gt;bf(shift, '-foreground', '-background')
} 
sub foreground {
    shift-&gt;bf(shift, '-background', '-foreground')
} 
</pre>

  <p>These immediately call the following subroutine,
  <tt>bf()</tt>. Remembering that an odometer's component widgets
  have been removed from ColorEditor's color list, it's up to the
  class to colorize them. So <tt>bf()</tt> simply walks the
  composite widget hierarchy, configuring each component in turn,
  but flopping foreground for background (or vice-versa) upon
  encountering any right-side label:</p>
  <pre>
sub bf {        # Reverse background/foreground colors on
                # right odometer labels. 
   my($odo, $color, $bf1, $bf2) = @ARG; 
   my $total_right = $odo-&gt;{'total_right_label'}; 
   my $trip_right = $odo-&gt;{'trip_right_label'}; 
   $odo-&gt;Walk( 
       sub { my($widget) = @ARG; 
            if ($widget == $total_right or 
                $widget == $trip_right) { 
                $widget-&gt;configure($bf1 =&gt; $color); 
            } else { 
                $widget-&gt;configure($bf2 =&gt; $color); 
            } 
          } 
       ); 
} 
</pre>

  <p>So, we're finished implementing, right? Wrong. Gee, all the
  code's there, it's tested and it works... what could be missing?
  How about <i>user</i> documentation! The Perl Way is to include a
  "pod" (plain old documentation) in your class module. Check out
  Odometer.pm for a barebones pod.</p>
