  <h2 align="center">The 0th Annual Obfuscated Perl Contest</h2>

  <h4><i>Felix S. Gallo</i></h4>

  <p>Are you renowned for your excessive, belligerent tersity? Are
  you a misunderstood genius who writes Perl code that looks like
  it's been run through MD5? Or are you just plain evil and ornery
  enough to write code that's so grotesque that other people pale
  in fear?</p>

  <p>At last, you have a socially acceptable creative outlet: the
  0th Annual Obfuscated Perl Contest!</p>

  <p>You are invited to participate in a contest to determine who
  can write the most incomprehensible, unreadable, confusing,
  horrific, amusing and interesting Perl code.</p>

  <p>There are four categories. You can enter as many as you like,
  but may only submit 2 (two) pieces of code per category.</p>

  <h3>The categories:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>BEST FOUR-LINE SIGNATURE

      <p>This award is for the best piece of Perl code that fits
      into 4 (four) lines of 76 (seventy-six) characters of ASCII
      code (not counting end-of-line newlines).</p>
    </li>

    <li>MOST POWERFUL

      <p>This award goes to the piece of Perl code which does the
      most with the least. The limit on bytecount is 1024
      characters, not including whitespace.</p>
    </li>

    <li>MOST CREATIVE

      <p>This award goes to the most stunningly intriguing and/or
      ridiculously hilarious combination of obfuscation and
      functionality. The limit is 2048 bytes of Perl code, not
      including whitespace.</p>
    </li>

    <li>BEST 'THE PERL JOURNAL'

      <p>In the fine 'Just another Perl hacker' tradition, this
      award is given to the best code which generates the words
      'the perl journal'. Case and context are not important. The
      limit is 2048 bytes of Perl code, not including whitespace.
      Winning entries will be featured on future front covers!</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>In addition to these four categories, the judges will award
  one applicant the coveted 'BEST OF SHOW' award, a certificate
  suitable for framing or, imaginably, hiding.</p>

  <h3>RULES:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>All programs must successfully run under perl5.002.</li>

    <li>Programs may only use the functionality included in the
    basic perl5.002 tarfile found on CPAN. No modules, patches or
    extensions beyond those in the standard distribution are
    available.</li>

    <li>Programs will be run on the judges' choice of platforms.
    The only guarantees about these platforms are that their perl
    interpreters pass all tests, they have at least 4 megabytes of
    memory, and they have at least 1 meg of available disk
    space.</li>

    <li>Submitted programs remain the credited property of the
    author, but may be duplicated and disseminated freely by
    TPJ.</li>

    <li>All programs should be uploaded via FTP to
    work.media.mit.edu in the directory <i>incoming/tpj</i> by July
    15, 1996. The tar archive must contain the following items:

      <p>a. The program.</p>

      <p>b. A README file which provides attribution (including the
      applicant's e-mail address) and tells which category the
      program is for. (Note: it's recommended that you provide no
      information about how the program works in the README
      file).</p>

      <p>c. A SOLUTION file which explains how the program works
      (Note: in the event a program wins, the SOLUTION file may be
      edited and published). The tar archive should be named</p>
      <pre>
&lt;YOUR_NAME&gt;.&lt;CATEGORY_NUMBER&gt;.&lt;SUBMISSION_NUMBER&gt;.tar
</pre>For example, my second submission to the best signature
category would be Felix_Gallo.1.2.tar.

      <p>Entries not submitted in this fashion might result in
      confusion, hassle, and entries getting lost, so please try to
      abide.</p>

      <p>Entries will not be accepted via e-mail.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The winners and their winning submissions will be announced
    in issue #3 of The Perl Journal, in comp.lang.perl.announce,
    and on various web sites.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>

  <p>The judging will work in three phases.</p>

  <p>In the first phase, the judges will examine the code carefully
  without running it in order to qualify its aesthetics. Any code
  that's completely understandable at this point will probably not
  win.</p>

  <p>In the second phase, the judges will run the code, examine the
  output, and then look at the code again in light of its
  output.</p>

  <p>In the third phase, the judges will dissect the code with
  filters, debuggers, and whatever else they can think of,
  attempting to determine how it works. Any code that's still
  incomprehensible at this point will probably win.</p>

  <p>If the judges are stumped by the end of the third phase,
  they'll turn to the SOLUTIONS file you've helpfully included in
  your distribution and attempt to use that to reverse engineer the
  code.</p>

  <h3>HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS</h3>

  <p>Judging obfuscation and what's 'cool', 'neat' or 'best' is a
  subjective process. However, here are some general guidelines
  which might help you design your entry.</p>

  <p>Overuse of one particular obfuscation method risks being
  tedious. Entries which demonstrate breadth, range and knowledge
  are likely to beat entries which rely on repeated parlor
  tricks.</p>

  <p>Being clever and humorous is good. As an example, a past
  winner in the Obfuscated C contest (our pale, weaker cousin)
  formatted his code in the shape of a maze; the program read its
  own source code in and implemented an ASCII 3-D maze walking
  program.</p>

  <p>Being surprising and deceitful is very good. Bonus points are
  awarded for obfuscated code which is not only syntactically
  obfuscated, but semantically obfuscated - code which appears to
  do one thing but does another is deemed extremely devilish.</p>

  <p>Being poetic is also very good.</p>

  <p>Entries needn't contain a #!/usr/bin/perl (or equivalent),
  unless they use nonobvious command-line switches. Neither the
  #!/usr/bin/perl nor the command-line switches will count toward
  the character limits.</p>

  <p>Programs which purposefully crash machines or cause system
  problems tend to be unamusing, so please consider saving them for
  the Perl System Destroyers' contest.</p>

  <p>Here's a tiny example which would not win in any of the
  categories, but which demonstrates a couple of now well-known
  obfuscation techniques. It's in the public domain, for what
  that's worth.</p>
  <hr>
  <pre>

@^T = qw, 3( 2 9 6) ;

21_PENGUINS, and print map {(1c((split//=&gt;\"\"=&gt;")[$^T&gt;1])..__)[$_]}@^T

</pre>
  <hr>

  <p>Example analysis and judging thought process:</p>

  <p><tt>@^T</tt> is a small red herring; although it looks like
  some sort of Perl special variable, it's not (that would be
  <tt>$^T</tt>.) Not particularly clever, but at least standardly
  so. qw uses comma as a quoting character, so the fake
  parentheses, semicolon, newline and trailing <tt>_PENGUINS</tt>
  are an attempt to hide a numeric array composed of (<tt>3, 2, 9,
  6, 21</tt>). The judges would instantly run pattern analysis
  software on this sequence in phase 3, so this is not well hidden
  enough. Fairly clever, though. The idea of apparently starting a
  line with</p>
  <pre>
21_PENGUINS, and print map
</pre>

  <p>is poetic, so that's worth something.</p>

  <p><tt>split//=&gt;</tt> is famous by now, having been used on
  <i>comp.lang.perl.misc</i>, so this is mildly derivative and
  obvious.</p>

  <p>The use of a scalar reference as a string in
  <tt>\"\"=&gt;</tt>" is fairly well hidden behind a wall of
  semantic misdirection. We'll call this clever, especially once we
  find out that we're using the letter 'c' from that reference to
  prime an alphabet generator.</p>

  <p>The use of <tt>$^T</tt> is humorous and misdirectional
  considering the use of <tt>@^T</tt>.</p>

  <p>The semantics of ..__ are interesting, neat, and somewhat
  unexpected. Bonus points for the fact that __ appears special and
  then unspecial but turns out to be special.</p>

  <p>Disappointingly, the output is minimal, uninspiring and
  extremely obvious. The program doesn't do anything remarkable or
  surprising.</p>

  <h3>SO THERE YOU HAVE IT</h3>

  <p>Please submit early and often, and encourage anyone you know
  who might be interested to do the same.</p>

  <p>Although Perl has taken some hard knocks as being a write-only
  language (and this contest could be construed as an unabashed
  celebration of that fact), the intent of this contest is to
  demonstrate Perl's tersity and power, while at the same time
  giving the creative and demented minds of the Internet's legions
  a fun, intriguing playground. So have fun!</p>

  <p>Although we won't accept any entries via e-mail (FTP only, as
  above), questions regarding this contest or its rules should be
  directed to</p>
  <pre>
  perl-journal-contest@perl.com
</pre>

  <p>We look forward with some trepidation to seeing your code!</p>
