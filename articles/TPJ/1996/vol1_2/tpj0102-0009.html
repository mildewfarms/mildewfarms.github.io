  <h4><i>Jon Orwant</i></h4>

  <p>In the last issue of TPJ, readers were asked to submit
  strategies for a three-way Prisoner's Dilemma. The notion is
  simple: you and two friends have been arrested for some crime,
  locked up in separate rooms, and asked to testify against one
  another. If all three of you testify, everyone goes to jail for a
  long time. If all of you keep mum, everyone goes to jail for a
  couple of years. If one or two out of the three testify, they
  benefit at the others' expense.</p>

  <p>Each strategy, encoded as a single Perl subroutine, was pitted
  against every other pair of strategies in a "duel" of 100
  matches. The distinction between a duel and a match is important,
  since in a series of matches each strategy can observe the others
  and decide how to act based on their past behavior.</p>

  <p>A total of 31 strategies were submitted, yielding</p>
  <pre>
(31)     31!
     =  ---- = 4495
( 3)    3!28!
</pre>

  <p>duels, or about 450,000 matches, in which each strategy
  returned a single letter: either an <tt>'H'</tt> to Hold out (or
  cooperate, in game theory parlance) or a <tt>'T'</tt> to Testify
  (or defect).</p>

  <p>This particular contest was inspired by Profs. Mitch Resnick
  and Mike Eisenberg, who in 1987 conducted a three-way Prisoner's
  Dilemma contest at MIT. Your august editor entered that contest
  (in which the strategies were Scheme functions instead of Perl
  subroutines), noticed that the contest rules (there were four)
  didn't prohibit mutators, and wrote a function that changed its
  opponents' histories, yielding the highest possible score. I was
  disqualified, and a fifth rule excluding such strategies was
  added the next year.</p>

  <p>I've been seething over this for the past nine years, and
  wanted some moral validation for what I thought was a clever
  insight. That's why I left the door wide open for similar
  strategies in this contest: there was nothing prohibiting
  subroutines from poking around the filesystem or the symbol table
  to locate, dissect, or modify other strategies, or even the
  judging program itself.</p>

  <p>A few hackers, notably Felix Gallo and Randal Schwartz,
  spotted these possibilities, but alas, no one actually tried
  anything, whether from lack of time or surplus of scruples I
  don't know. Felix also pointed out another devious tactic:
  collude with other contestants so that their strategies could
  recognize one another by their behavior. Then a
  previously-elected "master" could defect while the other "slaves"
  all cooperated, sacrificing themselves for the good of the
  master.</p>

  <p>That's exactly what <b>Ken Albanowski</b>, <b>Earle Ake</b>,
  and <b>Dan Wisehart</b> did: their "gestalt" entries identify
  whenever Ken's strategy is playing one of the other two. If so,
  the slave holds out while the master testifies, resulting in a
  bad score for Earle or Dan but a good score for Ken. It worked:
  Ken's strategy finished first, and martyrs Earle and Dan finished
  27th and 28th.</p>

  <p>The top ten, along with the number of years their strategy
  spent in jail:</p>
  <pre>
Kenneth Albanowski
    (with sacrifices by Earle Ake
     and Dan Wisehart)                  135164      
Peter Frodin                            147341
Eric Le Saux                            147624
Francisco Azevedo                       147678
Dave Pavlick and Beirne Konarski        148527
Bill England                            149053
Peter Seibel                            149317
Steve Frost                             149328
Ravi Kolagotla                          149396
Giovanni Marzot                         149412
</pre>

  <p><b>Peter Frodin's</b> second-place strategy is a less tolerant
  version of the <tt>fool_me_twice()</tt> strategy explained in
  last issue: his <tt>fool_me_once()</tt> testifies if either of
  the opponents testified during the previous match. (An honorable
  mention goes to <b>Brian Gough</b>, whose subroutine is identical
  to Peter's, but didn't score in the top ten because of other
  strategies that behaved nondeterministically.) <b>Eric Le
  Saux'</b> <tt>elephant()</tt> placed third by noticing whether
  opposing strategies retaliate against testifying. <b>Francisco
  Azevedo's</b> strategy was nice but unforgiving: it holds out
  until someone testifies, and then testifies forever after.
  <b>Dave Pavlich</b> and <b>Beirne Konarski</b> collaborated on
  the most complex strategy submitted: their subroutine contains
  five additional subroutines, implementing a temporary "probation"
  state for opponents. It testifies if both opponents are on
  probation and either one violated his probation by testifying
  last round.</p>

  <p>Then the backstabbing began: the bottom half of the top ten,
  and ten out of the 31 strategies overall, simply testified each
  and every time. (Again, differences in score were due to random
  behavior exhibited by other strategies.) <b>Peter Seibel</b> used
  genetic programming to breed winning strategies, and found
  nothing that performed better than a pure testifier. Georg
  Rehfeld's <tt>be_a_good_boy_all_the_time()</tt> was the exact
  opposite: it cooperated regardless of the other strategies'
  actions. In his description, Georg said,</p>

  <p><i>I think this is the only strategy to save the world: don't
  do any harm to anybody, be helpful and cooperative all the time.
  This holds true in real life, I believe...</i></p>

  <p>His strategy finished dead last.</p>
