  It is often stated that Perl is easily portable to "any
  platform". On closer examination, however, it turns out that this
  was only intended to mean "portability between UNIX platforms."
  Nevertheless, Perl in some form or other runs on almost every
  personal computing platform (IBM PC compatible, Amiga, Atari,
  Macintosh) and on a considerable number of mainframe platforms
  (VMS, MVS).

  <p>Macintosh users are known for a fierce antipathy toward
  command lines, so it seems a little surprising that they would
  use Perl, the archetypal command line tool. Yet MacPerl has
  attracted thousands of users in the four years of its existence.
  Macintosh users, especially programmers, are faced with similar
  data processing tasks as users of other platforms, so they end up
  picking the same tool to solve them, especially if they already
  know it from other platforms. A further attraction of MacPerl is
  that many interesting Perl applications, from James Tisdall's DNA
  Workbench to Thomas Boutell's PerlMUD, run on MacPerl with only a
  few changes. With the rise of the World Wide Web, MacPerl has
  also gained numerous users who use their Macs to run CGI scripts
  - sometimes in a production WWW environment, but often as a
  convenient prototyping platform.</p>

  <p>In this article, I'm presenting the MacOS port (Perl also runs
  under the A/UX and MachTen Macintosh UNIX environments. However,
  these are conventional UNIX ports and will not be further
  discussed here.) of Perl 4 and 5 with a focus on implementation
  challenges that are unlikely to arise on UNIX platforms:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Augmenting the standard libraries supplied by Macintosh
    compiler vendors with POSIX and other common UNIX functions
    used in the baseline Perl source.</li>

    <li>Making a command line based programming language attractive
    for using in a windowing environment.</li>
  </ul>Finally, I'll discuss the plans to exploit the power of Perl
  5 by porting the standard Perl 5 libraries and creating new
  libraries to interface with the MacOS toolbox.

  <p>First, though, a look back in history...</p>

  <h4>Perl on the Mac: A timeline</h4>

  <p>In Summer 1991, I was called by the Swiss army to do my
  compulsory 17 weeks of military basic training. While my duties
  were not unduly harsh, I soon experienced withdrawal symptoms
  from my programming habits and therefore started looking for a
  programming project to do on weekends. Since I had ported gawk to
  the Macintosh the preceding winter, and recently had become
  interested in Perl, I decided to attempt a port of Perl.</p>

  <p>The port proceeded quickly, and in August 1991, I was able to
  report the first partial successes. Tim Endres saw one of my
  Usenet postings and started getting involved in cleaning up my
  initial attempts. When my military service ended in November
  1991, I had a little more spare time for the port and in January
  1992, we announced the first release of MacPerl, 4.0.2, to the
  public. The favorable reception of our efforts encouraged me to
  do further work on library functions, and in December 1992, I
  released version 4.0.5 which featured socket and DBM support. By
  that time, it had become clear that I wouldn't get rid of
  MacPerl-related e-mail anytime soon, so in January 1993, I
  created a mailing list to support it.</p>

  <p>I kept fixing bugs in MacPerl and adding major new features in
  roughly annual increments since then. In October 1993, I released
  version 4.1.0, the first version with a true Macintosh human
  interface. In December 1994, version 4.1.4 started supporting
  Apple's PowerPC architecture, and in August 1995, version 5.0.0
  finally added Perl 5 support on the Mac.</p>

  <h4><a href="tpj0102-0005a.html">Running MacPerl</a></h4>

  <h4>Augmenting the standard libraries</h4>

  <p>One reason for the popularity Perl enjoys on UNIX platforms is
  the fact that it provides convenient access to all system calls
  available in the OS. Programmers rely extensively on these calls
  and expect a substantial subset of the POSIX.1 calls to be
  present, even on non-UNIX platforms.</p>

  <p>The Macintosh Programmer's Workshop (MPW) C compiler, however,
  which was used to compile all versions of MacPerl 4, offers
  essentially only the C library calls mandated by the ISO C
  standard. Low level I/O calls (<tt>open()</tt>, <tt>close()</tt>,
  <tt>read()</tt>, <tt>write()</tt>, <tt>lseek()</tt>,
  <tt>fcntl()</tt>, <tt>ioctl()</tt>) are supported to a certain
  extent, but not always with POSIX.1 semantics. In particular,
  <tt>lseek()</tt> did not permit seeking past the end of file,
  which led to problems porting some DBM packages. Many other
  calls, even such common ones as <tt>chdir()</tt>,
  <tt>stat()</tt>, or <tt>opendir()</tt>, were not supported.</p>

  <p>Thus, the porters had to write their own library functions. In
  the first releases of MacPerl, a few of the most severely missed
  functions (the <tt>opendir()</tt> and <tt>stat()</tt> families of
  calls) were added. Soon, however, I decided on a more ambitious
  project: During 1992, I developed GUSI, the Grand Unified Socket
  Interface (in the author's rural dialect of Swiss German, "gusi"
  is the word for "piglet"), a library offering the familiar BSD
  sockets interface on top of a number of Macintosh communications
  protocols, all of which had rather different application
  programmer interfaces:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>MacTCP, the Apple TCP/IP implementation.</li>

    <li>ADSP, the AppleTalk Datastream Protocol.</li>

    <li>PAP, the (Postscript) Printer Access Protocol.</li>

    <li>The System 7 Process-to-Process Communications
    Toolbox.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition to this communication functionality, I also added
  many POSIX.1 functions. In particular, I mapped the Macintosh
  concept of "Finder Alias" files to the POSIX.1 concept of
  symbolic links. This also necessitated modifying all library
  functions taking file paths to transparently resolve embedded
  alias files (e.g., paths of the form a:b:c, where a:b is an alias
  pointing to a folder), a feature not offered by most
  vendor-supplied libraries in 1992.</p>

  <p>However, some areas of UNIX functionality were still not
  covered. The <tt>fork()</tt> and <tt>exec()</tt> functions in all
  forms remain unimplemented for reasons that not all MacPerl users
  found as obvious as I did. The memory and process management of
  the MacOS, while not particularly hostile to multitasking, is
  rather unsuited to <tt>fork()/exec()</tt> style multitasking.(
  These problems don't seem to be unique to the Macintosh. Almost
  all non-UNIX platforms seem to place considerable restrictions on
  the use of <tt>fork()/exec()</tt>.) However, Marc Parmet's
  Macintosh port of Emacs 18 (ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/parmet/)
  and Jonathan Kimmit's PATMOS environment demonstrate that the
  problem is surmountable.</p>

  <p>Typical Perl code also makes common use of idioms whose
  implementation falls into the domain of POSIX.2, such as the
  following:</p>
  <pre>
1. open(LASER, "| lpr") 
2. chop($cwd = 'pwd') 
3. while (&lt;*.c&gt;) { ... 
4. system("echo 1")
</pre>

  <p>Each of these idioms presents different implementation
  challenges. Idiom #1 was implemented in Winter 1991/1992 by
  delegating the call to ToolServer, a scriptable version of
  Apple's Macintosh Programmer's Workshop (MPW) command line
  environment. ToolServer wants its input from disk files, not from
  pipes, but buffering the pipe (input for "<tt>| xyz</tt>", output
  for "<tt>xyz |</tt>") in a file proved to be quite
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p>This approach worked well for backquotes in principle, but not
  for idiom #2 in practice, as Toolserver is not available to most
  MacPerl users and <tt>pwd</tt> is not by default available in
  Toolserver. The solution I ultimately adopted is to have the
  <tt>my_popen()</tt> routine check for a number of UNIX commands
  often (ab)used in this fashion in UNIX perl code:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>'pwd'</tt> was handled by calling
    <tt>getcwd()</tt>.</li>

    <li><tt>'hostname'</tt> was handled by calling
    <tt>gethostname()</tt>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Idiom #3, which is expanded internally by Perl to a pipe from
  <tt>"echo *.c"</tt>, presents a similar problem: Toolserver is
  not widely available and it uses a different globbing syntax. I
  left this problem unsolved in MacPerl 4, but MacPerl 5 uses
  built-in globbing code to handle this case.</p>

  <p>Idiom #4 seems similar to idiom #1, but a faithful
  implementation would have to redirect both the standard input and
  the standard output of the called code, which is not possible
  with the technique used for idiom #1. After a few years of
  deliberation, I decided to implement a pragmatic solution by
  ignoring standard input. Standard input to <tt>system()</tt>
  seems to be used rarely in practice; I don't think that standard
  input is used in any <tt>system()</tt> call in the Perl test
  suite.</p>

  <h4>The Integrated Environment</h4>

  <p>The original Macintosh port of Perl was written for MPW, a
  command line oriented programming environment. MPW provides a
  natural habitat for tools like Perl, and I had assumed that my
  target audience would have MPW anyway. User feedback, however,
  quickly proved that the primitive standalone application I had
  included in the first release as a last minute thought was more
  popular than the MPW based version. In summer 1993, I was finally
  ready to address the requests for an implementation of Perl in a
  real Macintosh application with better online help. By fall 1993,
  the MacPerl user interface had a look that it kept (with minor
  adjustments) until today.</p>

  <p>The figure below shows the look of MacPerl during a script
  debugging. The "MacPerl" window is used for the standard
  input/output streams, while there is a separate "Perl Debug"
  window for debugger interaction. Scripts can open any number of
  additional windows, but this feature doesn't seem to be used much
  in practice.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <a href="images/anotherwin.gif"><img src=
    "images/anotherwin_sm.gif" width="200" height="133" border="0"
    alt=""></a>
  </div>

  <p>The integrated environment tries to compensate for the Mac's
  lack of a command line by offering a multitude of methods to run
  MacPerl scripts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Scripts without input files are started by selecting a menu
    command "Run Script..." and selecting the script to be executed
    from a standard file selection dialog.</li>

    <li>If a script is open in a MacPerl window, it can be executed
    by selecting the "Run Front Window" menu command.</li>

    <li>Scripts that take input files can be saved as "Droplets":
    Small applications that are started from the Finder by
    selecting the input files and dropping them on the script's
    icon.</li>

    <li>For specialized tasks (e.g., CGI scripts), MacPerl offers
    various "glue packages" that let Perl scripts interact with
    other Macintosh applications. The MacPerl application also
    allowed me to experiment with various online help mechanisms.
    Online help in MacPerl4 is based on a modified ASCII version of
    the standard Perl manual page. Selecting a built-in function
    and hitting the "Help" key dumps the appropriate manual section
    into a text window. This system works, but the amount of
    post-processing required makes keeping up with changes in the
    standard distribution of the manual too much work.</li>
  </ul>

  <div align="center">
    <a href="images/interprocess.gif"><img src=
    "images/interprocess_sm.gif" width="200" height="163" border=
    "0" alt=""></a>
  </div>

  <p>That's why I adopted a different approach for the MacPerl5
  help system: Help requests are translated into relative URLs in
  the HTML version of the Perl 5 manual, which are then, by means
  of the Internet Config system,(Internet Config, written by Peter
  Lewis and Quinn, is a freeware application offering a central
  database of an user's Internet settings (his e-mail address, his
  home page, his favorite WWW viewer).) sent to the users preferred
  WWW browser. In addition to the help index, which contains all
  built-in functions and variables, the MacPerl help menu (shown on
  this page) also offers direct access to all chapters of the Perl
  5 manual and to the MacPerl WWW home page. To avoid network
  traffic, the generated URLs are in general <tt>file</tt>:/ URLs
  pointing to a local disk copy of the manual.</p>

  <h4>Future Plans</h4>

  <p>Although MacPerl is currently still based on perl5.001m, the
  core code seems to have stabilized somewhat. The major challenges
  now seem to be in the embedding of Perl and in work on the Perl
  library.</p>

  <p>The integrated environment described in the previous section
  has well known weaknesses; in particular, the built in editor is
  limited to 32K characters and is rather inadequate for serious
  development work. I feel, though, that attempts to compete
  against powerful text editors like Alpha and BBEdit would be
  pointless. Instead, I'd like to improve the integration of
  MacPerl into these editors and into any other context desired by
  Mac users. In the short term, MacPerl has worked toward that goal
  through glue code for BBEdit and Alpha (aided by a MacPerl
  support package for Alpha written in Tcl by Tom Pollard). Glue
  code is also available for the various Macintosh HTTP servers
  (MacHTTP, WebSTAR, and Netpresenz) to provide a CGI compatible
  environment for Perl scripts.</p>

  <p>With System 7, Apple introduced the Open Scripting
  Architecture (OSA), a common API for automating tasks in
  Macintosh applications. MacPerl currently takes advantage of the
  OSA by supporting the embedding of AppleScript fragments in Perl
  scripts. In the long term, however, I would like MacPerl itself
  to become an OSA language and provide a third alternative to
  AppleScript and UserLand Software's Frontier language. Another
  important emerging Macintosh technology is the OpenDoc component
  architecture, where MacPerl has considerable potential both as a
  scripting language and as a language for the creation of new
  OpenDoc components. (OpenDoc is based on IBM's System Object
  Model (SOM) technology. Unfortunately, although SOM is designed
  to be language independent, there is currently no Macintosh
  support for languages other than C and C++.)</p>

  <p>The success of Perl 5 and of the module coordination efforts
  like CPAN and Tim Bunce's Module List has become evident in the
  vast number of new useful library modules being created. This is
  a somewhat mixed blessing to me as a porter, as I never even got
  around to port all of the comparatively tiny bundled Perl 4
  library. Luckily, though, it looks as if others will start
  cleaning up the "99% MacPerl compatible" libraries and get them
  to run.</p>

  <p>The extension mechanisms of Perl 5 also represent a
  potentially huge opportunity to provide full access to the MacOS
  API. Currently, there are probably more than 2,500 API calls;
  writing good Perl interfaces to all of them will require a
  nontrivial amount of work, but I'm optimistic that here, too,
  some other MacPerl users will join in the effort. At the moment,
  there are preliminary interfaces to the Memory manager, the
  Resource manager, and the AppleEvent manager. The DynaLoader
  module is already implemented on PowerPC Macs and will be
  implemented on older Macs soon, which makes developing and
  testing MacPerl extensions a lot easier.</p>

  <p>As on many other platforms, Perl has found good use and
  enthusiastic users on the Apple Macintosh, and I'm optimistic
  that it will continue to expand its usefulness and user base. As
  on other platforms, the success of MacPerl and the life of its
  primary porter call for the work to be distributed on more
  shoulders, but I'm optimistic that this, too, will happen.</p>
