  <h2 align="center">Saving State with CGI.pm</h2>

  <h4><i>Lincoln Stein</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  We live in a stateful world. Just to be certain of that fact, I
  collected a few examples this morning:

  <ol>
    <li>Today I'm in a certain frantic state of mind because this
    column is due: I'll be this way for at least the rest of the
    afternoon, or until the column is done, whichever comes first.
    This is an example of a short-term state.</li>

    <li>The federal budget is in a dreadful state of affairs and
    there's no hope of it being cleared up until the last state has
    voted in the general election. This is an example of a
    long-term state.</li>

    <li>The weather is truly lovely today with balmy spring weather
    and bright sunshine. Because this New England, however, it'll
    stay nice only until sometime tonight, when the weather report
    predicts a snowstorm followed by an iron frost. This is typical
    of an unstable state.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If the world has state, why doesn't the World Wide Web? It
  would seem reasonable for the Web to have some memory. After all,
  people do tend to hang around a site for awhile, exploring here
  and there. It would seem only polite for a Web site to remember
  the user who's been rattling around inside it for the past hour.
  But the HTTP protocol is stateless. Each request for a document
  is a new transaction; after the document is delivered the Web
  server wipes its hands of the whole affair and starts fresh.</p>

  <p>The HTTP protocol was designed that way because a stateless
  model is appropriate for the bulk of a Web server's job: to
  listen for requests for HTML documents and deliver them without
  fuss, frills or idle chitchat. The fact that the implementors of
  the protocol saw fit to build this stateless protocol on top of
  the connection-oriented TCP network communications protocol,
  thereby ensuring that the Web is hobbled by the performance
  limitations of TCP without reaping any of its benefits, is a
  small irony that we won't discuss further.</p>

  <p>CGI scripts, however, often fit the stateless model poorly.
  Many CGI scripts are search engines of some sort. People pose a
  question, the CGI script does a search, and returns an answer.
  The user looks at the results, refines or modifies his question,
  and asks again. Unfortunately, by the time the user has refined
  his query and wants to build on previous results, the original
  CGI script has terminated, and the search has to start all over
  again. Or consider the important class of CGI scripts called
  "shopping carts." A user browses around an online catalog for a
  while. Whenever something takes his fancy, he presses a button
  that adds it to his shopping cart. When he's ready, he reviews
  the contents of the cart and (the vendor hopes) presses a button
  that performs an online order.</p>

  <p>In the absence of any stateful behavior in HTTP itself, CGI
  script writers have to keep track of state themselves. There are
  several techniques for doing this: most of them rely on tricking
  or cajoling the browser into keeping track of the state for
  you.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Maintain state variables in the CGI parameters. The
    simplest trick is to store all the data you want to keep track
    of in the query string passed from the browser to the CGI
    script. You can store the data directly in the URL used in a
    GET request, or as settings in a fill-out form. As the previous
    column showed, this is relatively easy to do with CGI.pm,
    because it was designed to create "sticky" state-maintaining
    forms. This paradigm breaks down, however, when there's a lot
    of data to keep track of or when it's important to maintain a
    chronologically accurate record of the user's actions even when
    the user hits the "back" and "forward" buttons.</li>

    <li>Maintain the state on the server side with a
    specially-spawned HTTP server. You can defeat the limitation on
    HTTP by creating your own state-aware Web server. When a remote
    user starts a session, you spawn a new HTTP server that's
    dedicated to maintaining the state of that session, and you
    redirect the user to the new server's URL. This is how the
    state-maintaining miniserver module works and is the topic of
    the next issue's column.</li>

    <li>Save the session's state to a disk file and use a session
    key to keep track of the files. This technique works even when
    there's large amounts of state data, and requires minimal data
    to be stored on the browser side of the connection. This is the
    technique that I'll focus on in today's column.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The listing on the next page is a sample state-maintaining CGI
  script called remember.cgi. When invoked, it displays a form
  containing a single text input field and two buttons labeled
  "ADD" and "CLEAR" (see the figure for a screen shot). The user
  may type a short phrase into the text field and press ADD. This
  adds the phrase to the bottom of a growing list of phrases
  displayed at the bottom of the page. When the user presses CLEAR,
  the list is emptied. You can try it out for yourself at</p>

  <p>The script works by maintaining each session's state in a
  separate file. The files are kept in a subdirectory that is
  readable and writable by the Web server daemon. We keep track of
  the correspondence between files and browser sessions by
  generating a unique session key when the remote user first
  accesses the script. After the session key is generated, we
  arrange for the browser to pass the key back to us on each
  subsequent access to the script.</p>

  <p>The technique this script uses to maintain the session key is
  to store it in the "additional path information" part of the URL.
  This is the part of the URL between the name of the script and
  the beginning of the query string. For example, in the URL</p>
  <pre>
http://toto.com/cgi-bin/remember.cgi/202.2.13.1.117?item=hi%20there
</pre>

  <p>the text "<tt>/202.2.13.1.117</tt>" is the additional path
  information. Although the additional path information syntax was
  designed for passing file information to CGI scripts, there's no
  reason it can't be used for other purposes, and it's often easier
  to keep the session key here than mixing it up with the other
  script parameters.</p>

  <p>Lines 8 to 16 are responsible for generating a unique session
  key. After creating a new CGI object, the script fetches the
  additional path information and strips off the initial slash
  (lines 9-10). The session key is next passed to the subroutine
  <tt>valid()</tt> (lines 66-69). This subroutine performs a
  pattern match on the session key to ensure that it is a key
  generated by our program rather than something that the user
  happened to type in. Importantly, the <tt>valid()</tt> subroutine
  also returns false if the session key is an empty string, which
  happens the first time our script is called.</p>

  <p>If the session key is blank or invalid we generate a new key
  (lines 12-16) using the subroutine
  <tt>generate_session_key()</tt>. This subroutine, located at
  lines 60-64, is responsible for generating something that won't
  conflict with other concurrent sessions. In this example we use
  the simple but imperfect expedient of concatenating the remote
  machine's IP address with the CGI script's process ID.</p>

  <p>After creating a new session key we generate a redirect
  directive to the browser, incorporating the session key into the
  new URL. If our script's URL is
  <tt>http://toto.com/cgi-bin/remember.cgi</tt> and the
  newly-generated session key is 202.2.13.1.117, we redirect the
  browser to</p>

  <p>
  <tt>http://toto.com/cgi-bin/remember.cgi/202.2.13.1.117</tt>.</p>

  <p>The scripts exists after printing the redirect. It will be
  reinvoked almost immediately by the browser when it retrieves the
  new URL/session key combination.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the script, from line 18 onward, contains the
  code that is invoked when the browser provides a valid session
  key. Line 18 calls <tt>fetch_old_state()</tt> to retrieve the
  current list of text lines. This subroutine, defined in lines
  71-77, opens up a file that contains the saved state by using the
  session key directly as the name of the file. More sophisticated
  scripts will want to use the session key in more clever ways,
  such as the key to a record in a DBM file or a handle into a
  relational database session.</p>

  <p><tt>fetch_old_state()</tt> opens the file indicated by the
  session key, ignoring any "file not found" errors, and passes the
  filehandle to the CGI <tt>new()</tt> method. This creates a new
  CGI object with parameters initialized from data stored in the
  file. We create a new CGI object here solely because its
  <tt>param()</tt> method offers a convenient way to store multiple
  named parameters and because of its ability to save and restore
  these named parameters to a file. We don't check first whether
  the file exists. If the file doesn't exist already, the CGI
  <tt>new()</tt> method returns an empty parameter list, which is
  exactly what we want. We close the file and return the new CGI
  object.</p>

  <p>We now have two CGI objects. The first object, stored in the
  variable <tt>$q</tt>, was initialized from the current query and
  contains the contents of the text field and information about
  which button the user pressed when he submitted the fill-out
  form. The second object, stored in the variable
  <tt>$old_state</tt>, is the CGI object initialized from the saved
  file, and contains cumulative information about the user's
  previous actions.</p>

  <p>Lines 20 to 26 manipulate the saved state depending on the
  user's request. We find out which button the user pressed by
  examining the CGI query's "action" parameter (line 20). If equal
  to "ADD", we recover the contents of the text field from the
  query parameter "item" and add it to the cumulative list (line
  23). If the "action" parameter is "CLEAR", then we clear the list
  completely (line 25). Otherwise, no button was pressed and we
  continue onward.</p>

  <p>Next we save the updated list back to disk with
  <tt>save_state()</tt>, which reverses the process by opening up
  the file indicated by the session key and using the CGI
  <tt>save()</tt> method to dump out the contents of
  <tt>$old_state</tt>.</p>

  <p>So far no text at all has been transmitted to the browser.
  It's a good idea to do all the back end work first, because
  network delays can make your CGI script hang during output. If
  the user presses the "stop" button during this period your CGI
  script will be terminated, potentially leaving things in an
  inconsistent state.</p>

  <p>Lines 30 through 58 generate the HTML document. The script
  generates the HTTP header followed by the HTML preliminaries and
  some explanatory text (lines 30-37). Next it creates the fill-out
  form, using the <tt>start_form(), end_form()</tt>, and form
  element generating subroutines discussed in the previous column.
  The only trick in this section is the use of the
  <tt>-override</tt> parameter in the call to <tt>textfield()</tt>.
  We want the contents of this field to be blank each time the page
  is displayed. For this purpose we set the contents to an empty
  string and use <tt>-override</tt> to have CGI.pm suppress the
  usual sticky behavior of fields.</p>

  <p>After closing the form, we print out the current list of
  phrases in lines 44-52. Because there's no control over what the
  user types into the text field, it's important to escape any
  special HTML characters (such as angle brackets and ampersands)
  before incorporating it into our own document. Otherwise the
  script might create a page that doesn't display properly. The
  <tt>escapeHTML()</tt> method accomplishes this.</p>

  <p>Last, we end the page with <tt>end_html()</tt> and exit. This
  script doesn't save a vast amount of state information: only one
  parameter, and a short one at that. However, the same techniques
  can be used to store and manipulate the contents of hundreds of
  parameters. In order to turn this from an example into a real
  world script, you'll need to make a few refinements.</p>

  <p>You might want to change the way session keys are chosen.
  Although this script chooses its keys in a way that minimizes the
  chances of conflict between two sessions, it isn't suitable for
  security-sensitive applications. Such scripts should make sure
  that the remote user is entitled to use the provided session key
  in order to prevent one user from "stealing" another user's
  state. Checking the IP address for consistency is a one way to do
  this; password-protecting the script and incorporating the
  encrypted password into the session key would be an even better
  technique.</p>

  <p>In order to make this script useful in the real world you'll
  also need to remove state files when they've gone out of date.
  Otherwise the scripts' PIDs will eventually roll over and start
  using ancient state files that are no longer valid. (There's also
  the risk of proliferating state files filling up your disk!) The
  easiest way to handle this on a UNIX system is with a cron job
  that runs at regular intervals looking for old state files and
  deleting them.</p>

  <p>Another thing you might want to change is the way the session
  key is maintained. Netscape browsers support a "magic cookie"
  field that is guaranteed to be maintained for the entire length
  of a browser/server session. You can set the browser's magic
  cookie when the script first accesses the script, using CGI.pm's
  <tt>set_cookie()</tt>, method, and retrieve it on subsequent
  invocations of the script using <tt>get_cookie()</tt>.
  Unfortunately only Netscape browsers support the magic cookie
  field, so it isn't useful for other browsers.</p>

  <p>In the next column I discuss CGI:MiniSvr, a flexible and
  powerful way of saving state information at the server's side of
  the connection.</p>
