  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  There's been talk about a new interpreted language designed with
  the Internet and the World Wide Web in mind, one which combines
  safety, object-oriented power, near-native speed and platform
  independence with a rich and extensible class framework.

  <p>There's also been more than a little hype about a competitor
  to this language: an obscure, relatively unsafe, complex Internet
  language upstart which was born from a failed effort to make
  kitchen appliances programmable. Does this language, inexplicably
  named after coffee, have a chance against Perl's Penguin?</p>

  <h3>A Peek at Penguin</h3>

  <p>Penguin is a freely available set of Perl 5 modules which
  implement the transmission, receipt, setup and execution of Perl
  code between any two computers on any kind of network. Like Java,
  its intent is to ease and promote Internet application
  development; unlike Java, it's designed with philosophies and
  features which simplify development of complex non-toy
  applications.</p>

  <p>The basic tenet of Penguin is that you can write code and send
  it to a remote computer to be executed, and conversely, that you
  can receive code from somewhere else and reliably trust that it
  won't scribble obscenities on your disk drive where your precious
  data used to be. This promise enables all sorts of interesting
  programs, ranging from tiny functional applets embedded in web
  pages to massive intelligent agents which roam the Internet
  talking to other agents, buying information and acting to serve
  your interests.</p>

  <p>These futures are brought into view by Penguin's main
  paradigm: <b>all computers are peers</b>. In this model, there is
  no distinction between a client and a server; in fact, two
  computers might simultaneously send each other Penguin programs
  to accomplish a transaction. On the Internet, this paradigm makes
  more sense than Java's client-centric model. After all, although
  the local client computer may be able to display great graphics,
  it's statistically 30 million times more likely that some remote
  computer holds the information or data which the client needs to
  display.</p>

  <p>The idea of executing someone else's code (or indeed of
  sending your own code somewhere else) raises the issue of
  security. How can you be sure that the code, when run, won't send
  hate mail to the White House or play the delete fandango on your
  favorite spreadsheet? Penguin solves this problem with a three
  stage process.</p>

  <p>First, all Penguin code carries with it a cryptographic
  "digital signature," which guarantees that the code is intact and
  that a specific someone (the "signing authority") took personal
  responsibility for the code going out on the network. Once
  signed, the code and the signature cannot be tampered with in any
  way.</p>

  <p>Second, Penguin formalizes the idea of trust. When your
  computer receives some Penguin code, the Penguin-enabled Perl
  interpreter figures out who signed it and then checks to see how
  much you trust them. Penguin enables you to allow or deny each
  signing authority's code to execute any specific Perl operation.
  For example, you might allow all Felix Gallo-signed code to use
  simple math, arrays, hashes, and <tt>print()</tt>, but not use
  loops, <tt>open()</tt>, <tt>system()</tt>, or <tt>write()</tt> -
  but you might allow Larry Wall-signed code to do anything it
  wants. The choice of operations to limit and allow is completely
  customizable. Further, you can limit the amount of memory, disk
  space, and self-knowledge that each signing authority is allowed
  to access.</p>

  <p>Lastly, Penguin compiles and runs all code in a special
  interpreter with illegal functions "masked out." If the code
  attempts to perform any operation you've disallowed, it is loudly
  rejected at compile time before execution. The moment a Penguin
  program attempts to cross the bounds of its allowed memory or
  disk space at run time, or when it uses up more time than you've
  allowed, it is terminated with extreme prejudice by the operating
  system.</p>

  <p>By comparison, the marketing team at Sun has heavily promoted
  the fact that Java uses formally "provable" methods and a
  bytecode verification pass to ensure that Java programs don't run
  amok - but they have yet to explain why the Computer Emergency
  Response Team has twice had to issue global warnings of major
  Java viruses and bugs in the system. Interested parties are free
  to find and fix bugs in the source themselves, of course - as
  long as they have $250,000 for the license.</p>

  <p>Another pillar of Penguin's power is its extensible <i>class
  system</i>. Although the idea of a software agent scampering
  around the net gathering information is neat by itself,
  implementing such a beast without a standard set of interfaces
  and protocols for all executing environments to share would be
  untenably difficult.</p>

  <p>To help solve this problem, Penguin provides each executing
  program with two lists. The first list is the "law" of the
  environment; it details what the program can and cannot do. The
  second list is the "way" of the environment: it lets the program
  know what the local environment is for and provides clues for
  what the program might want to do. For example, if the computer
  is a storefront for selling shoes, the second list might tell all
  executing programs that the function <tt>&amp;buy()</tt> is
  available, and that there are 50 pairs of brown wingtips
  available for $65 each.</p>

  <p>Interface standardization helps, but what about extension?
  Like Perl, Penguin takes an intellectual-free-market approach by
  permitting Penguin environments to overload, extend or perform
  radical surgery on any class or function. If a site administrator
  wants incoming programs to have access to functions outside the
  accepted set, she's free to implement them and make them
  available.</p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> A Machine
  Sending Code to Another</font></p>

  <p>This draws a sharp distinction from Java, which has no
  standard methods for letting programs know what sort of
  environment they're running in and no master library of classes
  for an "Internet agent" to use. Confessedly, Java has a superior
  set of graphical user interface classes, but Penguin's catching
  up - it has interfaces for OpenGL, the only cross-platform freely
  available three-dimensional graphics standard currently supported
  in hardware, and Tk, Sun's own popular user interface
  library.</p>

  <p>The Penguin story is already a runaway winner by the time we
  get to the most subtle and yet most compelling part: the
  underlying language. While language evaluations and comparisons
  are notoriously complex and fraught with emotional boosterism,
  the issues for Internet application languages are fairly
  clear-cut and well-defined.</p>

  <p>A good language must handle data well. The Internet is
  expanding exponentially because people are entranced with the
  possibilities that accompany the avalanche of information. All of
  humanity's secrets, from its foibles to its successes, seem just
  two mouseclicks away. And as we go now from the raw document
  phase, in which we must gather information and interact ourselves
  using crude browsers, to the enhanced information phase, in which
  the deluge of content requires that we make tools to optimize our
  time and put the burden on computers, our language must filter,
  search, manipulate and process arbitrary data in a fast and
  powerful way.</p>

  <p>Perl is, of course, very good with information. Regular
  expressions, associative arrays, references, filehandles and
  typelessness are all features which enhance Perl's suitability
  for major data manipulation jobs.</p>

  <p>Perl's strength is Java's weakness. Java, based on C++, still
  shows its systems implementation language ancestry. Although it
  has some good "stream" classes which help get data from the net
  to the program, Java's very poor at handling large quantities of
  information. Lacking regular expressions, and feeling the
  constrictive effects of a rigorous type system, Java programmers
  must write great swaths of code to accomplish text manipulation
  tasks that are relatively simple in Perl.</p>

  <p>An Internet application language must also be a big tent. Just
  as the Web has proven that the media giants alone aren't capable
  of satisfying humanity's entire thirst for information, the
  Internet is proceeding to prove that no one software company (in
  fact, no thousand software companies) can encompass users' ever
  growing needs for ever more personalized programs. Our language
  must provide as many people as possible with the ability to do as
  much as possible.</p>

  <p>Perl is strong in this area too. Although much has been said
  about its initial learning curve, its nature lends itself well to
  incremental learning. With just <tt>$scalars,
  &lt;FILEHANDLES&gt;, open()</tt> and <tt>print()</tt>, new users
  can see results that clearly lead to important data manipulation
  programs. The powerful bits, such as regular expressions, need
  not be learned all at first or all at once. As a result, Perl is
  comfortable for even the occasional programmer.</p>

  <p>Java is far harder to grasp than Perl. The strictures and
  rules it applies take effect even before programming starts -- if
  the file the program is in isn't named according to exacting
  rules, the compiler won't even run. Going a step further along
  the road, the programmer must understand classes, objects,
  methods, functions, the 'public'/'private' distinction, return
  values, the special 'void' return value, 'static' class members,
  typed arrays, Java's 'System' class and a function called
  'println' before she can make "hello, world!" appear on a screen.
  Worse, esoteric concepts such as threading, exception handling,
  and garbage collection are mandatory for even intermediate
  programmers. Java may be an easy step up for those experienced
  with C and C++, but it's a mountain for those who haven't taken
  programming as their profession.</p>

  <p>The last important feature of an Internet application language
  is its scalability. As the Internet expands to fill all available
  bandwidth and explore new frontiers, it forces the creation of
  large, sophisticated programs to handle its boundaries. Small
  programs written carelessly are extended and extended again to
  serve ever increasing appetites. A good Internet application
  language must make software engineering possible in the face of
  even the Internet's unchecked rapaciousness.</p>

  <p>Perl is moderately good at permitting careful growth. Penguin,
  too, is designed with extensive scaffolding to permit future
  expansion. However, the easy-going nature of the language and the
  fact that it doesn't enforce anything but the most basic
  syntactical correctness can result in poor coding discipline and
  practices which inhibit reuse. As a result, Perl can be difficult
  to write long-term reusable code in. The only consolation is that
  on the Internet, most code has a lifespan of months anyway.</p>

  alt="Java's Complexity Onramp vs Perl's"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2:</b> Java's
  Complexity Onramp vs Perl's</font></p>

  <p>Java is better than Perl in the scalability area. It has
  flaws, such as its odd way of implementing multiple inheritance,
  its typefulness, and the too-numerous 'finalized'
  (non-extensible) classes in its provided libraries, but it gains
  from being derived from a software engineering language. Once
  people stop writing musical animated bouncing head applets, Java
  will likely prove a good system for programming in-the-large.</p>

  <p>So, Perl with Penguin is a safer, more consistent, more
  powerful, and more suitable Internet application language. Its
  network model is in line with the Internet's; its security relies
  on widely known cryptographic methods, rather than on unknown
  hidden algorithms that aren't, apparently, working; it provides
  interfaces specifically designed for agents; and the underlying
  application language addresses the core needs and strengths of
  the Internet.</p>

  <p>Penguin is freely available (under Perl's Artistic License) on
  the CPAN site nearest you. The first public release ("One
  Penguin") is now available - feel free to download it, test it,
  beat the heck out of it, and submit suggestions, comments,
  criticism and patches to me. Really interested people should join
  the Penguin mailing list by sending mail to
  <i>penguin-request@amicus.com</i>.</p>

  <p>Next issue, in 'Penguin: The First Tentative Waddle', we track
  the implementation of an honest-to-Betsy Internet agent. Stay
  tuned!</p>
