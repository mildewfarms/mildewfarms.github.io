  <h2 align="center">Perl/Tk: The Grid Geometry Manager</h2>

  <h4><i>Steve Lidie</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  We know that every Perl/Tk graphical application consists of a
  number of widgets arranged in a particular manner on a display.
  Although we may suggest the size and location of the widgets, the
  final say in the matter is up to a <i>geometry manager</i>, the
  software responsible for computing the actual layout of the
  widgets.

  <p>In essence, a geometry manager's job is to stuff what are
  known as, in X parlance, <i>slave</i> widgets inside a master
  widget. The topmost master widget in a Perl/Tk application is of
  course the MainWindow. In the simplest case it's the only master,
  but usually we need to employ one or more frames within which
  more slaves are packed. Once the slaves in these frames have been
  arranged, the frames themselves are laid out within the
  MainWindow.</p>

  <p>This means that in order to calculate the final look of an
  application, geometry information propagates outwards from the
  innermost masters to the MainWindow. We'll see why and how to
  defeat this behavior later.</p>

  <p>Before any widget can appear on the display it must be managed
  by a geometry manager. There can actually be multiple geometry
  managers controlling an application, although a widget can only
  be managed by one geometry manager at a time.</p>

  <p>The Perl/Tk distribution contains at least four geometry
  managers: place, pack, Tk::Table and grid, but we'll only discuss
  the "packer" and the "gridder" this time. As its name suggests,
  the grid geometry manager places widgets in rows and columns
  inside a master. But why include the packer in a gridder
  discussion? The answer to that question begins innocently enough,
  with a simple pack problem posted to the Perl/Tk mailing list.*
  After comparing equivalent pack and grid programs, we'll see that
  the gridder provides a simpler solution for this particular
  problem.</p>

  <h3>A Brief Diversion Into PackLand</h3>

  <p>Here's the task at hand:</p>

  <p>"I'm having a problem understanding how 'anchor' is working.
  My current problem is: I want to display a list of names in one
  column and a list of numbers in a second column. I want the names
  to be left justified and the numbers to be right justified. I
  have tried playing with the 'anchor' and 'width' mechanisms, but
  with no success."</p>

  <p>This code sample (prob1 on the TPJ site) represents the
  poster's valiant attempt:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use Tk; 
use strict;

my $MW = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
my $f1 = $MW-&gt;Frame-&gt;pack; 
my $f2 = $MW-&gt;Frame-&gt;pack;

$f1-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; 'This is a very long label', -width =&gt; 30)
    -&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'left', -anchor =&gt; 'w'); 
$f1-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; 123)-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'left');

$f2-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; 'A short one', -width =&gt; 30) 
    -&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'left', -anchor =&gt; 'w'); 
$f2-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; 456)-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'left');

$MW-&gt;Button(-text =&gt; 'Quit', -command =&gt; ['destroy', $MW]) 
    -&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'bottom');

MainLoop;
</pre>

  <p>The names are packed left and anchored west, which seems
  reasonable. Packing the numbers left as well looks dubious, but
  let's see what happens when the code is run:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/prob1.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 1: Prob 1" border="0" width="229" height="105"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> Prob
  1</font></p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the names are not left justified, but appear to
  be centered, and the numbers, which we thought might be left
  justified, seem to be right justified! Something must be amiss.
  To figure out what's going on, consider these tips:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When dealing with columnar data, use the font <i>fixed</i>
    rather than a proportional font.</li>

    <li>Use strings of varying lengths to expose boundary
    conditions, so that you know if your data is justified
    properly.</li>

    <li>Add different background colors to various widgets to
    highlight the requested display area versus that
    <i>assigned</i> by the geometry manager.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is a slightly modified version of the first program
  (program prob2). The changed lines are highlighted in bold.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use Tk; 
use strict;

my $MW = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
<b>$MW-&gt;configure(-bg =&gt; 'white');</b>
<b>$MW-&gt;optionAdd('*font' =&gt; 'fixed');</b> 
my $f1 = $MW-&gt;Frame-&gt;pack; 
my $f2 = $MW-&gt;Frame-&gt;pack;

<b>$f1-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; 'This is a very long label', 
                   -width =&gt; 30, -bg =&gt; 'gray')
    -&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'left', -anchor =&gt; 'w'); 
$f1-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; 1234567890, -bg =&gt; 'yellow')
    -&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'left');
$f2-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; 'A short one', -width =&gt; 30, 
           -bg =&gt; 'gray')
    -&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'left', -anchor =&gt; 'w'); 
$f2-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; 456, -bg =&gt; 'yellow')
    -&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'left');
$MW-&gt;Button(-text =&gt; 'Quit', 
            -command =&gt; ['destroy', $MW])-&gt;pack;</b> 

MainLoop;
</pre>

  <p>Most of the changes just implement the three tips listed, with
  the exception of the last one: by default the packer arranges a
  master's slave widgets from top to bottom, so <tt>-side =&gt;
  'bottom'</tt> is superfluous. Because I'm lazy, I used
  <tt>optionAdd()</tt> to change the X11 resource database so that
  all widgets use the default font "fixed". Executing our newly
  instrumented program reveals this:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/prob2.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 2: Prob 2" border="0" width="268" height="102"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2:</b> Prob
  2</font></p>

  <p>First note that the numbers are allocated an area just large
  enough to contain them, which is the default pack action,
  sometime called "shrink-wrapping." Next, note that the names are
  allocated a space 30 characters wide (because that's what we
  requested) and the label text is centered - again, the default
  pack action. Remember, the packer likes to shrink-wrap and center
  widgets unless you specify otherwise. So, the two container
  frames are assigned the minimum required space and centered in
  their master, the MainWindow - that's why unused space is equally
  apportioned on either side of the bottom frame.</p>

  <p>This exercise will clarify things. Make a copy of program
  prob2. Name it, say, <i>prob3</i>, and observe:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Packing the names with <tt>-anchor =&gt; 'w'</tt> is
    useless. Modify <i>prob3</i> and try it for yourself.</li>

    <li>But creating the label widgets with <tt>-anchor =&gt;
    'w'</tt> would make a difference. It doesn't solve the problem,
    but it does left justify the names in their 30 character
    allocated space. Convince yourself by modifying prob3
    again.</li>

    <li>Packing the second frame with <tt>-fill =&gt; 'x'</tt>
    tells the packer to fill the frame east-west instead of
    shrink-wrapping. Modify prob3 and check out the results, which
    look promising. The frames are the same length, and the names
    are now left justified. But the numbers are also left justified
    - after all we did tell the packer to do that!.</li>

    <li>Modify prob3 one last time to pack the numbers <tt>-side
    =&gt; 'right'</tt>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Program <i>prob3</i> should look similar to this simple
  solution (program <i>pack</i>), which solves the poster's problem
  in a slightly different way:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w 
# 
# Create two columns of data: left-adjusted text 
# labels and right-adjusted numbers. Each row consists 
# of a frame with two labels packed on opposite 
# sides. The packer fills unused space in the 
# X-dimension so that all frames are the same length
# (that of the widest frame).

use English; 
use Tk; 
use strict;

my $MW = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
my @text = ('This is a long label', 'Then a short',      
'Frogs lacking lipophores are blue');

my($i, $w, $f) = (0, undef, undef); 
foreach (@text) { 
    $f = $MW-&gt;Frame-&gt;pack(-fill =&gt; 'x'); 
    $w = $f-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; $ARG); 
    $w-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'left');     
    $w = $f-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; $i . '0' x $i); 
    $w-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'right'); 
    $i++; 
}

MainLoop;
</pre>

  <p>The program's output:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/pack.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 3: Pack_left" border="0" width="234" height="86"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 3:</b>

  <h3>Grid Geometry Management Fundamentals</h3>

  <p>The corresponding code using the grid geometry manager
  (program <i>grid</i>) produces an identical display. Unlike the
  rest of Tk, grid elements are referenced by row (Y coordinate)
  and column (X coordinate), starting from 0 at the top-left corner
  of the master widget.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w 
# 
# Create two columns of data: left-adjusted text 
# labels and right-adjusted numbers. Each row 
# consists of two labels managed by the gridder,
# which are "stuck" to opposite sides of their
# respective column. The gridder fills unused space
# in the east-west direction so that all rows are
# the same length -- that of the widest row.

use English; 
use Tk; 
use strict;

my $MW = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
my @text = ('This is a long label', 
            'Then a short',      
            'Frogs lacking lipophores are blue');

my ($i, $w) = (0, undef); 
foreach (@text) { 
    $w = $MW-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; $ARG); 
    $w-&gt;grid(-row =&gt; $i, -column =&gt; 0, -sticky =&gt; 'w'); 
    $w = $MW-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; $i . '0' x $i); 
    $w-&gt;grid(-row =&gt; $i, -column =&gt; 1, -sticky =&gt; 'e'); 
    $i++; 
}

MainLoop;
</pre>

  <p>The obvious difference is that here we define a grid, with
  three rows and two columns. <tt>-sticky</tt> replaces pack's
  <tt>-anchor</tt> and <tt>-fill</tt> attributes, so it's easy to
  west-align names in column zero and east-align numbers in column
  one. Also, we've dispensed with all the row frames required with
  the pack model.</p>

  <p>As a more exhaustive test drive of the gridder, let's look at
  an implementation of 15-puzzle, a game where you try to arrange
  15 numbered buttons in sequence. If you don't know what I'm
  talking about, try out the demo in the Tk <i>widget</i> program
  bundled with the Perl/Tk distribution. (15-puzzle uses the place
  geometry manager, in case you're interested.)</p>

  <p>This version of 15-puzzle is called <i>npuz</i> because it's
  not limited to a 4x4 square; you can choose <i>n</i>, the length
  of a side, from the set (3, 4, 6, 8). To make the puzzle more
  difficult, the numbered squares have been replaced with segments
  of an image: the official Perl/Tk icon, who we all know as
  <i>Camelus bactrianus</i>.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/npuz.gif"><img src=
  "images/npuz_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 4: Npuz - Camelus Bactrianus" border="0" width="156"
  height="154"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 4:</b> Npuz -
  <i>Camelus Bactrianus</i></font></p>

  <p>The grid geometry manager is well suited for this problem, not
  only for the initial layout of the puzzle, but also for moving
  the pieces. When a new game starts, the pieces are randomized.
  Then each is assigned an image and gridded, with one piece
  becoming the "space piece." Moving a piece simply involves
  exchanging it with the space, which entails a call to
  <tt>grid()</tt> to swap the row and column coordinates.</p>

  <p>Here's simp, a tiny program that gives you a feel for what
  npuz does:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w 
# 
# simp (simple_puz) - randomly grid 15 
# buttons and a space in a 4x4 rectangle.

use English; 
use Tk; 
use strict; 
use subs qw(create_puz xy);

my $MW = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
my $PIECES = 16; 
my $SIDE = sqrt $PIECES; 
my <tt>@ORDER</tt> = 
    (3, 1, 6, 2, 5, 7, 15, 13, 0, 4, 11, 8, 9, 14, 10, 12); 

create_puz; 

MainLoop;

<b>sub create_puz</b> {
    my($i, $text, $num, $but, $c, $r);
    for($i = 0; $i &lt;= $PIECES-1; $i++) {     
        $num = $ORDER[$i];      
        $text = ($num == 0) ? 'Space' : $num; 
        $but = $MW-&gt;Button(-text =&gt; $text, 
                -command =&gt; [$MW =&gt; 'bell']); 
        ($c, $r) = xy $i;       
        $but-&gt;grid(-column =&gt; $c, -row =&gt; $r, 
                   -sticky =&gt; 'nsew'); 
    } # forend all puzzle pieces
} # end create_puz

<b>sub xy</b> { # ordinal to X/Y
    my($n) = @ARG; 
    ($n % $SIDE, int $n / $SIDE)
} 
</pre>

  <p>For simplicity, think of the puzzle pieces as a linear list
  rather than a two dimensional array. So for <i>n</i> = 4, the
  pieces are numbered from 0 to 15, with piece 0 as the space. To
  position a piece we just need to convert a puzzle ordinal to a
  row/column pair - that's what subroutine <i>xy</i> does - and
  then grid it. The <tt>@ORDER</tt> list in effect shuffles the
  pieces so the game doesn't start already solved. (Perhaps
  <tt>@ORDER</tt> isn't an appropriate variable name, since the end
  result is to increase the game's entropy, or add disorder to
  it.)</p>

  <p>Running simp creates the following:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/simp.gif"><img src=
  "images/simp_sm.gif" align="center" alt="Figure 5: Simp" border=
  "0" width="100" height="73"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 5:</b>
  Simp</font></p>

  <p>The <tt>-sticky =&gt; 'nsew'</tt> attribute is analogous to
  the packer's <tt>-fill =&gt; 'both'</tt>, and ensures that all
  buttons completely fill their allocated space. Notice that grid
  column zero is wider than the other columns. This is because the
  gridder assigns the column a width equal to that of the widest
  button - the button labeled "Space." Rerun this program without
  <tt>-sticky</tt> and you'll see the difference. But this won't be
  a problem for npuz since all the buttons have images of identical
  size.</p>

  <p>Three changes to <i>simp</i> will give us <i>npuz</i>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a Photo image of <i>Camelus bactrianus</i> and
    replace button numbers with a portion of the image.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Keep track of every button widget and its grid position so
    we know when it's adjacent to the space piece.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Devise a button callback to re-grid a piece when it's
    eligible to move.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Since we think of the puzzle pieces as a list, we'll store the
  widget references in an array: <tt>@PUZ</tt>. The grid geometry
  manager obviously knows the location of all its slave widgets so
  npuz can simply ask the gridder for this data.</p>

  <p>This npuz code is analogous to simp. A few lines have been
  excerpted from other areas of the program and included here for
  completeness.</p>

  <p><br></p>
  <pre>
$CAMEL = <b>$MW-&gt;Photo</b>(-file =&gt; 'images/Xcamel.npuz');

# create puzzle frame grid master
$PF = <b>$MW-&gt;Frame-&gt;grid</b>; 

my($i, $o, $c, $r, $w, $h, $x, $y, $but, $gif);

for($i = 0; $i &lt;= $#PUZ; $i++) { 
    $o = $ORDER[$i]-&gt;[0]; 
    ($c, $r) = xy $o; # puzzle ordinal to column/row 
    $w = <b>$CAMEL-&gt;image</b>('width') / $SIDE; 
    $h = <b>$CAMEL-&gt;image</b>('height') / $SIDE; 
    $x = $c * $w; # x/column pixel offset 
    $y = $r * $h; # y/row pixel offset 
    $gif = <b>$PF-&gt;Photo</b>; # new, empty, GIF image 
    <b>$gif-&gt;copy</b>($CAMEL, -from =&gt; $x, $y, $x+$w, $y+$h);
    $but = $PF-&gt;Button(-image =&gt; $gif, -relief =&gt; 'flat',
                       -borderwidth =&gt; 0, 
                       -highlightthickness =&gt; 0);
    $PUZ[$o] = $but; 
    ($c, $r) = xy $i; 
    $but-&gt;grid(-column =&gt; $c, -row =&gt; $r, 
               -sticky =&gt; 'nsew'); 
    $but-&gt;configure(-command =&gt; [\&amp;move_piece, $but]); 
} # forend all puzzle pieces
</pre>

  <p>The first statement creates a Photo object of our friendly
  camel. Like Tk objects, a Photo object has methods to manipulate
  it, which we'll use to create smaller rectangular photos from the
  main image. These new photos are then assigned to the game
  buttons.</p>

  <p>Notice that frames are still used as containers with the
  gridder. Here the puzzle frame <tt>$PF</tt>, a slave of the
  MainWindow, is the grid master for the puzzle. (There's another
  MainWindow slave frame that holds the <i>npuz</i> menubar, but
  I'll talk about that later.)</p>

  <p>Once a puzzle ordinal is selected, we can use its row and
  column position, along with the width and height of a puzzle
  piece, to compute a bounding box that defines a sub-region of the
  main camel image. Then an empty photo is created and populated
  with the image sub-region using the <tt>copy()</tt> method, which
  copies from the source image $CAMEL to the new image
  <tt>$gif</tt> (It's important to note that when you're finished
  with an image you must explicitly delete it. Images don't
  magically go away just because a widget that happens to use it is
  destroyed. After all, several widgets might be sharing the same
  image. To prevent a memory leak when a new game is started and
  all previous buttons are deleted, we first delete all their
  images:</p>
  <pre>
foreach (@PUZ) {$ARG-&gt;cget(-image)-&gt;delete} 
</pre>).

  <p>After updating <tt>@PUZ</tt> with the new button, the piece is
  gridded and a callback to <tt>move_piece()</tt> is created,
  passing $piece, a reference to the button. Pushing a button
  invokes it.</p>
  <pre>
   foreach (@PUZ) {$ARG-&gt;cget(-image)-&gt;delete}
sub move_piece {
   my($piece) = @ARG;
   my(%info, $c, $r, $sc, $sr); 
   %info = $piece-&gt;gridInfo; 
   ($c, $r) = @info{-column,-row}; 
   %info = $SPACE-&gt;gridInfo; 
   ($sc, $sr) = @info{-column,-row}; 
   if (($sr == $r and ($sc == $c-1 or $sc == $c+1)) or        
       ($sc == $c and ($sr == $r-1 or $sr == $r+1))) {        
          $SPACE-&gt;grid(-column =&gt; $c, -row =&gt; $r);     
      $piece-&gt;grid(-column =&gt; $sc, -row =&gt; $sr); 
   }
} # end move_piece
</pre>

  <p>A call to <tt>gridinfo()</tt> returns a hash of grid
  configuration information. The hash keys are the same as the
  attributes you can give to a <tt>grid()</tt>( (or
  <tt>gridConfigure()</tt>) command, like <tt>-column</tt> and
  <tt>-row</tt>. It's a simple matter to take a slice of this hash,
  check to see if the puzzle piece is directly north, south, east
  or west of the space, and if so, swap their grid locations.</p>

  <p>As you can see, choosing the grid geometry manager for this
  problem greatly simplified the programming. The packer could be
  used, with a lot of bookkeeping and <tt>packForget</tt>ing, but
  the experience would not be pleasant! The placer is the second
  best choice, but you'd have to maintain button coordinates
  manually, so <tt>@PUZ</tt> would be a list of list of three:</p>
  <pre>
$PUZ[$ordinal] = [$column, $row, $but].
</pre>

  <p>You can grid menubars easily as well. Here's an example that
  <i>doesn't</i> work:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w 
# 
# menu1 - first attempt at gridding a menubar.

use Tk; 
use strict;

my $MW = MainWindow-&gt;new;

my $mf = $MW-&gt;Frame-&gt;grid; 
my $PF = $MW-&gt;Frame(-width =&gt; 300)-&gt;grid;

my $mbf = $mf-&gt;Menubutton(-text =&gt; 'File',
                        -relief =&gt; 'raised'); 
my $mbp = $mf-&gt;Menubutton(-text =&gt; 'Prefs',
                        -relief =&gt; 'raised');
my $mbq = $mf-&gt;Menubutton(-text =&gt; 'Help',
                        -relief =&gt; 'raised');

$mbf-&gt;grid(-row =&gt; 0, -column =&gt; 0, -sticky =&gt; 'w'); 
$mbp-&gt;grid(-row =&gt; 0, -column =&gt; 1, -sticky =&gt; 'w'); 
$mbq-&gt;grid(-row =&gt; 0, -column =&gt; 2, -sticky =&gt; 'e');

MainLoop;
</pre>

  <p>The frame <tt>$PF</tt> represents the puzzle frame, and
  artificially fixes the width of the application's display to 300
  pixels. I did this so there's unused space for the menubuttons to
  move about in to help illustrate gridder mechanics. The goal in
  this example is to grid the File and Prefs menubuttons side by
  side west, the Help menubutton east, with unused space in the
  center of the frame. Instead, this is the result:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/menu1.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 6: Menu 1" border="0" width="308" height="51"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 6:</b> Menu
  1</font></p>

  <p>Like the packer, the default grid action is to shrink-wrap the
  menubar frame around the three menubuttons and center it in the
  300 pixel allocated space. We'll need two small changes to
  achieve the effect shown below.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/menu2.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 7: Mmenu 2" border="0" width="308" height="51"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 7:</b> Menu
  2</font></p>

  <p>First, the menubar row needs to be east-west sticky:</p>
  <pre>
my $mf = $MW-&gt;Frame-&gt;grid(-sticky =&gt; 'ew');

  <p>By itself, this change doesn't make any difference in the
  geometry arrangement because the three grid columns containing
  the menubuttons have no weight. Without weight, a grid column (or
  row) can not be apportioned unallocated space. We can arrange for
  menubar column 1 (the Prefs menubutton) to get all the unused
  space in the frame like this:</p>

  <p>$mf-&gt;gridColumnconfigure(1, -weight =&gt; 1);</p>

  <p>The <tt>-weight</tt> attribute is a relative value, and
  because the other columns are weightless, the Prefs column gets
  100% of the unallocated space. It's important that Prefs be west
  sticky, but the other two columns don't need to be sticky at all,
  since they get no unused space. Although the current version of
  grid accepts floating point weight values, the next one will not,
  so always use integers.</p>

  <p>Sometimes you'll want to disable the outward propagation of
  geometry configuration information. For instance, suppose you
  want to manage a frame of a particular size, and within the frame
  pack or grid other widgets. This example grids a frame with an
  embedded button but prevents the gridder from shrink-wrapping the
  frame around the button:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w 

# Remove the gridPropagate() statement 
# to shrink-wrap the display.

use Tk; 

use strict;

my $MW = MainWindow-&gt;new; 

my $f = <b>$MW-&gt;Frame</b>(-width  =&gt; 200,
 
                   -height =&gt; 100) ; 
                                   
<b>$f-&gt;gridPropagate(0);</b>

$f-&gt;Button(-text =&gt; 'To shrink or not to shrink',
        -command =&gt; \&amp;exit)-&gt;grid;

                
MainLoop;
</pre>

  <p>There's a packer analog too: <tt>packPropagate()</tt>.</p>

  <p>That wraps up my grid introduction. Be sure to read the grid
  HTML documentation in the Perl/Tk distribution for further
  details. I'll see you back here for the first anniversary of The
  Perl Journal.</p>
