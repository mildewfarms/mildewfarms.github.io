  In relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement
  within this refuge for the demented, I am aware that my present
  position will create a natural doubt of the authenticity of my
  narrative. It is sadly true that the vast bulk of humanity lack
  the sensitivity and insight necessary to conceive of the eldritch
  manifestations that gibber and howl on the darkened hinterlands
  of the land of pure Platonic logic; or perhaps this is a blessing
  insofar as it renders them blissfully unaware of their peril, of
  the hideous evil from beyond time that dogs their steps, and of
  the ultimate price that transgressors in search of that hideous
  knowledge may ultimately pay.

  <p>Let me introduce myself. I, Charles Stross, formerly of
  England, was once but a humble scholar and seeker after
  knowledge, like many of you who read this testimony. From
  earliest childhood I have been a dreamer and a visionary. Weighed
  down by febrile and unhealthy imaginings, I have constantly
  prodded and pried at the unwelcoming closed doors of a certain
  ancient wisdom: like any other victim of the hallucinogenic
  ur-reality of Mr Howard Philips Lovecraft, I was drawn like a
  moth to the flame of a ghastly demise that wore the welcoming
  visage of glad enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Seven years ago, my commercial perambulations bought me into
  proximity to a fount of Hidden Knowledge. For, having succinctly
  concluded that my initial choice of trade was not to my taste, I
  had the wherewithall to subject myself to the rigours of a
  further sampling of the delights of academe, in this instance in
  the Department of Babbage Engineering that puffed its oil-spumed
  soot across the hallowed groves of Bradford University. For an
  entire year I studied mightily and invoked the evil (but in
  retrospect, compliant and biddable) demon spawn of Wirth to
  labour at my command. I even studied furtively from the dark and
  guarded book of Kernighan and Ritchie, and came to a tentative
  accomodation with the vast, squamous, and ancient nightmare to
  which the departmental administrators made sinister sacrifice in
  the machine room: I dared to speak the dread name 'Unix' in the
  midnight hour.</p>

  <p>I was a pasty-faced youth of ill complexion, much given to
  reading of forbidden codices and manuals by candlelight on stormy
  nights; and I conducted my researches for supressed knowledge in
  the dark and dismal labrynth beneath the Joseph Priestley
  Library. Many volumes did I pore over, and many covert mailing
  lists did I come across; until one day I heard mentioned the
  dread name of that most outrageous of sinister evils.<br></p>

  <p>At this point I was barely cognizant of the terrible doom that
  I faced, of the mortal peril in which I placed my soul: for there
  are those mindless horrors that twitter and weeble in the eternal
  void where lurks dread Yog-Sothoth, and there are the hideous
  ancients who even now wander the icy battlements of Leng beneath
  constellations unknown to man; but these are as nothing compared
  to the mind-destroying horror that is known even to men of
  courage only by its terrible symbol: the Camel. I have never been
  one to shrink from the pursuit of that wisdom which fools and
  visionless knaves write off as unspeakable blasphemy. Working by
  the light of a candle made with the tallow of a hanged man, I
  contrived to copy the dread book of incantations that was used in
  those days to summon the beast with one hump and no 'a'; and, had
  I but the time from my binding to service of the spawn of Wirth,
  I would have perhaps attempted a preliminary invocation. But it
  was not to be, for the exigencies of income took me in their
  grasp and it became necessary for me to depart from my academic
  lair, to seek my living wherever it might be in the mortal,
  daylit world.</p>

  <p>But years later, my terrible sins returned to haunt me.</p>

  <p>After some time, I came to work for a shadowy Operation
  dedicated to binding to their service and profit that most
  notorious of hellish spawn of the old ones, the demon named
  UNIX.</p>

  <p>The binding to service of UNIX was in its own right a vast and
  perilous enterprise, for although it was notoriously stupid this
  demon was prolific and febrile; no sooner had an entire team of
  sorcerers battened down one writhing squamous mass of tentacles
  beneath the dread sigils of XPG/4 than another cluster of eye
  stalks, palps, vibrissae, and other, less nameable organs would
  emerge into the light, pumping and pulsing with hideous energy.
  It took the combined efforts of a team of hundreds of magi over
  four years to enchain the brute to the point at which it could be
  entrusted with the simplest of tasks - and then they mass-
  marketed it as a palliative for halitosis and housework. But I
  digress! For, buried deep in the heart of this runic enterprise,
  I discovered once more the key to my fate: a circle of
  necromancers, working in secret within the operation, had opened
  a portal to one of the nameless planes and allowed certain
  terrible ancient truths to insinuate themselves into their
  brains. And one of the truths was ... the key to the camel with
  no 'a'.</p>

  <p>I tried to look away, but the forbidden knowledge already had
  me in its terrible febrile grasp. Attempts to use the presence of
  lesser entities to deter it failed; the beast with one hump and
  no 'a' spat, and the flightless bird lost its plumage. Even the
  most powerful of mystical sigils, the arcane language in which
  the sorcerers Brian, Ken, and Dennis first invoked UNIX, failed
  to deter the camel. It stared at me with an icy vision full of
  promises and strange, unapproachable knowledge: and I
  succumbed.</p>

  <p>Three years have passed since that point, when the camel
  taught me its secret language and enslaved my heart. I have
  committed atrocities and abominations since then. I have
  consorted with daemons and enjoined servers to do my bidding. I
  have woven a dense web of nightmares in which to entrap my
  victims and suck them dry of all motivation to resist. I have
  sacrificed babies on a blasted windswept heath by the light of a
  gibbous moon in order to acquire for my self-aggrandizement yet
  more knowledge of the evil that sounds like unto the name of an
  oyster's treasure. And yet ... I have always had the sense that I
  was being played with, kept on the outside of that mystical
  circle of knowledge, and that some deeper, sanity-challenging
  insight yet eluded me.</p>

  <p>Finally, a month ago, I discovered the true fount of insight
  into the nature of the beast. A book is available, to those who
  know who and what to ask for. Kept in the deepest dungeon of a
  library's stacks, its cover sealed with bronze clasps and its
  spine earthed by a silver chain, the book of the camel contains
  all the forbidden knowledge any evil necromancer could desire.
  There, laid out for my delectation was all the truth that my
  bleeding forehead could contain. Bleeding, for upon reading the
  book I was driven to pound my head upon the stone cobblestones of
  the oubliette to which the librarian had driven me. For I now
  realize that I have no hope of salvation; that my soul is
  eternally doomed to torment, and that the evil that gibbers and
  howls in the void beyond space will have me in the end. For I
  discovered secret clauses buried in the text of the book; and
  there was much howling and grinding of teeth as I realised what
  my earlier incantations had achieved. The camel has a mind of its
  own, a subtle and demented psychosis as old as time and twice as
  huge: it is eating my brain with a tea-spoon, and I feel quite
  sick. I have become the vector for a plague out of spacetime, a
  language with embedded magic and probabilistic parsers, a
  language that is eating my soul! Even the scholars of the local
  university would be hard-pressed to conduct a successful
  exorcism. For I have been polluted; the nemesis of orthogonality,
  the beast of UNIX, has laid its claws in my heart.</p>

  <p>I cannot control myself any more. Soon I shall be entirely its
  creature, and then I shall be forced to write down the forbidden
  knowledge I have received - to write it down and publish it in an
  innocuous-looking volume, presented to the general reader so that
  they might suffer and wilt in its hideous grasp.</p>

  <p>But first I warn you! Flee while you can! Flee before the
  approach of the dread beast with one hump and no 'a' in its name,
  flee before it eats your mind as it has</p>

  <p>Oh, that's better. I feel all right now. Don't worry,
  everything is under control.</p>

  <p>There is no cause for alarm.</p>

  <p>I repeat: there is no cause for alarm.</p>
