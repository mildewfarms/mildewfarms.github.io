  The Internet is an ideal medium for disseminating information to
  masses of people. E-mail can be used to distribute information to
  the masses via mailing lists, but there's a drawback: every piece
  of mail is sent to every subscriber. If there are a thousand
  people on your mailing list, there will be a thousand separate
  copies of each message zipping around the Internet. Mailing list
  maintenance can be a hassle as well, as we all know from the
  occasional spasms of "subscribe" and "unsubscribe" messages on
  our favorite lists.

  <p>The most popular alternative to mailing lists is Usenet. By
  keeping articles in centralized repositories, Usenet avoids the
  traffic problems posed by large mailing lists. These repositories
  then exchange articles among themselves.</p>

  <p>Users can read these articles, and post new ones, by
  connecting to a Usenet server using the Network News Transfer
  Protocol (NNTP).</p>

  <p>The articles are categorized into newsgroups; each has a
  particular theme or subject. Articles can be associated with one
  or more newsgroups. There are hundreds of different newsgroups
  available. Four of the most important are devoted to Perl:</p>
  <pre>
   comp.lang.perl.misc                     
   comp.lang.perl.announce      
   comp.lang.perl.modules        
   comp.lang.perl.tk 
   
</pre>

  <p>These groups are the ideal forum to ask questions and make
  Perl-related announcements. (comp.lang.perl.announce is
  moderated, which means that all articles must be approved by the
  group's moderator.)</p>

  <p>So what can we do with these newsgroups, or others, using
  Perl?</p>

  <h3>Finding Newsgroups</h3>

  <p>To start with, we can find a list of all the newsgroups on the
  nearest news server. The code below shows how to initiate a
  connection to the news server and retrieve the list of
  newsgroups.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w      
&#13;<b>use Net::NNTP;</b> 
&#13;# most systems provide the name 'news' as an
# alias for the news server. If yours 
# doesn't, you'll need to change the following
# line to the name of your server.
&#13;$NNTPhost = 'news';            
&#13;# Create the connection
&#13;$nntp = Net::NNTP-&gt;new($NNTPhost) 
   or die "Cannot contact $NNTPhost: $!"; 
&#13;# The 'list' method returns a reference to a
# hash. The keys are the group names; the values
# are short descriptions of the groups   
&#13;$groups = <b>$nntp-&gt;list()</b> 
   or die "Cannot get group list";
&#13;print join("\n", keys %$groups), "\n";
&#13;# Always remember to quit the connection!
&#13;<b>$nntp-&gt;quit;</b>
</pre>

  <p>If you're new to Usenet, you might be wondering which
  newsgroups to read. Help is at hand; most servers support a
  command which suggests newsgroups for new readers.</p>
  <pre>
# Get a list of recommended subscriptions       
# This may fail, since not all servers support 
# this feature
&#13;       $subs = <b>$nntp-&gt;subscriptions()</b> 
   or           die "Cannot get subscription list";
&#13;# The 'subscriptions' method returns a reference
# to an array. Each element is the name of a
# recommended newsgroup         
&#13;       print join("\n", @$subs), "\n";
</pre>

  <p>Now we know what groups are available, and which are
  recommended for new readers. What else can we do? Besides write
  yet another newsreader, we can do something far more useful:
  filter out articles we don't want to see. If, like me, you don't
  have the time to read, or even browse, all the articles in your
  favorite newsgroups, you can use my News::NNTP module to write
  scripts that automatically extract articles matching criteria of
  your own design.</p>

  <h3>Retrieving Articles</h3>

  <p>Every article is assigned an article number by the news
  server. Your newsreader uses these numbers to keep track of which
  articles have been read. For example, if you use a newsreader on
  a Unix machine, you probably have a .newsrc file in your home
  directory, with lots of lines like</p>
  <pre>
   comp.lang.perl.announce: 1-435       
   comp.lang.perl.misc: 1-42997 
   comp.lang.perl.modules: 1-1342       
   comp.lang.perl.tk! 1-2263,2512
</pre>

  <p>This group information is available via a method aptly named
  <tt>group()</tt>. When passed a group name, this method sets the
  <i>current group pointer</i> (CGP) and returns information about
  the group. If no group name is given, information about the
  current group is returned.</p>

  <p>The CGP is one of two pieces of information that the NNTP
  server keeps, the other being the current article pointer (CAP).
  The CAP can be moved via three methods: <tt>last()</tt> and
  <tt>next()</tt>, which move the pointer backwards and forwards,
  and <tt>nntpstat()</tt>, which takes a single argument and sets
  the CAP.</p>

  <p>The content of an article can be retrieved with three methods
  as well: <tt>head()</tt>, which retrieves the header of the
  article; <tt>body()</tt>, which retrieves the body; and
  <tt>article()</tt>, which retrieves both.</p>

  <p>Luckily, you don't have to keep moving the CAP to retrieve
  each article. If you know the article number, you can pass it as
  an argument to <tt>head()</tt>, <tt>article()</tt>, or
  <tt>body()</tt> and the required article will be returned. This
  also sets the CAP as a side effect.</p>

  <p>The example below shows how you can set the current group and
  retrieve parts of articles.</p>
  <pre>
# Set the current group         
($count,$first,$last,$group) =          
  <b>$nntp-&gt;group</b>("comp.lang.perl.misc");         
&#13;print join("\t", $count,$first, $last, $group),
           "\n"; 
print "-" x 60, "\n";    
&#13;# Get the header of the last article   
&#13;$arr = <b>$nntp-&gt;head</b>($last);   
print @$arr if $arr;    
&#13;print "-" x 60, "\n";          
&#13;# Now get the previous article         
&#13;$nntp-&gt;last;        
$arr = <b>$nntp-&gt;body</b>;   
print @$arr      if $arr;               
&#13;print "-" x 60, "\n";          
&#13;# And finally the oldest article still available 
&#13;$arr = <b>$nntp-&gt;article</b>($first);       
print @$arr     if $arr;
</pre>

  <p>Besides setting the current group pointer and using article
  numbers, you can also retrieve articles via Message-ID strings.
  Just as with e-mail messages, each Usenet message is assigned a
  unique Message-ID, and this string can also be provided to the
  <tt>head()</tt>, <tt>body()</tt> or <tt>article()</tt> methods to
  retrieve articles. However, calling these methods with a
  Message-ID doesn't change the CAP.</p>

  <p>If you don't care about article numbers and just want to find
  the articles that have been posted since, say, yesterday, use the
  <tt>newnews()</tt> method, which returns the Message-IDs of all
  articles posted to a group (or groups) since a specified
  date.</p>

  <p>The example below shows how to retrieve all articles posted in
  the last day to comp.lang.perl.misc. It retrieves each article
  and places it into a file. But this could be extended further;
  for example, you could have the script mail these articles to you
  (see my column in <a href="../vol1_1/tpj0101-0004.html" target=
  "resource window">TPJ Vol. 1, Issue 1</a>). Here we'll assume
  that you want to write each article to a separate file.</p>
  <pre>
# Find all articles in comp.lang.perl.announce 
# posted in the last 24 hours   
&#13;$news = <b>$nntp-&gt;newnews</b>( time - 86400,
               'comp.lang.perl.misc') 
    or die "Cannot get newnews: $!";
&#13;foreach $msgid (@$news) {       
    # Get the text of the article        
    $article = <b>$nntp-&gt;article</b>($msgid) 
       or die "Cannot get '$msgid': $!";
&#13;    # Save the text in a file   
    ($file = $msgid) =~ s/[\/\$]/_/g;
&#13;    open(ARTICLE, "&gt;$file") 
       or die "Cannot open $file: $!";
&#13;    print ARTICLE @$article;    
    close(ARTICLE);     
}
</pre>

  <p>Now it's getting a little more useful. But we can take it a
  step further, scanning the headers of the articles and retrieving
  only those we might be interested in. I do this myself with the
  comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup; personally, I find that there's
  too much traffic for me to browse every article. For that purpose
  I run a script every hour which extracts articles satisfying
  particular criteria.</p>
  <pre>
# Find all articles in 'comp.lang.perl.misc'    
# that were posted in the last hour     
&#13;$news = <b>$nntp-&gt;newnews</b>( time - 3600,
                           'comp.lang.perl.misc') 
       or die "Cannot get newnews: $!";
&#13;foreach $msgid (@$news) {
&#13;    # Extract the subject line from the message        
    $subj = <b>$nntp-&gt;xhdr</b>( 'Subject', $msgid ) 
       or die "Cannot get subject: $!";
&#13;    next unless $subj =~ /CPAN/ios;
&#13;    # Get the text of the article       
    $article = <b>$nntp-&gt;article</b>($msgid) or              
       die "Cannot get '$msgid': $!";
&#13;    # Save the text in a file   
    ($file = $msgid) =~ s/[&lt;&gt;\/\$]/_/g;
&#13;    open(ARTICLE, "&gt;$file") 
       or               die "Cannot open $file: $!";
&#13;    print ARTICLE @$article;    
    close(ARTICLE);     
}
</pre>

  <p>This code wastes a little too much network bandwidth, because
  it first requests subject lines, and only later requests the
  articles. Instead of retrieving the subject lines with
  <tt>xhdr()</tt>, we could use the <tt>xpat()</tt> method, which
  makes our news server perform the pattern matching. The only
  disadvantage is that, as you might expect, <tt>xpat()</tt>'s
  pattern matching is much simpler than Perl's.</p>

  <p>The pattern matching scheme used by <tt>xpat()</tt> is called
  wildmat, which you can think of as a stripped-down version of
  regular expressions. Here's a short description:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All wildmat patterns are automatically anchored at
    beginning and end.</li>

    <li>An asterisk '*' matches any sequence of zero or more
    characters</li>

    <li>A question mark '?' matches any single character.</li>

    <li>Square brackets delimit a range, just as with Perl. A
    leading caret '^' negates the range.</li>

    <li>A backslash may be used to quote special characters.</li>

    <li>All patterns are case sensitive.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The code below is similar to the previous example, but uses
  <tt>xpat()</tt> to search for CPAN articles instead of a regular
  expression. Also, instead of using Message-IDs to reference the
  articles, we use article numbers just for kicks.</p>
  <pre>
($count,$first,$last) =         
        <b>$nntp-&gt;group</b>('comp.lang.perl.misc');
&#13; $subj = <b>$nntp-&gt;xpat</b>('Subject',
                          '*[Cc][Pp][Aa][Nn]*', 
                          [$last - 20, $last]) 
   or die "Cannot get subject lines: $!";
&#13;foreach $msgnum (keys %$subj@$news) {
&#13;    # Get the text of the article       
    $article = <b>$nntp-&gt;article</b>($msgnum) 
       or               die "Cannot get '$msgnum': $!";
&#13;    open(ARTICLE, "&gt;$msgnum") 
       or die "Cannot open $file: $!";
&#13;    print ARTICLE @$article;    
    close(ARTICLE);     
}
</pre>

  <h3>Posting Articles</h3>

  <p>If your news server and newsgroup permit, you can post
  articles as well as read them. To do this with Net::NNTP, you'll
  need to create a series of lines similar to an e-mail message,
  with a blank line separating the header from the body. In
  particular, you'll want these four fields:</p>

  <p><tt>Subject</tt> - This line should always be present, and
  should contain a concise description of your article. Subject
  lines like "Help" and "Can any gurus answer this?" aren't very
  explanatory; see Dean Roehrich's periodic comp.lang.perl.misc
  posting about good Perl Usenet etiquette.</p>

  <p><tt>From</tt> - This line should contain an e-mail address for
  people who want to contact you directly instead of posting a
  followup for everyone to see.</p>

  <p><tt>Newsgroups</tt> - This line must be present, containing a
  comma separated list of groups to which this article is being
  posted. Do not put spaces after the commas!</p>

  <p><tt>References</tt> - This line is an ordered list of
  Message-ID strings from previous articles in the thread. It is
  normally generated by the newsreader. If your article isn't a
  followup, you don't need it.</p>

  <p>The following example reads an article from a file and posts
  it to the server.</p>
  <pre>
  
# Open the file containing the new article 
open(ART, "post.art") 
   or die "Cannot read 'post.art'";             
&#13;# Post the article 
<b>$nntp-&gt;post</b>(&lt;ART&gt;) 
   or die "Could not post article: $!";          
&#13;# Close the file       
close(ART);
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>post()</tt> method is great if your article is already
  formatted and ready to see the world. But if you're constructing
  an article on the fly, you need a method that transmits your
  article line by line. That's what the <tt>datasend()</tt> method
  does. Here's an example that uses <tt>datasend()</tt> to post an
  article. It's functionally equivalent to the above program, but
  has a little more flexibility: if you wanted, you could have the
  loop perform some transformation on certain article lines as
  they're read from the filehandle.</p>
  <pre>
open(ART, "post.art") 
   or die "Cannot read 'post.art'";
&#13;$nntp-&gt;post() 
   or die "Could not post article: $!";
&#13;while(&lt;ART&gt;) {    
    <b>$nntp-&gt;datasend</b>($_);      
}
&#13;close(ART);
	
</pre>

  <p>Those of you about to write scripts with Net::NNTP should know
  that it supports a debug mode. The <tt>debug()</tt> method, when
  called with a value greater than zero, echoes all communication
  between your program and your the news server to STDERR. If you
  ever have problems with your scripts, try it before you
  panic.</p>

  <p>All examples in this article are written using my Net::NNTP
  module. Net::NNTP is distributed as part of the libnet
  distribution, and is available from any CPAN site.</p>

  <p>One final point - remember that Internet bandwidth is a finite
  resource. Please don't abuse it.</p>
