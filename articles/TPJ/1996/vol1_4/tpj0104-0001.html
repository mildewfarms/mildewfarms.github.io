  I must confess that laziness was one of my more notable
  attributes long before I discovered Perl, and as Jon can testify
  (having waited the best part of a year for this article) that
  hasn't changed. One thing to keep in mind is that this is merely
  some opinions I formed between 1986/7 (when C++ was still a slim
  new language whose C-with-Classes roots were still evident) and
  1996. In particular I can indulge in a fine display of
  hand-waving generalism from a position of very little practical
  experience; my objective here is to stir up a few inquisitive
  thoughts, not to teach object oriented programming in 21 column
  inches. <i>[Hah! Try 160. -ed.]</i>

  <p>There is, however, some "meat" in this article. Timothy Budd
  has given me permission to use the Eight <tt>Queen</tt>s problem
  and solutions presented in his book [Budd 91], which is
  recommended from time to time by Dean Roehrich on
  comp.lang.perl.misc. It appealed to me because it deals with
  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) from a philosophical
  perspective, using several languages as examples rather than
  dwelling on the features of one. This is a useful approach for
  tackling OOP in Perl, which enables you to program in an OO style
  without forcing you to.</p>

  <p>Budd uses four languages in his first edition: Object Pascal,
  C++, Objective C, and Smalltalk. The second edition of the book
  has been expanded to include Java. It's interesting to see how
  the languages approach OO and how languages like C++ and
  Objective C, which share a common base language, have taken
  different routes to OO nirvana.</p>

  <p>Budd's book is a useful resource. It has a good glossary which
  ties together some of the noodles in the soup of OO terminology,
  and a broad bibliography if you're interested in seeing just how
  old some of these "new" concepts are.</p>

  <p>Another resource is the new edition of Programming Perl [Wall
  96], which has sections on packages, objects and modules that
  expand on the documentation supplied with recent (5.002 and
  later) versions of Perl. The Perl distribution contains several
  manual pages relevant to OOP:</p>

  <p><tt>perlobj</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perl objects<br>
  <tt>perltie</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perl objects hidden behind
  simple variables<br>
  <tt>perlbot</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perl OO tricks and examples</p>

  <p>These pages assume that you're up to speed with Perl data
  structures and packages.</p>

  <p>This article aims to fill some part of the space between the
  manual pages and "real" books on OO programming and design by
  presenting a small but complete example of an object-oriented
  program. It's little more than an appetizer; as usual with things
  Perlish (and real) there's more than one way to do it, and a
  class design that seems natural and appropriate to some may seem
  outlandish and crazy to others.</p>

  <h3>(Un)Common Sense</h3>

  <p>I tend to be a little skeptical of techniques that people
  proclaim will save the software world. The only way to make sure
  that no more "bad" software is produced is for everyone to stop
  programming! Merely being object-oriented doesn't make a piece of
  software good, in spite of assertions from certain members of the
  computing community.</p>

  <p>You could say that OOP is just a collection of programming
  techniques that allow the designer and programmer to think about
  a problem in an abstract way, and that OO languages provide
  constructs supporting those techniques. Despite what some people
  seem to suggest about OOP's benefits, I have yet to see any
  evidence that it is miraculous enough to stop me going bald or
  make peeling my socks off at the end of the day any more
  pleasant.</p>

  <p>Using an OO technique to write some code is no substitute for
  thinking about the problem at hand during the design phase, no
  matter how short or informal that phase is. OO techniques might
  open up avenues that you haven't considered, or suggest new
  twists and turns in familiar paths. Or it might do nothing at
  all. Fortunately, Perl doesn't force you to write every program
  in OO style; it has all of the features but none of the
  constraints. Many factors might affect how much OO you throw at a
  project; to me, the three most important factors are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Language features. Many new languages (and a few old ones,
    such as Smalltalk) offer the syntactic and semantic constructs
    necessary for OO, which means there's probably an existing body
    of code large enough to have evolved some common idioms. It's
    possible to use OO methods in a language lacking OO features.
    It's just harder.</li>

    <li>The programmer's background. If a programmer is familiar
    with OO techniques, he can employ those techniques even in
    languages which don't directly support OO. (And conversely, a
    dyed-in-the-wool C or assembly programmer might choose to avoid
    OO features even in a language that supports them.)</li>

    <li>The environment. Programs are not created in a vacuum.
    Frequently the development tools used with a particular
    language evolve to reflect the features available in that
    language, and employ phrases and models derived from the
    language. Different OOP environments have been around for a
    while now, and if a team of programmers is familiar with, say,
    Smalltalk and its environment, they might well take a different
    approach than if the environment had been C++ or Java
    flavored.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Different OO languages were designed with different goals in
  mind, and this has a major impact on the features a language
  offers as well as the computational expense of OO techniques. In
  the introduction to their book, Ellis and Stroustrup comment:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Because C++ has been in use for large software projects,
    stability and compatibility have been important considerations
    in the development of the language; so has run-time and space
    efficiency. Time and space overheads above those for C are
    considered unacceptable for C++.
  </blockquote>

  <p>These aims led to a language quite philosophically different
  than languages like Smalltalk. The moral? Be aware that your
  favorite OO language may not be the best for the job at hand.</p>

  <h3>The Benefits of OOP</h3>

  <p>In some ways, OO facilities can be viewed as an evolutionary
  step for imperative languages. Three of the four languages in
  Budd's book are descendants of existing languages and even Java
  can be considered as a neutered and buffed up descendant of C++.
  It's a stretch, but you can think of the <tt>FILE</tt> data
  structure in C's STDIO (along with the associated routines
  provided to manipulate <tt>FILE</tt>s) as a precursor to some of
  the C based OO languages. It's not too big a stretch to envision
  STDIO implemented so that instead of:</p>
  <pre>
fprintf (fh, "format %s\n", "string");
</pre>

  <p>you used</p>
  <pre>
fh.fprintf ("format %s\n", "string");
</pre>

  <p>in a C-with-Classes-like language.</p>

  <p>Once you start "thinking OO" you'll be able to see how the
  features available to you in a particular language might be used
  to help you develop software whether that language be Perl, Java,
  or Visual Cobol++, much like an understanding of regular
  expressions allows you to use the various regex tools to their
  greatest potential.</p>

  <p>So, how can you "think OO?" Budd identifies three perspectives
  as particularly important:</p>

  <p><b>It's a way of viewing the world.</b> The objects in the
  program can be used in a way that makes computation act as a
  simulation of the real world (or whatever real world programmers
  inhabit.) Objects describe the behavior of the thing being
  simulated, and instances of objects (that is, particular
  lower-case-o objects that you create, as opposed to the Object
  definition itself) maintain their state. Objects exhibit behavior
  when you prod them; in some languages the prod might look like a
  function call, and in others it might be a message passed to the
  object.</p>

  <p><b>It's a way of dealing with complexity.</b> OOP offers the
  programmer another way to abstract information. An object can be
  a descendant of another object, with differences in behavior and
  state, or it can simply contain entirely separate objects. In
  either case, the object need only contain the code distinguishing
  it from the other objects; the shared code can be delegated to
  other objects.</p>

  <p><b>It's a way of writing reusable software.</b> Since objects
  can have well-defined interfaces (read: acceptable ways to prod
  them and what to expect them to do when prodded) and are
  responsible for implementing those behaviors, people can write
  code without having to know what's under the hood. That way, when
  you inevitably change the internal workings of your object, the
  people using your objects never even have to know.</p>

  <h3>Responsibility</h3>

  <h4>(What's that?)</h4>

  <p>There are several levels at which the word "responsibility"
  can be bandied about. I'll look at the human side of
  responsibility first. One of Perl's strengths is the way modules
  and blessed references have made the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl
  Archive Network) possible; many modules depend on other modules.
  The tacit assumption that objects will behave properly has
  encouraged authors to use one another's code, because they trust
  that objects won't pull any surprises on them.</p>

  <p>Some languages enforce policies which make it even easier to
  reap these benefits. Perl just provides the mechanisms to let you
  develop OO code - it's your responsibility to choose whether your
  code makes use of the "unpublished" details of an implementation
  (say, for speed reasons) or adheres to the published interface.
  And it's the responsibility of the object creator to make sure
  that the definitions are clear and unambiguous, and to specify
  exactly what state and behaviors are accessible via the
  interface. A well designed object (or class of objects)
  discourages people from circumventing its interface, and suggests
  ways in which the interface can be used to extend its
  capabilities. It takes a good designer to pull this off, but it's
  an important skill.</p>

  <p>Budd describes a technique he calls "Responsibility-Driven
  Design" to discover classes which can be used to model a
  situation. He suggests using physical index cards to define
  responsibilities and classes. The limited space on an index card
  means that a class design which embodies too much complexity is
  easy to spot; if you can't describe it in a 3"x5" space, your
  object is attempting too much. In some situations the division of
  a system into classes, objects, and responsibilities may be
  obvious. But it's not always, and Budd's index card system seems
  like a reasonable method for determining whether your division is
  appropriate. Personally, I've never had to model anything overly
  complex, and recently I haven't even collaborated with others on
  a design, so I can't attest to how well Budd's system works with
  Perl.</p>

  <h3>Eight Queens in Perl</h3>

  <p>Once again my laziness steps in to save me as I present an
  example from Budd's book - the Eight Queens problem. On an
  chessboard (an 8x8 grid), a Queen can attack anything in the same
  row, column, or diagonal. The problem is this: how can you place
  eight Queens on a chessboard such that no Queen can attack
  another? Consider the chessboard below. It has four Queens; no
  two are in the same row, column, or diagonal; if you can place
  four <i>more</i> Queens on the chessboard and still satisfy that
  condition, you'll have solved the Eight Queens problem. Try
  it!</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/4queens.gif" align="center"
  alt="Figure 1: Board with 4 Queens" border="0" width="300"
  height="277"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> Board with 4
  Queens</font></p>

  <h4>Overview of the Solution</h4>

  <p>I selected the 8 Queens problem because Budd presents full
  solutions in his book for Smalltalk, C++, and Objective C. My
  Perl solution is derived from the Objective C version, which
  seems to be reasonably object-oriented without being too removed
  from a plain jane solution using linked lists and global
  functions. Budd's solution resembles a conventional generate and
  test approach, but the important behaviors have been encapsulated
  in an object.</p>

  <p>In Budd's implementation, each <tt>Queen</tt> communicates
  with exactly one of her neighbors. As each <tt>Queen</tt> is
  created, it's initialized with a position, and then the resulting
  setup is checked to see whether it's a valid solution. A
  <tt>Queen</tt> does this by asking its left-hand neighbor, "Can I
  be attacked?" If so, it generates the next position and test
  that, repeating until a safe position is generated, at which
  point the <tt>Queen</tt> replies with an "OK."</p>

  <h4>A CRC Card for a Queen</h4>

  <p>Budd's calls his index cards "CRC cards", for Class,
  Responsibilities, and Collaborators. It's all part of his
  philosophy of responsibility-driven design, and he touts them
  early on in his book. Part of the rationale is that if you can't
  describe the class on a 3" x 5" index card, it's too complex.</p>

  <p>The front of a CRC card defines the interface to the object;
  the back describes the data values used to maintain its state.
  The front and back of our <tt>Queen</tt> CRC card are shown
  here:</p>

  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <center>
          <b>Queen</b>
        </center>

        <p><b>first</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initialize
        row, then find first acceptable solution for self and
        neighbors</p>

        <p><b>next</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advance row and
        find next acceptable solution</p>

        <p><b>canAttack</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see
        whether a position can be attacked by self or neighbors</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <center>
          <b>Queen - data values</b>
        </center>

        <p><b>row</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current row
        number (changes)</p>

        <p><b>column</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column number
        (fixed)</p>

        <p><b>neighbor</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbor to
        left (fixed)</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Our answer masquerades as a <tt>Queen</tt> in the 9th column,
  just off the board. To deal with the 0th column, we use a special
  class of <tt>Queen</tt>, a <tt>Queen::Null</tt>, which is a
  simple <tt>Queen</tt> with degenerate responses. In addition to
  the responsibilities outlined on the front of our CRC card,
  there's a <tt>print()</tt> responsibility, which prints out its
  row and column information after asking its neighbors to do the
  same.</p>

  <h3>The Main Program</h3>

  <p>Without further ado, here's the entire program. If it looks
  too small, that's because the tricky behaviors are hidden inside
  the <tt>Queen</tt> and <tt>Queen::Null classes</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
&#13;  use strict;
&#13;  require Queen; 
  require Queen::Null;
&#13;  my $lastQueen; 
  my $column; 
  my $neighbor = new Queen::Null;
&#13;  foreach $column (1 .. 8) { 
      $lastQueen = new Queen; 
      $lastQueen-&gt;initialColumn                  
	               ($column, $neighbor); 
      $neighbor = $lastQueen; 
  }
&#13;  $last Queen-&gt;first() and 
                  $lastQueen-&gt;print();
</pre>

  <p>The code first generates the special <tt>Queen::Null</tt>
  object (new <tt>Queen::Null</tt>). Next, the <tt>Queen</tt>
  objects are instantiated (with <tt>new()</tt>) and then
  initialized (with <tt>initialColumn()</tt>), so that they know
  which column they inhabit and who their neighbors are. It would
  have been quite easy to combine instantiation and initialization
  into the <tt>new()</tt> routine, and in some applications this
  might make sense. But in other applications one might want to
  reinitialize without having to reinstantiate: that is, to go back
  to square one without having to create the square itself from
  scratch.</p>

  <p>After <tt>new()</tt> and <tt>initialColumn()</tt> are used to
  instantiate and initialize the chessboard, the rightmost
  <tt>Queen</tt> is prodded, triggering a flurry of communication
  until a valid solution is found. At that point the rightmost
  <tt>Queen</tt> is prodded in a different way, using the
  <tt>print()</tt> method, to print the solution.</p>

  <p>Note that <tt>Queen::Null</tt> has no initializiation method,
  and that it's derived from the <tt>Queen</tt> class. (Actually,
  you can't infer the class relationship from the names alone: the
  mere fact that <tt>Queen</tt> and <tt>Queen::Null</tt> have
  similar names doesn't necessarily imply a semantic linkage.)
  Since <tt>Queen</tt>'s <tt>new()</tt> uses no arguments, we now
  know that <tt>Queen::Null</tt>'s new also requires no arguments;
  since one inherits from the other, the two <tt>new()</tt>s are
  one and the same. Think about that - if the <tt>Queen</tt> class
  had rolled initialization into its <tt>new()</tt> method, then it
  might be necessary to override it for <tt>Queen::Null</tt> in a
  language with stronger typing than Perl. As usual with Perl,
  there's more than one way to do it...</p>

  <p>The output from the above code: <a href=
  "tpj0104-0001a.html">Main Program Output</a>.</p>

  <h3>The Queen::Null Class</h3>

  <p>The first object generated in the program is the special
  <tt>Queen::Null</tt> which is used to guard the 0th column. All
  it does is supply methods that let the <tt>Queen</tt> in the 1st
  column behave sensibly. As a subclass of <tt>Queen</tt>, it
  implements the methods on the front of the <tt>Queen</tt> CRC
  card: (plus that pesky <tt>print()</tt>.) Here it is:</p>
  <pre>
   package Queen::Null;
&#13;   @ISA = qw(Queen);
&#13;   sub canAttack {return 0;} 
   sub first {return 1;} 
   sub next {return 0;} 
   sub print {return;}
&#13;   1;
</pre>

  <p>You can see that <tt>Queen::Null</tt> implements pretty simple
  behavior for its responsibilities - the null <tt>Queen</tt> can't
  attack anything, and first() always succeeds. If <tt>next()</tt>
  is invoked, then we know we're out of possible positions, so it
  fails. <tt>print()</tt> is a no-op.</p>

  <p>Note that having this special behavior in a
  <tt>Queen::Null</tt> object lets us avoid having lots of special
  cases in the "real" <tt>Queen</tt> class, described next.</p>

  <h3>The Queen Class</h3>

  <p>The <tt>Queen</tt> class is the real "meat" of the program -
  it's here that methods which store the state of each
  <tt>Queen</tt> and implement its behavior are defined.</p>

  <p>The <tt>new()</tt> and <tt>initialColumn()</tt> methods handle
  instantiation and initializiation. As with many Perl classes, the
  <tt>new()</tt> constructor returns a blessed reference to an
  anonymous hash. That hash is then used to store instance
  variables.</p>
  <pre>
sub new { 
    my $type = shift; 
    return bless {}, $type; 
}
&#13;sub initialColumn { 
    my $self = shift; 
    $self-&gt;{column} = shift; 
    $self-&gt;{neighbor} = shift;
    return; 
}
</pre>

  <p>Note that <tt>initialColumn()</tt> initializes <i>only</i>
  those variables described as "fixed" on the back of the CRC
  card.</p>

  <p><tt>first()</tt>, shown on the next page, initializes the
  <tt>row</tt> (which varies, unlike the column), and asks its
  neighbor Queen for a legal position. Then it employs the
  <tt>testOrAdvance()</tt> method to determine whether the current
  position is legal or if it can find a legal position by asking
  its neighbor to shuffle around a bit. That may cause the neighbor
  to shuffle about by talking to <i>its</i> neighbor, and so on. As
  usual, 1 means success and 0 means failure.</p>

  <p>The method <tt>testOrAdvance()</tt> wasn't mentioned on the
  <tt>Queen</tt> CRC card, and isn't part of the public interface.
  Some languages have ways of specifying exactly how private or
  public a method is. But in Perl, it's the designer's
  responsibility to document the interface, and the programmer's
  responsibility to obey. As its name suggests,
  <tt>testOrAdvance()</tt> checks to see if its position is
  threatened by neighbors. If it's safe, it returns a true value.
  Otherwise, it tries to find the next legal position.</p>

  <p><tt>canAttack()</tt> is used to ask whether a neighbor (or any
  of <i>its</i> neighbors) can attack a particular square on the
  board. The design is such that it's not necessary to check
  whether there's another <tt>Queen</tt> in a given column, since
  the <tt>foreach</tt> loop in our main program iterates across
  columns. So we only need to check the rows and the diagonals.</p>

  <p>The <tt>next()</tt> method contains some key information: how
  many rows there are on the chessboard, and what to do when she
  needs to wrap around from bottom to top in its search for the
  next safe square. <tt>next()</tt> returns 1 if it can find a
  legal next position, and 0 if it can't. Note that both
  <tt>next()</tt> and <tt>testOrAdvance()</tt> employ recursion; as
  <tt>next()</tt> is mentioned on the CRC card, the public might
  stumble into it. That's why we turn off Perl's $^W variable - so
  that the normally desirable warning about deep recursion (which
  we perform intentionally) will never reach the user.</p>

  <p>Lastly, there's the <tt>print()</tt> method that we added to
  the Budd's published interface on the CRC card. There's nothing
  particularly inspiring about <tt>print()</tt>, and in fact my
  code on the TPJ web site avoids this method entirely, settling
  instead for a foreach loop appended to the main program that
  iterates through all of the <tt>Queen</tt>s and display the row
  and column information with Perl's regular <tt>print()</tt>
  function.</p>

  <h3>Wrapping Up</h3>

  <p>Here's the solution generated by my code:</p>
  <pre>
row: 1 column: 1 
row: 5 column: 2 
row: 8 column: 3 
row: 6 column: 4 
row: 3 column: 5 
row: 7 column: 6 
row: 2 column: 7 
row: 4 column: 8
</pre>

  <p>which corresponds to this chessboard:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/8queens.gif" align="center"
  alt="Figure 2: Board with 8 Queens" border="0" width="300"
  height="316"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2:</b> Board with 8
  Queens</font></p>

  <p>The OO style I've shown here isn't too distant from the non-OO
  solution a C or Perl programmer might write. There's nothing
  magic about object-oriented programming, and I hope that this
  simple example will whet your appetite for exploring more about
  OO methodology.</p>

  <p>Budd's book is a well-rounded survey of the OO landscape, and
  Budd doesn't have an axe to grind in favor of any particular
  language. The exercises from the relevant chapter in Budd's book
  might be interesting and instructive, as might looking at the
  solutions he presents in other languages.</p>

  <h4>Exercises</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>Modify any one of the programs to produce all possible
    solutions, rather than just a single solution. How many
    possible solutions are there for the Eight <tt>Queen</tt>s
    puzzle? How many of these are rotations of other solutions? How
    might you filter out rotations?</li>

    <li>Suppose we generalize the Eight <tt>Queen</tt>s problem to
    the N Queens problem, where the task is to place N Queens on an
    N x N chessboard. How should the programs be changed? It's
    clear that some values of N prohibit solutions; consider N = 2
    or N = 3. What happens when your program is executed for these
    values? How might you produce more meaningful output?</li>

    <li>Using whatever graphics facilities your system has, alter
    one of the programs to display dynamically on a chessboard the
    positions of each Queen as the program advances. What portions
    of the program need to know about the display?</li>
  </ol>
