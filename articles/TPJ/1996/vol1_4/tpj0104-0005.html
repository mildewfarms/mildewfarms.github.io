  These modules, and hundreds of others, are all available on the
  Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, or CPAN. Choose a site near
  you from the list at right.

  <h3>CPAN</h3>

  <p>Or, use Andreas K&ouml;nig's CPAN module to retrieve, build,
  and install any of the CPAN modules automatically. It's useful
  for upgrading current modules as well as installing new ones.</p>

  <h3>Make</h3>

  <p>A not-so-new module by Nick Ing-Simmons that implements the
  Unix make command in Perl. It can be used to parse Makefiles.</p>

  <h3>NNML::Server</h3>

  <p>The NNML::Server module, by Ulrich Pfeifer, implements a
  minimal NNTP (a.k.a. Usenet or Netnews) server.</p>

  <h3>Net::SSLeay</h3>

  <p>Sampo Kellomaki's Net::SSLeay module provides a Perl interface
  to Eric Young's implementation of the Secure Socket Layer.</p>

  <h3>PDL</h3>

  <p>PDL is the Perl Data Language, an extension for compact
  storage and speedy manipulation of large N-dimensional data sets
  such as images or movies. It's in late alpha, and development
  (mostly by Karl Glazebrook and Tuomas Lukka) is ongoing.
  Subscribe to perldl-request@jach.hawaii.edu for more
  information.</p>

  <h3>Tie::Watch</h3>

  <p>Steve Lidie's Tie::Watch module lets you place a "watchpoint"
  on any Perl variable. The watchpoint is a subroutine invoked
  whenever the variable is accessed.</p>

  <h3>VRML</h3>

  <p>The Virtual Reality Modeling Language is like HTML, but
  describes scenes instead of documents. When you visit a URL
  containing a VRML world, a file is downloaded to your computer. A
  VRML-enabled browser then interprets the file as a geometric
  description of a VRML world, letting you interact with it in real
  time. There's VRML 1.0 and VRML 2.0; Hartmut Palm's module
  provides Perl methods for both.</p>

  <h3>WWW::Search</h3>

  <p>A collection of Perl modules that know how to talk to certain
  WWW search engines: AltaVista, Lycos, and HotBot. WWW::Search
  requires LWP, which you should already have if you're a serious
  Web hacker. If not, see the next page!</p>
