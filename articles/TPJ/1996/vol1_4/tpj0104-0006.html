  In previous columns I've focused on the Web from the server's
  point of view. We've talked about how the CGI protocol works, how
  to write server scripts, and how to maintain long-running
  transactions across the Web. But what about the client side of
  the story? Does Perl offer any support for those of us who wish
  to write our own Web-creeping robots, remote syntax verifiers,
  database accessors, or even full-fledged graphical browsers?
  Naturally it does, and the name of this support is LWP.

  <p>LWP (Library for WWW access in Perl), is a collection of
  modules written by Martijn Koster and Gisle Aas. It derives in
  part from the Perl 4 libwww-perl library created by Roy Fielding.
  To understand what LWP can do, consider the tasks your average
  Web browser is called upon to perform:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>read and parse a URL</li>

    <li>connect to a remote server using the protocol appropriate
    for the URL (e.g. HTTP, GOPHER, FTP)</li>

    <li>negotiate with the server for the requested document,
    providing authentication when necessary</li>

    <li>interpret the retrieved document's headers</li>

    <li>parse and display the document's HTML content</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The LWP library provides support for all of the tasks listed
  above, and several others, including handling proxy servers. In
  its simplest form, you can use LWP to fetch remote URLs from
  within a Perl script. With more effort, you can write an entirely
  Perl-based Web browser. In fact, the Perl/Tk library comes
  complete with a crude but functional graphical browser based on
  LWP.</p>

  <p>The LWP modules are divided along the following
  categories:</p>
  <pre>
URI::*              URL creation and parsing
HTML::*             HTML creation, parsing and formatting
HTTP::*             The HTTP protocol 
LWP::UserAgent      Object-oriented interface to the library    
LWP::Simple         Procedural interface to the library 
LWP::Protocol::*    Interfaces to various protocols
</pre>

  <p>To illustrate what you can do with LWP, I've written a Perl
  script, <a href="tpj0104-0006a.html">get_weather</a>, that
  fetches and prints the current weather report. You could run this
  script from an hourly cron job and incorporate the result into an
  HTML page, or use it to produce the text for a scrolling marquee
  applet (and produce a special effect that does something useful
  for a change!).</p>

  <p>The US National Oceanographic and Atmospherics Service (NOAA)
  runs a series of Web servers that provide constantly updated
  weather reports and weather maps. Its servers were designed for
  human interactive use using fill-out forms; by changing the form,
  you can select among the cities that the NOAA monitors, and
  choose among a variety of text and graphical reports. By
  reverse-engineering its forms, I was able to determine that you
  can obtain a basic weather report by passing the CGI script</p>

  <p>http://www.nnic.noaa.gov/CGI-bin/netcast.do-it</p>

  <p>a query string that looks like this (all one line):</p>
  <pre>
state=&lt;state&gt;&amp;city=on&amp;area=Local+Forecast&amp;match=Strong+Match&amp;html=text+only+format
</pre>

  <p>Everything in the string is constant except for the
  &lt;state&gt; parameter, which despite its name should be one of
  NOAA's three-letter city abbreviations (e.g. "BOS" for Boston,
  "NYC" for New York City; you can learn the list of abbreviations
  by browsing NOAA's site.) When you fetch this URL you'll receive
  a short HTML page that contains the weather report plus a few
  graphics and links to NOAA's other pages.</p>

  <p>Further down the page you'll see the code for <a href=
  "tpj0104-0006a.html">get_weather</a>, which fetches the current
  weather report from the NOAA server. You invoke it from the
  command line with the city code as its argument (default "BOS").
  An example of the script's <a href=
  "tpj0104-0006b.html">output</a> is shown further below.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the LWP library, the code is very straightforward.
  Lines 04-06 load the components of the LWP library that we need.
  In addition to the LWP::UserAgent module, which provides
  URL-fetching functionality, we import routines from the
  HTML::Parse and HTML::FormatText modules. The first provides the
  ability to create a parse tree from HTML text, and the second
  turns the parse tree into pretty-printed text.</p>

  <p>Lines 08-11 set up various globals for the script. The city is
  read from the command line, and globals for the server URL and
  its CGI parameters are defined.</p>

  <p>The interesting part begins in lines 13-17, where we connect
  to the NOAA server, send the query, and retrieve the result.
  First we create a LWP::UserAgent object, which is essentially a
  virtual browser. Next we create an HTTP::Request object to hold
  information about the URL we're requesting. We initialize the
  request object with the string 'GET' to indicate we want to make
  a GET request, and with the URL we want to fetch. The actual
  connection and data transfer occurs in line 15, where we invoke
  the UserAgent's <tt>request()</tt> method and receive an
  HTTP::Response object as the result. Lastly we check the
  transaction's result code by calling the response object's
  <tt>isSuccess()</tt> method and die with an informative error
  message if there was a problem.</p>

  <p>We now have an HTTP::Response object in hand. It contains the
  HTTP status code, the various MIME headers that are transmitted
  along with the document, and the document itself. In lines 19-24
  we extract the document, reformat it, and print it out. First we
  extract the HTML document using the response object's
  <tt>content()</tt> method, and immediately pass its result to the
  <tt>parse_html()</tt> function. Next we create a new HTML
  formatter object. LWP provides several types of formatters,
  including one that generates PostScript, but we're interested in
  HTML::FormatText, which creates pretty-printed ASCII text. We
  then pass the parse tree to the formatter's <tt>format()</tt>
  method, effectively stripping all HTML tags from the text and
  returning HTML entity codes to their original characters.</p>

  <p>The script isn't quite done, however, because the
  pretty-printed page still contains cruft such as the links to
  NOAA's home page that we don't want in the final output. The last
  part of the script splits the pretty-printed text into an array
  of lines and extracts all the text between the two rows of
  hyphens that NOAA uses to delimit the weather report.</p>

  <p>This example only gives a taste of what you can do with LWP.
  The LWP library distribution is itself a good source for ideas.
  Among the sample application programs that accompany it is a Web
  mirror application that can be used to replicate a tree of Web
  pages, updating the local copies only if they are out of date
  with respect to the remote ones. Other parts of the library
  include the basic components required to write your own web
  crawling robots. LWP is distributed under the Perl Artistic
  License and can be downloaded from any CPAN archive.</p>
