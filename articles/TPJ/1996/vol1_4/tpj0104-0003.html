The Perl Purity Test Version 1.04, October 16, 1996 
Written by Jeff Okamoto (okamoto\@corp.hp.com) 
With Help from Tom Christiansen (tchrist\@convex.com) 
Other Suggestions from Christopher Davis (ckd\@eff.org)
</pre>

  <p><b>This is similar to other Purity Tests, of which perhaps the
  most famous is the Unisex, Omnisexual Purity Test that can be
  found in soc.singles.</b></p>

  <p><b>Additions are welcome. Please send them to
  okamoto\@corp.hp.com.</b></p>

  <p><b>Answer each question with a "yes" or "no". The program will
  keep track of your answers and at the end, tell you your Perl
  Purity Percentage, and also a description of what kind of Perl
  person you are.</b></p>

There are $howmany questions in this version.
