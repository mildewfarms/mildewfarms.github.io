  <h2 align="center">The Advantages of Perl - A Corporate
  View</h2>Perl is growing. The number of Perl programmers
  worldwide has passed the 300,000 mark and is growing at a rate in
  excess of 10,000 per month - there's a new Perl programmer every
  five minutes! If we assume at least some (and more likely lots)
  of these folks work in corporations, it begs some questions: why
  are so many programmers turning to Perl? And what are the
  advantages of Perl from a corporate view?

  <p>Looking at Perl as one choice from a spectrum of languages, we
  can immediately enumerate several benefits of Perl. Some of these
  advantages can be assigned a dollar value. Other, less tangible,
  benefits are difficult to quantify. They simply add to the
  enjoyment of life. Let's look at the advantages of Perl:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It's free. Perl is available with a free license for both
    commercial and non-commercial purposes. This amounts to a
    savings of $500 or more initially, plus $100 to $200 per year
    in upgrades per workstation.</li>

    <li>Free technical support. The Perl community has advanced
    this far because it takes care of itself - equal to a savings
    of as much as $1800 per programmer year.</li>

    <li>Script writing efficiency. Conservative estimates rank Perl
    as a third faster than most other languages for script writing.
    Let's assume that a programmer who makes $40,000 per year and
    spends 1/3 of his time writing scripts were to use Perl. The
    result would be an added $4,400 annually to the corporate
    bottom line. This benefit expands when you consider that it's
    often said (less conservatively) that two hours of script
    writing in Perl can produce the equivalent of a week of
    scripting in many other languages. The savings skyrocket.</li>

    <li>Perl utilities. There are over 200 modules and other
    utilities available on the CPAN, and the number is increasing
    by an average of two per week. By using (and reusing) these
    modules, programmers can save weeks.</li>

    <li>Reliability and security. Perl is easier to debug than
    other languages. And when properly written, it's more secure
    too. It's difficult to put a dollar value on security, and for
    most of us it's not likely to be an issue. But there are times
    and places where the increased reliability and security factor
    may prove invaluable.</li>

    <li>Perl is fun. Perl adds humor to programming - a great
    buffer against burnout.</li>

    <li>Perl offers creative options. Perl allows the same end
    result to be achieved by a variety of routes, rather than one
    way only. Programmers are creative human beings. The value of
    incorporating creativity within work is immeasurable.</li>

    <li>Perl is flexible. Changes are incorporated into the
    language quickly, usually within 30 days. Making changes in
    most other languages frequently requires filtering through
    standards committees. That takes years.</li>

    <li>Documentation. There are more than 15 Perl books currently
    in print, several scheduled to come off the presses during the
    next few months, and a dozen more being written.</li>

    <li>Training. Perl can be learned quickly. Anyone familiar with
    programming should be generating reasonably complex scripts
    within a few days. Perl trainings are becoming readily
    available, and one is currently available on the Internet at:
    www.mcp.com/waite/ezone/.</li>

    <li>Number of applications. Perl has been used in a number of
    major applications. Most of the interactive sites on the web
    use Perl to drive search engines and interactive forms. The
    number of applications is growing every day because of the
    amount of interest in the language and because Perl does some
    things that other language doesn't do very well such as string
    handling, advanced pattern checking, and object oriented
    programming.</li>

    <li>Availability. Thanks to a unique group of Perl hackers,
    Perl has been ported to most of the major operating systems
    currently in use. There are more than 20 publicly available
    mirror archive sites around the world for everything you would
    want to know about Perl including modules, text files, ports of
    Perl to the various major operating systems (and a number of
    min= or ones), source code, and example programs.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Given all of the above, it's clear that corporations reap
  significant economic benefits when Perl is used. Many of these
  benefits can be assigned a specific dollar value - money and time
  saved, increased productivity, morale, etc. It follows that
  corporations protect their interest in maintaining the robust
  health of Perl. I respectfully suggest that continued corporate
  investment in Perl is well justified. The long term prospects for
  Perl are bright; it'll be around for quite some time.</p>

  <h3>A Community Responds to Chaos</h3>

  <p>All freeware brings with it a potential liability in the
  market place: there are no funds to pay people to provide
  technical support, maintain a web site, index archives etc. This
  void is filled by volunteers, people who are willing to
  generously contribute their time to provide what is wanted and
  needed by others. Members of the freeware community have proven
  very generous in this respect.</p>

  <p>This volunteer system works well when there is a broad base of
  people over which to spread the volunteer work load, i.e. when
  enough people are using it to generate enough volunteers.
  Unfortunately, freeware has an inherent Catch-22. The more widely
  it's used, the more demand there is for support services. The
  demands on volunteers eventually increases to the point where the
  system becomes overtaxed. This is when chaos arises.</p>

  <p>Perl has grown not just in number of users, but in the scope
  of its applications. Even Larry Wall has been heard to say on
  occasion, with a smile on his face: "Oh, I didn't know Perl could
  do that!" Demand for support has also increased dramatically.
  This has brought with it the need to take a look at ways to deal
  with incipient chaos. When considering this situation and looking
  at the alternatives earlier this year, it was clear that two of
  the most frequent solutions would not be acceptable to the Perl
  community: (1) do nothing and sink into chaos or (2) have a
  commercial organization take over. Another alternative was more
  appealing - band together and form a non-profit run by and for
  the Perl community. Thus was born The Perl Institute. Our goals
  are:</p>

  <p><b>To help keep Perl useful</b>, by matching projects to
  people, staying ahead of the technical curve and providing
  centralized information to a decentralized community.</p>

  <p><b>To help keep Perl available</b>, by guaranteeing
  development continuity, providing an interface between the
  commercial and freeware communities and promoting Perl's
  strengths to potential Perl programmers.</p>

  <p><b>To help keep Perl free</b>, by supporting the existing
  volunteer efforts, matching people to projects and interfacing
  between the freeware and commercial communities.</p>

  <p>TPI acts as a coordination center for Perl - connecting Perl
  users, information, and resources. It also serves as an
  administrative support center. When you join TPI, you become a
  partner, contributing money, ideas, time, and expertise.</p>

  <p>The Institute uses its funds to cover basic operating expenses
  and to advance projects. During the startup stage, TPI is heavily
  dependent on support from the community; we can succeed only to
  the extent that resources allow.</p>

  <h3>A Good Deal Just Got Better</h3>

  <p>Perl Institute partners and TPJ subscribers can now get 30%
  off on books ordered through The Perl Store. We also offer a 20%
  discount on any and all books published by Macmillan, the world's
  largest publishers of technical books. And you can take an
  additional 10% off on orders of $100 or more.</p>

  <p>This offer includes all books by QUE, New Riders, SAMS, Hayden
  Books, Brady Games, Ziff-Davis Press, Waite Group Press, Borland
  Press, and Adobe Press! This offer applies to all Macmillan
  Publishing books, not just their Perl books or their computer
  books.</p>

  <p>The Perl Institute is looking for other ways to save you
  money. We'd like to know what else you'd like to see in the
  Store. If it's something needed by many members of the Perl
  community, we can resell it at a discount to you! Contact us at
  discounts@perl.org.</p>

  <p>If you're not yet a member of The Perl Institute, you can
  still get 10% off on all books, and an additional 10% off orders
  greater than $100. Plus, for a limited time, if you join the
  Institute and place a book order at the same time, we'll send you
  a free Perl Institute T-shirt (a $20 value) at no charge.</p>
