  <h4><i>Jon Orwant</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  One of the most common questions on comp.lang.perl.misc is "How
  come my random numbers aren't random?" Usually, a simple answer
  involving <tt>srand()</tt> is sufficient. But the simplicity of
  these answers belies just how hard it is to have a computer
  generate good random numbers.

  <p>In fact, it's downright <i>impossible</i> to generate
  completely random numbers. We live in a determinist universe,
  there's no free will, and those of you muttering about quantum
  uncertainty and souls should go back to your Penrose - tiled
  holes in the sand.</p>

  <p>Anyway, while no source provides completely random numbers,
  some sources are more random than others. The PGP encryption
  package, for instance, has you type aimlessly at your keyboard,
  using the intervals between keystrokes as a source of random
  numbers. It measures tiny time differences, making it a good
  source of random numbers unless you possess a truly robotic sense
  of rhythym, in which case you probably have career options that
  don't involve the use of contraband cryptosystems.</p>

  <p>The measurement of keystrokes is slow and intrusive, so some
  computers rely on rapidly changing areas of computer memory for
  their random numbers, or network packet arrival times. Others
  amplify ambient noise collected from disconnected audio or video
  inputs. Still others calculate disk seek times; minute variations
  in speed are caused by air turbulence, which is pretty hard to
  predict.</p>

  <p>Computers that take their randomness seriously have physical
  hardware dedicated to random number generation: unstable free -
  running oscillators, a source of radioactive decay, or thermal
  noise from an amplified diode. That's about as random as you can
  get.</p>

  <p>But the vast majority of computers generate random numbers the
  same way. They're more properly called <i>pseudorandom</i>
  numbers, because if you know what number the computer just
  picked, you can predict the next number.</p>

  <p>This is why Las Vegas Mafia thugs break your kneecaps if you
  try to pry open a slot machine. All modern slot machines first
  determine what your payoff will be using a pseudorandom number
  generator, and <i>then</i> spin the wheels so that the
  appropriate fruits appear. That way, wear and tear on the moving
  parts of a slot machine won't affect the payoffs. (Casino slot
  machines are networked in a LAN of sorts; that's how million
  dollar progressive jackpots are possible. The Bally slot machines
  in Vegas are even in a WAN connecting many different casinos;
  that's how they can offer an $11 million jackpot. But I
  digress.)</p>

  <h3>Congruential Generators</h3>

  <p>Many computers use <i>linear congruential generators</i> to
  create random numbers. It's a lousy method. There are plenty of
  better ones, but they're slower, which accounts for the near -
  universality of this lame scheme, which works as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Take the last random number.</li>

    <li>Multiply it by something.</li>

    <li>Add something else.</li>

    <li>Take the remainder when you divide by something else.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>That's all there is to it. Expressed as an equation,</p>
  <pre>
nj+1 = anj + b (mod c)
</pre>

  <p>where <tt>nj+1</tt> is the new random number, nj is the last
  random number, and <tt>a, b</tt>, and <tt>c</tt> are all positive
  integers specific to a particular generator.</p>

  <p>So if every random number is determined by the previous random
  number, where's the <i>first</i> random number come from? You.
  It's called the <i>seed</i> of the random number generator, and
  you provide it to Perl (and C) with the <tt>srand()</tt>
  function. This is why we see all those questions on
  comp.lang.perl.misc: people don't realize that without seeding
  their generators, they'll get the same sequence of random numbers
  each time. Less often, you see people who know that they're
  supposed to use <tt>srand()</tt>, but they aren't quite sure what
  it does, so they use it as often as possible, with disastrous
  (but predictable!) results.</p>

  <h3>Choosing the seed</h3>

  <p>Astute readers will notice that linear congruential generators
  produce only integers. And sure enough, if you use
  <tt>rand()</tt> in a C program, you'll get integers. But Perl's
  <tt>rand()</tt>, like Perl itself, is a little quirky and a
  little more useful: it divides the integer by the system constant
  RAND_MAX, yielding a fraction between 0 and 1. On systems which
  use these generators, RAND_MAX will simply be <tt>c - 1</tt>.</p>

  <p>Linear congruential generators can be cracked, yielding the
  values of <tt>a, b</tt>, and <tt>c</tt>, with only moderate
  difficulty. There's a complete scheme in [Krawczyk]; to give you
  a taste (and part I of this issue's contest), I've created an
  imaginary generator by choosing an a, b, and c. Your task is to
  deduce their values. I'll give you four pairs of numbers, each
  containing a seed fed to <tt>srand()</tt> and the result from
  <tt>rand()</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
seed    result of rand()
1           26
2            3
3           12
4           21
</pre>

  <p>I picked this generator out of thin air. Real computers
  wouldn't use such simple generators, of course, but I got a
  little lucky: my generator happens to be <i>maximal - length</i>,
  which means that it will only repeat itself after c calls to
  <tt>rand()</tt>. Had I picked bad values for <tt>a, b</tt>, and
  <tt>c</tt>, the result would have been a generator that repeats
  much more quickly. This is a recurring problem.</p>

  <p>The ANSI C committee hasn't been much help, either. They
  published a mediocre generator ( <i>a</i> = 1103515245, <i>b</i>
  = 12345, and <i>c</i> = 32768) that was meant to demonstrate how
  pseudorandom number generation might be implemented. As [Press]
  points out, the ANSI generator was meant only to be an example.
  But sure enough, many major operating systems, even today, use it
  as their <tt>rand()</tt>. Run the program below to see if your
  computer falls victim to the ANSI plague.</p>

  <p>The c = 32768 is especially troubling, since it means that
  your computer will repeat itself after 32768 calls to
  <tt>rand()</tt>. Many years ago, when developing an image
  processing application, I noticed that my 512x512 image had a
  discernible pattern repeated every eight lines. The reason? When
  I added a little white noise to the image, I was working on a
  computer that used the ANSI generator, and sure enough, (512 *
  512) / 32768 is eight.</p>

  <p>Press et al. reveal that the only thing worse than the ANSI
  generator is a system that tries to fix it:</p>

  <p>...one popular 32 - bit PC - compatible computer provides a
  <i>long</i> generator that uses the above congruence, but swaps
  the high - order and low - order 16 bits of the returned value.
  Somebody probably thought that this extra flourish added
  randomness; in fact it ruins the generator.</p>

  <p>Tampering with the result of a generator is like shuffling a
  deck of cards again to make them more random. Sometimes it does;
  sometimes it doesn't. (If you can shuffle a 52 - card deck
  <i>perfectly</i> eight times in a row, you'll return the deck to
  its original order.)</p>

  <p>Linear congruential generators are pretty fast: one multiply,
  one add, one modulus, and bang, you're done. But for the speed
  freaks among us, it turns out that a <i>mulplicative</i>
  congruential generator:</p>
  <pre>
nj+1 = anj mod c
</pre>

  <p>(that is, a linear congruential generator with <i>b</i> = 0)
  can do just as well if you choose your a and c wisely.</p>

  <h3>LFSRs</h3>

  <p>Linear Feedback Shift Registers, or LFSRs, are another popular
  way of producing random numbers. Like congruential generators,
  LFSRs are completely deterministic, but they can be embedded in
  electronic devices with less hardware.</p>

  <p>An LFSR provides an endless procession of pseudorandom bits,
  as opposed to full - fledged pseudorandom integers. Don't fret
  about the fact that LFSRs only produce a bit at a time: by
  combining multiple bits, you can create a pseudorandom number in
  any range you want. Of course, if you're as lazy as Mike Stok
  said he was in the previous article, you might not like this, and
  I don't blame you: I'd rather roll a six - sided die than flip a
  coin three times (disregarding HHH and TTT, and then arbitrarily
  assigning the other outcomes to one through six).</p>

  <p>(As an aside, cryptographers often talk about a coin flip as
  if it were the ideal generator of random bits. Skilled magicians,
  however, can manipulate coin flips. And because of the way coins
  are struck by dies at the mint, the edges are often not quite
  perpendicular to the sides. Don't believe me? Balance a penny on
  its edge and then bump the table. It'll fall heads more than half
  the time.)</p>

  <p>You can think of every LFSR as containing a "window" of bits.
  In a 4 - bit LFSR, the system sees four bits at a time; when a
  user wants a random bit, the system extracts the rightmost bit,
  shifts the other three bits one place to the right, and
  calculates a new leftmost bit by XORing some of those four bits
  together.</p>

  <p>For instance, a very simple LFSR might operate on four bits at
  a time, XORing the first and third bits. Let's say you seed this
  generator with 15, which is 1111 in binary. Then the first nine
  pseudorandom bits will be 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, and 1, because
  they're the rightmost bits of this sequence:</p>
  <pre>
1111
0111
1011
<u>010</u>1
0<u>010</u>
1001
1100
1110
0111
</pre>

  <p>Consider the fourth state: 0101. We arrive at the fifth state
  by XORing the first and third bits, 0 and 0, yielding 0. That's
  our new leftmost bit; the other bits are the underlined leftover
  bits from the fourth state, shifted right.</p>

  <p>As with congruential generators, you need to be very careful
  when choosing the parameters; you can't just XOR any bits you
  like. The four bit generator above is a "real" LFSR. It's maximal
  length; no matter what seed you provide, it will repeat after no
  less than seven iterations. As part II of this issue's contest, I
  present to you a nine bit generator; can you crack the generator
  by deducing which bits are XORed?</p>
  <pre>
1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
</pre>

  <p>Unfortunately, I wasn't so lucky as I was when I made up my
  congruential generator; this LFSR repeats itself after 127
  iterations, which I learned from the program on this page.</p>

  <p>If you don't think any of this stuff matters, consider a great
  cryptosystem. A <i>superb</i> cryptosystem, one that uses, say,
  hundred - thousand - bit keys. To generate those keys, it needs
  random numbers. Now suppose your computer uses an eight - bit
  random number generator. Guess how many attempts you need to
  crack the cryptosystem through exhaustive search. Not
  2<sub>65536</sub>, but 2<sub>8</sub> = 256.</p>

  <p>And yes, my computer (a DEC Alpha running Digital Unix) still
  uses that stupid ANSI generator.</p>
