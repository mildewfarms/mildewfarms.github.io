1      Four  score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on 
2  this   continent,  a  new  nation,  conceived  in  Liberty,  and 
3  dedicated to the  proposition  that  all  men are  created equal.
4      Now  we  are engaged in a great civil war,  testing  whether 
5  that  nation,  or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,  can 
6  long  endure. We are met on a great  battle-field of that war. We 
7  have  come  to  dedicate  a portion  of that  field,  as  a  final 
8  resting  place  for  those who here gave their lives  that  that 
9  nation  might live. It is altogether fitting and proper  that  we 
10  should do this.
