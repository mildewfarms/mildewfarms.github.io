1      Four  score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on 
2  this   continent,  a  new  nation,  conceived  in  Liberty,  and 
3  dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. 
4   
5      Now  we  are engaged in a great civil war,  testing  whether 
6  that  nation,  or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,  can 
7  long  endure. We are met on  a great battle-field of that war. We 
8  have  come  to  dedicate  a portion  of that field,  as  a  final 
9  resting  place  for  those who here gave their lives  that  that 
10  nation  might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that  we 
11  should do this.
