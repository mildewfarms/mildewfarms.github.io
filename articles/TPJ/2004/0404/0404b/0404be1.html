1  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this 
2  continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to 
3  the proposition that all men are created equal. 
4   
5  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that 
6  nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long 
7  endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have 
8  come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting 
9  place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might 
10  live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do 
11  this.
