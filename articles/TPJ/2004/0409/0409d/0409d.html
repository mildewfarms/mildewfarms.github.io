<p>I read my mail with Washington University's PINE and I do it on a remote server. I've been doing it that way for years and it works for me. Since I travel so much, I never know where I might be or which computer I might be using, but I can usually ssh to my shell account.</p>

<p>I can't look at most attachments since PINE is just a text thing. It isn't going to show me pictures or translate Word documents. Since I read this stuff on a remote account, I usually have to save the attachments, then move them into my web space so I can download them on whatever computer I may be using.</p>

<p>I never felt annoyed or motivated enough to fix this&#151;until now, that is. I don't want to give up PINE, but I want to view the attachments with as little pain as possible. I wrote a script that I can pipe a message to using PINE's <i>enable-unix-pipe-cmd</i> feature (which you may have to turn on). When I read a message with an attachment that I want to save, I display the full message with the <i>h</i> command (full header mode) so PINE displays the entire message including all the attachments. I can scroll through all of this if I like, and it's the same thing my program will get as input. With the | command, PINE prompts me for a program name to send the message to; I called this program "detach" and placed it in my personal bin directory. I also created a symlink named "d" to reduce typing. This program is shown in <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing 1</a>.</p>

<p>The program is deceptively short. I start off with the usual Perl invocation and <i>strict</i> and <i>warnings</i> declarations. The <i>ExtUtils::Command</i> module provides me a <i>mkpath()</i> function that acts like a portable <i>'mkdir -p'</i> so I can easily create new directories. The <i>File::Spec::Functions</i> module has the handy <i>catfile()</i> function that joins together path parts according to the preference of the current operating system. The <i>File::Path</i> module also has an <i>mkpath()</i> function, but it kills the script if it fails. I don't like that sort of interface, so I stick to <i>ExtUtils::Command</i>.</p>

<p>I try to use this whenever I need to work with paths so my script will have fewer portability issues. Both of these modules have come with Perl for a long time so feel free to use them liberally.</p>

<p>I also pull in <i>MIME::Parser</i> to do all of the hard work, which makes the script as short as it is. It knows how to parse and save the attachments. Although I normally don't like this sort of tight coupling and multiple action interface, in this case, it is just what I want.</p>

<p>Before I used this script, I defined the environment variable <i>ATTACHMENT_ROOT</i> in my shell configuration file. I have this set to a directory in the protected space of my web directory so I can download the file through a web browser. That takes care of the download hassle I had before. If I don't set this variable, I use my home directory.</p>

<p>I read the message from STDIN with one big chunk. The <i>do{}</i> idiom is a favorite of mine. It acts sort of like an inline subroutine: I get a block of code to define a scope and it returns the last evaluated expression. In this case, I set the <i>$/</i> (the input record separator) variable to nothing, so the diamond operator (<i>&lt;&gt;</i>) reads the entire file at once. I store the whole message, headers and all, in <i>$message</i>.</p>

<p>Once I have the message, I want to figure out where to store my attachments. I think everyone names their files the same thing, so I have a bunch of files named "tpr-article.doc" from different authors. I decided to create a directory for each sender, so I send the entire message to my <i>from()</i> subroutine to pull out the e-mail address, then store it in <i>$from</i>. My e-mail address extractor is very simple, and it's the same thing I wrote about in my last <i>TPJ</i> article, "Pipelines and E-mail Addresses" (<i>TPJ</i>, August 2004). It is not a complete (or "correct") solution, but it's good enough and it hasn't failed me yet. If I was worried about weird e-mail address or <i>From</i> lines, I could use one of the e-mail parsing modules.</p>

<p>Before I go any further, though, I want to make sure that the string in the <i>$from</i> address is something safe for a path. The <i>MIME::Parser::Filer</i> module, which does a lot of the work my script doesn't show, can take a string and ensure it's something I can safely use. If it can't rescue a bad e-mail address, it returns <i>undef</i> and I use "malformed-sender" as a default.</p>

<p>I use <i>catfile()</i> to join my base directory and sender directory. As I said earlier, <i>catfile()</i> does the right thing for the operating system. In the next line, I use the <i>do{}</i> block to create a scope that I can modify with <i>unless()</i>. If the directory already exists, I skip this step, but if it doesn't, I put my new directory name into a <i>local()</i> version of <i>@ARGV</i> then call <i>mkpath()</i>, which uses the values in <i>@ARGV</i> as its arguments. It's an odd bit of history, but that's the way it works.</p>

<p>Once the directory exists, I tell <i>MIME::Parser</i> that I want to use that directory to store the files. This is where my attachments will show up. After I set the directory, I call <i>parse_data()</i> and all the interesting stuff happens.</p>

<p>The files end up in one of my private web directories, so I go to that URL, which is just a directory listing, then choose the link to the e-mail address of the message. There are my attachments. It's not as easy as clicking a link in web mail, but now everything  that everyone sends me gets stored in an easily accessible web directory.</p>
