<p>Throughout its history, Perl has always found a home in the suite of tools employed by systems administrators in the maintenance, monitoring, and administration of computer systems. As the needs of systems administrators have grown, Perl has kept pace with an ever-expanding base of diverse application and tool components available from the comprehensive Perl archive network (CPAN, http://www.cpan.org/).</p>

<p>One tool available from CPAN of particular utility to systems administrators is the <i>Net::Pcap</i> library. This module provides an interface for Perl to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Network Research Group's <i>pcap</i> library, which is a system-independent interface for user-level packet capture. This library provides a portable framework for low-level network monitoring and can be used for a variety of network monitoring functions, including network statistics collection, security monitoring, and network debugging. </p>
<h3>Setting the Device</h3>

<p>The first step in building an application or tool using <i>Net::Pcap</i> and the underlying <i>libpcap</i> library for network monitoring is to determine an available network interface that can be used for monitoring this network traffic. This device can be specified by the user for specific network monitoring, particularly on multihomed machines, or can be determined via the <i>lookupdev</i> method of <i>Net::Pcap</i>.</p>

<p>The syntax of the <i>lookupdev</i> method is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$dev = Net::Pcap::lookupdev(\$err)

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>This method returns the name of a network device, which can be used for monitoring network traffic. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
use Net::Pcap;
use strict;

my $err;
my $dev = Net::Pcap::lookupdev(\$err);
if (defined $err) {
    die 'Unable to determine network device for monitoring - ', $err;
}

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The string reference <i>$err</i> is passed as an argument to this method and is returned with an error description in the event of method failure. Upon method failure, the returned device name is also undefined.</p>

<p>With the latest version of the <i>Net::Pcap</i> module (0.05), a list of all network devices that can be used for network monitoring can be retrieved using the <i>findalldevs</i> function. The syntax of this function is similar to that of the <i>lookupdev</i> function:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
@devs = Net::Pcap::findalldevs(\$err)

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>Another useful method available from the <i>Net::Pcap</i> library is <i>lookupnet</i>, which can be used to determine the network address and netmask for a device. This method is useful for the validation of a device name supplied for network monitoring by a user.</p>

<p>The syntax of the <i>lookupnet</i> method is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Net::Pcap::lookupnet($dev, \$net, \$mask, \$err)

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>This method returns the network address and netmask for the device specified&#151;<i>$dev</i>. This method also follows the conventions of the underlying library of returning 0 for success and -1 for failure and, as such, error checking for this and other <i>Net::Pcap</i> functions may use the pseudoreverse mentality of the <i>die if...</i> idiom. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
my ($address, $netmask, $err);
if (Net::Pcap::lookupnet($dev, \$address, \$netmask, \$err)) {
    die 'Unable to look up device information for ', $dev, ' - ', $err;
}
print STDOUT "$dev: addr/mask -&gt; $addr/$mask\n";

</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Capturing Packets</h3>

<p>Once an appropriate network device has been determined, the process of packet capturing can be initiated. The <i>Net::Pcap</i> function <i>open_live</i> returns a packet capture descriptor, which can be used for capturing and examining network packets.</p>

<p>The syntax of the <i>open_live</i> method is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$object = Net::Pcap::open_live($dev, $snaplen, $promisc, $to_ms, \$err)

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>The <i>$dev</i> parameter specifies the network interface from which to capture network packets while the <i>$snaplen</i> and <i>$promisc</i> parameters specify the maximum number of bytes to capture from each packet and whether to put the interface into promiscuous mode, respectively. The latter of these parameters, the promiscuous mode, places the network card into a "snooping" mode where network packets not necessarily directed to the packet-capturing machine are captured. In a nonswitched network environment, this can capture all network traffic. The <i>$to_ms</i> parameter specifies a read time-out for packet capturing in milliseconds&#151;a <i>$to_ms</i> value of 0 captures packets until an error occurs, while a value of -1 captures packets indefinitely.</p>

<p>Individual packets can be retrieved from the network interface using the <i>next</i> method of the <i>Net::Pcap</i> module in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$packet = Net::Pcap::next($object, \%header)

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>This method will return the next packet available on the network interface registered with the <i>Net::Pcap</i> packet descriptor object.  The <i>%header</i> hash reference is populated with details relating to packet header information, namely:</p>



<ul>
  <li><i>len,</i> the total length of the packet.</li>
  <li><i>caplen</i>, the captured length of the packet; this corresponds to the <i>$snaplen </i>argument passed to the <i>Net::Pcap::open_live</i> method.</li>
  <li><i>tv_sec</i>, the seconds value of the packet timestamp.</li>
  <li><i>tv_usec,</i> the microseconds value of the packet timestamp.</li>
</ul>



<p>If no packets are available on the network interface for capture, the return value of the <i>Net::Pcap::next</i> method is undefined.</p>

<p>Alternatively, continuous packet capture can be performed by establishing and registering a callback function to which <i>Net::Pcap</i> can pass captured packets to for analysis and reporting. For this, the <i>loop</i> method of <i>Net::Pcap</i> is called:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Net::Pcap::loop($object, $count, \&amp;callback_function, $user_data)

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>This method takes four mandatory arguments. <i>$object</i> is the <i>Net::Pcap</i> object returned from the <i>Net::Pcap::open_live</i> method. <i>$count</i> is a number indicating the number of packets to capture.  If the number passed to this function is negative, <i>Net::Pcap::loop</i> will capture packets indefinitely (or until an error occurs if the <i>$to_ms</i> argument of the <i>open_live</i> method is set to 0). The third parameter is a subroutine reference to the callback function. The fourth argument represents arbitrary data that is passed with the callback function (along with captured packets) and can be used as a method to tag captured packets or distinguish between several open-packet capture sessions.</p>

<p>The callback function specified by the <i>Net::Pcap::loop</i> method receives the following arguments when called:</p>



<ul>
  <li>The <i>$user_data</i> string passed to the <i>Net::Pcap::loop</i> method.</li>
  <li>A reference to a hash containing packet header information (as described in association to the <i>Net::Pcap::next</i> method above). </li>
  <li>A copy of the entire packet.</li>
</ul>



<p>An example of the callback function associated with packet capture may look like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
sub callback_function {
    my ($user_data, $header, $packet) = @_;

    ...
}

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>One important limitation of this module in its current version, however, is that only a single callback function and user data scalar can be registered at any given time, as both elements are stored within global variables within the <i>Net::Pcap</i> namespace.</p>
<h3>Filtering Packets</h3>

<p>While the previously methods described provide the means by which to capture all network traffic, the real power offered by the <i>libpcap</i> library is to selectively filter network packets to monitor specific traffic. The filtering of network packets can be set through the use of a filter language specific to the <i>libpcap</i> library. A description of this filter language can be found in the <i>libpcap</i> source code or on the <i>tcpdump(8)</i> man page. The use of this filter language for the selective capture of network packets does require some knowledge of TCP/IP networking and the underlying packet structure, and a detailed description of this filter language would be beyond the scope of this article.</p>

<p>The <i>Net::Pcap</i> module provides methods for the compilation and setting of filters for network packet capture by means of the <i>Net::Pcap::compile</i> and <i>Net::Pcap::setfilter</i> methods.</p>

<p>The arguments of the <i>Net::Pcap::compile</i> method are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Net::Pcap::compile($object, \$filter_compiled, $filter_string, $optimize, $netmask)

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>This method will compile and check the filter specified in <i>$filter_string</i> for the <i>Net::Pcap</i> object <i>$object</i> and return the compiled filter in the scalar <i>$filter_compiled</i>. The filter is optimized where possible if the <i>$optimize</i> variable is True. This function, like other <i>Net::Pcap</i> functions, returns 0 if successful or -1 if an error occurs.</p>

<p>The compiled filter string, <i>$filter_compiled</i>, can then be applied against the <i>Net::Pcap</i> object using the <i>Net::Pcap::setfilter</i> method. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Net::Pcap::setfilter($object, $filter_compiled)

</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Decoding Captured Packets</h3>

<p>Once packets have been captured using the <i>Net::Pcap</i> interface to <i>libpcap</i>, the next step is to decode these packets and make sense of the network packet data collected. This can be performed by constructing unpack templates for captured data or (more easily) through the <i>NetPacket::</i> collection of modules. These modules each contain methods for extracting information from and about network packets, the most useful of which is (arguably) the <i>decode</i> method. This method returns a hash of metadata about the passed packet specific to the packet type.</p>

<p>For example, the <i>NetPacket::Ethernet::decode</i> method will return the following information on captured ethernet packets:</p>



<ul>
  <li><i>src_mac</i>, the source MAC address for the Ethernet packet as a hex string.</li>
  <li><i>dest_mac</i>, the destination MAC address for the Ethernet packet as a hex string.</li>
  <li><i>type</i>, the protocol type of the Ethernet packet; for example, IP, ARP, PPP, and SNMP.</li>
  <li><i>data</i>, the data payload for the Ethernet packet.</li>
</ul>



<p>Further information on each of the <i>NetPacket::</i> modules and the information returned by the decode function can be found on their respective man pages.</p>

<p>In addition to this, each of the <i>NetPacket::</i> modules also contain a <i>strip</i> method, which simply returns the data payload of the network packet. This is useful when the network encapsulation is of little or no concern to your application.</p>
<h3>Error Handling</h3>

<p>While scalar references can be passed as arguments to a number of the <i>Net::Pcap</i> methods (namely <i>lookupdev</i>, <i>findalldevs</i>, <i>lookupnet</i>, and <i>open_live</i>), in order to return error messages, there are a number of dedicated methods supplied by this module for more generic error handling: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Net::Pcap::geterr($object)
Net::Pcap::perror($object, $prefix)
Net::Pcap::strerror($errno);
The <i>Net::Pcap::geterr</i> function returns an error message for the last error associated with the packet capture object <i>$object</i>. The <i>Net::Pcap::perror</i> function prints the test of the last error associated with the packet capture object <i>$object</i> on standard error prefixed by the string in <i>$prefix</i>. <i>Net::Pcap::strerror</i> returns a string-describing error number <i>$errno</i>.

</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Cleaning Up</h3>

<p>Once finished capturing packets, the <i>Net::Pcap::close</i> method should be called to close the packet capture device. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Net::Pcap::close($object)

</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>

<p><a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing 1</a> shows a way of putting all of the aforementioned techniques to use for network administration. In this example, details of all TCP packets with the SYN header flag set captured by a machine will be reported. These network packets are used by a client in initiating a connection with a server and can be used to initiate denial of service attacks against a network host. For further information on TCP packet structure and the SYN header flag, see RFC793.</p>
<h3>From Here</h3>

<p>This article has touched upon the basic functionality of the <i>Net::Pcap</i> module and how it can be used in network administration. Other features of this excellent module that have not been covered in this article include saving captured network packets to files and interface statistics handling. These features are well described in the documentation for this module, and readers should have no trouble employing these extended features of the <i>Net::Pcap</i> module.</p>
