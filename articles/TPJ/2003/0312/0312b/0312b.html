<p>Numerous programs in the UNIX system (and its clones) are small and yet excel at what they do. Individually, they can't do much, but when used together they can make a large task easier to implement, debug, and maintain. In keeping with this UNIX philosophy, I'll show you how to use a little UNIX utility, <i>find</i>, and two small Perl scripts to accomplish the job of finding duplicate files in a given directory.</p>
<h3>Using <i>find</i></h3>

<p><i>find</i> is a small but powerful utility that is available on all UNIX/Linux systems. The following command, for example, tells <i>find</i> to descend into /tmp (and recursively descend into all subdirectories it encounters), and print to the standard output the names of all files and subdirectories it finds:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
find /tmp -name "*" 

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p><i>find</i>'s output is similar to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/tmp
/tmp/tex2pdf-root
/tmp/Gladman
/tmp/Gladman/sha2.c
/tmp/Gladman/uitypes.h
/tmp/Gladman/test.c
/tmp/Gladman/sha2.h
/tmp/Gladman/a.out
/tmp/guile-1.6.4

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The best feature of <i>find</i>, just like any good UNIX tool, is that its output can be redirected as input to another program. So, instead of displaying its output to the screen, you can use a pipe to "hand over" its output to the next program for processing, as in</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
find /tmp -name "*" | ./md5

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The symbol "|" is the pipe, and the command above tells us that md5 is the next program that takes in <i>find</i>'s output.</p>
<h3>The md5 Script</h3>

<p>md5 is a short Perl script that uses the MD5 one-way hash function to generate a unique message digest for a given input file. The md5 script is shown in <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing 1</a>. The MD5 algorithm guarantees that every file has its own unique digest. (Well, not quite. But mathematically speaking, the probability of two different files having identical digests is 1 in 264, which is practically nil.) So, if MD5 says that two files have the same digest, you can be sure, with a very high degree of confidence, that they are indeed identical.</p>

<p>The output of the command:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
find /tmp -name "*" | ./md5

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>gives us something like:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
294da4cc09dd0024a1f21a7f810dfe60  /tmp/Gladman/sha2.c
7218b118cc8de06b13bd4d997cb00250  /tmp/Gladman/uitypes.h
72f0f6f900800fbd7b14af552b40d8a6  /tmp/Gladman/test.c
b0b8bae1aaf4169ec6dffb1a78b13372  /tmp/Gladman/sha2.h
009b12ab19c4e5640f2bd263f4970d70  /tmp/Gladman/a.out

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Each line of md5's output consists of a 32-character MD5 digest, followed by two single spaces, and lastly, a filename.</p>

<p>Line 7 of md5 uses the "diamond operator" (&lt;&gt;) to receive whatever that is output by <i>find</i>. Although invisible to the naked eye, each line of <i>find</i>'s output ends in a newline, something we don't need. md5 strips off these newlines via the <i>chomp</i> command (line 8). Line 9 checks whether or not the input line is a regular file (the -f switch).</p>

<p>Most novice Perl programmers would be puzzled by lines 7-9, since &lt;&gt;, <i>chomp</i>, and <i>-f</i> seem to operate on a global variable that was not explicitly defined anywhere in the script. Let me explain lines 7-9 in more detail.</p>

<p>By default, every input line read by &lt;&gt; is loaded into the special variable, <i>$_</i>. When <i>chomp</i> is called without any argument, it is understood that we mean to discard the newline character of <i>$_</i>. The <i>-f</i> switch (guess what?) also acts on <i>$_</i> implicitly. <i>$_</i> is updated every time a new input line is read.</p>

<p>Lines 11-13 generate an MD5 digest of the filename, and line 15 prints the digest and the filename.</p>
<h3>The finddup Script</h3>

<p>finddup takes the output of md5, again, through the use of a pipe. finddup then produces an associative array, <i>%dups</i>, using the digests computed by md5 as keys. See <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing 2</a> for the whole finddup script.</p>

<p>On lines 11 and 12 of finddup, we again employ the familiar &lt;&gt; and <i>chomp</i>, respectively. On line 13, the first 32 characters of <i>$_</i> are assigned to <i>$digest</i>, while the rest of <i>$_</i> gets assigned to <i>$filename</i>.</p>

<p>On line 15, <i>$filename</i> is saved in <i>%dups</i>, using <i>$digest </i>as key. Normally, when the contents of <i>%dups </i>are finally printed out, duplicate files for every key are displayed on one line only, with just a single space separating them. This is ugly to look at. To make the output pleasing to the eye (I hope), I saved a newline every time <i>$filename </i>is <i>push</i>-ed into <i>%dups </i>(line 14). This way, the filenames are displayed in one nice-looking column. In doing this, however, notice that every key of <i>%dups</i> now contains at least two elements (the filenames and the newlines).</p>

<p>On lines 18-24, finddup loops through <i>%dups</i>, and checks for keys with multiple elements. On line 19, if a certain key (the MD5 digest) contains more than two elements (take the newlines into account), we know that duplicate files exist for this digest, and they get printed to the standard output (line 21).</p>

<p>If finddup is called with the <i>--verbose</i> or <i>-v</i> options switched on, the digests for duplicate files are printed as well (line 20). Line 22 is there for cosmetic purposes only.</p>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<p>On my Linux machine, I made a directory and called it testdir. I then created six small test files, some with duplicates.</p>

<p>The command:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
find ./testdir -name "*" | ./md5 | ./finddup &#151;verbose

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
find ./testdir -name "*" | ./md5 | ./finddup -v

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>produces these results:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
1  900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f72
2     ./testdir/ba3e2571
3     ./testdir/9cd0d89d
4     ./testdir/a9993e36
5  
6  d4b7c284882ca9e208bb65e8abd5f4c8
7     ./testdir/1a3472da
8     ./testdir/f2c8d22e
9     ./testdir/hello world

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The three files listed on lines 2-4 are all identical; their MD5 digest is printed on line 1. Likewise, line 6 shows the digest of identical files printed on lines 7-9.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you'll find out that, using either of the commands above, it's not possible to get the digest of a file that starts with a dot ("."). There's a way, though, but I'll leave this as an exercise for the interested reader. (Hint: check the <i>find</i> man page.)</p>
