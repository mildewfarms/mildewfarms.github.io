<h1>Searching for Search Tools</h1>
<p><i>The Perl Journal</i> December, 2003</p>



<hr>


<p>Over the years, I've produced my fair share of commercial CD-ROMs. Along the way, the one thing I've learned is that a good search tool is hard to find.</p>

<p>Well, I should say it's hard to find if you want one that is lightweight, indexes without crashing, works on a variety of platforms, and doesn't cost an arm and leg to distribute on CD. I've looked at a lot of content-indexing systems, from the cheap-and-dirty right up to the expensive-and-feature-laden.</p>

<p>The problem is complicated by the fact that search tools aren't one application. They're two&#151;an indexer and search client app. For CD-ROM content, you only have to run the indexer once, to produce an index. That index is distributed on your CD-ROM, along with the search client app that reads the index and lets users search the disc. Both of these apps need to be reliable.</p>

<p>Some search tools have indexers that tie you to one platform, which means that if you want to do all your CD-ROM production work on one machine, the indexer is determining for you which machine you'll be using. Some tools have Java-based search applets that are supposed to work on any end user's VM. We all know how that goes&#151;write once, debug everywhere. Yet another problem is that some tools require you to distribute an app on your CD-ROM that must be installed on the user's machine to allow searching of the disc. Granted, performance may be better than with a cross-platform search tool, but I still don't like CD-ROMs that do this.</p>

<p>So you can imagine my delight in running across jsFind, an open-source tool put together by Shawn Garbett (http://elucidsoft.net/projects/jsfind/). It's really just a nice customization of a popular open-source indexer called swish-e, coupled with some Perl to massage the swish-e output into an XML B-tree, and a JavaScript component to search that B-tree. Swish-e is available as source, so you can compile it on nearly any platform you like (I did it on Mac OS X). Shawn provides a patch for swish-e that lets it export its index as XML, but by the time you read this, that patch might well be incorporated into the main swish-e source. The back end of this tool, then, is usable on any machine on which you can manage to successfully compile it. So far, so good.</p>

<p>But what about that JavaScript component? That, too, seems to be a thing of beauty. It works in any Level 2 DOM-compliant browser. That includes many of the relatively recent browsers, and gives users the choice of at least two different browsers on any of the big three platforms&#151;Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. (Probably Solaris, too, though I don't have a Solaris installation to test this.) The searches are fast and the whole user experience is customizable because you have access to all the code. </p>

<p>From the standpoint of compatibility for end users, a JavaScript client makes so much more sense than a Java client because JavaScript comes built-in to the browser. There's no separate install just to support the search client. Most of the time, the user's browser is adequate.</p>

<p>jsFind isn't perfect: It has a JavaScript timeout bug that shows up on some OS/browser combinations that leaves the search stuck on a "Please wait..." page. But this is usually easily cleared by resubmitting the search. Shawn promises he's looking for a way to squash that one. If you think you know the answer, he'd probably like to hear from you.</p>
