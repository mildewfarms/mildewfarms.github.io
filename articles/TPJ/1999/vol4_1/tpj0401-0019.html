  <p>Object Oriented Programming is an approach to software design
  that most programmers simultaneously love and hate. OOP is just
  so adorable because it provides a simple conceptual model, and
  code that often looks like natural language:</p>
  <pre>
my $dog = new Dog; ## create a new dog
$dog-&gt;bark; ## Speak, Fido!
</pre>

  <p>The misconception that using Object Oriented Design is the
  proper ritual to drive out bugs and maintenance problems causes
  most of us to hang our heads and sigh when someone touts the
  latest Magic Object Oriented Toaster. But the OOP Establishment
  thrives on rituals.</p>

  <p>In the tradition of Galileo, I will challenge the
  Establishment and boldly state a Perl Heresy:</p>

  <p><b>Objects in Perl need not be represented with
  hashes.</b></p>

  <p>This article assumes at least some knowledge of how to
  implement objects in Perl. If you don't have that prerequisite,
  fear not! You are but a short reading of the <i>perltoot</i>
  documentation away. This article will explore how using arrays as
  objects can be a bit more efficient (both timewise and spacewise)
  and encourage nicer style while refraining from violating the
  principle in the <i>perlmodlib</i> documentation:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Perl doesn't have an infatuation with enforced privacy. It
    would prefer that you stayed out of its living room because you
    weren't invited, not because it has a shotgun.</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We'll call this the Graciousness Principle.</p>

  <h3>OO Basics</h3>

  <p>There are several ways to create objects in Perl, but they all
  have the same effect: They store the state of the world in a data
  structure and return a reference to it. As the <i>perltoot</i>
  examples show, that data structure can be a scalar, array, hash,
  typeglob, or even an anonymous subroutine. Each of these has
  different tradeoffs between flexibility, speed, size, and
  readability. For whatever reason (as a quick browse of CPAN
  confirms), Perl programmers prefer hashes as their storage of
  choice, probably because of hashes' high score on the flexibility
  scale.</p>

  <p>Let's say we want to create some objects to represent people.
  In OO parlance, we would say that we want to create instances of
  the Person class. Think of a class as a definition of what
  objects "know" about themselves. For example, every person knows
  his name. If one can say something about the entire class, then
  that is said to be part of the class definition. Now, let's think
  of a particular person--Larry Wall for instance. Larry knows his
  name, and he could tell us if we asked him. We can think of Larry
  as an instance of class Person.</p>

  <p>This is how the non-heretical programmer would implement a
  Person class:</p>
  <pre>
package Person;
&#13;# create a new Person object whose name is provided in @_
# e.g. my $person = new Person 'Larry';
sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = {};
    $self-&gt;{NAME} = shift;
    bless $self =&gt; $class;
}
</pre>
  <pre>
# A method to get or set the NAME
sub name {
    my $self = shift;
    $self-&gt;{NAME} = shift if @_;
    $self-&gt;{NAME};
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>Before we attack this code, a little terminology. The
  <tt>new()</tt> subroutine above is called a <i>constructor</i>
  because it is invoked when you want to create a new Person
  object. Subroutines that know how operate on objects are called
  <i>methods</i>. (One might think of addition and subtraction as
  methods in the class of Integers, for example.) If a method is
  used only to store and retrieve an attribute (<tt>NAME</tt>,
  above) of an object, it's called an <i>accessor</i>.
  <tt>name()</tt> is an accessor.</p>

  <p>Say we want to have our Person objects come to the microphone
  and introduce themselves:</p>
  <pre>
my $lwall = new Person 'Larry';
my $tchrist = new Person 'Tom';
&#13;for $person ($lwall, $tchrist) {
    print "Hi, my name is ", $person-&gt;name, ".\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>As you can see, because of the way we have generalized the
  notion of what a person is and how to coax information out of
  people, we can use generic code to make people speak up.</p>

  <p>One of the tenets of OO is that you should be able to write
  code like this independent of how <tt>new()</tt> and
  <tt>name()</tt> are defined. When you peer inside the black box
  of a Person object, you see a hash: the <tt>my $self = {}</tt>
  makes <tt>$self</tt> into a reference to an anonymous hash, and
  the <tt>bless</tt> at the end of the constructor makes that into
  an object. Everywhere you look, you'll see constructors like
  this.</p>

  <p>However, if you're willing to write your accessors
  differently, you can say <tt>my $self = []</tt> and build objects
  out of arrays. Here's a new <tt>new()</tt> that creates an object
  out of an array:</p>
  <pre>
sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = [];
    $self-&gt;[NAME] = shift;
    bless $self =&gt; $class;
}
</pre>

  <p>Our new <tt>name()</tt> also just trades braces for
  brackets:</p>
  <pre>
sub name {
    my $self = shift;
    $self-&gt;[NAME] = shift if @_;
    $self-&gt;[NAME];
}
</pre>

  <p>There are four reasons why arrays are preferable to
  hashes:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>They're faster.</li>

    <li>They use less space.</li>

    <li>They prevent attribute collisions.</li>

    <li>They prevent you from misspelling attribute names.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The first two are general truths, and the last two are
  specific to a technique for manipulating attributes described
  later. I'll discuss each of these reasons one by one.</p>

  <h3>Arrays are faster</h3>

  <p>We've only exchanged braces for brackets, but Graham Barr
  (author of the popular IO and <i>libnet</i> packages) reported
  that when he reworked Convert::BER to use arrays instead of
  hashes, he saw a speed improvement of better than twenty percent.
  To test this claim, I used a base class with two attributes and a
  subclass with one. The benchmark program used both arrays and
  hashes to construct new objects and read and write those
  attributes. My simple benchmarks (available on the TPJ web site)
  found a comparable speed increase.</p>

  <p>Why the increase? Because you can retrieve an element from an
  array faster than from a hash, although as <i>perltoot</i> points
  out, the savings are not as substantial as one might hope:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>You might guess that the array access would be a lot faster
    than the hash access, but they're actually comparable. The
    array is a little bit faster, but not more than ten or fifteen
    percent, even when you replace the variables above like $AGE
    with literal numbers, like 1.</i>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Arrays use less space</h3>

  <p>My benchmark program created large arrays of the subclassed
  objects. Using the <tt>PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS</tt> feature to measure
  the space, I found that arrays used a little more space
  initially, but for large numbers of objects, hashes used about
  40% more memory. (All benchmarks ran under Perl 5.005_02.)
  <i>perltoot</i> continues:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>A bigger difference between the two approaches can be found
    in memory use. A hash representation takes up more memory than
    an array representation because you have to allocate memory for
    the keys as well as for the values.</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Although space and time requirements should not be the
  standards by which all implementations are judged, they become
  increasingly important as the application creates more and more
  objects.</p>

  <h3>Arrays can prevent attribute collisions</h3>

  <p>Let's say that we define a subclass of the Person class:
  Child. Any Person can have an email address, even children, so we
  make <tt>EMAIL</tt> an attribute of all Person objects. An
  <tt>email()</tt> accessor is used to get and set the email
  address. And if we implement our objects as hashes, the attribute
  would be stored as <tt>$object-&gt;{EMAIL}</tt>. So far, so
  good.</p>

  <p>The sharp reader will wonder what prevents a subclass from
  inadvertently accessing the attribute of a superclass. Envision a
  collaborative software project in which different people
  implement different classes. The author of the Child class didn't
  remember that the author of the Person class implemented an
  <tt>EMAIL</tt> attribute, and in a late night coding frenzy he
  used <tt>$object-&gt;{EMAIL}</tt> as a boolean to keep track of
  whether or not the Child is old enough to read email. That's a
  <i>collision</i>, and it's a common bug in large software
  projects.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there's no easy way to prevent collisions, and
  this is one of the biggest problems with hashes as objects. It
  might be possible to represent the object with a tied hash whose
  <tt>FETCH</tt> and <tt>STORE</tt> methods (see the <i>perltie</i>
  documentation) maintained a registry of which classes are allowed
  to access which keys, but this would be very cumbersome and slow.
  Such a solution would violate the Graciousness Principle.</p>

  <p>We're going to solve the collision problem by ensuring that
  each attribute is assigned a unique number. That shouldn't come
  as a surprise; the big difference between hashes and arrays is
  that hashes let you name elements, while arrays only let you
  number them. Naming is more convenient and intuitive--but as
  you'll see, there's a clever workaround that allows us to name
  the elements of our array <i>and</i> avoid collisions.</p>

  <p>The <i>perlsub</i> documentation describes how you can create
  constants at compile time. Here's the common example:</p>
  <pre>
sub PI () { 3.14159 } # define constant PI
use constant PI =&gt; 3.14159; # has the same effect
</pre>

  <p>Subroutines like this are a hint to the Perl compiler that
  it's okay to inline the subroutine's return value--to substitute
  3.14159 wherever it sees <tt>PI</tt>, just like the C
  preprocessor.</p>

  <p>We can use this for our attributes, converting names into
  numbers with subroutines like <tt>sub NAME { 0 }</tt> and <tt>sub
  EMAIL { 1 }</tt>. However, we don't want to force everyone in a
  large software project to agree on which numbers to use, because
  inevitably people will forget--just like our late-night hacker
  forgot about the <tt>EMAIL</tt> attribute--and collisions will
  occur.</p>

  <p>So what we'll do is generate those numbers automatically. Our
  collision protection for root classes (that is, classes with no
  superclasses) goes near the top of the class:</p>
  <pre>
package Person;
&#13;my @Attributes;
BEGIN {   # executed at compile time
    @Attributes = qw( NAME EMAIL );
&#13;    my $i = 0;
    for (@Attributes) {
        eval "sub $_ () { $i }";
        $i++;
    }
}
&#13;sub ATTRIBUTES { @Attributes }
</pre>

  <p>The Child subclass looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
package Child;
&#13;use Person;
&#13;my @Attributes;
BEGIN {
    @Child::ISA = qw( Person );
    @Attributes = qw( PARENT EMAIL );
&#13;    my $class = 'Child';
&#13;    # Set $i to the number of known attributes,
    # which is also the next free index in the array.
    my $i = $class-&gt;SUPER::ATTRIBUTES;
&#13;    for (@Attributes) {
        eval "sub $_ () { $i }";
        $i++;
    }
}
&#13;sub ATTRIBUTES {
    my $class = shift;
    my @a = ($class-&gt;SUPER::ATTRIBUTES, @Attributes);
    return @a;
}
&#13;sub parent {
    my $self = shift;
    $self-&gt;[PARENT] = shift if @_;
    $self-&gt;[PARENT];
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>The purpose of all this <tt>ATTRIBUTE</tt> code is to ensure
  that every attribute throughout the class hierarchy has a unique
  integer. That integer corresponds to its index in the array,
  which is how we can get away with the illusion of having
  conveniently named attributes instead of unintuitive integers.
  Thanks to the constants created by our <tt>eval()</tt> statement,
  it's speedy. We even observe the Graciousness Principle: anyone
  can access the array directly, or even recover the symbol
  associated with a particular index.</p>

  <h3>Arrays can prevent misspellings</h3>

  <p>If you were really determined to use hashes, you could do what
  Graham Barr did to avoid collisions and always put the class name
  in the keys to avoid ambiguity. So a Child's email address would
  be <tt>$obj-&gt;{CHILD_EMAIL}</tt>. This works, but it's
  cumbersome and a lot of extra typing. Furthermore, deep
  subclasses will have extremely long keys like
  <tt>Person_Worker_Blue_Collar_Construction</tt>. The longer the
  name, the more opportunities to misspell it.</p>

  <p>Our shortened attribute names are simpler to spell. And
  there's an added bonus: If our class uses the <tt>strict</tt>
  pragma, you'll be notified at compile time if you misspell a
  key!</p>

  <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

  <p>This technique for collision avoidance won't work for multiple
  inheritance. Depending on your opinion of MI, this is either a
  Good Thing or a Big Loss. Given that forcing people to do things
  isn't nice, I wish I knew of a way to reconcile this approach
  with multiple inheritance.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, this approach also requires that all attributes
  be known in advance; you can't add more attributes at run time.
  If you do, you run the risk of two attributes being awarded the
  same index number, causing collisions.</p>

  <p>The biggest disadvantage to this approach is the inertia that
  the hash representation has gained over the past few years. One
  criticism of Perl's OO is that subclasses are forced to use the
  representation of the superclass. Using the array representation
  described here means retrofitting lots of old code, and the path
  of least resistance dictates that people will happily stay where
  they are. Of course, that doesn't stop anyone from using this
  approach in <i>new</i> code, and I hope they will, because it
  makes the right tradeoffs between flexibility, speed, size, and
  readability.</p>

  <h3>Other Approaches</h3>

  <p>As the number of elements in an array grows large, the space
  costs become more and more expensive. When it becomes untenable,
  we could store our arrays in a packed string, or even a simple
  string like <tt>$obj = join $;, @array;</tt>. Some details are
  hazy; for instance, how do you assign to the middle of your
  scalar efficiently? Repeatedly inflating and deflating the object
  would probably kill any gain. However, if the object is mostly
  read-only, it might be a reasonable tradeoff.</p>

  <p>Another approach is to use a new experimental feature of
  post-5.005 Perls known as <i>pseudo-hashes</i>. Pseudo-hashes
  create mappings from names to indices for accessing data, but
  instead of encoding the mapping with subroutines, each
  pseudo-hash carries a reference to a hash that associates names
  with indices. They are more general than the technique I've
  described here, but that generality costs space and time. You can
  find the documentation on pseudo-hashes in the <i>perlref</i> and
  <i>fields</i> documentation.</p>

  <p>This new approach to implementing objects illustrates that you
  don't have to do what everyone else does to do your job well.
  When you can build your objects out of arrays, you benefit from a
  cleaner style, less memory use, less access time, attribute
  spell-checking, and collision protection. If arrays aren't
  feasible, remember that There's More Than One Way To Do It, and
  take advantage of Perl's empowering flexibility to craft a
  solution that works for you.</p>
