  <p><i>O'Reilly's Perl Resource Kit is a shrinkwrapped collection
  of software and documentation in two flavors: Unix and Win32.
  Each contains a CD-ROM with the CPAN and four books: the
  two-volume Perl Module Reference, the Perl Utilities Guide, and
  Programming with Perl Modules. (There's also a wee version of
  TPJ.) The Unix kit came out in November 1997; its CD contains
  Perl 5.004, and a tool written by Larry Wall called JPL
  (Java-Perl Lingo). The Win32 kit came out in August 1998; its CD
  contains Perl 5.005 and a number of tools written by ActiveState,
  such as a debugger and a Package Manager for installing modules
  on Win32.</i></p>

  <p><i>TPJ has never had reviews because I could never figure out
  how to do them right. Not only was I worried about biases from
  the tangled web of relationships (both business and personal)
  that suffuse the Perl community, reviewing a software product or
  book is just plain hard. Not only do you have to examine it
  meticulously, you have to put yourself in the place of novices,
  experts, the patient, the impatient, those who learn by reading,
  and those who learn by doing. Figuring that multiple viewpoints
  are more readily expressed by multiple people than a single
  person, I've solicited four independent reviews of O'Reilly's
  Perl Resource Kit, and published them side by side so you can
  make up your own mind. Sure enough, the reviews spanned a wide
  variety of opinion. Enjoy! &shy;Jon</i></p>

  <h3>Ken Bandes</h3>

  <p>The Win32 Edition of the Perl Resource Kit is an essential
  reference for Perl programmers on this platform, though not
  without its limitations. The volume <i>Programming with Perl
  Modules</i>, by Erik Olson, is excellent and has by far the best
  discussions I've seen of OLE Automation, ADO, and ODBC as they
  apply to Perl. These are crucial topics and for my purposes have
  largely justified the cost of the package.</p>

  <p>The bulk of the package is the two volume module reference.
  Although these contain no information that can't be found
  elsewhere, they are certainly in a more convenient form,
  especially for old guys like me who prefer their words on paper
  and their paper in a binding.</p>

  <p>The software distribution has some fine tools, like the
  graphical debugger, which is a nice bit of work with a
  DevStudio-style interface (which I happen to like, though Unix
  folks tend to hate it). PerlCOM and PerlCtrl are interesting
  tools as well which could be useful, though I haven't yet had the
  occasion. The essentials for me are Perl and PerlScript, which
  are freely available and more up-to-date elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The <i>Perl Utilities Guide</i> volume also has some awfully
  good coverage of important Win32-specific topics that are not
  readily found elsewhere, such as the use of Perl in Active Server
  Pages. However, I was disappointed in the section on writing Perl
  extensions, which is a very cursory introduction. In a package of
  this scope (and price), I don't know why this topic couldn't have
  been covered in depth. Yes, I can find it on-line, but that's
  true of much of the PRK already.</p>

  <p>The Win32 PRK is a very useful reference and I rely on it
  heavily. With deeper coverage of a few areas, it could be even
  more valuable. I rate it 5 for utility and 4 for value.</p>

  <h3>Vicki Brown</h3>

  <p>The <i>Perl Resource Kit</i> picks up where chapter 7 of
  <i>Programming Perl</i> left off. This is a good thing--at 3
  volumes and nearly 1200 pages, the content of the PRK would have
  made <i>Programming Perl</i> unbalanced and unwieldy. Still, the
  PRK is an invaluable addition to your bookshelf. If you plan to
  do any serious Perl programming, you should have it.</p>

  <p>The PRK covers Perl modules--reusable code packages that are
  central to the idea of sharing code. When you use modules, you
  not only won't be reinventing the wheel, your program can take
  advantage of the very latest technology in Perl. All of these
  modules are available for downloading from the CPAN
  (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network), or from the handily
  included CD-ROM. You could find all of the modules' documentation
  on the CPAN (with some effort), but O'Reilly has included it all
  in one, convenient and easily accessible, place.</p>

  <p>I have only two problems with the PRK. First, I wish it had
  been organized differently. The book parallels the CPAN directory
  structure (a good thing), but I am more familiar with
  alphabetical categorization; thus I am constantly picking up the
  wrong volume (and using the Index a lot). Second, the price
  ($150) is steep for most individuals and many organizations. I
  would have preferred something around $100, myself.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, if you are serious about Perl, this is a
  reference you should have. If you work at a company, try to get
  one for several programmers to share. If you buy your own books,
  start budgeting for this one. The price may be high, but it's
  worth it.</p>

  <h3>Keith Allen</h3>

  <p>I learned about the Perl Resource Kit from an O'Reilly flier
  and immediately decided I had to have it. At the time I was quite
  new to Perl; I'd just finished the Llama book and was busy
  wrestling with the Camel. The Resource Kit seemed like a great
  idea, and having the CPAN on a CD was pretty appealing.</p>

  <p>At first glance the <i>Perl Utilities</i> guide was a bit of a
  disappointment because so much is devoted to the new JPL package.
  This would be cool if I were interested in Java, but right now
  what I do is DNA sequence analysis and data mining, so what I
  need is Perl, not Java. But this little volume is saved by the
  very nice selection of five articles from TPJ collected at the
  end.</p>

  <p>The real core of the kit is the two volume <i>Perl Module
  Reference</i>, containing complete documentation for the snapshot
  of CPAN included on the CD. The CD and the <i>Module
  Reference</i> make this kit worthwhile from my perspective. As
  any newcomer to Perl quickly learns, there is an astonishing
  wealth of free code available in CPAN, but how is one to get a
  handle on it? How do you know what's useful? All of this is
  available online, of course, in the pod or in indices or in
  newsgroups. You can also pick out a lot of pointers to CPAN
  modules from the Llama, Camel, and Ram books (yes, I did get a
  free coffee mug from Amazon this year), but as far as I'm
  concerned nothing compares with having a complete reference right
  there on the shelf.</p>

  <p>The kit also includes Nate Patwardhan's book <i>Programming
  With Perl Modules</i>, which has a very nice intro to using
  modules. Of course, this is easy to do, but for a newcomer like
  me it takes a little getting used to, and I found this book to be
  a perfect starting point, expanding on material you can find in
  the Llama book (like the difference between <tt>use</tt> and
  <tt>require</tt>), and then moving through a wide variety of
  different modules, from the utilitarian GetOpts to modules for
  networking, web programming, graphics, and database applications.
  The book is a lot of fun to read. The writing is clear, the
  examples are good, and Patwardhan introduces the topics as well
  as the modules--helpful for those of us who came to programming
  late in life.</p>

  <p>Whether the PRK is worth the money really depends on what you
  need to get out of Perl. If you're writing code to address a few
  specific needs, you may not need many CPAN modules, so retrieving
  them online and reading the documentation might work fine for
  you. But this kit is about Perl power tools, and if your
  programming needs are broad it's hard to see how you can do
  without these books on your shelf. This kit puts the CPAN at your
  fingertips, taking it offline and into your briefcase where you
  can read it on the train.</p>

  <h3>Mark-Jason Dominus</h3>

  <p>When O'Reilly first contacted me to ask for permission to
  distribute my Text::Template module in the PRK, I was delighted,
  particularly since they said they'd send me a free copy once it
  came out. I like getting things for free.</p>

  <p>But when it arrived, I was puzzled. It has three big pieces,
  and while I can imagine people for whom <i>some</i> of the pieces
  are useful, I can't imagine anyone who wants all of the pieces,
  which you have to buy together.</p>

  <p>For example, the most interesting and novel part of the
  package is Larry Wall's 'JPL', which is a kit for integrating
  Perl and Java. Maybe this is the answer to someone's prayer. But
  I can imagine that person turning their eyes to heaven (Or
  Sebastopol, which must be nearly the same) and saying 'Thank you!
  But what did you throw in all that other stuff for?'</p>

  <p>Patwardhan and Irving's book <i>Programming with Perl
  Modules</i> looks nice (although I didn't read it because I
  already know how to use most of that stuff) and I can imagine
  someone who would be very happy with it. But is this the same
  person who prayed for JPL? Probably not.</p>

  <p>The CD contains a snapshot of a lot of stuff that is already
  on CPAN, which would be nice, except that all that stuff is
  already on CPAN--and the versions on the CD are out-of-date.
  There are two fat books of module documentation--simply typeset
  versions of the pods supplied by the various module authors.
  These books, therefore, were written by a collaboration of about
  four hundred people. Some of them write well, and some of them
  don't, and the editing is sparse or nonexistent. Some of the
  documentation is complete, and correct, and some isn't. And
  anyway, it's on CPAN, so why pay good money for out-of-date
  versions?</p>

  <p>Someone suggested that the real reason this part exists is for
  people with pointy-haired bosses who wouldn't let them use CPAN
  modules because they didn't come in a pretty box. Here's the
  pretty box--problem solved.</p>

  <p>I can believe that those people exist, and if you have that
  problem, the PRK might be the solution. But are you also the
  person who prayed for JPL or who wants to read the Patwardhan
  book? Probably not. And once you have the box, you might as well
  put it in the closet, because the boss won't know the difference
  if you get fresh versions direct from CPAN. ("Sure, Boss. It came
  with the PRK.")</p>

  <p>It wasn't too long before the PRK moved off my convenient Perl
  shelf into my hidden closet with the other things that I never
  use that are too expensive to throw away. It sure does take up a
  lot of space! And unless you're someone doing Perl-Java
  integration who wants a book about programming with Perl modules
  and whose boss has forbidden CPAN, I think yours will probably
  end up doing the same thing.</p>
