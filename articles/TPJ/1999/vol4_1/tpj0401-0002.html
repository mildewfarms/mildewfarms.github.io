  <p>Sure, the web has all kinds of wonderful graphical services.
  Sit down in front of your computer, go clicky-clicky, and worlds
  of information are at your fingertips. The problem is, sometimes
  it's nice not to have to sit in front of a web browser to visit
  sites. Maybe you'd prefer to have those web pages mailed to
  you--call it poor man's push technology. Or maybe you'd like to
  download a lot of information from a huge number of web pages,
  and you don't want to open them all one by one. Or maybe you'd
  like to write a robot that scours the web for information. Enter
  the LWP bundle (sometimes called libwww-perl), which contains two
  modules that can download web pages for you: LWP::Simple and
  LWP::UserAgent.</p>

  <p>My colleague Dan Gruhl submitted five tiny but exquisite
  programs to TPJ, all using LWP to automatically download
  information from a web service. Instead of sprinkling these
  around the magazine as "TPJ One-Liners", I've collected all five
  here with a bit of explanation for each.</p>

  <p>The first thing to notice is that all five programs look
  alike. Each uses an LWP module (LWP::Simple in the first three,
  LWP::UserAgent in the last two) to store the HTML from a web page
  in Perl's default scalar variable <tt>$_</tt>. Then they use a
  series of <tt>s///</tt> substitutions to discard the extraneous
  HTML. The remaining text--the part we're interested in--is
  displayed on the screen, although it could nearly as easily have
  been sent as email with the various Mail modules on the CPAN.</p>

  <h3>Downloading currency exchange rates</h3>

  <p>The <tt>currency</tt> program converts money from one currency
  into another, using the exchange rates on www.oanda.com. Here's
  how to find out what $15.82 in worth in Euros:</p>
  <pre>
$ currency 15.82 USD EUR
--&gt; 15.82 US Dollar = 14.1452 Euro
</pre>

  <p>The LWP::Simple module has a function that makes retrieving
  web pages easy: <tt>get()</tt>. When given a URL, <tt>get()</tt>
  returns the text of that web page as one long string. In
  <tt>currency</tt>, <tt>get()</tt> is fed a URL for oanda.com
  containing the three arguments provided to the program:
  <tt>$ARGV[0]</tt>, <tt>$ARGV[1]</tt>, and <tt>$ARGV[2]</tt>,
  which correspond to 15.82, USD, and EUR in the sample run above.
  The resulting web page is stored in <tt>$_</tt>, after which four
  <tt>s///</tt> substitutions discard unwanted data.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
&#13;# Currency converter.
# Usage: currency [amount] [from curr] [to curr]
&#13;use LWP::Simple;
&#13;$_=get("http://www.oanda.com/converter/classic?value=
                   $ARGV[0]&amp;exch=$ARGV[1]&amp;expr=$ARGV[2]");
s/^.*&lt;!-- conversion result starts//s;
s/&lt;!-- conversion result ends.*$//s;
s/&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;//g; s/[ \n]+/ /gs;
print $_, "\n";
</pre>

  <p>The first <tt>s///</tt> removes all text before the HTML
  comment <tt>&lt;!-- conversion result starts</tt>; the tail of
  that comment (<tt>--&gt;</tt>) becomes the arrow that you see in
  the output. The second <tt>s///</tt> removes all text after the
  conversion result. The third <tt>s///</tt> dumbly removes all
  tags in the text that remains, and the final <tt>s///</tt>
  replaces consecutive spaces and newlines with a single space
  each.</p>

  <h3>Downloading Weather Information</h3>

  <p>Weather information is downloaded from www.intellicast.com in
  much the same way as currency information is downloaded from
  www.oanda.com. The URL is different, the <tt>s///</tt>
  substitutions are different (except for the HTML tag remover),
  but the basic operation is the same. As an added treat,
  <tt>weather.pl</tt> uses the Text::Wrap module to format the
  output to 76 columns (reformatted for TPJ):</p>
  <pre>
$ weather bos
WHDH WEATHER FORECAST
&#13;Wednesday February 17, 1999 at 8:11 AM
---------------------------------------
A stormier pattern is definitely in the making. Two 
significant storms will impact our area during the 
next 5 days. The first one will be bring rain at 
first Wednesday night and especially Thursday, but 
as colder air works down from the higher levels of
the atmosphere, a mix with or change to heavy wet 
snow may occur before that storm is done with us 
later Thursday or Thursday night. However, enormous 
potential rests with the second storm. As of now, 
it would appear the time table could fall in the 
Saturday afternoon into early Sunday time frame. The
rain/snow line is sure to be a challenge with that 
storm, but at this storm it appears that most of 
our area will receive mainly snow, with Cape Cod 
and the Islands falling closest to the rain/snow
line. Please stay tuned to our updates all week long.
Todd and Harv
</pre>

  <p>Todd and Harv say more, but I've truncated their output to
  save space.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
&#13;# Prints the weather for a given airport code
#
# Examples: weather bos
#           weather sfo
&#13;use LWP::Simple;
use Text::Wrap;
&#13;$_ = get("http://www.intellicast.com/weather/$ARGV[0]/
            content.shtml");
s/^.*&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;//s;
s/&lt;\/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;//s;
s/&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;//g;
s/\n\n\n+/\n\n/g;
s/\&amp;copy.*//s;
&#13;print wrap('', '', $_);   # default: 76 columns
</pre>

  <h3>Downloading News Stories</h3>

  <p>The CNN home page displays the top news story; <tt>cnn</tt>
  formats and displays it using Text::Wrap. I sandwiched Dan's code
  in a <tt>while</tt> loop that sleeps for five minutes (300
  seconds) and retrieves the top story again. If the new story (as
  usual, stored in <tt>$_</tt>) is different than the old story
  (<tt>$old</tt>), it's printed.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
&#13;use LWP::Simple;
use Text::Wrap;
&#13;while (sleep 300) {
    $_ = get("http://www.cnn.com");
    s/^.*Top Table//s;
    s/&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;//g;
    s/FULL STORY.*$//s;
    s/^.*&gt;\s+//s;
    s/\n\n+/\n\n/g;
    if ($old ne $_) { print wrap('', '', $_); $old = $_ }
}
</pre>

  <p>Because <tt>sleep</tt> returns the number of seconds slept,
  <tt>sleep 300</tt> will always return a true value, and so this
  while loop will never exit.</p>

  <h3>Completing U.S. Postal Addresses</h3>

  <p>There's a TPJ subscriber in Cambridge who hasn't been getting
  his issues. When each issue goes to press, I FTP my mailing list
  to a professional mail house that takes care of all the
  presorting and bagging and labeling that the US Post Office
  requires--an improvement over the days when I addressed every
  issue myself in a cloud of Glu-Stik vapors.</p>

  <p>The problem is that whether I like it or not, the mail house
  fixes addresses that seem incorrect. 'Albequerque' becomes
  'Albuquerque', and 'Somervile' becomes 'Somerville'. That's
  great, as long as the rules for correcting addresses--developed
  by the post office--work. They usually do, but occasionally a
  correct address is "fixed" to an incorrect address. That's what
  happened to this subscriber.</p>

  <p>The <tt>address</tt> program pretends to be a user typing
  information into the fields of the post office's address
  correction page at http://www.usps.com/ncsc/. That page asks for
  six fields: <tt>company</tt> (left blank for residential
  addresses), <tt>urbanization</tt> (valid only for Puerto Rico),
  <tt>street</tt>, <tt>city</tt>, and <tt>zip</tt>. You need to
  provide the <tt>street</tt>, and either the <tt>zip</tt>
  <i>or</i> the <tt>city</tt> and <tt>state</tt>. Regardless of
  which information you provide, the site responds with
  everything:</p>
  <pre>
$ address company "The Perl Journal" urbanization ""
           street "Boxx 54" city "" state "" zip "02101"
&#13;PO BOX 54
BOSTON MA 02101-0054
Carrier Route : B001
County : SUFFOLK
Delivery Point : 54
Check Digit : 8
</pre>

  <p>Note that I deliberately inserted a spelling error:
  <tt>Boxx</tt>.</p>

  <p>One inconvenience of <tt>address</tt> is that you have to
  supply placeholders for all the fields, even the ones you're
  leaving blank.</p>

  <p>This program is a bit trickier than the three you've seen so
  far. It doesn't use LWP::Simple, but instead two other modules
  from the LWP bundle: LWP::UserAgent and HTTP::Request::Common.
  That's because LWP::Simple can handle only HTTP <tt>GET</tt>
  queries. This web site uses a <tt>POST</tt> query, and so Dan
  used the more sophisticated LWP::UserAgent module, which has an
  object oriented interface.</p>

  <p>First, a LWP::UserAgent object, <tt>$ua</tt>, is created with
  <tt>new()</tt>, and then its <tt>request()</tt> method is invoked
  to <tt>POST</tt> the address data to the web page. If the
  <tt>POST</tt> was successful, the <tt>is_success()</tt> method
  returns true, and the page contents can then be found in the
  <tt>_content</tt> attribute of the response object,
  <tt>$resp</tt>. The address is extracted as the <tt>_content</tt>
  is being stored in <tt>$_</tt>, and two more <tt>s///</tt>
  substitutions remove unneeded data.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# Need *either* state *or* zip
&#13;use LWP::UserAgent;
use HTTP::Request::Common;
&#13;$ua = new LWP::UserAgent;
$resp = $ua-&gt;request(
         POST 'http://www.usps.com/cgi-bin/zip4/zip4inq',
         [@ARGV]);
&#13;exit -1 unless $resp-&gt;is_success;
($_ = $resp-&gt;{_content}) =~ s/^.*address is:&lt;p&gt;\n//si;
s/Version .*$//s;
s/&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;//g;
print;
</pre>

  <p>You can use <tt>address</tt> to determine the zip code given
  an address, or to find out your own nine-digit zip code, or even
  to find out who's on the same mail carrier route as you. If you
  type in the address of the White House, you'll learn that the
  First Lady has her own zip code, 20500-0002.</p>

  <h3>Downloading Stock Quotes</h3>

  <p>Salomon Smith Barney's web site is one of many with free
  15-minute delayed stock quotes. To find the stock price for
  Yahoo, you'd provide <tt>stock</tt> with its ticker symbol,
  <tt>yhoo</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
$ stock.pl yhoo
Yahoo Inc
Symbol: YHOO
Last Price: $134 11/16 at 9:39am
Chg.: +1 5/16
Bid: $135 1/16
Ask: $135 1/8
</pre>

  <p>Like <tt>address</tt>, <tt>stock</tt> needs the LWP::UserAgent
  module because it's making a <tt>POST</tt> query.</p>

  <p>Just because LWP::UserAgent has an OO interface doesn't mean
  that the program has to spend an entire line creating an object
  and explicitly storing it (<tt>$object = new Class</tt>),
  although that was undoubtedly what Gisle Aas envisioned when he
  wrote the interface. Here, Dan's preoccupation with brevity
  shows, as he invokes an object's method in the same statement
  that creates the object: <tt>(new
  LWP::UserAgent)-&gt;request(...)</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
&#13;# Pulls a stock quote from Salomon Smith Barney's web site.
#
# Usage:       stock.pl ibm
#
# or whatever stock ticker symbol you like.
&#13;use LWP::UserAgent;
use HTTP::Request::Common;
&#13;$response = (new LWP::UserAgent)-&gt;request(POST
      'http://www.smithbarney.com/cgi-bin/benchopen/quoteget',
              [ search_type =&gt; "1",
              search_string =&gt; "$ARGV[0]" ]);
&#13;exit -1 unless $response-&gt;is_success;
$_ = $response-&gt;{_content};
s/&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;//g;
s/^.*recent close[^a-zA-Z0-9]+//s;
@t = split(/\n\n+/);
print shift(@t), "\n";
@h = split(/\n/, shift(@t));
foreach (@h){
    ($f = shift(@t)) =~ s/\n//g;
    next unless $f =~ /\d/; # Skip fields without digits
    print $_, ": ", $f, " ";
    print " at ", shift(@t) if /L/;
    print "\n";
}
</pre>

  <h3>Whee</h3>

  <p>These aren't robust programs. They were dashed off in a couple
  of minutes for one person's pleasure, and they most certainly
  will break as the companies in charge of these pages change the
  web pages formats or the URLs needed to access them.</p>

  <p>We don't care. When that happens, these scripts will break,
  we'll notice that, and we'll amend them accordingly. Sure, each
  of these programs could be made much more flexible. They could be
  primed to adapt to changes in the HTML, the way a human would if
  the information were moved around on the web page. Then the
  <tt>s///</tt> expressions would fail, and the programs could
  expend some effort trying to understand the HTML using a more
  intelligent parsing scheme, perhaps using the HTML::Parse or
  Parse::RecDescent modules. If the URL became invalid, the scripts
  might start at the site home page and pretend to be a naive user
  looking for his weather or news or stock fix. A smart enough
  script could start at Yahoo and follow links until it found what
  it was looking for, but so far no one has been smart enough to
  write a script like that.</p>

  <p>Of course, the time needed to create and test such programs
  would be much longer than making quick, brittle, and incremental
  changes to the code already written. No, it's not rocket
  science--it's not even computer science--but it gets the job
  done.</p>
