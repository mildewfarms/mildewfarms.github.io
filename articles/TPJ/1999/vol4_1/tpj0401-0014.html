  <p>This article is about building your own Perl under Win32 with
  non-proprietary solutions. In other words, I won't be talking
  about building Perl with Microsoft's or Borland's development
  tools, nor about ActiveState's precompiled version of Perl. In
  fact, this article is my sales pitch to you, the Win32 developer,
  to build your own Perl from the source kit that you'll find on
  CPAN. I'll address various mechanisms for building Perl and
  discuss why you might or might not want to use them.</p>

  <p>Why would you want to build your own Perl binary with
  non-proprietary solutions? Five reasons:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You don't have a compiler, and don't want to buy Borland
    C++ or Microsoft Visual C++, the two compilers supported by the
    ActiveState distribution.</li>

    <li>You want to compile XS extensions with another
    compiler.</li>

    <li>You can't get non-XS modules to build or function
    correctly, particularly those which involve sockets or web
    applications.</li>

    <li>You'd like to install Perl in a different place and the
    pre-compiled version doesn't let you.</li>

    <li>You've noticed that some function is implemented under Unix
    Perl but not your Win32 Perl.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I'll show you two free development environments for Windows:
  Cygwin32 and Mingw32. Cygwin32 has a Unix emulation library that
  provides signals, sockets, <tt>fork()</tt>, and all the other
  things Windows lacks. Mingw32 is a set of Unix-like compiler
  tools (<i>ld</i>, <i>ar</i>, etc.) that doesn't attempt to
  emulate Unix at all (although it does fix a few of the things
  that Windows got wrong, like <tt>select()</tt>).</p>

  <p>I'll show you how the two differ in their support for things
  like sockets, <tt>fork()</tt>, and permissions. Then I'll give
  step-by-step instructions for building Perl under each. Finally,
  I'll talk about building <i>extensions</i>--Perl modules that use
  C code under the hood.</p>

  <p>In this article, Perl and examples were built and tested on a
  200MHz Pentium Pro with SCSI and 64M RAM running Windows NT
  Workstation 4.0.</p>

  <h3>Cygwin32: An Overview</h3>

  <p>Cygwin32 is a complete Unix emulation library, with a whole
  suite of Unix-like tools--essentially all the <i>/bin</i> and
  <i>/usr/bin</i> programs Unix folks are familiar with.</p>

  <p>It comes with ports of the GNU development tools (<i>gcc</i>,
  <i>ld</i>, <i>ar</i>, and so on). There's also a replacement for
  <i>gcc</i> called <i>egcs</i> (pronounced "eggs"). <i>egcs</i> is
  far superior to Cygwin32's <i>gcc</i> for both performance and
  reliability.</p>

  <p>Developers interact with Cygwin32 through the <i>bash</i>
  shell, although you can install others if you wish. All programs
  built with Cygwin32 rely on the <tt>CYGWIN32.DLL</tt> library for
  Unix emulation, so this library must be distributed with any
  programs you compile.</p>

  <p>Although Cygwin32 allows users to create libraries in the Unix
  style with <i>ar</i> and <i>ranlib</i>, one of the Cygwin goals
  was to have compilers and tools capable of working with Win32
  object files written in Microsoft's Portable Executable (PE)
  format. The other goal was to support the Win32 API, specifically
  modifying the GNU binutils so that they could build DLLs
  (Dynamically Linked Libraries).</p>

  <p>Since <tt>CYGWIN.DLL</tt> uses the Win32 API, it runs on all
  Win32 hosts--but with Windows 95/98 instead of NT your mileage
  will certainly vary. Given that Windows NT implements a POSIX
  subsystem and Windows 95 does not, you'll find that Windows 95/98
  won't pass many of the tests that NT will. In my opinion, there's
  so much missing in Windows 95/98 that you should spend the $200
  on Windows NT Workstation so that your software will build
  correctly.</p>

  <p>In short, Cygwin32 is trying to emulate a Unix kernel. There
  is appropriate process control; processes can communicate with
  one another (<tt>fork()</tt> with parents and children);
  processes can trap signals, and so on.</p>

  <h3>MINGW32: An Overview</h3>

  <p>The Minimalist GNU Win32 (Mingw32) package was written
  (according to its maintainer) "out of personal frustration with
  Cygwin32. I didn't need the Unix stuff, and thought that it was
  too slow and cumbersome." Mingw32 is nothing more than a set of
  header files and a library to let a GNU compiler (<i>gcc</i> or
  <i>egcs</i>) link against the standard Windows runtime libraries.
  As with Cygwin32, <i>egcs</i> is recommended.</p>

  <p>Because Mingw32 doesn't have a Unix emulation layer, you don't
  need to distribute an emulation DLL with your compiled programs.
  However, you sacrifice the convenience of simply being able to
  compile any Unix-reliant source. When you build Perl, you'll be
  building a Windows port, not a Unix port. This means, for
  instance, that <tt>fork()</tt> won't work.</p>

  <p>Like Cygwin32, Mingw32 can build standard Windows DLLs and
  link against PE libraries. Both Mingw32 and Cygwin32 are
  supported ways of building Perl on Windows. But each has their
  own traps and pitfalls, and we'll explore them now.</p>

  <h3>Gotchas!</h3>

  <p>No matter how much a Win32 product resembles Unix, remember
  that you're still dealing with Win32, so building software still
  has its gotchas. This section describes them: filesystem
  permissions, files and paths, linefeeds, symbolic links, how Perl
  is invoked, <tt>select()</tt>, <tt>crypt()</tt>, and
  threading.</p>

  <p><b>Filesystem Permissions.</b> Unlike the Unix model of file
  permissions, Windows NT implements a security model which employs
  Access Control Lists (ACLs). Cygwin32 takes these ACL entries and
  works with them in a Unix-like fashion. Windows 95/98 doesn't
  even have ACLs, so Cygwin32 makes all files appear to be owned by
  a default user and group.</p>

  <p>Neither Windows NT nor 95/98 can <tt>chown()</tt> files
  because neither operating system has any concept of UIDs under
  the Win32 API. You'll likely want to read the Cygwin
  documentation about security problems with shared memory and
  stored processes that can be modified by intruders.</p>

  <p><b>Files and Paths.</b> Cygnus supports both Win32
  (<tt>C:\this\that</tt>) and POSIX-style (<tt>/this/that</tt>)
  paths. On a Unix machine, <tt>/floppy</tt> and <tt>/cdrom</tt>
  might represent different devices where these "mounts" (I use the
  term loosely) appear on a Win32 system as <tt>a:\</tt> and
  <tt>d:\</tt>. Current Win32 Perl ports allow you to open files on
  different devices like so:</p>
  <pre>
#!perl
$floppy = 'a:/';
$cdrom = 'd:/';
&#13;opendir(FLOP, $floppy) or die("Can't open floppy $floppy: $!");
opendir(CD, $cdrom) or die("Can't open cdrom: $cdrom: $!");
</pre>

  <p>Cygwin allows you to mount (strictly speaking, 'map') these
  devices under a slash partition. <tt>A:\</tt> could get mounted
  on <tt>/a</tt> and <tt>D:\</tt> could get mounted on <tt>/d</tt>.
  Cygwin32's <tt>mount</tt> command works just like its Unix
  sibling:</p>
  <pre>
mount &lt;win32:deviceletter&gt; &lt;/unix_mount_point&gt;
mount D:/ /cdrom
</pre>

  <p>Mounting devices this way makes your code more portable in an
  environment where code is shared by both Unix and NT machines.
  With mounted devices, you can read a directory just like you
  would on a Unix machine:</p>
  <pre>
#!perl
&#13;$floppy = '/floppy';
opendir(FLOP, $floppy) or die("Can't open $floppy: $!");
</pre>

  <p>Wow! So this is <i>just like my Unix machine</i>! Well, not
  exactly. You've probably noticed that Win32 can preserve case
  when it wants to; you can save a file under Windows NT as
  <tt>FoOBaR.TxT</tt> and Windows NT will tell you that there's a
  file named <tt>FoOBaR.TxT</tt>. But you cannot write another file
  in the same directory called <tt>FOOBAR.TXT</tt>,
  <tt>foobar.txt</tt>, or <tt>FooBar.txt</tt>, because Win32
  filesystems remain case insensitive. The Cygwin32 developers
  believe that few Unix programs rely on case distinction, and
  chose not to add the overhead that case-sensitivity would
  require.</p>

  <p><b>Linefeeds.</b> By default, Cygwin32 uses Win32 linefeeds
  and end-of-line terminators. If you're going to use any
  <tt>fopen(3)</tt> or <tt>open(2)</tt>calls in your programs
  (that's not Perl's <tt>open()</tt>, but the system's native
  <tt>open()</tt>), you must use the associated binary flags
  (<tt>b</tt> and <tt>O_BINARY</tt> respectively). If you don't
  want to mess with every piece of software that opens files, you
  can also mount your working directory with the <tt>-b</tt>flag.
  One way or another you'll need to address this issue; if you
  don't, you'll experience undesirable behavior like missing
  characters and truncated files when opened for writing. Programs
  like <i>gdbm</i> won't build or work correctly; nor will Perl's
  filehandles and modules or File::Copy.</p>

  <p><b>Symbolic links.</b> A symbolic link is an entry in your
  filesystem that isn't a file at all, but really a pointer to
  another file elsewhere. In the case of <tt>CYGWIN.DLL</tt>, a
  file gets generated with a "magic cookie" or "magic header" when
  you create a symbolic link. It isn't really all that "magic" if
  you think about it--under Cygwin32, a symbolic link is nothing
  more than a file with another file listed in its header. If
  you're using Windows 95/98 (or any FAT file system), you'll be
  disappointed to note that the symbolic link command won't fail;
  it will just copy the original file wherever you've created the
  link. Yes, this stinks--but it's true. Symbolic links under
  Windows 95/98 mean loads of duplicate files.</p>

  <p><b>Invoking Perl.</b> If you're like me, you've been spending
  most of your time in a Unix environment. You've probably written
  some shell scripts, and if you're reading this article, you're
  also likely to have programmed in Perl. If this is the case,
  you're familiar with Unix's "shebang" path notion--
  <tt>#!/use/this/program/to/execute/the/rest/of/the/file.</tt></p>

  <p>Cygwin32 supports shebang paths for programs executed in the
  Cygwin32 environment. This means that if you run your program
  from <i>bash</i>, the Cygwin32 Unix emulator will understand the
  <tt>#!</tt> notation, but if you run your program from NT's
  <tt>cmd</tt>, 95's <tt>COMMAND.COM</tt>, the <tt>4DOS</tt> shell,
  or from the desktop or Explorer, Cygwin32 is not involved and
  your Perl script will not be recognized.</p>

  <p><tt>cmd</tt> is also impaired when it comes to quoting and
  writing lengthy one-liners. Under <tt>cmd</tt>, one-liners like
  this won't work:</p>
  <pre>
perl -MTk -e '$mw = MainWindow-&gt;new(); \
      $mw-&gt;Button(-text=&gt; qw(Hi), -cmd =&gt; \
      sub {exit})-&gt;pack(); \
      MainLoop;'
</pre>

  <p>Sadly, any simplistic one-liner using single quotes will fail
  under <tt>cmd</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
perl -e 'foreach $number (1..100) { print("$number\n"); }'
</pre>

  <p><tt>cmd</tt> doesn't support single quotes at all! You'll need
  to use double quotes. Even then, this version of the one-liner
  above is broken:</p>
  <pre>
perl -e "foreach $number (1..100) { print("$number\n"); }"
</pre>

  <p>You'll need to escape the quotes inside of <tt>print</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
perl -e "foreach $number (1..100) { print(\"$number\n\"); }"
</pre>

  <p>So, if you plan on building Perl with Mingw32 so that it can
  be executed from <tt>cmd</tt>, please be prepared to flog
  yourself. Or, you can wrap your Perl script in a batch file with
  the <i>pl2bat</i> utility, as documented in your Perl
  distribution's <tt>README.win32</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Select<i>.</i></b> Cygnus's developers were mortified when
  they realized that Win32's <tt>select()</tt> only supported
  socket handles. In other words, Win32 decided to break the Unix
  dictum of Everything Is A File; Cygnus unbroke this
  implementation. They needed to rewrite <tt>select()</tt> to
  support a number of file descriptors, including sockets and
  pipes; now <tt>select()</tt> works fine under Cygwin32. Mingw32
  also has a working <tt>select()</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Crypt.</b> Mingw32 and Cygwin32 are missing
  <tt>crypt()</tt> because of US government restrictions on the
  export of cryptographic software. If you need <tt>crypt()</tt>,
  obtain the <i>libdes</i> library listed at the beginning of this
  article. Versions newer than 3.06 will not work because some of
  the functions in <tt>fcrypt.c</tt> have changed.</p>

  <p>You <i>can</i> build Perl without <tt>des_fcrypt()</tt>, but
  Perl's <tt>crypt</tt> builtin will then fail with a <tt>crypt()
  not implemented due to excessive paranoia</tt> error when
  <tt>crypt</tt> is called at run-time.</p>

  <p><b>Threading.</b> Mingw32 is thread-safe; Cygwin32 is not.
  Cygwin32's <i>libc</i> and <i>libm</i> aren't reentrant, which
  means that threading won't work--although it should in the
  future. Cygwin32 also locks memory shared by multiple processes,
  which can lead to race conditions in threaded programs. Mingw32
  is thread-safe because it's using Microsoft libraries capable of
  threading; you cannot use this threading if you choose to use
  other libraries that aren't thread-safe.</p>

  <h3>Making Things Work</h3>

  <p><b>Cygnus.</b> You'll want a beefy machine with a good
  processor, lots of RAM, and SCSI. As noted above, Cygwin32 is
  incredibly effective but rather slow; the giveaway was when
  Configure took 35 minutes to run with the <tt>-ders</tt> flags.
  You should download the distribution and <i>egcs</i> replacement
  from the sites listed at the beginning of this article.</p>

  <p>If you've already installed Cygwin32, you're now ready to
  build Perl. Be sure to mount the directory where you're keeping
  your Perl source in binary mode.</p>

  <p>You should also be aware that some of the Cygwin32 socket
  calls are a bit flaky. I've been able to build Perl with vanilla
  Win32 sockets (winsock) instead of Cygwin32's Unix equivalents.
  According to the Cygwin32 FAQ:</p>

  <p>To use the vanilla Win32 winsock, you just need to <tt>#define
  Win32_Winsock</tt> and <tt>#include "windows.h"</tt> at the top
  of your source file(s). You'll also want to add
  <tt>-lwsock32</tt> to the compiler's command line so you link
  against <tt>libwsock32.a</tt>.</p>

  <p>This means that you'll have to include <tt>windows.h</tt> in
  the appropriate <tt>.h</tt> file in your Perl distribution and
  add <tt>-lwsock32</tt> to the list of libraries that you'll add
  when you run Configure.</p>

  <p>If you attempt to run Configure interactively (that is,
  without a <tt>-d</tt> flag), you'll find that <tt>sh.exe</tt>
  skips every other line. This is a known Cygwin32 bug and the
  remedy is to use Sergei's "coolview" patch set, listed on the
  "Related Links" page of the Cygnus website. And if you're using
  Cygwin b20 or newer, this problem should have disappeared
  entirely.</p>

  <p>I've found that the best (and fastest) way to get around a
  slow Configure process is to copy <tt>hints/cygwin.sh</tt> to
  <tt>$PERLSOURCEDIR/config.sh</tt>. Edit <tt>config.sh</tt> and
  plug in values to match your system's configuration; when you're
  done, run Configure with the <tt>-ders</tt> options.</p>

  <p>Once Configure finishes, execute a <tt>make depend</tt> and
  then a <tt>make</tt>. <i>Please</i> also run a <tt>make
  test</tt>; Under Windows NT, you'll pass about 90-95% of the
  tests. Then <tt>make install</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Mingw32.</b> I've had the most success with Mingw32 (98% of
  the tests passed with Perl 5.005_02) and <i>egcs-1.1</i>. The
  Perl build, test, and install took about a half hour (26 minutes
  longer than it took under FreeBSD-2.2.7). Although the
  <i>egcs</i> compilers are still considered experimental, there
  are plenty of anecdotes about peoples' experiences on the
  perl5-porters mailing list archives. Mumit Khan, <i>egcs</i>
  developer, has been quite active in these discussions.</p>

  <p>To begin the process, retrieve and install Mingw32.
  <i>Don't</i> use any Cygwin-based tools (like <i>tar</i>) to
  extract these distributions because of the end-of-line problems
  mentioned above; you need WinZip or Pkunzip. You shouldn't need
  to reboot your machine: just modify your PATH and hit the
  <tt>Apply</tt> button under <tt>Control
  Panel/System/Environment</tt>. Make sure that you restart your
  DOS shell before proceeding. Run <tt>mingw32.bat</tt>; this sets
  up your <tt>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</tt>, necessary for things to build
  (see the Mingw32 README for details). It is suggested that you
  write a simple C program to ensure that <i>gcc</i> is working
  correctly before trying to compile Perl.</p>

  <p>Under NT, make sure to run <tt>cmd</tt> from your DOS prompt.
  You might have weird results if you don't use <tt>cmd</tt>, and
  it's quite likely that tests will fail (for no reason) even if
  Perl seems to build correctly. Change directories into
  <tt>C:\base\perldir\win32</tt> and edit <tt>makefile.mk</tt>.</p>

  <p><tt>CCHOME</tt> should point to your compiler, which will
  initially be <i>gcc</i>; you should have installed
  <i>egcs-1.1</i> in <tt>C:\EGCS-1.1</tt>, so <tt>CCHOME</tt>
  should be set to <tt>C:\EGCS-1.1</tt>. Make sure that
  <tt>INC</tt> (or <tt>INCLUDE</tt>) points to
  <tt>$CCHOME\include</tt> and <tt>LIB</tt> (or <tt>LIBS</tt>)
  points to <tt>$CCHOME\lib</tt>. If you don't do this, you will
  get a slew of errors early in the build process.</p>

  <p>You can build a threaded version of 5.005_02 under Mingw32,
  but you can't currently enable both threading and
  <tt>PERL_OBJECT</tt>, which is specific to Perl for Win32. You
  can get only one of them in a Perl interpreter.</p>

  <p>If you choose to build with <tt>crypt()</tt> support, point
  <tt>CRYPT_SRC</tt> at the file that implements
  <tt>des_fcrypt()</tt>--<tt>fcrypt.c</tt>. Or, if you've already
  built <i>libdes</i>, you can link against <tt>CRYPT_LIB</tt>.
  Frankly, it's pretty easy to just use <tt>CRYPT_SRC</tt>.</p>

  <p>Type <tt>dmake</tt> to build the software, <tt>dmake test</tt>
  to run the test suite, and <tt>dmake install</tt> once you're
  convinced that everything is okay. When all is done, you should
  have a functional <tt>perl.</tt></p>

  <p>You'll need to include Perl's location in your PATH, as shown
  in <tt>README.win32</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
set PATH c:\perl\5.005\bin;c:\perl\5.005\bin\MSWin32-x6;%PATH%
</pre>

  <h3>Extensions</h3>

  <p>One of the advantages of building your own Perl is the ability
  to work with your own compiler--and therefore XS, so you can
  create Perl hooks into speedy compiled C code. When you built
  your own Perl, a file called <tt>Config.pm</tt> was written
  containing all of the information about your system and
  development environment (compiler type, libraries, paths, and so
  on). When you build modules, particularly those which call
  external code via XS, you'll be working with <tt>make</tt> and
  your compiler. Like your Unix compatriots, you should be able to
  do this:</p>
  <pre>
C:\&gt; perl Makefile.PL
C:\&gt; dmake
C:\&gt; dmake test
C:\&gt; dmake install
</pre>

  <p>And now things should work.</p>
