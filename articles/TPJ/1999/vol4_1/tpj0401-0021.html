    <i>Know when to forgo an advantage.</i>

    <p align="right">--Benjamin Disraeli</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Strap yourself into your program's cockpit. <i>Gentlemen,
  start your sockets!</i> boom the echoing bullhorns. The
  connections rev up and block for the server's signal. A green
  flag waves and your program is off! It's the first (and possibly
  last) annual <i>Solitaire 500,</i> a no-algorithms-barred
  competition to have your program be the first to organize and
  discard 500 shuffled decks of cards.</p>

  <p><b>Speed matters.</b> A glance at any of the Usenet
  programming newsgroups reveals innumerable examples of arguments
  over fine points of programming, seemingly authoritatively
  settled when someone benchmarks example code. There is a lot of
  interest in speed, but execution speed is rarely made a criterion
  in programming contests. Bucking the hardware-industry-inspired
  trend against fast software, the Solitaire 500 is a race. Entries
  that survive a qualification round will compete against one
  another to find which can finish an identical series of puzzles
  first.</p>

  <h3>Wheels</h3>

  <p>The game is called "Wheels." It is solvable, predictable, and
  can take hours to play by hand. A deck of cards is won when all
  thirteen sets of four cards have been matched and discarded.</p>

  <p>To play Wheels, lay four cards from the top of the deck left
  to right, face up. The cards now mark the location of the four
  game piles, which for the purposes of this contest are numbered
  0,1,2,3. If the top (visible) cards on any two piles match in
  rank, (e.g. two of the four cards you see are sevens) the card to
  the right <i>may</i> be moved to cover the matching card to its
  left (e.g. you may move a seven from pile 2 on top of a seven on
  pile 0 or 1.) This step may be (and often is) repeated.</p>

  <p>When it is no longer possible (or desirable) to group like
  cards, another four cards are dealt face up atop the four piles.
  If all four freshly dealt cards match in rank, they are moved to
  the discard pile where they remain for the rest of the game. When
  the entire deck is dealt into the four game piles and the last
  moves made, the piles are stacked together, flipped over, and
  another round begins. The order in which the piles are restacked
  is up to you. Wheels has two opportunities for player decisions:
  You choose when to move matching cards to the left and you choose
  how to restack your cards. That's all there is to it.</p>

  <p>Discarding, rare in the first few rounds, happens regularly in
  later rounds. Chaos magically transforms into order at a
  satisfyingly increasing rate as the cards become better grouped
  and there are fewer cards to deal out in each round. Unless you
  get stuck in an endless loop, all the cards will eventually be
  discarded, and you can break out of endless loops by either
  choosing not to make legal moves, or varying the order in which
  the game piles are picked up. Those choices can also be used to
  find an optimal strategy: When playing by hand, you'll inevitably
  experience a sense that had you left just one more card in some
  pile last round, several sets could have been discarded this
  round. D'oh!</p>

  <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>

  <p>Unlike the "Stones" contest from TPJ #7, when entries were
  subroutines called by a larger program managing one-on-one
  matches, all entries in the Solitaire 500 will run
  simultaneously. In a perfect world we'd give each program their
  own identical computer to run on. Or the contest would be held
  over the Internet, with contestants responsible for their own
  hardware and connection, and a single central server with limited
  bandwidth to equalize the advantages of fast connections or
  computers. But this is not a perfect world, and all of the
  entries in this contest will be timesharing the single CPU of the
  "arena" machine and communicating with the server via TCP/IP
  streams. (The "arena" machine is a POSIX-compliant single
  processor computer with enough RAM and swap space to accommodate
  all of the qualifying entries. It should comfortably handle two
  dozen simultaneous entries. In the event of an overwhelming
  turnout, the entries may be assigned to multiple identical arenas
  in a round-robin. Whatever it takes, the contest will be run in a
  timeshared virtual memory environment and all entries will
  communicate via TCP/IP with the server program running on a
  different computer.) The server will run on a different machine
  to prevent the server from stealing the contestants' cycles.
  Working sample code implementing the networking layer of your
  client program is provided.</p>

  <h3>The Protocol</h3>

  <p>The Stateful Wheels Protocol has two states: authentication
  and play. On connecting, the server issues a login request, which
  must be answered with a valid <i>username:password</i> string,
  followed by a newline.</p>

  <p>In the play state, the server keeps track of the client's
  game, and only allows legal moves.</p>

  <p>All lines are terminated with newlines, so that lines can be
  read using <tt>&lt;SOCK&gt;</tt> on both ends without changing
  <tt>$/</tt>. After the client has authenticated itself, the play
  state begins, with the initial stack of decks. Note that a client
  can have only one socket open at a time. If a client disconnects
  and reconnects, the game is preserved.</p>

  <p>Play consists of instructions from the client to the server,
  each containing one or more commands. and the server's responses.
  Recognized commands include:</p>

  <p><tt><b>status</b></tt>: get the current status of your
  game</p>

  <p><tt><b>lay</b></tt>: shift four cards from the deck in hand to
  the piles</p>

  <p><tt><b>discard</b></tt>: when the four top cards match, get
  rid of them</p>

  <p><tt><b>NN</b></tt>: move a card from the top of one pile to
  the top of a lower numbered pile (N is one of 0,1,2,3)</p>

  <p><tt><b>NNNN</b></tt>: pick up all four piles and place them on
  the bottom of the deck.</p>

  <p><tt><b>win</b></tt>: after discarding all thirteen sets from a
  deck, start next deck</p>

  <p><tt><b>sync</b></tt>: a command matching <tt>/^sync\w+/</tt>
  results in the command being returned to the client, to help with
  any data buffering problems that may occur.</p>

  <p><tt><b>close</b></tt>: close the socket, should you want
  to.</p>

  <p><tt><b>dump</b></tt>: print the game state--where all the
  cards are--into the server log, for client debugging.</p>

  <p>To discourage fast, light, brute force clients that rely on
  the server's error codes for all their move selection, a maximum
  of one move-containing instruction for each client will be
  allowed during each second. Also, a one second pit stop will be
  required for each illegal move. An entry that issues <tt>"lay lay
  lay lay lay lay lay lay lay lay lay lay lay\n"</tt> for its first
  instruction, proceeds to solve the whole deck, and issues its
  solution in a single newline-terminated write to its socket will
  incur no delay at all, as the computation will surely take longer
  than one second.</p>

  <p>Every server response will be either a status line (if your
  move is successful) or an error message (if it's not). The status
  line always begins <tt>OK</tt>, and then shows the four visible
  top cards, the time in seconds since the beginning of the game,
  what round we're on, what move we're on, how many sets are left
  in the deck in hand, and which deck we are using of all the decks
  in the current puzzle. (Decks start with thirteen sets, because
  there are 4 * 13 = 52 cards in a deck.) The following log excerpt
  is based on a test run of the "pace car"--a default client you
  can find on the TPJ web site--on a set of eight decks, after it
  had solved decks one, two, and three, and discarded three sets
  from deck four.</p>

  <p>The King of Spades in pile 3 was moved on top of the King of
  Diamonds in pile 2 with the <tt>NN</tt> instruction <tt>32,</tt>
  revealing the Three of Clubs in pile 3 which could then be moved

  <p>Assuming we've really been doing our homework, we can issue a
  whole stream of instructions and they will be executed in order.
  To prevent deadlocks caused by miscounting the number of

</pre>

  <p>If you want to test your client, use the server at <a href=
  "http://www.tipjar.com/games/solitaire/wheels/server" target=
  "resource window">http://www.tipjar.com/games/solitaire/wheels/server</a>.
  An accompanying card-shuffling utility is at /wheels/shuffle.</p>

  <p>The server keeps whoami:password data in its invocation
  directory, in a file called <i>passwd</i>. You'll need to create
  this file to test your program--or, better yet, just comment out
  the password-checking code.</p>

  <p>Entries must make use of the <tt>SWP_SERVERNAME</tt>,
  <tt>SWP_SERVERPORT</tt>, and <tt>SWP_PASSWORD</tt> environment
  variables (as demonstrated in the pace car client) to connect to
  the server.</p>

  <p>Again, the source code for the pace car can be found at:
  <a href="http://www.tipjar.com/games/solitaire/wheels" target=
  "resource window">http://www.tipjar.com/games/solitaire/wheels</a>.
  Its networking options are configured with environment variables
  containing the location of the server and the password to use on
  connection. The default is to communicate on <tt>localhost</tt>,
  port 5200, so that both server and client can run on the same
  machine for testing.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the race the server will be started with a
  fresh <tt>decks.dat</tt> file containing shuffled decks.
  <i>"Gentlemen, start your sockets!"</i> will be called out and
  the entry programs will be started on the arena machine and
  allowed to authenticate. The <tt>Connect()</tt> subroutine from
  the pace car, based on example clients in the <i>perlipc</i>
  documentation bundled with Perl, may be used in all entries. On
  race day the correct environment variables will be provided to
  the entries so that they can locate the server, connect,
  authenticate, and play the game.</p>

  <p>Once the TCP connection is made, the <tt>Connect()</tt>
  function reads the server's greeting message, gives the server a
  username/password pair, and nips misconfiguration in the bud by
  <tt>die</tt>ing unless the server sends back a line beginning
  <tt>OK</tt>. If program flow returns from a call to
  <tt>Connect()</tt>, the dynamic socket handle <tt>SOCK</tt> is
  connected to the server and the race commences.</p>

  <p>The pace car operates with almost no intelligence at all,
  dealing cards and then attempting all possible moves until none
  of them gets an <tt>OK</tt> response. When it has dealt the whole
  deck, which it knows about by checking <tt>$Count</tt>, it picks
  up the cards in a random order. It avoids endless loops by
  counting the number of rounds it has gone without discarding and
  skipping possible moves more and more often as the number of
  rounds without a discard increases. I have not proven that this
  method of loop avoidance always finishes, but it has completed
  all the decks I've dealt it so far.</p>

  <p>The pace car could easily be improved upon and made into a
  viable contestant. <i>Any</i> move selection algorithm would be
  an improvement. The loop avoidance strategy could be revised. A
  second thread could be started to handle communications.
  Extensive advance planning could be done with virtual game
  states, heuristics, and breadth-first searches. An optimal mix of
  lexical and dynamic variables could be explored.</p>

  <h3>The Rules</h3>

  <p>Please try to keep the disk space used by your entry under 50
  megabytes. In case of disk space problems, entries growing beyond
  that ample limit (enough to store hundreds of thousands of game
  states without resorting to the Huffman tables discussed by
  Mark-Jason Dominus last issue) may be disqualified.</p>

  <p><b>50 Trial laps.</b> A sequence of fifty shuffled decks will
  be prepared and loaded into the server. The "pace car" will be
  started, and its time, number of moves, and number of rounds to
  complete all fifty decks will be measured. Each entry will then
  be measured similarly. The 24 entries with the lowest round count
  qualify for the race. If there are more than 72 entries, the best
  third will qualify.</p>

  <p><b>Race.</b> The server will be loaded with a sequence of 500
  shuffled decks, and move and error delays will be enabled. Once
  all entrants have established their sockets, the server will
  begin normal operation. The winning entry will be the first to
  issue a legal <tt>win</tt> instruction on the last deck.</p>

  <p><b>Prizes.</b> Here is the list of prizes we know about at
  press time. More may follow, watch http://www.tipjar.com/
  games/solitaire/wheels.html for the latest updates.</p>

  <p>First prize: Two year subscription to TPJ, and $100.</p>

  <p>Second prize: One year subscription to TPJ, and $50.</p>

  <p>All qualifying entries: Perl Mongers T-shirts.</p>

  <p>Honorable mentions will be awarded based on readability,
  elegance, creativity, attitude, or anything else deemed
  worthy.</p>

  <p>Only one entry per entrant is allowed. Entries must be
  received before <b>May 1, 1999</b>. Entries written entirely in
  Perl may be submitted as plain text email. More complex entries
  can be (optionally gzipped) tar files, MIME-attached to mail sent
  to <b>programmingcontest@tipjar.com</b>.</p>

  <p>Entries can also be submitted on 3.5 inch floppies (include
  your name and address on the label) and mailed to:</p>

  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>

  <p>Your entry will be copied into a user directory on the arena
  machine. If you include an <tt>INSTALL</tt> script (say, to
  install any modules you might include with your entry), it will
  be run. Your entry must include a script called <tt>entry.pl</tt>
  that will be invoked via <tt>perl entry.pl</tt> for the trial lap
  and race. The <tt>SWP_SERVERNAME</tt> and <tt>SWP_PASSWORD</tt>
  environment variables will be set for your entry to use as in the
  example. Please include a <tt>README</tt> file listing any
  external utilities used by your entry so that links may be added
  if needed. The complete log of the race and time trials will be
  made available on the TPJ web site, including periodic runs of
  <tt>ps</tt> on the arena machine and the source code of all
  entries.</p>

  <p>Entrants maintain copyright on their entries but grant TPJ the
  right to edit, annotate, and publish their attributed entries
  both on the Internet and in print, now and in the future. This
  contest is not open to any board members or employees of David
  Nicol Consulting or their immediate family.</p>
