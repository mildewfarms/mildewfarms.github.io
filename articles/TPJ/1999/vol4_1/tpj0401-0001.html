  <h4>Chris Nandor</h4>

  <p><img src="images/news3.gif" align="left" hspace="0" width=
  "162" height="123">It is that time of year again, when a young
  man's fancy turns to thoughts of writing Perl News columns for
  The Perl Journal.</p>

  <p>By the time this glossy rag hits your cubicle's inbox, <b>Perl
  5.005_03</b> should be released. It is the first release of Perl
  since before the Perl Conference, and the first with Graham Barr
  as pumpking.</p>

  <p>The pumpkin for <b>5.004_05</b>, the latest maintenance
  release of the previous version of Perl, has been handed off from
  Tim Bunce to Chip Salzenberg, the original pumpkin holder for
  5.004.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in another part of Gotham, development on 5.006
  progresses under the watchful eye of Gurusamy Sarathy, and as of
  this writing the latest development release is <b>5.005_56</b>
  (which now includes JPL, Java/Perl Lingo, making good on
  O'Reilly's August promise to release JPL as free software).</p>

  <p>The Perl community is busy, as ever. <b>The O'Reilly Perl
  Conference</b> is headed into its third year, and O'Reilly has
  posted a Call for Participation, with abstracts for papers due
  April 9. TPC 3.0 will be held in Monterey, CA, on August
  21&shy;24, and will coincide with Linux, FreeBSD, Sendmail, and
  Open Source conferences.</p>

  <p><a href=
  "http://conference.perl.com/pace/conf/confdocs/call.html" target=
  "resource window">http://conference.perl.com/pace/conf/confdocs/call.html</a></p>

  <p><a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://conferences.oreilly.com/</a></p>

  <p>But O'Reilly isn't stopping there. The company is also holding
  Perl tutorials in Boston on April 27 and 28.</p>

  <p>And for those who can't fathom the fee of the O'Reilly
  offerings, Kevin Lenzo is organizing <b>Yet Another Perl
  Conference</b>, a low-cost gathering of Perlers at Carnegie
  Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, on June 24 and 25. Details
  are still being worked out, so keep checking Perl News and
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lenzo/yapc/ for more details.</p>

  <p>The <b>Second German Perl Conference</b> will probably take
  place March 8-10, 2000.</p>

  <p>Many more <b>Perl Mongers</b> (<a href="http://www.pm.org/"
  target="resource window">http://www.pm.org/</a>) groups have
  sprouted up across the globe. New groups in the United States
  include: Albuquerque NM, Anchorage AK, Charlotte NC,
  Charlottesville VA, Denver, Edmond OK, Hartford CT, Jacksonville
  FL, Kansas City MO, Knoxville TN, Las Vegas, Lynchburg VA, Miami,
  Nashua NH, Newald WI, Norwalk CT, Orlando FL, San Diego, Santa
  Rosa CA, Sherman Oaks CA, Tallahassee FL. Other new groups around
  the world include: &Aring;arhus (Denmark), Bandung (West Java),
  Bath (UK), Beijing (China), Belfast (Ireland), Brisbane
  (Queensland, Australia), Bristol (UK), Brunei, Chennai (India),
  Curitiba (Brazil), Delhi (India), Glasgow (Scotland), Helsinki
  (Finland), Islamabad (Pakistan), Jakarta (Indonesia), Karachi
  (Pakistan), Liege (Belgium), Limerick (Ireland), Magyar
  (Hungary), Malaysia, Mexico City, Montevideo (Uruguay), Moscow,
  New Zealand, Paris, Perth (Australia), Rome (Italy), Salzburg
  (Austria), Sarawak (East Malaysia), Shanghai (China), Singapore,
  Switzerland, Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada), and Zhengzhou
  (China).</p>

  <p>Phew. Say all that twelve times fast.</p>

  <p>A new Perl Mongers FAQ is available at <a href=
  "http://www.pm.org/faq.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.pm.org/faq.html</a>, and the Perl
  Mongers have also added several mailing lists, including
  perl-jobs-announce and perl-jobs-wanted (run by Uri Guttman),
  perl-mongers-announce (low volume, announce-only), and
  perl-mongers-general. To subscribe, mail <a href=
  "mailto:majordomo@hfb.pm.org">majordomo@hfb.pm.org</a> with the
  body <tt>subscribe</tt> <i>list mail-address</i>.</p>

  <p>The <b>Perl AI list</b> has moved to
  perl-ai@netizen.com.au.</p>

  <p>There are several new <b>MacPerl mailing lists</b> up too,
  inaugurating the brand-new macperl.org domain. Two old lists have
  moved there: macperl and macperl-announce. New lists are
  macperl-modules, macperl-toolbox, macperl-webcgi,
  macperl-porters, macperl-anyperl (discussion of cross-platform
  Perl), and macperl-forum (open discussion about anything relating
  to Perl, Macs, Apple, and so on). To subscribe to any of these
  lists, send mail to <a href=
  "mailto:listname-request@macperl.org"><i>listname</i>-request@macperl.org</a>,
  with a body of <tt>subscribe</tt>.</p>

  <p>Prime Time Freeware, which hosts the new MacPerl lists, has
  moved <b>The MacPerl Pages</b> to <a href=
  "http://www.macperl.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.macperl.com/</a>. In other MacPerl
  news, yours truly has released <b>cpan-mac</b>, an all-in-one,
  easy-to-install package containing everything one needs to
  download, unpack, and install modules, using either the CPAN
  module itself, or separate droplets that can perform the
  unpacking and installing. (The only thing it's missing is MacPerl
  itself.)</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/</a></p>

  <p>Also in that directory is a version of MacPerl built with the
  <tt>-DDEBUGGING</tt> flag, for use with Chip Salzenberg's article
  in TPJ #12.</p>

  <p>Currently over 20 modules have been ported or built for
  MacPerl and are listed on the <b>MacPerl Module Porters</b> page
  at <a href="http://pudge.net/mmp/" target=
  "resource window">http://pudge.net/mmp/</a>. Among the modules
  available are DBI, <b>Storable</b>, <b>Math::Random</b>, and
  XML<b>::Parser</b>.</p>

  <p>Most modules work fine under any platform, but to know whether
  or not a given module will work on yours, check the new home of
  the <b>CPAN Testers</b> at <a href=
  "http://www.perl.org/cpan-testers/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.org/cpan-testers/</a>. More
  testers are always welcome; see the page for details.</p>

  <p><b>The Linux Journal</b> readers recently picked Perl as the
  favorite programming language. We wonder, what would be the
  favorite OS of the Perl Journal readers? Mutual Admiration
  Society aside, Perl was also a finalist in PC Magazine's 1998
  Technical Excellence Award in the Development Tool category.</p>

  <p>The other two products up for the award were from
  Microsoft.</p>

  <p>ActiveState, which launched the <b>Perl Clinic</b> with the
  Paul Ingram Group to provide commercial Perl support, has now
  launched <b>PerlDirect</b>, a subscription support program
  featuring quarterly CDs, a Y2K test suite, weekly bulletin, and
  incident-based support through the Perl Clinic.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.perlclinic.com/" target=

  <p><a href="http://www.ActiveState.com/PerlDirect/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.ActiveState.com/PerlDirect/</a></p>

  <p>ActiveState has also been busy releasing new software.
  <b>ActivePerl</b>, the company's build of Perl 5.005_02 and
  related utilities, has reached build 509, the <b>Perl Development
  Kit 1.1</b> is in release candidate status, and <b>PerlEx 1.1</b>
  was released. PerlEx is a plugin for NT web servers to speed CGI
  performance.</p>

  <p>The <b>Apache</b> folks have a <b>mod_perl</b> developer's
  mini-guide available at <a href="http://perl.apache.org/guide/"
  target="resource window">http://perl.apache.org/guide/</a>.</p>

  <p><b>POE</b> (Perl Object Environment), by Rocco Caputo, is a
  programming framework for event-driven state machines. It is a
  cooperative multithreading model in pure Perl. It is a high-level
  interface to <tt>select()</tt>, alarms, and IPC. It is not easily
  explained by us. We hear there is a financial application using
  it that moves a billion euros a day.</p>

  <p><b>Raima</b> (<a href="http://www.raima.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.raima.com/</a>) has released
  <b>Velocis Database Server 2.1</b>, featuring DBI support, among
  other new features.</p>

  <p>The <b>Data Display Debugger</b>, a GUI front end to
  command-line debuggers for Unix and Windows at <a href=
  "http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/</a>, has
  added Perl support.</p>

  <p><b>WishPerl</b> is a pair of two (small) scripts, one in Perl
  and one in Tcl, enabling you to painlessly breed Perl modules
  with a Tcl/Tk/Tix GUI. Works on Unix with Perl 5, Win32 with
  YeP-perl, and MacPerl with Tcl/Tk 8.0.4 and the
  <b>Mac::AppleEvents::Simple</b> and <b>Mac::Apps::Launch</b>
  modules. It's available at <a href="http://www.qub.com/group/"
  target="resource window">http://www.qub.com/group/</a>.</p>

  <p>With its help, you can add a Tcl/Tk GUI to your Perl program
  quickly, make a new application with GUI events processed by some
  Perl engine, or just debug your Tcl script.</p>

  <p>Sean M. Burke's <b>Mac::FileSpec::Unixish</b> allows
  programmers to translate native filespecs into a Unixish format,
  and then convert Unixish pathspecs back into a native format.
  This module does the Right Thing under MacPerl or a Unix Perl, so
  it's now easier to write code under MacPerl and have it run under
  a Unix Perl, or vice versa. Sean also released
  <b>Sort::ArbBiLex</b>, which manufactures functions that sort
  according to any lexicographic sort order the user supplies, for
  single- or multi-character glyphs, without recourse to locales
  (ArbBiLex stands for "arbitrary bi-level lexicographic"). In
  addition, Sean wrote <b>Class::ISA</b>, providing functions that
  report the class names of an <tt>@ISA</tt> tree. It is useful for
  reading the <tt>$VERSION</tt> numbers across a network of classes
  and for various data-inheritance tasks.</p>

  <p>You want books? We've got new ones. Osborne/McGraw-Hill
  published <b>Perl Annotated Archives</b>, by Martin C. Brown,
  which features collections of programs that are heavily
  annotated, to aid in learning. Dave Roth, author of several Perl
  for Win32 extensions, wrote <b>Win32 Perl Programming: The
  Standard Extensions</b> for Macmillan. O'Reilly offers <b>Perl in
  a Nutshell</b> (Ellen Siever, Stephen Spainhour, and Nathan
  Patwardhan) and <b>Learning Perl/Tk</b> (Nancy Walsh). And
  Addison-Wesley published <b>Perl Power!</b>, by Michael
  Schilli.</p>

  <p>Tom Christiansen just released the <b>Perl Module-Writers
  Workbench</b> (<tt>pmtools</tt>), a suite of small programs to
  help manage modules. It follows the "keep it small" notion of
  many tiny tools each doing one thing well, with separate tools
  for finding modules, getting module versions, and so on.
  Available at <a href=
  "http://mox.perl.com/misc/pmtools-1.00.tar.gz" target=
  "resource window">http://mox.perl.com/misc/pmtools-1.00.tar.gz</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Net::Whois 0.23</b> has been released by Chip Salzenberg,
  fixing the parsing code to adapt to the new Internic format.</p>

  <p>The <b>Text::Thesaurus</b> module, by Martin Hamilton and Jon
  Knight, supports ISO thesaurus files from Perl programs. It's
  part of the ROADS bundle, which you can think of as a <b>free
  version of Yahoo.</b></p>

  <p>Mark-Jason Dominus released <b>Text::Template</b>, a module
  for filling text templates.</p>

  <p><b>Lingua::EN::Syllable</b>, from Greg Fast, estimates the
  number of syllables in an English word.</p>

  <p>Earl Hood's popular <b>MHonArc</b>, a program that converts
  MIME mail messages into an HTML archive, is now at version
  2.3.3.</p>

  <p><b>Gimp</b>, the Perl extension for the popular graphics
  package, the Gimp, has reached "Mature" status on the module
  list. The current version is 1.053.</p>

  <p>The <b>Bioperl Project</b> (<a href="http://bio.perl.org/"
  target="resource window">http://bio.perl.org/</a>) is a
  coordinated effort to collect bioinformatics and computational
  biology techniques into a set of standard, well-documented, and
  freely available Perl modules. The international group of
  developers has released its first set of core modules, and is
  available under the CPAN <b>Bio::</b> namespace.</p>

  <p>Mark Hershberger's <b>Image::Grab</b> module downloads images
  from the web.</p>

  <p>Johan Vromans just released three <b>PostScript::Font</b>
  modules that help you manipulate Type 1 PostScripts fonts from
  Perl.</p>

  <p>The <b>dupie</b> program, by Mark Hewitt, generates pie charts
  representing disk usage.</p>
