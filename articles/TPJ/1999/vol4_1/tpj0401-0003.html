  <h4>Kurt Starsinic</h4>

  <p>There is now a hierarchical index of scripts on CPAN!</p>

  <p>Most readers of TPJ are intimately familiar with CPAN, the
  Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. Recently, a new area was
  added to the Archive--the scripts repository. This is an area
  where you can find useful Perl programs, and where you can
  publish your own programs.</p>

  <p>Script authors have always been able to upload scripts to
  CPAN, but until now, there was no formal organization for them.
  There was an earlier attempt at a scripts repository, which still
  exists (but is no longer updated) at <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/scripts/legacy.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/scripts/legacy.html</a>.</p>

  <h3>What is CPAN?</h3>

  <p>In case you weren't familiar with it, CPAN is a worldwide
  collection of FTP servers. Tom Christiansen has made it easy to
  find a CPAN site near you with his multiplexer, available at
  <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN">http://www.perl.com/CPAN</a>.
  Note that there is no slash at the end of this URL.</p>

  <h3>How Can I Find a Script?</h3>

  <p>The index of scripts can be found at:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/scripts/index.html" target=
    "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/scripts/index.html</a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Scripts are arranged by category, and there is also a list
  arranged alphabetically by script name.</p>

  <h3>How Do I Create a Script?</h3>

  <p>First, you'll need to come up with a problem (in technical
  jargon, this is known as 'the easy part'). If you've determined
  that your problem hasn't been solved already (by someone else's
  script or module), write it.</p>

  <p>When your script is written and debugged, you'll need to give
  it a version number. It's recommended that you start with version
  number 0.01; that your version numbers contain only numeric
  characters, period (.), and underscore (_); and that you only
  insert an underscore in 'unstable' or 'development' version
  numbers. Use the version number as the last part of the filename,
  and also assign this number to the <tt>$VERSION</tt> variable in
  your script.</p>

  <p>To appear in the scripts area of CPAN, your script will need
  to contain some identifying information, in the form of pod
  documentation (if you're not familiar with pod, read the
  <i>perlpod</i> documentation bundled with Perl). There are
  several sections that you may wish to add to your script; the
  only essential one is the SCRIPT CATEGORIES section. This section
  tells CPAN that your file should appear in the scripts index; it
  must contain a list of categories (no more than three!) to which
  this script belongs. A more lengthy description of the format,
  along with an example script, can be seen at:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/scripts/submitting.html"
    target=
    "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/scripts/submitting.html</a>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>How Will I Choose a Script Category?</h3>

  <p>First, take a look at the currently existing categories. As of
  this writing, there are six:</p>

  <p>CGI<br>
  CGI/Filter<br>
  CPAN<br>
  CPAN/Administrative<br>
  Win32<br>
  Win32/Utilities</p>

  <p>If your script fits into one of these, great! If not, dream up
  your own--but you've got a little bit of work to do. Category
  creation is based on a peer review process; in this case, your
  peers are the members of the <a href=
  "mailto:scripts@perl.org">scripts@perl.org</a> mailing list. To
  participate in the process, first join the mailing list by
  sending email to <a href=
  "mailto:majordomo@cpan.org">majordomo@cpan.org</a> with a message
  body of <tt>subscribe scripts</tt>; then send email to the list
  explaining what your script does, and what new category you'd
  like to create. List members will discuss your proposal with you,
  and then, unless somebody comes up with a very good reason why
  your script doesn't belong in that category (or you withdraw your
  proposal), an administrator will inform you that the category has
  been created.</p>

  <h3>How Can I Upload a Script?</h3>

  <p>In order to have upload privileges, you will need a user ID on
  PAUSE (the Perl Authors Upload SErver). Instructions for
  registering your user ID and uploading files are published at</p>

  <blockquote>
    <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/04pause.html" target=
    "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/04pause.html</a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Once you have an ID, you can put files on CPAN. First, you'll
  upload your script via anonymous FTP to <a href=
  "ftp://pause.kbx.de/incoming">ftp://pause.kbx.de/incoming/</a>.
  Then, you'll claim ownership of it (so that it will go into your
  personal CPAN directory, and will also appear in the scripts
  index). You claim ownership at <a href=
  "https://pause.kbx.de/perl/user/add_uri">https://pause.kbx.de/perl/user/add_uri</a>.</p>

  <h3>Finally!</h3>

  <p>Once you click <tt>Submit</tt>, your file is on its way to
  CPAN; it will appear in about two hours (some CPAN sites mirror
  less frequently than others, so your mileage may vary). Tell your
  friends!</p>

  <h3>What Next?</h3>

  <p>After you've been through this process once, you might want to
  create more scripts! Consider using the additional pod sections
  (PREREQUISITES, COREQUISITES, OSNAMES, and README); or include a
  script in a tarfile that contains scripts, modules, and
  documentation.</p>

  <h3>Still to Come</h3>

  <p>The scripts index is in its early stages of development, and
  comments, suggestions, and submissions are welcomed.</p>

  <p>Improvements likely in the near term include a more attractive
  hierarchical index; keyword searching; display of brief
  descriptions in the index; and an alphabetical listing split into
  multiple pages.</p>

  <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

  <p>Andreas K&ouml;nig very generously gave me an account on the
  PAUSE server, and patiently explained many details of PAUSE,
  MakeMaker, and CPAN.</p>

  <p>Jarkko Hietaniemi helped work out some of the kinks in the
  scripts directory structure, and made many helpful suggestions
  along the way. And in dozens of email messages about broken
  hyperlinks, he never once used profanity.</p>

  <p>Nathan Torkington (on behalf of The Perl Institute) was
  instrumental in encouraging the CPAN team to actually get
  something <i>done</i>.</p>

  <h3>Uploading a Script Step by Step</h3>

  <p>Get a PAUSE ID:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
To: modules@perl.org
Subject: PAUSE registration
&#13;Hello,
&#13;My name is J. Random Perlhacker. My
email address is jrp@int.netorg.edu. My
homepage is http://www.netorg.edu/~jrp/.
I've written some system administration scripts
that I'd like to upload.
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Join scripts@perl.org:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
To: majordomo@perl.org
subscribe scripts
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Discuss possible script categories. Send mail:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
To: scripts@perl.org
Subject: New category proposal
&#13;Hello,
&#13;I've written some scripts for administering
both NT and UNIX systems remotely; I think that
"Administration/Cross-Platform" would be a good
category for them. Comments?
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Wait for a response. New categories don't get created
  automatically! If the community agrees (or fails to disagree)
  with your suggestion for a new category, the category will be
  created on CPAN and you'll receive mail to that effect.</p>

  <p>Add identifying documentation. Invoke your favorite editor on
  your script, and insert the following:</p>

  <blockquote>
    $VERSION = 0.01;

    <p>=head1 SCRIPT CATEGORIES</p>

    <p>Administration/Cross-Platform</p>

    <p>=cut</p>

    <p>=pod OSNAMES</p>

    <p>solaris<br>
    linux<br>
    MSWin32</p>

    <p>=cut</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Name the script: <tt>mv myscript myscript-0.01</tt></p>

  <p>Upload it:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
% ftp pause.kbx.de
Connected to dubravka.kbx.de.
220 pause.kbx.de FTP server . . . .
Name (pause.kbx.de:jrp): anonymous
331 Password required for anonymous
Password:
230 User anonymous logged in.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp&gt; cd incoming
ftp&gt; put myscript-0.01
ftp&gt; quit
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Register your upload at <a href=
  "https://pause.kbx.de/perl/user/add_uri">https://pause.kbx.de/perl/user/add_uri</a>.</p>

  <p>Tell your friends, and wait for your mailbox to fill up with
  comments and bug reports!</p>
