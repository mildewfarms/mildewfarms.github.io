  <p>Serial ports are one of the oldest black boxes in computing:
  data goes in, data goes out, and few people understand how, even
  though they've been around much longer than PCs and haven't
  changed much over the years. They're still the most common way to
  connect computers to their peripherals, or even computers to one
  another. This article describes how to use the Win32::SerialPort
  module to talk to devices like modems from your Win32 Perl
  programs.</p>

  <p>Before communicating, serial ports have to agree about a few
  things. Sometimes the agreement is pre-arranged; for instance,
  operating systems typically know how to talk to many types of
  mice. But you've probably seen something like <tt>9600,8N1</tt>
  describing a modem configuration. Those are the serial
  characteristics that must be agreed upon: baud rate, data bits,
  parity, and stop bits.</p>

  <p>Let's look at what that <tt>9600,8N1</tt> means. At all times,
  a serial line either has a voltage difference across it (an "on"
  bit) or no voltage difference (an "off" bit). The <tt>9600</tt>
  defines the time between bits: 1/9600 second. The <tt>8</tt> is
  the number of bits per character. ASCII requires only seven bits,
  but most connections these days find a use for that eighth bit.
  An additional bit, the <i>parity bit</i>, is used as a simplistic
  checksum for the others; here, the <tt>N</tt> means that there is
  no parity bit. Finally, the <tt>1</tt> is the <i>stop bit</i>
  used to separate the end of one character from the beginning of
  the next.</p>

  <p>I'll assume you've installed at least version 0.13 of the
  SerialPort module and the other prerequisite modules:
  Win32API::CommPort (currently bundled with SerialPort) and Aldo
  Calpini's Win32::API. SerialPort includes the high-level user
  interface, while CommPort provides low-level details, object
  creation, and other building blocks.</p>

  <p>In this article, I'll show you eight examples that send data
  through a serial port. The first four will work on any serial
  device; the second four are modem-specific. The examples use
  <tt>COM2</tt>, meaning the second serial port.</p>

  <h3>Example 1</h3>
  <pre>
#! perl -w
&#13;use strict;
use Win32::SerialPort;
&#13;my $ob = Win32::SerialPort-&gt;new ('COM2') || die;
&#13;my $baud = $ob-&gt;baudrate;
my $parity = $ob-&gt;parity;
my $data = $ob-&gt;databits;
my $stop = $ob-&gt;stopbits;
my $hshake = $ob-&gt;handshake;
&#13;print "B = $baud, D = $data, S = $stop, P = $parity, 
            H = $hshake\n";
&#13;undef $ob; 
</pre>

  <p>This creates a SerialPort object and prints the five most
  common parameters. We don't set the parameters, and we don't send
  any data. These are the same five settings you see when you
  select <tt>File-&gt;Parameters-&gt;Configure</tt> in
  HyperTerminal. This example works as long as your serial port was
  left in a sane state by whatever used it last; if you have a
  problem (occasionally a PC modem will claim that the baud rate is
  0), open and close the port with HyperTerminal.</p>

  <p>Note that my examples turn on all of Perl's sanity checking
  (<tt>-w</tt> and <tt>use strict</tt>). This is strongly
  recommended for all SerialPort programs, because little bugs that
  would be mere irritations in other programs can confuse your
  hardware. Nothing will crash your system or cause any sort of
  permanent damage, but debugging will be tough, so it's best to
  take these precautions.</p>

  <p>If you look at the <tt>Parameters</tt> display in
  HyperTerminal, you'll see that each setting has a menu of
  permitted values. You can get the same information in Perl by
  calling these methods in list context. The output below was
  generated by adding lines like these to the first example:</p>

  <h3>Example 2</h3>
  <pre>
my @data_opt = $ob-&gt;parity; # list context
&#13;print "\nData Bit Options: ";
foreach $a (@data_opt) { print " $a"; } 
</pre>

  <p>The complete Example 2 is available on the TPJ website; it's a
  subset of the <i>options.plx</i> program included in the
  distribution. The resulting output will look like this:</p>
  <pre>
Data Bit Options:   8 5 6 7
&#13;Stop Bit Options:   1 2 1.5
&#13;Handshake Options:  none rts dtr xoff
&#13;Parity Options:     none mark space even odd
&#13;Baudrate Options:   110 1200 300 2400 600 14400
                    56000 19200 4800 38400 9600
&#13;Current Settings:   B = 9600, D = 8, S = 1, 
                    P = none, H = rts 
</pre>

  <p>Baud rates like 28800 and 33600 are actually synthesized by
  the modem hardware and so don't appear in the list.
  Unfortunately, SerialPort only supports speeds in the list at
  present.</p>

  <h3>Initializing Your Modem</h3>

  <p>Creating a SerialPort object opens the port, but doesn't
  initialize it for data transfer. We're ready to initialize it
  now.</p>

  <p>SerialPort defers changes during initialization until the
  <tt>write_settings()</tt> method is invoked. Then it validates
  your selections, and verifies that baudrate, data bits, parity,
  and stop bits have been set. Setting the handshake is strongly
  recommended, but not required. We can complete the initialization
  by adding the following:</p>

  <h3>Example 3</h3>
  <pre>
$ob-&gt;baudrate($baud)   || die "fail setting baud";
$ob-&gt;parity($parity)         || die "fail setting parity";
$ob-&gt;databits($data)         || die "fail setting databits";
$ob-&gt;stopbits($stop)         || die "fail setting stopbits";
$ob-&gt;handshake($hshake)      || die "fail setting handshake";
&#13;$ob-&gt;write_settings         || die "no settings"; 
</pre>

  <p>The complete Example 3 does even more checking than what you
  see above. Handily, you don't have to go through all that
  checking every time you want to initialize a serial port. Once
  you have a functioning setup, the <tt>save()</tt> method
  generates a configuration file that specifies the parameters and
  their values. You can use this configuration file to duplicate
  the settings in a subsequent script. So on to Example 4, which
  creates our configuration for the rest of this article.</p>

  <h3>Example 4</h3>
  <pre>
#! perl -w
&#13;use strict;
use Win32::SerialPort;
&#13;my $ob = Win32::SerialPort-&gt;new ('COM2') || die;
&#13;$ob-&gt;user_msg(1);   # misc. warnings
$ob-&gt;error_msg(1);   # hardware and data errors
&#13;$ob-&gt;baudrate(38400);
$ob-&gt;parity("none");
$ob-&gt;parity_enable(1);       # for any parity except "none"
$ob-&gt;databits(8);
$ob-&gt;stopbits(1);
$ob-&gt;handshake('rts');
&#13;$ob-&gt;write_settings;
$ob-&gt;save("tpj4.cfg");
&#13;print "wrote configuration file tpj4.cfg\n";
&#13;undef $ob; 
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>user_msg()</tt> method enables messages intended for
  the user, like "Waiting for CTS", and the <tt>error_msg()</tt>
  method enables error messages like "Framing Error."</p>

  <p>An error during <tt>write_settings()</tt> closes the port but
  leaves your program alive; the module is designed so that error
  recovery is preferred over failure.</p>

  <p>The <tt>save()</tt> method checks whether
  <tt>write_settings()</tt> succeeded, and then generates a file
  with a complete collection of settings--many more than the five
  parameters you see here.</p>

  <p>Once we have <tt>tpj4.cfg</tt>, the configuration file created
  by Example 4, we can use it with a method named <tt>start()</tt>
  that we call instead of the <tt>new()</tt> in the examples above.
  <tt>start()</tt> reads the file, validates the file format, sets
  all the parameters, and performs the <tt>write_settings()</tt>
  for you. Bingo, instant serial port!</p>

  <p>There is a similar <tt>restart()</tt> method that
  re-initializes an already open port, a bit like <tt>stty
  sane</tt> in Unix. Example 5 below requires a modem that
  understands the Hayes command set--most do. Try running it twice,
  using HyperTerminal to change the baud rate between trials. The
  <tt>start()</tt> will change it back to 38400.</p>

  <h3>Example 5</h3>
  <pre>
#! perl -w
&#13;use strict;
use Win32::SerialPort 0.11;
&#13;my $ob = Win32::SerialPort-&gt;start ("tpj4.cfg") || die;
&#13;my $baud = $ob-&gt;baudrate;
print "baud from configuration: $baud\n";
&#13;$ob-&gt;write("ATE0X4\r");
sleep 1;
my $result = $ob-&gt;input; 
print "result = $result\n";
&#13;$ob-&gt;write("AT&amp;V\r");
sleep 2;
$result = $ob-&gt;input;
print "result = $result\n";
&#13;undef $ob; 
</pre>

  <p>The exact results will vary from modem to modem; this example
  is intended only to show data transfer. The <tt>input()</tt>
  method gets all of the characters currently pending (which in
  real applications may be limited by the size of internal
  buffers--see the module documentation for details). The
  <tt>write()</tt> method does just what you expect. We will
  revisit this example later at another speed.</p>

  <p>Veteran Win32 Perl users will see the <tt>sleep</tt>
  statements and mumble about the lack of <tt>alarm</tt> on their
  platform. A pleasant surprise: SerialPort supports time limits
  much like <tt>alarm</tt>. Although most Win32 user code offers no
  easy "abort-and-do-this-on-timeout" function, the serial driver
  supported by the Serial API runs as a <i>kernel service</i>, and
  can therefore interrupt system calls. It also supports both
  blocking and non-blocking I/O with <i>asynchronous</i>
  calls--background I/O based on a start/done_yet?/complete model
  that appears almost as through the operation is running in a
  separate thread. (This mechanism is at the heart of Win32
  multitasking. Since most applications are based on an "event
  loop" model, it was essential that a slow or failed call not
  disrupt the loop. The Windows 3.x serial driver had notorious
  defects and was commonly replaced in its entirety by application
  vendors, often creating additional bugs and incompatibilities.
  The Win32 serial drivers and API, by contrast, are full-featured,
  high-performance entities that permit applications access to a
  wider range of OS services than any substitute could easily
  provide.)</p>

  <p>Now an example to clarify the usage. After we send an
  <tt>ATE0X4</tt> to our modem, we expect to see an <tt>OK\r</tt>
  in return, but we might get more than that if <tt>E1</tt> was
  previously set. So we ask for more characters than we need (20)
  and use <tt>read_interval()</tt>to return 100 milliseconds after
  the final character. We don't want that timeout for the
  <tt>AT&amp;V</tt> command, so we issue a
  <tt>read_interval(0)</tt>to disable it. We'll read 40 characters,
  and then 4000 more, having set a timeout of 5 seconds for both
  reads. The second read should fail--I haven't seen any modems
  <i>that</i> verbose.</p>

  <h3>Example 6</h3>
  <pre>
#! perl -w
&#13;use strict;
use Win32::SerialPort;
&#13;my $ob = Win32::SerialPort-&gt;start ("tpj4.cfg") || die;
&#13;$ob-&gt;write("ATE0X4\r");
$ob-&gt;read_interval(100);
my ($count, $result) = $ob-&gt;read(20);
print "count = $count, result = $result\n";
&#13;$ob-&gt;read_interval(0);
$ob-&gt;read_const_time(5000);
$ob-&gt;write("AT&amp;V\r");
($count, $result) = $ob-&gt;read(40);
print "count = $count, result = $result\n";
($count, $result) = $ob-&gt;read(4000);
print "count = $count, result = $result\n";
&#13;undef $ob; 
</pre>

  <h3>Getting Your Modem To Dial</h3>

  <p>Let's get our modem to dial a telephone number. There is no
  one telephone number that everyone can use; replace 555-1234 with
  whatever number you like.</p>

  <p>Example 7 is long, so we'll just hit the high points. The
  important work is in the <tt>waitfor()</tt> subroutine, which
  accepts a time (in seconds) and calls the built-in
  <tt>lookfor()</tt> method. <tt>waitfor()</tt> then returns all of
  the input through whatever string matched so you can see the
  results.</p>

  <p>The <tt>are_match()</tt> method lets you specify an array of
  strings that will satisfy <tt>lookfor()</tt>. Here, we stuff it
  with all the responses we might receive from our modem:
  <tt>CONNECT</tt>, <tt>OK</tt>, and so on.</p>

  <p>Run Example 7 with the phone line disconnected, and if you
  can, try it again with a <tt>BUSY</tt> number. You could dial an
  actual number and <tt>CONNECT</tt>, but the example does not
  include any follow-up dialog.</p>

  <h3>Example 7</h3>
  <pre>
#! perl -w
&#13;use strict;
use Win32::SerialPort 0.13;
&#13;my $ob;
my $file = "tpj4.cfg";
&#13;sub waitfor {
    my $timeout = Win32::GetTickCount() + (1000 * shift);
    $ob-&gt;lookclear; # clear buffers
    my $gotit = "";
&#13;    for (;;) {
        return unless (defined ($gotit = $ob-&gt;lookfor));
        if ($gotit ne "") {
            my ($found, $end) = $ob-&gt;lastlook;
            return $gotit.$found;
        }
        return if ($ob-&gt;reset_error);
        return if (Win32::GetTickCount() &gt; $timeout);
    }
}
&#13;$ob = Win32::SerialPort-&gt;start ($file) or die 
      "Can't start $file\n";
&#13;$ob-&gt;error_msg(1); # use built-in error messages
$ob-&gt;user_msg(1);
&#13;$ob-&gt;are_match("BUSY","CONNECT",
                  "OK","NO DIALTONE",
                  "ERROR","RING",
                  "NO CARRIER","NO ANSWER");
&#13;$ob-&gt;write("ATE0X4\r");
# Wait one second for a response
printf "%s\n", waitfor(1); 
&#13;print "\nStarting Dial\n";
# Use a different number!
$ob-&gt;write("ATDT5551234\r"); 
printf "%s\n", waitfor(20);
&#13;print "\n5 seconds to failure..\n";
waitfor(5) || print "Timed Out\n";
&#13;undef $ob; 
</pre>

  <p>Example 7 could be extended to handle any device with
  well-defined responses--say, a pager. But managing completely
  interactive dialogs is tough; don't expect to have your programs
  dial up your ISP and chat with your friends. However, if you're
  intrigued, consult the <i>demo5.plx</i> example bundled with the
  module. Starting with Version 0.13, the module provides many of
  the functions of both <tt>stty</tt> and Expect, including echo
  control, line-ending conversion, backspace/backspace-echo,
  separate pre_match, match, and post_match strings, and multiple
  match patterns. Expanding this into a "mini-shell" is on my TODO
  list.</p>

  <h3>To Block Or Not To Block?</h3>

  <p>The examples so far are written as if the serial I/O
  operations were <i>blocking</i>--that is, as though you couldn't
  do anything else until the operation finished. Actually,
  <tt>input()</tt> is non-blocking. It returns an empty string when
  nothing has been received. <tt>read()</tt> and
  <tt>write()</tt>block, but each has a non-blocking alternative.
  These I/O operations are constructed from low-level primitive
  methods in Win32API::CommPort, which can be set to block or
  not.</p>

  <table border="0">
    <tr>
      <th>
        <p align="center"><u>Function</u></p>
      </th>

      <th>
        <p align="center"><u>Primitives</u></p>
      </th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <tt>read($count)</tt>

        <p><tt>write($out)</tt></p>

        <p><tt>input</tt></p>

        <p><tt>status</tt></p>
      </td>

      <td>
        <tt>read_bg($count), read_done($block)</tt>

        <p><tt>write_bg($out), write_done($block)</tt></p>

        <p><tt>status, read_bg($waiting_count)</tt></p>

        <p><tt>is_status</tt></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Unless you want to perform your own bitmask processing and
  error handling, use <tt>status()</tt> instead of
  <tt>is_status()</tt>. It handles <tt>user_msg()</tt> and
  <tt>error_msg()</tt> output, returning an array containing the
  number of characters in the input and output buffers of the
  serial driver. Hence, <tt>input()</tt> issues only a
  <tt>read_bg()</tt> when something is there to read. Example 8 is
  a slow version of Example 5 using non-blocking I/O.</p>

  <h3>Example 8</h3>
  <pre>
#! perl -w
&#13;use strict;
use Win32::SerialPort 0.11;
&#13;my $ob = SerialPort-&gt;start ("tpj4.cfg") || die;
&#13;my $baud = $ob-&gt;baudrate(1200);
print "baud for background demo: $baud\n";
&#13;$ob-&gt;read_interval(0);
$ob-&gt;read_const_time(10000);
&#13;$ob-&gt;write("ATE0X4\r");
sleep 1;
my $result = $ob-&gt;input;
print "result = $result\n";
&#13;$ob-&gt;write("AT&amp;V\r");
print "Starting 500 character background read\n";
my $in = $ob-&gt;read_bg(500);
my $done = 0;
my $blk;
my $err;
my $out;
&#13;for (;;) {
    ($blk, $in, $out, $err) = $ob-&gt;status;
    print "got $in characters so far..\n";
    sleep 1;
    ($done, $in, $result) = $ob-&gt;read_done(0);
    last if $done;
}
&#13;print "got = $in\nresult = $result\n";
&#13;$baud = $ob-&gt;baudrate(38400);
sleep 2;
$result = $ob-&gt;input;
print "\n\n....And now the rest = \n$result\n";
&#13;undef $ob;
</pre>

  <p>This example doesn't do much, but if you want to implement
  some serial protocol, you could prepare the next transmission at
  the same time as you send the current buffer. You can read and
  write at the same time, because <tt>read_done()</tt> and
  <tt>write_done()</tt> need not block; they can be used in a
  continuous loop construct such as those found in control systems
  (or in Perl/Tk).</p>

  <h3>What's Next?</h3>

  <p>Many modems include fax capabilities, and a basic fax
  capability could be built on top of a CommPort object. It might
  not use much of SerialPort, since fax characteristics are more
  rigidly defined. Win32 includes an extensive interface called
  TAPI for managing telephony issues such as incoming calls, line
  selection, voice interface, modem-specific extensions, and so
  on.</p>

  <p>I haven't tested SerialPort on ports within an NT Service, but
  I don't foresee any problems. I also plan to add a simple
  file-transfer demo (<i>xmodem</i>) to the distribution. And the
  <tt>readline()</tt> method will be expanded to allow a virtual
  login from the console that can be accessed as a limited command
  line from an external serial device. A mini-HyperTerminal
  (interactive dialout) with scripting capability is possible as
  well. Contributions of ideas, examples, and code are welcome. Any
  TAPI wizards out there?</p>

  <p>With methods like <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt>,
  SerialPort objects are similar to Perl filehandles. But they're
  not--you can't use <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt>, or <tt>print</tt>, for
  instance. A tied filehandle interface is included in Version
  0.14, now available on the CPAN.</p>
