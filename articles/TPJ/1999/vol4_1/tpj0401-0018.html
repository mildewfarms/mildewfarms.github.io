    <i>What Music is Perl?</i>

    <p align="right"><i>--</i>Larry Wall, TPJ #1</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface), is a standard for
  representing music as series of notes, rather than as raw audio
  data. MIDI is to raw audio (.au/.wav/.aiff) as vector graphics
  (PostScript) is to bitmaps (.png/.gif).</p>

  <p>With MIDI, you can make music without actually having to
  perform waveform synthesis, the same way that PostScript lets you
  draw circles without having to worry about trigonometry. For the
  purposes of this article, MIDI represents music as a series of
  events--where each event is basically "turn a note on or off."
  These events happen at certain times, on a certain channel (what
  others call a "voice" or "track"), with a certain note number, at
  a certain volume. Most any computer with a sound card can play
  MIDI files.</p>

  <p>When I first started reading the MIDI internals, it seemed an
  ideal format for composing music in Perl, and so I set out to
  make routines for encoding to and decoding from the binary format
  used in MIDI files. In August 1998, I sent to CPAN my first
  release of the imaginatively named "MIDI-Perl", a mostly
  object-oriented interface to these encoding/decoding routines
  (Burke 1998).</p>

  <p>However, as I stood back from the pile of code, I realized
  that while I had created a fine object model for representing
  MIDI files, the most basic data structure, the MIDI event, was no
  more suited to musical composition than raw PostScript is for
  composing architectural blueprints.</p>

  <h3>Hard Things Possible</h3>

  <p>Imagine you need to examine a series of addresses and save any
  located in the U.S. to a file. You might do that with a program
  like this:</p>
  <pre>
open US, "&gt;us.txt" or die "Can't write to us.txt!";
&#13;while (&lt;DATA&gt;) {
    next if /^\s*\#/s;
    chomp;
    my ($address, $url, $country) = split(/\s+/, $_, 3);
    next unless $country =~ /^U\.?S\.?/i;
    print US "$address: $url\n";
}
&#13;__END__
# List of addresses, in the format:
# Address       URL             Country
foo@bar.org     http://bar.org  U.S.
staff@tpj.com   http://tpj.com  USA
# We'll want to ignore this one:
pati@lebar.fr http://www.lebar.fr France
</pre>

  <p>This program basically implements a language, and then has,
  after its <tt>__END__</tt>, "instructions" in that language. Now,
  the language is simple: lines are ignored if they start with
  optional whitespace and then a <tt>#</tt> sign. If a line can be
  split into three non-null fields, it's considered an instruction
  to save the first two fields, but only if the last field begins
  with <tt>US</tt> or <tt>U.S.</tt> or <tt>us</tt>. This language
  doesn't have anything like what we'd expect in a real programming
  language--it has no flow-control structures, no variables, no
  ability to define procedures. But it is a language in the sense
  that it has a syntax (an order things have to be in to make
  sense) and semantics (what the elements in the language
  mean).</p>

  <p>Now, the semantics here are quite restricted, so it's a
  language only in the same sense that a simple markup language
  like HTML is a language, or the way that the notation for
  recording chess moves is a language, or the way that common music
  notation is a language. None of these are languages you could
  write a program to calculate 5 * 12 in, but each has its
  purpose.</p>

  <p>None of these languages makes hard things possible. For
  example, if you wanted to represent the behavior "save the output
  of an address if today is Tuesday", you'd be out of luck. You
  could change the program so that it would work, but then it would
  be a different language.</p>

  <p>Now, there are two ways to make a language more flexible. You
  can make a <i>novel</i> language, or an <i>extensional</i>
  language.</p>

  <p>And so I found myself in the not-entirely-anticipated position
  of designing and implementing a language that would provide an
  interface for musical composition, a language that would use MIDI
  for output but be several levels higher in abstraction.</p>

  <p>Now, it is the work of language designers to make their
  languages so that they will--to quote Larry Wall--"make easy
  things easy, and hard things possible." What's implied is that
  there are two domains that a programming language bridges--the
  way we think of a problem, and the way we code up the program
  that solves the problem. Making "hard things possible" is a
  matter of making the language open-ended enough that one can do
  just about anything with it, while making "easy things easy" is a
  matter of making sure that simple ideas can be coded
  concisely.</p>

  <p>In this article I'll first explain my ideas about types of
  simple languages, and then from that I'll show how these ideas
  led me to design the MIDI::Simple language the way I did. My goal
  is not so much to document MIDI::Simple, but instead to
  illustrate how specific problems in language design led me to
  make MIDI::Simple the way it is. Readers whose interests do not
  include both language theory and music can skip sections as they
  wish.</p>

  <h3>Approach 1: A Novel Language</h3>

  <p>A Novel Language is what we have already: a language
  independent of whatever you implement it in. Here, we've
  implemented our language in Perl, but none of Perl's power is
  available to it. Now, if you want the language to do more, you
  could write it so that it has flow control, like Perl's
  <tt>if</tt> statements and <tt>while</tt> loops. If you've never
  done anything like this before, it seems quite daunting--and it
  is! (Well, not <i>too</i> daunting, or else there wouldn't be so
  many programming languages around. Think of all the early-80s
  BASICs written in machine language and fitting in a few kilobytes
  of ROM.)</p>

  <p>Now, this is not to say that implementing just any high-level
  language in Perl is trivial--not by a long shot--but implementing
  a language with simple syntax and simple semantics, like a LOGO
  dialect, or even a simple Lisp dialect (as in Abelson &amp;
  Sussman 1996), is quite doable. Or, you could create an
  extensional language.</p>

  <h3>Approach 2: An Extensional Language</h3>

  <p>An Extensional Language is what I call a language that is
  really an extension of Perl, provided as subroutines in a Perl
  library, module, or class. Now, it may strike you as arrogant to
  say that Perl plus five subroutines from <tt>require
  "my_great_lib.pl"</tt> constitutes a new language. First off, I
  didn't say it was an <i>entirely new</i> language. Second, it
  does what you want, and that's probably all you're interested in,
  right? The advantage to using an Extensional Language is that
  you're still in Perl, so you get to use all of its
  features--variables, flow control, and so on. The disadvantage is
  that you have to work within the confines of Perl syntax.
  However, Perl syntax is so free-form that this is not a
  problem.</p>

  <p>There's a parallel here in the creation of jargons: Chemists,
  when they needed a language to talk about chemical structures
  with precision, could have decided to make up a whole new rich
  Novel Language, with verb tenses and noun compounding and and all
  the goodies we expect in a natural language. But that would mean
  figuring out the best way to implement predicate argument
  structure and pronoun binding and phonology and all the other
  cruft of natural language--the same way that making a Java
  virtual machine in Perl means having to implement exception
  handling.</p>

  <p>Instead, chemists implemented chemical names as an Extensional
  Language based on English. Now, "boron trifluoride" isn't exactly
  core English, but it's more English than it is Thai or Klingon;
  and, I admit, when the chemical "extension" to English starts
  spawning forms like "dichloro-1,2-ethane" and
  "2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine", it
  begins to leave every natural language behind. But when a chemist
  says "boron trifluoride is an inorganic gas", you understand that
  <i>something</i> is an inorganic gas, even if you can't picture
  what a boron trifluoride molecule looks like. Similarly, if
  you're reading Perl code and you see <tt>&amp;funk_it</tt>, or
  <tt>$this-&gt;thingify</tt>, you probably can't guess what
  <tt>funk_it()</tt> or <tt>thingify()</tt> do, but at least you
  can tell they're subroutines.</p>

  <h3>Easy Things Easy</h3>

  <p>Consider these MIDI events, expressed as they would be sent to
  the MIDI encoder in MIDI::Event:</p>
  <pre>
# event, wait-time, channel, note number, volume
['note_on', 0, 1, 25, 96],
['note_off', 96, 1, 25, 0],
['note_on', 0, 1, 29, 96],
['note_off', 96, 1, 29, 0],
['note_on', 0, 1, 27, 96],
['note_off', 96, 1, 27, 0],
['note_on', 0, 1, 20, 96],
['note_off', 192, 1, 20, 0],
</pre>

  <p>...and so on, for a total of thirty-three such lines. I won't
  explain the exact details of this format, as it's not relevant to
  the rest of this article, but obviously requiring a composer to
  write notes like this is not making easy things easy. A more
  intuitive formulation of notes would involve these qualities:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Duration: quarter note, half note, and so on.</li>

    <li>Pitch: a note-letter and octave number, such as
    <tt>A5.</tt></li>

    <li>Volume: either a number or one of the common abbreviations
    from sheet music, such as <tt>mf</tt> for medium-loud.</li>

    <li>Channel number; for MIDI, a number between 0 and 15.</li>
  </ul>

  <font size="-1"><i>Graphic courtesy of Matthew A.
  Siegler.</i></font></p>

  <p>In my early attempt at a music language (implemented as a
  Novel Language with an interpreter written in Perl), I ended up
  with a language that looked like this. Each note occupies a line
  of its own and specifies the channel, volume, duration, and pitch
  in order.</p>
  <pre>
note c1 f qn Cs2
# Cs2 = C sharp, octave 2
# qn = quarter note
note c1 f qn F2
note c1 f qn Ds2
note c1 f hn Gs1
# yup, hn = half note
note c1 f qn Cs2
note c1 f qn Ds2
# ...and so on...
</pre>

  <p>Incidentally, this tune I'm trying to represent is the
  Westminster Chimes, better known as what fancy clocks play when
  they chime the hour. See Sturdy 1998.</p>

  <p>Now, what makes these lines of note-making code different from
  typical lines of code in a high-level programming language is
  redundancy. Duration, pitch, volume, and channel often stay the
  same from one event to the next. So, in the name of brevity, I
  decided that each note's properties should be inherited from the
  previous note. And so, in the new language thus defined, the
  above code can be rephrased as:</p>
  <pre>
note c1 f qn Cs2
note F2
note Ds2
note hn Gs1
note qn Cs2
note Ds2
# ...and so on...
</pre>

  <p>I was on the way to a workable language. But then, when I
  wanted to expand it, I arrived at the same question raised in the
  first example of this article--do I continue with my Novel
  Language, adding primitive flow control, functions, variables,
  and data structures? Or do I implement an Extensional Language? I
  had two considerations.</p>

  <p>First, I wanted my language allow <i>algorithmic
  composition</i>--composition where the notes are partially
  determined by the output of algorithms developed by the composer.
  Composers like Xenakis use algorithms that involve some fairly
  complex algebra. If I wanted my simple Novel Language to do
  anything like that, I'd need to implement algebraic capabilities
  for that language. I'd also need to provide mathematical
  functions like sines and logarithms, and data structures plus the
  functions to manipulate them. That sounded like a lot of
  work.</p>

  <p>Second, both kinds of music languages exist--very simple
  languages, notably the <i>abc</i> language (Walshaw 1998); and
  composition extensions to high-level languages, notably the
  Forth-extension HMSL (Burk 1998). But, I asked myself, which kind
  of language would be most useful to the world? The <i>abc</i>
  language seemed well designed, implemented, and supported by
  various ports and utilities. So implementing a simple Novel
  Language would be reinventing the wheel. As for Extensional
  Languages, HMSL seemed the richest--I was even willing to learn
  Forth to deal with it! However, the implementation of Forth that
  it's based on works well only on Macs and Amigas. That ruled it
  right out, as I don't have either. There are other compositional
  languages, but they're either based on languages I wouldn't want
  anyone to have to compose in (e.g., C++), or they focus on
  acoustics and digital signal generation (e.g., Common Lisp Music)
  more than I or MIDI care to.</p>

  <p>But if I implemented my music language as an Extensional
  Language based on Perl, composer-users could write their programs
  and be able to run them on any Perl interpreter, on all the
  platforms Perl runs on. People new to programming would have at
  their disposal all the documentation and support that all Perl
  novices have. Algorithmic composers would have at their disposal
  all the data structures and mathematical functions Perl provides.
  And--no small consideration--it'd save me a ton of work that
  would otherwise go into creating the Novel Language's rudimentary
  data structures and functions.</p>

  <p>So the Extensional Language approach won. I scrapped the Novel
  Language and reimplemented its semantics (and a lot more) as the
  MIDI::Simple module that comes in the MIDI-Perl suite, version
  0.7 or later. The remainder of this article gives a guided tour
  of its features, with insights into my thinking as I designed the
  module.</p>

  <h3>Behold MIDI::Simple!</h3>

  <p>For all the tortured thought I put into its design,
  MIDI::Simple ended up easy to implement. It was almost
  anticlimactic. Maybe I should have done it in C++ so that it
  would given me a heroic sense of accomplishment! MIDI::Simple is
  only six hundred lines of relatively unsurprising code--much of
  it highly redundant, at that. Its only quirk is that it provides
  <i>both</i> a procedural and an object-oriented interface--I
  wanted beginners to be able to use a purely procedural interface,
  and advanced users to benefit from the power of object-oriented
  design if they wished.</p>

  <p>MIDI::Simple operates on a data structure I call a
  <i>score</i>, which is basically a list of events and times, and
  some state variables for storing defaults. Here's a sample of the
  state variables:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>$Time</tt>: the time (measured in <i>ticks</i>, each
    1/96th of a quarter note) at which the next event will take
    place.</li>

    <li><tt>$Duration</tt>: the number of ticks in the next note or
    rest.</li>

    <li><tt>$Channel</tt>: the channel number of the next
    note.</li>

    <li><tt>$Volume</tt>: the volume of the next note, from 0 to
    127.</li>

    <li><tt>@Notes</tt>: the pitches added to the score by the next
    call to the <tt>n()</tt> routine, discussed below.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Now, I expect that only the most advanced users will have to
  deal with the contents of a score directly, because everyone else
  can use this interface:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>new_score()</tt>, which initializes a <i>score
    object</i>--a score plus the state variables.</li>

    <li><tt>n()</tt> and <tt>r()</tt>, to add notes and rests to
    the score.</li>

    <li>functions to add arbitrary MIDI events to the score, such
    as <tt>patch_change()</tt> to set the patch (a simulated
    instrument, like a piano or banjo).</li>

    <li><tt>write_score()</tt>, to write the newly composed score
    as a MIDI file.</li>

    <li><tt>read_score()</tt>, to read a single-track MIDI file as
    a score.</li>

    <li><tt>synch()</tt>, to take the output of several
    user-provided functions and place them in the score at the same
    time--useful for blending different instruments.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Using the language specified as above, the Westminster Chimes
  could be notated like this:</p>
  <pre>
use MIDI::Simple;
new_score;
patch_change 1, 8; # set Channel 1 to Patch 8 = Celesta
n c1, f, qn, Cs2; n F2; n Ds2; n hn, Gs1;
n qn, Cs2; n Ds2; n F2; n hn, Cs2;
n qn, F2; n Cs2; n Ds2; n hn, Gs1;
n qn, Gs1; n Ds2; n F2; n hn, Cs2;
write_score 'chimes.mid';
</pre>

  <p>Much more concise than the forty-odd lines of code you'd need
  to express low-level MIDI events and calls!</p>

  <h3>"Relative" Notes</h3>

  <p>At this point I noticed that in most music, notes aren't
  thought of as belonging to a particular numbered octave so much
  as a <i>current octave</i>, with notes being in it, below it, or
  above it. So I added another way to specify pitches: instead of
  number (<tt>n25</tt>) or note-and-octave (<tt>Cs2</tt>), one can
  specify them in terms of just note-letter: <tt>Cs</tt>, meaning
  "C sharp in the current octave." I call this a <i>relative</i>
  note specification, in distinction to <tt>Cs2</tt> and
  <tt>n25</tt> which I call <i>absolute</i>.</p>

  <p>The current octave is a number stored in a state variable
  called <tt>$Octave</tt>, which can either be set directly or by
  calling <tt>n()</tt> or <tt>r()</tt> with a parameter in the form
  <tt>o6</tt> (where the 6 can be replaced by any number from 0 to
  10) or an absolute note specification. All of these set
  <tt>$Octave</tt> to 2:</p>
  <pre>
$Octave = 2;
</pre>
  <pre>
$Octave = 3; --$Octave;
</pre>
  <pre>
n o2 Cs;
</pre>
  <pre>
n Cs2; 
</pre>
  <pre>
r n25;
</pre>

  <p>I also added a way to denote "... an octave above the current
  one" or "... an octave below the current one":</p>
  <pre>
Cs_u1 ("u" for "up")
Cs_d1 ("d" for "down")
</pre>

  <p>...where <tt>1</tt> can be replaced by any positive integer,
  just so long as the resulting note is within the note range of
  MIDI devices: C0 to G10.</p>

  <p>The result is that these four notes:</p>
  <pre>
n c1, f, qn, Cs2; n F2; n Ds2; n hn, Gs1;
</pre>

  <p>can be expressed as:</p>
  <pre>
$Octave = 2;
n c1, f, qn, Cs; n F; n Ds; n hn, Gs_d1;
</pre>

  <p>or as:</p>
  <pre>
n c1, f, qn, Cs2; n F; n Ds; n hn, Gs_d1;
</pre>

  <p>In the last line, only the first note is specified absolutely,
  setting the current octave to <tt>2</tt>. This means that all you
  have to do to move all these notes up two octaves is change
  <tt>Cs2</tt> to <tt>Cs4</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Percussion, Uniformity, and noop()</h3>

  <p>MIDI has a special reserved channel, channel 9, where numbers
  for pitches are interpreted as a special percussive instrument.
  For example, <tt>n35</tt> (that is, <tt>B2</tt>) on channel 9
  doesn't mean a <tt>B2</tt> on the current patch for channel 9,
  but instead a (largely untuneable) note on an acoustic bass drum.
  Lines of code to generate bunches of percussion notes often look
  like this <tt>n c9, ff, n41, qn; r; n; r;</tt>. This specifies a
  quarter note, a quarter rest, a quarter note, and a quarter rest,
  all played on the acoustic bass drum.</p>

  <p>However, this seemed like a violation of <i>uniformity</i>, a
  principle I learned about from Weinberg's <i>The Psychology of
  Computer Programming</i>. Weinberg holds that users expect things
  that look similar to do similar things, and things that look
  different to do different things. But the first call to
  <tt>n()</tt> above looks very different than the second and third
  calls to <tt>n()</tt> even though all they do the same thing.
  What I wanted was a way to set up all the state variables, and
  then be able to just say <tt>n;r;n;r;</tt>, perhaps like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
$Channel = 9; $Volume = 112; $Duration = 96; @Notes = (41);
n; r; n; r;
</pre>

  <p>But that seemed inelegant. What I ended up doing was adding
  another function, called <tt>noop()</tt> (for "no operation").
  <tt>noop()</tt> parses options just like <tt>n()</tt> and
  <tt>r()</tt>, and has all the same side-effects, but doesn't
  actually affect the score. For example, consider these three
  lines of code:</p>
  <pre>
n         qn, C3; # C3 = n36, by the way
r       qn, C3;
noop    qn, C3;
</pre>

  <p>The first line adds a note to the score, and increments
  <tt>$Time</tt> by the duration of a quarter note. The second line
  just increments <tt>$Time</tt> because it's a rest. The third
  line alters neither the score nor <tt>$Time</tt>, but has all the
  same side-effects as the first two: it sets <tt>$Duration</tt> to
  the duration of a quarter note, and it sets <tt>@Notes</tt> to
  <tt>(36)</tt>. With <tt>noop()</tt>, you can write code like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
noop c9, ff, n41, qn;     # The setup...
n; r; n; r;             # ...and the work.
</pre>

  <p>This not to say that you <i>have</i> to do it this way; but
  allowing the organization of code to reflect different ways of
  organizing thought is the Perl way.</p>

  <h3>The Object-Oriented Interface</h3>

  <p>So far I've described functions (or procedures, really, seeing
  as how they don't have useful return values, and have more side
  effects than radical chemotherapy) for manipulating a score and
  for setting the state variables that ride along with the
  score.</p>

  <p>This is great if you just want to manipulate one score at a
  time. For manipulating several scores, I've provided an OOP
  interface:</p>

  <table border="0" width="454">
    <tr>
      <th width="157"><u>Procedural</u></th>

      <th width="27"></th>

      <th width="258"><u>OOP</u></th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td width="157" valign="top">new_score<br>

  <h3>Using synch(), and Some Actual Music</h3>

  <p><tt>synch()</tt> takes a list of code references (generally of
  the form <tt>\&amp;foo</tt>, where <tt>foo()</tt> is a subroutine
  the user has defined for adding notes to the score). For each
  coderef, <tt>synch()</tt> calls the user's routine, and then
  notes the value of <tt>$Time</tt>. After calling all the
  routines, <tt>synch()</tt> advances <tt>$Time</tt> as necessary.
  In other words, it makes multiple subroutines
  <i>synchronous</i>--occurring (or at least starting) at the same
  time.</p>

  <p>Each user routine, incidentally, should expect its first
  parameter to be the score object, and should add to that score
  object via the object-oriented interface to MIDI::Simple instead
  of the procedural interface. A simple use for <tt>synch()</tt>
  might look like this:</p>
  <pre>
use MIDI::Simple 0.7;
&#13;new_score;
@subs = (\&amp;tom_two, \&amp;double_clap);
foreach (1 .. 10) { synch(@subs) }
write_score("rhythm1.midi");
exit;
&#13;sub tom_two {
    my $it = shift;
    # n41 on c9 = low floor tom
    $it-&gt;n(c9, ff, n41, qn); $it-&gt;r;
    # qn = 1/4 note, ff = very loud
    $it-&gt;n(f); $it-&gt;r;
    # f = loud
}
&#13;sub double_clap {
    my $it = shift;
    # n39 on c9 = hand-clap
    $it-&gt;n(c9, ff, n39, sn); # sn = a 16th note
    $it-&gt;n;
    # This only takes up 2 16th-notes
    # of time, but that's fine.
}
</pre>
  <pre>
Now, this generates twenty monotonously identical 
measures. My instrument subroutines vary their effect 
from measure to measure because of a trick: The first 
subroutine is a call to a measure counter, and the other 
subroutines pay attention to it. Here's the measure 
counter:
</pre>
  <pre>
sub measure_counter {
    my $it = shift; $it-&gt;r(wn); # a whole rest
    ++$measure;
}
</pre>

  <p>Using the measure counter, tom_two() can now do two different
  things, depending whether $measure is greater than 4:</p>
  <pre>
sub tom_two {
    my $it = shift;
    if ($measure &gt; 4) {
      # For the first four measures...
      $it-&gt;n(c9, f, n41, qn);
    } else {
      # For measures after that...
      $it-&gt;n(c9, ff, n41, qn); $it-&gt;r;
      $it-&gt;n(f); $it-&gt;r;
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>Then we just change this line in the program:</p>
  <pre>
@subs = (\&amp;measure_counter, \&amp;tom_two, \&amp;double_clap);
</pre>

  <p>And voil&agrave;, simple percussion. From there it's not hard
  to get more ornate:</p>
  <pre>
use MIDI::Simple 0.7;
&#13;new_score;
@subs = ( \&amp;measure_counter, \&amp;boom, \&amp;tboom, \&amp;clap );
foreach (1 .. 24) { synch(@subs) }
write_score("rhythm2.midi");
exit;
&#13;sub measure_counter {
    my $it = shift;
    $it-&gt;r(wn); # a whole rest
    ++$measure;
}
&#13;sub boom {
    my $it = shift;
    return if $measure % 4 &lt; 2;
    $it-&gt;n(c9, ff, n41, qn); $it-&gt;r;
    $it-&gt;n(f); r;
}
&#13;sub tboom {
    my $it = shift;
    return if $measure % 4 &lt; 2;
    # 42 = 'Closed Hi-Hat' ; 43 = 'High Floor Tom'
    # In quick succession...
    $it-&gt;n( c9, ff, n43, sn); $it-&gt;n( n42 ); $it-&gt;r(dqn);
    # dqn = dotted quarter note/rest
    $it-&gt;r( c9, ff, n43, sn); $it-&gt;n( n42 ); $it-&gt;r(dqn);
}
&#13;sub clap {
    my $it = shift;
    return if $measure &lt; 4;
    $it-&gt;n(c9, ff, n39, sn); $it-&gt;n;
    $it-&gt;r(dqn);
    $it-&gt;r(hn);
}
</pre>

  <p>Now, I promised that I'd show you a little Novel Language
  based on an Extensional language. While I was tossing together
  the above code, originally just to test <tt>synch()</tt>'s
  functionality, I decided I wanted a more complex instrument. For
  some reason, I had the rhythm of the Talking Heads' "Psycho
  Killer" stuck in my mind, and decided to code it up. I tried it
  with combinations of eighth notes and rests, but I couldn't quite
  do it. So I made a very simple Novel Language where whitespace is
  ignored, <tt>!</tt> means to hit the "side stick" (note 37 on
  that magic channel 9) for a sixteenth note, and anything else
  makes a sixteenth rest:</p>
  <pre>
sub psycho {
   my $it = shift;
   my $pattern = " !.!. !.!. !.!. !.!. " ; # just a start
   $pattern =~ tr&lt;\cm\cj\t &gt;&lt;&gt;d; # kill whitespace
   warn "&lt;$pattern&gt; doesn't add up to a whole measure\n"
                           unless length($pattern) == 16;
   $it-&gt;noop(c9, mf, n37, sn);
   # setup: n37 on c9 = side stick
   foreach (split('', $pattern)) {
       if ($_ eq '!') { $it-&gt;n }
       else { $it-&gt;r }
   }
}
</pre>

  <p>From here I just monkeyed around with the quoted string on the
  line after <tt>my $pattern</tt>. I eventually arrived at:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <pre>
" !.!.!. !!!!!! !.!. " ;
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This was exactly the rhythm I was thinking of! To hear it,
  paste the <tt>psycho()</tt> subroutine into the program above,
  and add it to the <tt>@subs</tt> line, like so:</p>
  <pre>
@subs = ( \&amp;measure_counter, \&amp;psycho, \&amp;boom, \&amp;tboom, 
               \&amp;clap );
</pre>

  <h3>Mod, Canons, and Rounds</h3>

  <p>Having your subroutines use <tt>$measure</tt> to decide what
  notes to generate is the most straightforward way to produce
  higher-level structures in music. Earlier, you saw a subroutine
  use <tt>$measure % 4 &lt; 2</tt> to control what notes it adds to
  the score. The <tt>%</tt> operator ("modulus", also known as
  "remainder"--<tt>X % Y</tt> means "the remainder of dividing X by
  Y") is one that a surprising number of people are unfamiliar
  with, but it's absolutely necessary for algorithmic composition.
  Consider the Westminster Chimes' four measures:</p>
  <pre>
my @phrases =(
  [ Cs, F, Ds, Gs_d1 ], [Cs, Ds, F, Cs],
  [ F, Cs, Ds, Gs_d1 ], [Gs_d1, Ds, F, Cs]
);
</pre>

  <p>These four measures can be repeated <i>ad infinitum</i>
  (starting, appropriately, with the first measure), with this
  code:</p>
  <pre>
sub first {
    my $it = shift;
    $it-&gt;noop(c1, mf, o3, qn); # setup
    my $phrase_number = ($measure + -1) % 4;
    my @phrase = @{$phrases[$phrase_number]};
    foreach my $note (@phrase) { $it-&gt;n($note) }
} 
</pre>

  <p>If you change <tt>($measure + -1) % 4</tt> to <tt>($measure +
  0) % 4</tt>, everything happens one measure later than before.
  Change &shy;1 to 1 and it's two measures later. That way, when
  the piece starts, with a <tt>$measure</tt> of 1, you get the
  third element of <tt>@phrases</tt>. Since you probably want it to
  keep quiet until measure 3, just add <tt>return if $measure &lt;
  3;</tt> to the start of the subroutine.</p>

  <p>Now you can have several subs like <tt>&amp;first</tt> that
  play all the same notes, but in different measures. This
  structure, called a <i>canon</i>, may seem very abstract, but
  it's common in songs, where it's called a <i>round</i>. If you
  remember singing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat", you were singing
  exactly the same kind of musical structure you get out of
  <tt>&amp;first</tt>, copied and adjusted for different <i>N</i>s
  in <tt>($measure +</tt> <i>N</i><tt>) % 4</tt>. Compare
  <tt>&amp;first</tt>, <tt>&amp;second</tt>, <tt>&amp;third</tt>,
  and <tt>&amp;fourth</tt> in the program shown on the previous
  page, which plays a round based on the Westminster Chimes.</p>

  <h3>Future Features</h3>

  <p>MIDI::Simple is by no means finished. There are three areas
  where I hope to improve it:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The language has plenty of functions for dealing with
    notes, but larger structures are either oddly implemented (as
    with <tt>set_tempo()</tt> and <tt>time_signature()</tt>) or
    missing (there are no functions for <i>crescendo</i> or
    <i>sostenuto</i>, for example).</li>

    <li><tt>n()</tt>, <tt>r()</tt>, and <tt>noop()</tt> accept
    abbreviations like <tt>qn</tt>, <tt>hn</tt>, and <tt>den</tt>,
    for quarter note, half note, and dotted eighth note. However,
    these are counterintuitive if you call a quarter note a
    <i>crotchet</i> (as much of the English-speaking world does),
    or, for that matter, a <i>Viertelnote</i>, <i>semiminima</i>,
    <i>negyed hangjegy</i>, or a <i>nelj&auml;nnesnuotti</i>.
    Future versions of MIDI::Simple will provide an interface for
    adding or changing abbreviations.</li>

    <li>At present, MIDI-Perl generates files only, and not other
    MIDI devices. Interfacing with devices attached to a MIDI port
    requires OS- and hardware-specific programming well beyond what
    I can produce or support. But at least in the case of Unixes
    that provide <tt>/dev/midi</tt> and <tt>/dev/sequencer</tt>, it
    should be possible to support real-time access, which can be
    incorporated into MIDI::Simple. As examples of applications
    based on real-time MIDI access, programs using MIDI::Simple can
    generate real-time streams that portray any incoming numeric
    data stream, such as stock market data or the status of a
    computer network.</li>
  </ul>
