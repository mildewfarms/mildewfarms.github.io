  <p>Have you heard? XML is going to change the very nature of
  computing. No more data conversion headaches or legacy code
  nightmares. And it will be everywhere: in databases, Web
  browsers, toaster ovens, and your favorite breakfast cereal. Oh,
  and it's Y2K compliant.</p>

  <p>I may be exaggerating a bit, but many people smarter than me
  say that it's going to make a significant impact, so they must be
  right. Right?</p>

  <h3>XML History</h3>

  <p>Once upon a time, these same smart people decided that a
  common document format would be good. So they invented a format
  that did everything. They called it SGML, and ISO, the
  international standards organization, said it was good.
  Unfortunately, it was so complete that few SGML users knew how it
  all worked. Then came HTML, a markup language that is itself a
  derivative of SGML. HTML found wide acceptance thanks to its
  simplicity and ease of use.</p>

  <p>HTML's popularity led to people wanting more ambitious
  layouts. Developers designed ever more convoluted mutations for
  complex Web-based presentations, and the limitations of HTML
  began to show. Furthermore, the growing volume of HTML content on
  the Internet and HTML's inability to define new tags made it
  difficult, if not impossible, to search for and manage data. So
  the World Wide Web Consortium, the standards body for the World
  Wide Web, formed an SGML working group to fix the problem. The
  result was XML.</p>

  <p>The tenets of XML are simplicity and utility, the same
  features that made HTML so popular. At the same time, XML was
  designed to preserve the extensibility of SGML. This led to a
  language lacking many of the non-essential features that made
  SGML so complex. Now, many analysts and programmers are hailing
  XML as the next step in the evolution of the World Wide Web.</p>

  <p>In this article we will learn the basics of XML and how to
  manipulate XML in Perl. Then, we will design a simple XML format
  for creating a FAQ, and write a program to convert it into
  HTML.</p>

  <h3>XML Structure</h3>

  <p>A valid XML file (more on what validity means later) begins
  with three things: an XML declaration, a Document Type Definition
  (DTD), and a root element. (In XML parlance, "element" means the
  same as "tag".) In the example that follows, we'll look at an
  address database containing contact information for people; our
  root element will be called <tt>contact</tt>.</p>

  <p>Here's the first line of our XML file, the XML
  declaration:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Note that <tt>xml</tt> must be in lower case. The DTD comes
  next:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE contact SYSTEM "contact.dtd"&gt;
</pre>

  <p>This DTD declaration identifies the XML document as being of
  type <tt>contact</tt>. It also indicates that the file containing
  the rules for the contact document type is located in the file
  <i>contact.dtd</i>. DTDs are described in more detail on the next
  page.</p>

  <p>Finally, the root element, like the <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt> tag
  in HTML, envelopes rest of the XML document. Unlike HTML, you're
  free to choose whatever name you like.</p>

  <p>Every XML document contains data within nested elements A
  simple XML record containing my contact information might look
  like this:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;contact&gt;
&lt;name&gt;Jonathan Eisenzopf&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;address&gt;555 Foobar Lane&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;phone number="555-5555"/&gt;
&lt;email address="eisen@pobox.com"/&gt;
&lt;/contact&gt;
</pre>

  <p>You can find the complete XML specification at <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml" target=
  "resource window">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml</a>.</p>

  <h3>XML Tags</h3>

  <p>Like SGML and HTML, XML is a structured format that uses tags
  to define elements within a document. You're free to define any
  tag you like. Here, I've made up a <tt>name</tt> tag:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;name&gt;Jonathan Eisenzopf&lt;/name&gt;
</pre>

  <p>This next tag contains a phone number. Notice the <b>/</b>
  character before the end of the tag. Unlike HTML, every element
  must contain an end tag--but the start and end tags can be one
  and the same. Here, the <tt>phone</tt> element is self-contained,
  so I include the slash to make it an end tag.</p>
  <pre>
&lt;phone number="555-5555"/&gt;
</pre>

  <p>This tag also contains one attribute named <tt>number</tt>,
  whose value is <tt>555-5555</tt>. In XML, attribute values must
  be contained in quotes.</p>

  <h3>The DTD</h3>

  <p>Document Type Definitions are the heart and soul of XML. Each
  DTD is a formal description of a document's structure; there are
  DTDs for domains like real estate, mathematics, news, and VRML.
  DTDs allow programs to validate the organization of a document
  and extract its meaning programmatically--typically using
  Perl.</p>

  <p>Here, we create a DTD file named <i>contact.dtd</i>, which
  declares the element types for our contact database:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT contact (name, address, phone, email)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT address (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT phone EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT email EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST phone number CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST email address CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
</pre>

  <p>This DTD declares the <tt>contact</tt> element as containing
  name, address, phone, and email elements. The <tt>name</tt> and
  <tt>address</tt> elements contain character data
  (<tt>#PCDATA</tt>), while the <tt>phone</tt> and <tt>email</tt>
  elements contain no data at all (<tt>EMPTY</tt>). The last two
  lines of the DTD declare the valid element attributes for the
  <tt>phone</tt> and <tt>email</tt> elements: <tt>number</tt> and
  <tt>address</tt> respectively.</p>

  <h3>Valid, Or Merely Well-Formed?</h3>

  <p>A <i>well-formed</i> XML document needs a root element and
  properly-nested tags. That's all. It doesn't even need a DTD. A
  <i>valid</i> XML document, on the other hand, is not only
  well-formed, but also contains a structure conforming to the
  associated DTD. Thus, XML that needs to be validated must include
  a document type declaration at the beginning of the XML
  document.</p>

  <h3>XML Display</h3>

  <p>Unlike HTML, XML does not contain any information regarding
  how data is to be displayed on the user's screen. The two primary
  methods of displaying XML are <i>stylesheets</i>, and simply
  converting XML into another format.</p>

  <p>The dominant proposal for XML stylesheets is the Extensible
  Style Language (XSL). XSL is based on the Document Style
  Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL), an ISO standard
  designed to be used with SGML. It also borrows features from the
  older Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which you can use in HTML.
  The difference between XSL and DSSSL is that XSL is itself XML.
  XSL is not yet an official standard, but it probably will be
  soon. Currently, tools exist to convert XML using an XSL style
  sheet into formats like Postscript, RTF, SGML, TeX, and HTML.
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/</a> contains more
  information on XSL including tools, libraries, and tutorials.</p>

  <p>The second technique for displaying XML documents is to
  directly convert XML to another format using an XML parser and
  Perl. When the conversion is simple, there's no need for a
  stylesheet mechanism like XSL. As we'll see, converting XML to
  HTML is easy as long as the XML document is fairly simple.</p>

  <h3>Unicode in Perl</h3>

  <p>As of developer release 5.005_52, Perl includes a pragma that
  handles UTF8 encoded strings. This is a good thing, since the XML
  standard requires that all parsers handle both UTF8 and UCS2
  encoded text. UTF8 enables the basic Unicode support required for
  multi-byte character languages like Japanese. This is a recent
  advance, but a very important one for Perl and especially XML.
  Thanks go out to Larry Wall and contributors.</p>

  <p>To enable Unicode support, simply add the following line to
  the beginning of your program:</p>
  <pre>
use utf8;
</pre>

  <h3>The XML::Parser module</h3>

  <p>Larry Wall wrote the first XML::Parser module, now being
  maintained and updated by Clark Cooper. XML::Parser is built on
  top of James Clark's <i>Expat</i>, a non-validating XML parser
  written in C. A non-validating parser checks the XML document for
  well-formedness, but does not validate it against a DTD. The
  latest version of XML::Parser can be found at <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/C/CO/COOPERCL/"
  target="resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/C/CO/COOPERCL/</a>.</p>

  <p>Because XML::Parser is an event-based parser, we must register
  event handlers to process the incoming XML. As the XML data is
  parsed, the handlers are called when the corresponding event is
  triggered.</p>

  <h3>Setting Event Handlers</h3>

  <p>For processing to occur, we must set event handlers when we
  create a new instance of the XML::Parser class:</p>
  <pre>
use XML::Parser;
my $parser = new XML::Parser(
Handlers =&gt; {Start =&gt; \&amp;handle_start,
	       End =&gt; \&amp;handle_end});
</pre>

  <p>This creates two event handlers, <tt>Start</tt> and
  <tt>End</tt>. Each time the parser encounters a new element (or
  tag), it triggers the <tt>Start</tt> event, which in turn
  executes the associated subroutine, <tt>handle_start()</tt>.
  Likewise, when the parser finds the end of an element, it
  triggers the <tt>End</tt> event and executes
  <tt>handle_end()</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Parsing the XML</h3>

  <p>Once you've set your event handlers, it's time to parse the
  XML. Below is a script that parses an XML file from the command
  line (<tt>$ARGV[0]</tt>) and prints each element as it's found.
  It also prints the depth of each element in the XML
  structure:</p>
  <pre>
1 #!/usr/bin/perl -w
2
3 use XML::Parser;
4 my $deep = 0;
5 my $parser = new XML::Parser(Handlers =&gt; {
6         Start =&gt; \&amp;handle_start, End =&gt; \&amp;handle_end});
7 $parser-&gt;parsefile($ARGV[0]);
8
9 sub handle_start {
10     my $p = shift;
11     my $el = shift;
12     $deep++;
13     print "$el - $deep\n";
14 }
15
16 sub handle_end {
17     $deep--;
18 }
</pre>

  <p>Lines 5 and 6 create a new instance of XML::Parser and assign
  subroutines <tt>&amp;handle_start</tt> and
  <tt>&amp;handle_end</tt> to the <tt>Start</tt> and <tt>End</tt>
  events. Each time the XML parser detects a new tag, it calls the
  handler assigned to the <tt>Start</tt> event,
  <tt>&amp;handle_start</tt>. Then line 7 reads in the file and
  stores it in a way that reflects the tag structure.</p>

  <h3>XML::Parser Styles</h3>

  <p>The XML::Parser module includes built-in styles that contain
  their own event handlers and implement built-in structures. The
  available styles are: <tt>Debug</tt>, <tt>Subs</tt>,
  <tt>Tree</tt>, <tt>Objects</tt>, and <tt>Stream</tt>. The
  <tt>Debug</tt> style prints information about an XML
  structure:</p>
  <pre>
1 #!/usr/bin/perl -w
2
3 use XML::Parser;
4 my $parser = new XML::Parser(Style =&gt; 'Debug');
5 $parser-&gt;parsefile($ARGV[0]);
</pre>

  <p>When provided with our earlier contact database, this program
  prints the following:</p>
  <pre>
\\ ()
contact || #10;
contact \\ ()
contact name || Jonathan Eisenzopf
contact //
contact || #10;
contact \\ ()
contact address || 555 Foobar Lane
contact //
contact || #10;
contact \\ (number 555-5555)
contact //
contact || #10;
contact \\ (address eisen@pobox.com)
contact //
contact || #10;
//
</pre>

  <p>This is simple stuff, but remember that XML is used for
  everything from databases to books. Visualizing the structure
  helps correct organizational problems.</p>

  <h3>Application: an XML-Based FAQ</h3>

  <p>Nearly every topic has its own FAQ, usually in HTML. Keeping a
  FAQ fresh can be difficult, especially if it requires frequent
  updates. You might also want to generate ASCII for sending mail,
  or a PostScript version for printing.</p>

  <p>XML and Perl can address these problems with minimal effort.
  First, we define a DTD for our XML FAQ:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT faq (header, abstract, section)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT header (title, author version)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT author (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT version (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT abstract (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT section (question,answer)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT question (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT answer (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST version number CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Because the XML::Parser module is non-validating, we can't
  validate our XML FAQ using this DTD--but we can use it as a
  roadmap to define how our XML file is to be constructed. In this
  example, we will be maintaining a Music Trivia FAQ. Here's our
  XML file:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;faq&gt;
   &lt;header&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Music Trivia FAQ&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;author&gt;Jonathan Eisenzopf&lt;/author&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;abstract&gt;This FAQ contains musical trivia that includes
                bands, compositions, and writers.
  &lt;/abstract&gt;
  &lt;section&gt;
    &lt;question&gt;When was Johann Sebastian Bach born?
    &lt;/question&gt;
    &lt;answer&gt;Johann Sebastian Bach was born in 1685. &lt;/answer&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;section&gt;
    &lt;question&gt;What band defied the laws of tradition
             in their album entitled "Frizzle Fry"?
    &lt;/question&gt;
    &lt;answer&gt;Primus&lt;/answer&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/faq&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Now we write a script to parse the XML file, assign handler
  subroutines, and convert the XML to HTML. The source code is
  shown below. First, we load the XML::Parser module and create a
  new XML::Parser object. Notice that we have assigned three
  handlers: the familiar <tt>Start</tt> and <tt>End</tt>, and
  <tt>Char</tt> for character data.</p>
  <pre>
#<b>Parsing an XML-based FAQ</b>
&#13;#!/usr/binperl -w
&#13;use strict;
<b>use XML::Parser;</b>
&#13;die "Usage: xmlfaq.pl &lt;file&gt;" unless @ARGV == 1;
<b>my $parser = new XML::Parser(Handlers =&gt; {
     Start =&gt; \&amp;handle_start, End =&gt; \&amp;handel_end,
     Char =&gt; \&amp;handle_char});
$parser-&gt;parsefile($ARGV[0]);</b>
&#13;sub <b>handle_start</b> {
     my ($p, $e1) = @_;
     if ($e1 =&tilde; /\bheader\b/i) {print "&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;HR&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\btitle\b/i) {print "&lt;H1&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\bauthor\b/i) {print "Author: &lt;B&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\bversion\b/i) {print "Version: &lt;B&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\babstract\b/i) {
	      print '&lt;FONT SIZE=+1&gt;&lt;B&gt;Abstract&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;P&gt;';
     }
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\bsection\b/i) {print "&lt;UL&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\bquestion\b/i) {print "&lt;li&gt;&lt;B&gt;Q:&lt;/B&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\banswer\b/i) {print "&lt;dl&gt;&lt;B&gt;A:&lt;/B&gt;";}
}
&#13;sub <b>handle_char</b> {
     my ($p, $data) = @_;
     print $data;
}
&#13;sub <b>handle_end</b> {
     my ($p, $e1) = @_;
     if ($e1 =&tilde; /\bheader\b/i) {print "&lt;HR&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\btitle\b/i) {print "&lt;/H1&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\bauthor\b/i) {print "&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\bversion\b/i) {print "&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\babstract\b/i) {print "&lt;P&gt;\n";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\bsection\b/i) {print "&lt;/UL&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\bquestion\b/i) {print "&lt;/li&gt;";}
     elseif ($e1 =&tilde; /\banswer\b/i) {print "&lt;/dl&gt;";}
}
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>handle_start()</tt> subroutine grabs the element name
  that the parser found, and the nested <tt>if</tt> statements
  print the appropriate HTML for each of the eight meaningful tags
  in our DTD. The <tt>handle_char()</tt> subroutine, which dumbly
  prints simple character data, and the <tt>handle_end()</tt>
  subroutine prints the appropriate HTML end tags, finishing what
  <tt>handle_start()</tt> started.</p>

  <p>As you can see, we were able to create a simple XML to HTML
  converter in less than forty lines of code. Because the FAQ is in
  XML form, we can change the HTML output at whim, or convert it to
  an entirely different format almost as easily.</p>

  <h3>What's Next?</h3>

  <p>Based on its popularity, the Perl and XML combination has a
  bright future. Programmers have begun to release modules built on
  top of XML::Parser for DBI, CGI, and RPC, to name a few acronyms.
