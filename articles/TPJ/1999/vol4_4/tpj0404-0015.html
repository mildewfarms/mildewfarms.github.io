  <p>Many Perl programmers are linguistically adept; the
  expressivity and flow of our language attracts people who enjoy
  the written word. Perl programmers also tend to have a lot of
  free time from getting their jobs done so quickly, and so it's
  natural that they sometimes blend Perl and wordplay. One common
  manifestation of this whimsy is Perl poetry: a poem that also
  happens to be a functioning program.</p>

  <p>Our Obfuscated Perl Contest is ugly and evil. We know this,
  and revel in it. To compensate for encouraging these most
  unpoetic programs, we hereby present out first Perl Poetry
  Contest, to be judged by Perl poet Kevin Meltzer. This is a
  chance to show the world just how beautiful Perl can be.</p>

  <p>Perl Poetry has been around for a decade; on April Fool's Day
  1990, someone forged a Usenet posting in Larry Wall's name with
  four Perl poems. Sharon Hopkins, a longtime friend of Larry Wall
  and the Official Perl Poet, presented <i>Camels and Needles:
  Computer Poetry Meets the Perl Programming Language</i> at the
  Usenix Winter 1992 Technical Conference. One of Sharon's poems,
  <i>listen</i>, has even been published in the <i>Economist</i>
  and the <i>Guardian</i>.</p>

  <p>More recently, this arrived in my inbox:</p>
  <pre>
<tt>
#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# asylum.pl
# by Harl

close (youreyes);
bind  (yourself, fast);

while ($narcosis) {
    exists $to($calm);
        not calm;
}

accept the, anesthesia;
seek the, $granted, $asylum'
and wait;

stat ically;

unlink and listen (in, $complicity);

for (a, little) {
        system ("sync hronicity");
} 
</tt>
</pre>

  <p>Note the rhyme at the end, and Harl's use of poignant imagery,
  wordplay, and the quadruple theme of sleep, insanity,
  connectivity, and socket programming. True, Harl's program
  doesn't <i>do</i> much, bit it's inspirational, and we expect to
  see Harl performing at a Silicon Valley poetry slam near you.</p>

  <p><b>THE CATEGORIES</b></p>

  <p>True poets bridle at constraints, so we won't restrict entries
  to any particular style or genre of poem; mail us anything you
  like. However, please use discretion. We don't find large binary
  files poetic. Here are some ideas to get you started:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Pick a famous poem and "port" it to Perl.</li>

    <li>Write a Perl poem that performs a useful task.</li>

    <li>A Haiku, Tanka, or Limerick about Perl. Haikus(syllable
    pattern 5-7-5) and tankas (5-7-5-7-7) don't rhyme; limericks
    (9-9-6-6-9) do, in an AABBA pattern. (Also see the separate
    haiku contest mentioned in Damian Conway's Coy.pm article,
    earlier in this issue.)</li>

    <li>Write a program that generates poetry.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>JUDGING</b></p>

  <p>All poems must run without error under Perl 5.005, and entries
  will receive extra credit for running under the <tt>-w</tt> flag.
  Don't worry about whitespace, and don't try anything cheap like
  using comments excessively. We'll be watching. Extra points will
  be awarded for particular poetic styles, like iambic pentameter
  or internal rhyme. Whether your poem employs the pronunciations
  of non-alphanumeric characters(for instance, <tt>$bill</tt> as
  "dollar bill") is up to you.</p>

  <p>Choosing the prizes was easy. Winners will receive Magnetic
  Perl Poetry Kits from Perltoys.com</p>

  <p><b>SUBMITTING</b></p>

  <p>Enter on or before February 20, 2000 by mailing you poem to
  contest@tpj.com. At the end of your poem, include the
  following:</p>

  <p>&bull; Your name and email address.<br>
  &bull; An explanation of what your program does, if anything.
  If<br>
  your program is derived from an original poem, please include
  it.<br>
  &bull; Anything else you'd like us to know. For instance, if your
  poem requires pronouncing non-alphanumeric characters in a
  particular way (is # pronounced "pound", "bang", or "hash"?), say
  so.</p>

  <p>Good luck!</p>
