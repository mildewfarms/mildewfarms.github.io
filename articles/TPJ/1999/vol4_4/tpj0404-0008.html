  <p>There are a few precious books in my library that seem almost
  magical. A beginner can pick one up and become and expert, just
  by reading the book, because of the tremendous breadth and depth
  of the subject matter and because of the perfectly clear
  exposition. An expert can also pick up the book and learn
  something new for the same reasons. These are books that you can
  buy when you're just starting out in a field, and even though you
  pull them off the shelf every week for years and years they never
  seem to run dry. There aren't many of these books; Tanenbaum's
  <i>Computer Networks</i> is one. I think Damian Conway's
  <i>Object Oriented Perl</i> is another.</p>

  <p>It may sound almost trivial, but I think the best thing about
  this book is the division into sections. I read a lot of prose in
  which the sentence breaks are in arbitrary places: the author
  wrote for a while, then ran out of steam and pressed the period
  key. Then he wrote some more and when he got tired he pressed the
  period key again. Eventually, he went to get a fresh cup of
  coffee and when he got back he started a new paragraph.</p>

  <p>When so few authors have a grasp on something as simple as a
  sentence, it's really rare to find a book that is intelligently
  divided up into sections or chapters, and one forgets how
  valuable such an organization can be.</p>

  <p>Each chapter in <i>Object Oriented Perl</i> is about a big
  idea, like persistence, overloading, encapsulation, or
  genericity. (Don't worry if you don't know what these things are;
  Chapter 1 is about jargon.) It's usually hard to understand ideas
  as big as these. But the organization of this book makes it easy:
  you can understand a chapter because the big ideas of the
  chapters are divided into smaller ideas so cleanly and because
  the smaller ideas are in such a straightforward order. It is very
  difficult to write a book like this. The clean division of the
  chapters means that you can pick up the book, open to a section
  at random, and learn something useful from it even without the
  context. The order and organization make it easy to understand
  each section in context, so that you can see what problem is
  being solved and how the ideas presented in each section solves
  the problem.</p>

  <p>This organization is repeated at the next step down also: The
  smaller ideas are divided into little ideas, and each subsection,
  while self-contained, fits clearly and neatly into the larger
  pattern. You can pick up this book for five minutes and come away
  knowing something useful; you can also study it for ten hours and
  learn something even more useful.</p>

  <p>For beginners, the book starts with straightforward, simple
  things, including an explanation of OO terminology and a
  fifty-page summary of Perl syntax and semantics, then follows
  with a simple example of a class using blessed hashes. Chapter 4
  is about blessed arrays and scalars, and chapter 5 is about
  making objects based on other kinds of data, including blessed
  filehandles and regexes. The following chapters are about
  inheritance, polymorphism, and how to construct classes
  automatically. The transition from simple things to progressively
  more complex ones is smooth and even.</p>

  <p>For experts, I guarantee that Conway will find something that
  you haven't seen before. For me it was the section on
  implementing strong member data privacy with flyweight scalar
  objects. (I don't want to spoil the surprise, so I won't say
  anything else about it.) Conway isn't afraid to let Perl be Perl,
  so in the course of discussing object-oriented programming, it
  also touches on all sorts of Perl programming techniques. For
  example, Conway isn't afraid to use eval to construct code on
  demand, or to use a glob assignment to install a new method into
  a package. These techniques have wide applicability.</p>

  <p>The book should also work well for programmers who have
  experience with object-oriented programming in some language
  other than Perl. Besides the fifty-page summary of Perl OOP
  features up front, at the end there is a nine-page summary of the
  entire book, with code examples, and an appendix which compares
  Perl in detail with Smalltalk, Java, Eiffel, and C++.</p>

  <p>There are some small problems. The quality of typesetting and
  layout is not quite good enough -- certainly not as good as this
  book deserves. The cover is ugly, and I worry about the
  durability of the binding.</p>

  <p>I forgot to mention that the book is also funny. When was the
  last time you read a funny programming book? I'd tell you when it
  was for me but I can't actually remember any funny programming
  books.</p>

  <p>Everyone should buy this book. We should all give Damian lots
  and lots of money to encourage him to write more books.</p>

  <p><i>Object-Oriented Perl</i> is the most advanced Perl book
  I've read. I thought that I was a fairly advanced user of Perl;
  I've used most of the individual features and have written some
  decently large programs and modules. But what I hadn't realized,
  and what this book makes clear, is the wealth of expression that
  Perl allows by combining its primitives. There aren't many more
  actual features of Perl used here than bless and some scoping
  tricks (such as closures), but by combining them the programmer
  can achieve about every object-oriented trick there is.</p>

  <p>You may think, as I did at first, that having a good knowledge
  of object-oriented programming and a good knowledge of Perl would
  mean that you already know most of the material in this book. In
  fact, the book isn't so much about either of those topics as it
  is about writing idiomatic Perl code to accomplish all sorts of
  tasks that come up in the course of object-oriented programming.
  If you're looking for Perl code to implement design patterns, you
  won't find it here, but you will learn how to bless a typeglob,
  and how to use a single package for both tie-ing and
  blessing.</p>

  <p>Conway covers the material very well, and very thoroughly. I
  learned some things that I wish I had known when I wrote an
  article about ties for the Perl Journal. Perhaps the most useful
  sections of the book were those explaining how to use some common
  convenience modules such as Class::Struct, Class::MethodMaker,
  and the overload pragma, none of which I was familiar with
  before.</p>

  <p>The book is organized by topic, and not by difficulty. This
  makes it useful as a reference (you can sit down with it for an
  afternoon and learn everything about ties), but more difficult
  for someone who's learning the material for the first time. We
  are on page 168, already having read about esoterica such as
  blessing regular expressions, before we encounter inheritance. My
  advice to the first time reader would be to skim the book, paying
  special attention to the first section of each chapter, before
  diving into the details.</p>

  <p><i>Object-Oriented Perl</i> includes a couple of appendices,
  one of which summarizes how to use Perl's object-oriented
  features, and one of which compares Perl to four other popular
  object-oriented languages, including small "phrasebooks" for
  translating concepts between the languages. This material is very
  useful, and again, you may want to peruse it early on, in case
  you're not able to get through the full 400 pages of advanced
  material first.</p>

  <p>I found a moderate number of typos in both the text and the
  code, but that's not surprising in the first edition of a book
  with this much information, and they were all noted in the online
  errata.</p>

  <p>The visual design of the book is faultless. There's a lot of
  information on every page, but it reads very clearly. This trait
  is regrettably rare among computer books, so I want to make sure
  Manning is complimented for it.</p>

  <p><i>Object-Oriented Perl</i> is a complete and authoritative
  reference on most of the object-oriented nooks and crannies of
  the Perl language. I would have reservations recommending it as a
  first text to a Perl programmer who had never encountered
  object-oriented programming before -- I think it would be rather
  intimidating -- but for anyone who already knows the basics and
  wants to make sure that they understand the whole field before
  diving into a big project, it's essential.</p>

  <p align="right"><i>--Dan Schmidt</i></p>

  <p>I recently recommended <i>Object Oriented Perl</i> to a
  co-worker who has begun working with ties and methods and, well,
  object oriented Perl. His response, after reading the first three
  chapters: "I'm impressed. And I'm not easily impressed."</p>

  <p>This is an impressive book. Damian Conway has managed to write
  a book for nearly everyone. If you're just starting out, there's
  a tutorial on object-oriented programming. This is also useful if
  it's been a while since you used OOP and need a vocabulary
  refresher. If you're learning Perl as well, Chapter 2 contains a
  remarkably smooth overview of Perl. If you're an experienced Perl
  programmer, you may want to skip ahead to later chapters (but I'd
  recommend reading the first two or three anyway; you may find
  something new). If you're an experienced OOP programmer, Appendix
  B provides a comparison between Perl and other popular
  object-oriented languages.</p>

  <p>Another reader I spoke to recently called this book "A
  Graduate Course in Perl." When I scan my bookshelves, I find
  numerous introductory books on Perl but only a few that I'd call
  Intermediate to Advanced. <i>Object Oriented Perl</i> fits
  solidly into the latter category. By the time you finish this
  book, you'll understand what object-oriented programming is, how
  it works in Perl, and how to use it to your advantage. At the
  same time, you'll also learn more about Perl, more about
  programming, and you'll be entertained in the process.</p>

  <p>This is more than just a reference book on how to use the
  object-oriented programming features of Perl. This is a textbook
  for a class (self-taught or otherwise) on OOP, in which the
  language of choice is Perl. As Damian Conway points out, Perl was
  not originally designed to be object oriented; object-oriented
  programming is not a fundamental focus of the language. This
  doesn't mean, however, that you can't use Perl to build reusable,
  maintainable, large systems just as you can with other OO
  languages. You can use Perl, you can do so effectively, and you
  can have fun doing it.</p>

  <p>The style of this book is informal and witty; the examples are
  clear, interesting, and practical; the typography is clean; the
  graphics (although occasionally a bit small) are well-done. It's
  obvious that the author understands his subject and knows how to
  teach.</p>

  <p>If you're planning to make use of the object-oriented
  programming features of Perl (or if you'd just like to know more
  about OOP), buy this book.</p>
