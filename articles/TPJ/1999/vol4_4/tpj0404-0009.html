  <p>This article is the result of my own personal adventures in
  maintaining a rapidly growing web site via FTP, without the
  benefit of a telnet shell on my server. If you have FTP access to
  your web server's file tree, there are four reasons why mirroring
  with FTP may be preferrable to HTTP:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Your ISP's web server munges links and image paths in your
    HTML pages, so you can't use HTTP to mirror the site.</li>

    <li>There is a cache between your HTTP client and your web
    server, making you retrieve out-of-date pages.</li>

    <li>Your web site contains dynamically generated content.</li>

    <li>You have data besides HTML pages and images, such as Perl
    programs.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This article will demonstrate how to recursively traverse an
  FTP site using the Net::FTP module bundled with Graham Barr's
  libnet distribution on the CPAN. For the pedantically inclined,
  further background information regarding the FTP protocol is
  available in RFC 959.</p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>

  <p>You may find yourself in the unenviable position of trying to
  maintain a remote file tree without shell access to the system
  where your file tree resides. Your file tree might contain a web
  site, an FTP site, or other data.</p>

  <p>Many ISPs do not provide shell accounts, either for security
  reasons or because the host operating system has no concept of a
  remote login shell (such as on MacOS or Windows). If you take the
  login shell out of the equation and wish to automate the process
  of moving data between file trees on your local machine and your
  server, a scriptable client becomes a necessity. Fortunately, the
  Net::FTP module provides an implementation of the FTP protocol so
  that you can write FTP scripts in your favorite scripting
  language. Here are some off-the-shelf approaches to tackling this
  problem:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The classic command-line FTP client.</li>

    <li>One of the larger fully-featured mirroring tools, such as
    Lee McLoughlin's <tt>mirror</tt>
    (http://sunsite.org.uk/packages/mirror/, written entirely in
    Perl), or Pavuk (http://www.idata.sk/~ondrej/pavuk/).</li>

    <li>A graphical FTP client, such as <tt>gFTP</tt>
    (http://gftp.seul.org/), a fairly new but rapidly maturing
    graphical X Window FTP client based on the gtk+ library, or
    WS_FTP (http://www.ipswitch.com/), a graphical Windows
    client.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Each of these tools has its own strengths and weaknesses, and
  a corresponding place in your toolbox. As my web site has grown
  over the last couple of years, I have found myself moving
  individual files and directories with either command-line FTP, or
  one of the graphical clients mentioned above.</p>

  <p>The cornerstone of the Perl philosophy is that "There's always
  more than one way to do it." I propose the following corollary:
  "but it's always more fun to do it <i>your way</i>". This article
  will show you how. Here is an amusing anecdote illustrating why I
  think it's more fun to write your own software:</p>

  <blockquote>
    An old friend of mine works for one of the big car companies,
    designing electric cars. One day he described the basic
    architecture of an electric car, saying "Well, you have some
    batteries, a motor, a transmission, some software..." I
    interrupted, "Hold it right there! I write software for a
    living, and believe me, I don't want ANY software in MY car .
    at least not any software that I haven't personally written and
    tested!"
  </blockquote>

  <p>When I stumbled across Net::FTP by accident one day, I began
  developing a small but effective mirroring program of my own. I
  had been avoiding the larger mirroring packages, since I find
  them to be too (how to say this delicately?) "feature-rich" for
  my taste.</p>

  <p>If you have shell access, mirroring a file tree is
  trivial:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>1. Package up your file tree on your development machine:
      <pre>
% <b>cd ~/filetree</b>
% <b>tar cvf - . | gzip &gt; ../filetree.tar.gz</b>
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>FTP your package over to the server:
      <pre>
% <b>cd ..</b>
% <b>ftp someisp.net</b>
Conected to someisp.net
220 someisp.net FTPServer (Version wu-2.4.2) ready.
Name (someisp.net:gerard): <b>gerard</b>
331 Password required for gerard.
Password:
230 User gerard logged in.
Remote system type is UNIX.
ftp&gt; <b>cd /home/html/users/gerard</b>
250 CWD command successful.
ftp&gt; <b>bin</b>
200 Type set to I.
ftp&gt; <b>put filetree.tar.gz</b>
put filetree.tar.gz

200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for filetree.tar.gz.
226 Transfer complete.

221-Thank you for using the FTP service on lanois.
221 Goodbye.
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Open a shell on the remote server:
      <pre>
% <b>telnet someisp.net</b>
Trying 127.0.0.1...

% 
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Change directory to the root of the remote file tree (and
    delete the old file tree, if necessary):
      <pre>
% <b>cd /home/html/users/gerard</b>
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Unpack your new file tree:
      <pre>
% <b>gunzip &lt; filetree.tar.gz | tar xvf -</b>
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Close the shell on the remote server:
      <pre>
% <b>exit</b>
Connection closed by foreign host.
%
</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>In the reverse direction:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open a shell on the server:
      <pre>
% <b>telnet someisp.net</b>
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Package it up:
      <pre>
% <b>cd /home/html/users/gerard</b>
% <b>tar cvf - . | gzip &gt;  filetreemirror.tar.gz</b>
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Close the shell on the remote server:
      <pre>
% <b>exit</b>
Connection closed by foreign host.
%
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>FTP the tree onto your local machine:
      <pre>
% <b>cd ~</b>
% <b>mkdir filetreemirror</b>
% <b>ftp someisp.net</b>
...
ftp&gt; <b>get filetreemirror.tar.gz</b>
...
ftp&gt; <b>bye</b>
...
%
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Unpack it on your local machine:
      <pre>
% <b>gunzip &lt; filetreemirror.tar.gz | tar xvf -</b>
</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>For these two simple cases, an automated Perl client is
  probably overkill. But take the shell account out of the
  equation, and you'll find yourself engaging in some very long
  conversations with your FTP server.</p>

  <h3>Net::FTP</h3>

  <p>Although the documentation for Net::FTP says that only a
  subset of RFC 959 is implemented, you will find that the
  implementation provided by Net::FTP is sufficiently robust for a
  wide variety of uses. The real power of Net::FTP stems from the
  power of the Perl programming language itself.</p>

  <p>The Net::FTP module is contained in the libnet distribution,
  available from your favorite CPAN mirror in the directory
  modules/by-module/Net. The filename will be of the form
  libnet-X.YYYY.tar.gz. As of this writing, the most current
  version was 1.0607, dated a long time ago: 22-Aug-1998.</p>

  <p>There is also a virtually identical FTP capability in the
  Win32::Internet extension module, although Net::FTP works equally
  well in both the Unix and Windows environments.</p>

  <h3>Downloading A File -- The Simple Case</h3>

  <p>Here is a short example illustrating how to download a single
  file; I occasionally use this to download my web server. s access
  log. It is a simple example, but demonstrates all the major steps
  involved in scripting an FTP session with Net::FTP.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Use the Net::FTP package:
      <pre>
use Net::FTP;
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Instantiate an FTP object:
      <pre>
$ftp = NET::FTP-&gt;new("someisp.net") 
  or die "ERROR: Net::FTP-&gt;new failed\n";
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Start an FTP session by logging in to the remote FTP
    server:
      <pre>
$ftp-&gt;login("anonymous", "g_lanois@yahoo.com") 
  or die "ERROR: login failed\n";
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Navigate to the directory containing the file you wish to
    download:
      <pre>
$ftp-&gt;cwd("/pub/outgoing/logs")
   or die "ERROR: cwd failed\n";
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Retrieve the file or files of interest:
      <pre>
$ftp-&gt;get("access_log")
   or die "ERROR: get failed\n";
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>End the FTP session:
      <pre>
$ftp-&gt;quit;
</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Recursion</h3>

  <p>Let's quickly review Perl's recursion capability. Recursion
  barely gets a mention in the perlsub documentation: "Subroutines
  may be called recursively." This just means that a subroutine can
  call itself.</p>

  <p>Here is a short example which shows how useful this can be.
  The factorial of a number n is the product of all the integers
  between 1 and n. The factorial() subroutine below is recursive:
  it computes the factorial of $n as $n multiplied by factorial($n
  - 1).</p>
  <pre>
    sub factorial {
        my $n = shift;
        return ($n == 1) ? 1 : $n * factorial($n - 1);
    }
</pre>

  <p>The conceptual model of a file tree is an example of what
  graph theoreticians call a directed acyclic graph. Recursion is
  the tool of choice when describing algorithms which traverse the
  nodes of a file tree.</p>

  <h3>Downloading A File Tree . The Recursive Case</h3>

  <p>On the local machine, if we wanted to crawl a file tree
  recursively, we would use the <tt>finddepth()</tt> subroutine
  from the File::Find module. (See Recipes 9.7 and 9.8 in the Perl
  Cookbook). However, there is no way to perform a
  <tt>finddepth()</tt> on a remote file tree via the FTP
  protocol.</p>

  <p>Before we tackle the problem of mirroring a remote file tree,
  let's first develop the technology to crawl the tree. Our
  approach combines recursion with Net::FTP calls to perform a
  <tt>find()</tt>-like recursive traversal of the remote tree. Here
  is a snippet of pseudocode:</p>
  <pre>
  sub crawl_tree {

      Get a list of all directories and files in the current directory;
  
      for (each item in the list) {
          if (item is a directory) {
              Save the current FTP remote working directory;
              Change into the directory called "item";
              crawl_tree();
              Restore the remote working directory to what it was before;
          }
      }
  }
</pre>

  <p><tt>crawl_ftp</tt> (shown in <a href=
  "tpj0404-0009a.html"><b>Listing 1</b></a>) is a Perl program
  which traverses a remote file tree, listing the directories and
  files it finds along the way.</p>

  <p>I discovered several interesting issues when developing this
  script. Any script which uses Net::FTP needs to check for and
  handle these conditions:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>$ftp-&gt;cwd will fail on a directory which has permission
    set to d---------</li>

    <li>$ftp-&gt;cwd will succeed on d--x--x--x, but $ftp-&gt;dir
    will fail on d--x--x--x</li>

    <li>Some (but not all) FTP servers include . and .. when you
    request a directory listing. Do not recurse on these
    directories. If you recurse on .., you'll crawl up the tree
    instead of down. If you recurse on . (the current directory),
    you'll cause a tear in the space-time continuum, and the
    computer the script is running on will turn into a Klein
    bottle.</li>

    <li>RFC959 does not dictate the format of a directory listing.
    The following assumptions are reasonable if you don't know the
    FTP server's listing format in advance:
      <pre>
&bull;  The columns in the listing are separated by whitespace.  

&bull;  The last column contains the file name. 

&bull;  Directory items in the listing begin with d.
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Handling file names with spaces requires a priori knowledge
    of the listing format. (The <tt>unpack()</tt> function is
    perfect for parsing out the columns of the directory listing.)
    The programs in this article do not handle file names with
    spaces.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The <tt><a href="tpj0404-0009a.html"><b>crawl_ftp</b></a></tt>
  program shown here produces a nicely-indented listing of the
  remote file tree.</p>

  <p>It would be far more useful to generalize the
  <tt>crawl_tree()</tt> subroutine, using the same subroutine
  reference callback mechanism employed by File::Find's find() and
  <tt>finddepth()</tt>. The perlref documentation brushes lightly
  over the concept of subroutine references, mentioning it in
  detail only in the context of anonymous subroutines. In our case,
  it allows us to package our tree crawling technology into a Perl
  module.</p>

  <p>The next listing gives a modified version, with crawl_tree()
  renamed to ftp_finddepth() and generalized through the use of a
  subroutine reference.</p><a href=
  "tpj0404-0009b.html"><tt><b>crawl_ftp2</b></tt></a>

  <p>The first step is to create a module for the general purpose
  ftp_finddepth() technology we just developed. Then we can write a
  downloading application that uses the module to traverse the
  remote file tree's directory structure, transferring any files it
  finds along the way.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0404-0009c.html"><b>Listing 3:
  FTPFind.pm</b></a></p>

  <p>Writing an application to download a file tree is just a
  simple matter of writing a <tt>process_item()</tt> callback that
  mirrors the directory tree and retrieves files, depending on what
  <tt>ftp_finddepth()</tt> passed it.</p>

  <p>If <tt>process_item()</tt> is called with a directory (as
  indicated by the <tt>$isdir</tt> parameter), we want to create a
  directory in the local filesystem. If <tt>process_item()</tt> is
  called with a file, we issue an FTP <tt>get()</tt> request to
  download the file.</p>

  <h3>Uploading A File -- The Simple Case</h3>

  <p>Uploading a file is exactly the same as downloading, except
  you call the Net::FTP <tt>get()</tt> subroutine instead of
  <tt>put()</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Uploading A File Tree -- The Recursive Case</h3>

  <p>You would think that using File::Find's <tt>find()</tt> or
  <tt>finddepth()</tt> would be the way to iterate over the local
  file tree. There is one small problem with this approach:
  <tt>find()</tt> and <tt>finddepth()</tt> report the <i>full</i>
  path name of the local directories they find. We only want
  <i>relative</i> local path names of each directory, so that we
  can duplicate the relative file subtree on the remote system.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0404-0009d.html"><b>Listing 4:
  mirror_get</b></a></p>

  <p>We can get by without a remote <tt>mkpath()</tt>-like
  capability on the remote system, since we can mirror the local
  directory to the remote site on the fly as we descend the local
  tree. We will keep track of our relative location in the local
  file tree by pushing each directory we descend into onto the back
  of a Perl array.</p>

  <p>So, leaving File::Find's <tt>find()</tt> and
  <tt>finddepth()</tt> behind, we'll develop our own
  <tt>finddepth()</tt>. Longtime users of Perl might remember the
  old example program called down distributed with Perl 4. Our
  version, called <tt>finddepth_gl()</tt> (shown below) performs a
  similar function -- but more portably, since it doesn't involve
  invoking a Unix command via the Perl system function.</p>

  <p>Beware that Net::FTP's <tt>mkdir()</tt> will return failure if
  the directory already exists.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0404-0009e.html"><b>Listing 5:
  mirror_put</b></a></p>

  <h3>Applications</h3>

  <p>The ability to automate FTP operations relieves a great deal
  of tedium from having to manually push and pull files to and from
  your remote file tree. This is particularly useful for periodic
  and repetitive tasks such as log file retrieval, or unattended
  updating of an otherwise static web site.</p>

  <p>The mirroring applications given above only scratch the
  surface of what is possible, given a generalized and recursive
  FTP site traversal mechanism. This gives you the ability to grind
  over your entire remote file tree. In the case of a web site,
  this is particularly helpful for rooting out missing or orphaned
  files. Another application is to automatically check and fix the
  permissions on all the files in your remote tree. Do you remember
  the last time you had to do <i>that</i> by hand?</p>
