  Poetry is for <i>everyone</i> to make.<br>
  -- Lautr&eacute;amont (Isidore Ducasse, 1846-1870)</p>

  <p>Wherever I go, people always come up to me and say "Sean, you
  gotta help me --I need to find a three-syllable word that rhymes
  with 'toad'." And my answer is always the same; I always say
  "Well, we. re going to have to pull out the Perl for this
  one!"</p>

  <p>Because, while <i>The Perl Journal</i> articles constantly
  demonstrate that Perl is good at everything from designing
  sundials to peppering IRC with Eliza bots, one thing that it's
  <i>really really</i> good at is making short little programs for
  searching text. And that's what this article is about --how to
  search text (specifically wordlists or pronunciation databases)
  for rhymes of various kinds.</p>

  <h3>Where To Look</h3>

  <p>If this article were about rhyming in Spanish or Italian, or
  Finnish, it'd be a whole lot shorter! Because for the most part,
  the way something is spelled in these languages tells you pretty
  well how to pronounce it; ending with the same letters may not be
  exactly the same thing as rhyming, but often you can start with
  the spelling and apply some trivial string replacement operations
  to get a phonetic form that can be searched for the presence of a
  rhyme. This can work even with with French, where (for the most
  part) spelling tells you pronunciation, even though the
  pronunciation won't tell you the spelling.</p>

  <p>However, English isn't that kind of language --not only does
  the English pronunciation of a word not tell you how to spell it,
  its spelling doesn't tell you how to pronounce it. But luckily,
  lexicons exist that tell are basically simple databases,
  associating the normal written form of a word with some
  representation of its pronunciation. One of my favorite lexicons
  (partly because it's <i>free</i>!) is Moby Pronunciator. It
  consists of about 177,000 entries, one word to a line, that look
  like this:</p>
  <pre>
   ...
   accipitrine /&amp;/k's/I/p/I/tr/I/n 
   Accius '/&amp;/k/S//i//@/s 
   acclaim /@/'kl/eI/m 
   acclamation ,/&amp;/kl/@/'m/eI//S//@/n 
   acclamation_medal ,/&amp;/kl/@/'m/eI//S//@/n_'m/E/d/-/l 
   acclamatory /@/'kl/&amp;/m/@/,t/oU/r/i/ 
   acclimate /@/'kl/aI/m/I/t 
   acclimation ,/&amp;/kl/@/'m/eI//S//@/n 
   acclimation_fever ,/&amp;/kl/@/'m/eI//S//@/n_'f/i/v/@/r 
   acclimatise /@/'kl/aI/m/@/,t/aI/z 
   acclimatize /@/'kl/aI/m/@/,t/aI/z 
   acclivity /@/'kl/I/v/I/t/i/ 
   ...
</pre>

  <p>Ignoring the meanings of these symbols, you can see that (as
  the README will tell you), the format of each line is the word
  (or underscore-separated multiword phrase, like
  "acclamation_medal"), then a space, then the phonetic notation.
  What the slashes mean (and why there isn't one between the
  <tt>/k/</tt> and <tt>/l/</tt>) is something I'm unsure of. But I
  am sure that these slashes are annoying, since they get in the
  way of me trying to search. I have to remember to stick them in
  my search patterns, and I always worry that I stuck in one too
  many. The same goes for the commas and apostrophes, which
  indicate stress --and when I'm looking for a rhyme, I may not
  care about stress.</p>

  <h3>Preparing the Data</h3>

  <p>So the first thing to do, whether it's for the Moby
  Pronunciator wordlist or for any other wordlist you choose, is to
  strip out the parts you don't want, take what's left, and format
  it the way you like. Here, we can do that by deleting certain
  tokens in the pronunciation part:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;slashes (used to separate phonemes?)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;spaces and underscores (used to separate words)<br>
  " &nbsp;&nbsp;apostrophes (used to precede syllables with primary
  stress)<br>
  " &nbsp;&nbsp;commas (used to precede syllables with secondary
  stress)<br></p>

  <p>Since these tokens are all single characters, we can delete
  them by just applying a tr operator to slashes, spaces,
  underscores, commas, and apostrophes. We use the <tt>d</tt>
  switch ("d" for delete):</p>
  <pre>
tr/\/ _,'//d;
</pre>

  <p>Personally, I find it disconcerting to have the
  backslash-escaped slash in there, so I tend to use different
  delimiters, like matching wedges:</p>
  <pre>
tr&lt;/_,'&gt;&lt;&gt;d;
</pre>

  <p>Either way, you can build this into a program that reads the
  Moby Pronunciator database:</p>
  <pre>
         open(IN, '&lt;mobypron.unc') or die $!;
         while (&lt;IN&gt;) {
              chomp;
              ($word, $pron) = split(' ', $_);
              $pron =~ tr&lt;/ _,'&gt;&lt;&gt;d;
              ... then do something with $word and $pron ...
   }

</pre>

  <p>designtimesp="29857"&gt;Now, to search this database for
  rhymes (or any other phonetic information), there are two ways to
  go about it:</p>

  <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the code above, and once you've modified
  <tt>$pron</tt>, search it for a pattern;<br></p>

  <p>or:</p>

  <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;write <tt>$word</tt> and the modified
  <tt>$pron</tt> to a file, and then use <tt>grep</tt> on that
  file.<br></p>

  <p>The benefit of the former is simplicity, but the benefit of
  the latter is efficiency . no need to constantly <tt>chomp</tt>,
  <tt>split</tt>, and <tt>tr</tt> for each line. Now, normally I
  say that program (as opposed to programmer) efficiency is
  overvalued in programming. But in this case, the Moby wordlist is
  so very large that the waste of the first approach is
  significant. So I say the second approach the one to take. We can
  save each line' s <tt>$word</tt> and <tt>$pron</tt> values to a
  file called <tt>mpron.dat</tt>, like so:</p>
  <pre>
 open(IN, '&lt;mobypron.unc') or die $!;
 open(OUT, '&gt;mpron.dat') or die $!;
 while (&lt;IN&gt;) {
      chomp;
      ($word, $pron) = split(' ', $_);
      $pron =~ tr&lt;/ _,'&gt;&lt;&gt;d;
      print OUT $word, "\t", $pron, "\n";
      # tab makes a nice delimiter
  }


</pre>

  <p>The resulting file, <tt>mpron.dat</tt>, begins like this:</p>
  <pre>
        ...
        accipitrine         &amp;ksIpItrIn
        Accius              &amp;kSi@s
        acclaim             @kleIm
        acclamation         &amp;kl@meIS@n
        acclamation_medal   &amp;kl@meIS@nmEd-l
        acclamatory         @kl&amp;m@toUri
        acclimate           @klaImIt
        acclimation         &amp;kl@meIS@n
        acclimation_fever   &amp;kl@meIS@nfiv@r
        acclimatise         @klaIm@taIz
        acclimatize         @klaIm@taIz
        acclivity           @klIvIti
        ...     
        
</pre>

  <h3>Searching The Prepared Data</h3>

  <p>With mpron.dat prepared, we can grep it for whatever pattern
  we want in the pronunciation. Suppose we're still after a
  three-syllable word that rhymes with "toad". The idea of rhyme in
  English is a pretty straightforward matter: if two words rhyme,
  this means they end for Moby Pronunciator (or whatever alternate
  pronunciation database you might use), I could, off the top of my
  head, say how to represent the sound "-oad" (from "toad").
  However, I've never bothered, since so easy to just look up the
  word you want to rhyme with, and see how it's represented:</p>

  <p>in some sounds (generally last vowel and any consonants
  following it). If I were quite familiar with the phonetic
  notation &gt;</p>
  <pre>
% grep '^toad' mpron.dat
toad                toUd
toad's-mouth        toUdzmouT
toadeater           toUdit@r
toadfish            toUdfIS
toadflax            toUdfl&amp;ks
toadstone           toUdstoUn
toadstool           toUdstul
toadstool_disease   toUdstuldIziz
toady               toUdi
</pre>
  <pre>
oUd <b>it is!</b>
% grep 'oUd$' mpron.dat
abode           @boUd
access_road     &amp;ksEsroUd
acnode          &amp;knoUd
Aeolian_mode    ioUli@nmoUd
alamode         &amp;l@moUd
Alexis_Claude   AlEksikloUd
all-hallowed    Olh&amp;loUd
anchor_rode     &amp;Nk@rroUd
</pre>

  <p>...and 281 other matches, ending with zip_code
  (<tt>zIpkoUd</tt>). There are so many because we haven't limited
  our search to three-syllable words. So how do we do that?</p>

  <h3>Counting Syllables</h3>

  <p>As with most models of syllables in most languages, an English
  syllable is basically a vowel sound with some number of
  consonants before and after it. Now, actually settling on what
  consonants go with what vowels is a sticky subject (is rostrum
  <tt>rAs-tr@m</tt> or <tt>rA-str@m</tt>?), but since all we want
  to do now is count the syllables, we merely need to count the
  number of vowel sounds.</p>

  <p>You've seen that some vowel sounds, like the long "o" sound in
  "toad" are represented by a pair of ASCII characters,
  <tt>oU</tt>. That means that we can't simply count the number of
  vowel characters in the pronunciation string, because then oU
  would count as two. We could count the number of times we find a
  sequence of some number of vowel characters, but that would match
  only once in each of these two-syllable words:</p>
  <pre>
eon   i@n   (one sequence: "i@")
Noah  noU@  (one sequence: "oU@")
</pre>

  <p>(The @ character here represents the "uh" sound in unstressed
  syllables.) However, if we go back to the format of the original
  Moby Pronunciator file (as opposed to our cooked
  <tt>mpron.dat</tt> file), we see that those slashes can do us
  some good:</p>
  <pre>
eon '/i//@/n
Noah 'n/oU//@/
</pre>

  <p>One consistency is that there's at least one between vowels in
  different syllables. So where the vowels in the two syllables in
  "Noah" in our prepared file run together, they are still separate
  in the original file. This means that if we start with the
  original form of the pronunciation entry, and count the number of
  occurrences of sequences of vowel characters:</p>
  <pre>
eon '/i//@/n  (two sequences: "i", "@")
Noah 'n/oU//@/  (two sequences: "oU", "@")
</pre>

  <p>...then we get a correct syllable count. All we need to know
  now is what "vowel characters" means. The Moby Pronunciator
  documentation says that it uses all of the following characters
  (or sequences of them):</p>
  <pre>
a e i u o  A E I O U  y Y  &amp; @ -
</pre>

  <p>We can count syllables by seeing how often this matches:</p>
  <pre>
m/[-\&amp;yYaeiouAEIOU\@]+/g
</pre>

  <p>We can simply write that into our program that produces
  mpron.dat, by matching it against $pron before we delete the
  slashes.</p>

  <h3>Coping with (Syllabic) Stress</h3>

  <p>Let's say this three-syllable word to rhyme with "toad" is
  needed not merely for its austere artistic potency, but because
  we need it to complete our Baudelairean opus magnum which
  ends:</p>
  <pre>
I chanced upon a lovely toad,
It gleamed and danced like ____!
</pre>

  <p><i>...DUM-duh-DUM</i>. In technical terms, you've got
  eight-syllable lines, with this metrical pattern (where slash
  means stressed, and underscore means unstressed):</p>
  <pre>
I chanced upon a lovely toad,
_   /     _ /  _  /   _  /
It gleamed and danced like ____!
_    /     _    /      _   / _ /
</pre>

  <p>So not only do you want the word you're after to have three
  syllables, but you want it to have a particular stress pattern. A
  word like:</p>
  <pre>
electrode
_ /   _
</pre>

  <p>has the exactly the wrong stress pattern, even though it
  <i>is</i> three syllables long, and rhymes with "toad". (That's
  aside from "danced like electrode" being a bit ungrammatical
  --hey, this is <i>poetry!</i>). Since we're about to rebuild
  <tt>mpron.dat</tt> to contain each entry's syllable count, we
  might as well note syllable stress patterns too.</p>

  <p>Stress is noted in the original data file with commas and
  apostrophes:</p>
  <pre>
acclamatory /@/'kl/&amp;/m/@/,t/oU/r/i/
acclimate /@/'kl/aI/m/I/t
acclimation ,/&amp;/kl/@/'m/eI//S//@/n
</pre>

  <p>Unfortunately, the apostrophe (primary stress) or comma
  (secondary stress) that marks the following syllable as stressed
  isn't right before the vowel that we'd match in order to count
  that syllable. If it were, we could come up with a single regex
  that would match any vowel cluster as well as its stress
  notation:</p>
  <pre>
m/([,']?)[-\&amp;yYaeiouAEIOU\@]+/g
</pre>

  <p>Each time this matched, we could just look in $1 to see what
  kind of stress the syllable had. However, that's not the way the
  data is. As it is, we have to match the stress marks wherever
  they are, and then set a flag so that the following syllable will
  be marked as stressed (and in the absence of the flag, marked
  unstressed). We can combine this with the syllable counter that
  works its way through the word, based on this regex:</p>
  <pre>
m/[',]|[-\&amp;yYaeiouAEIOU\@]+/g
</pre>

  <p>We can work this into part of the main loop for our converter
  program, so that it can cook up a field representing the meter of
  each word for each line in <tt>mpron.dat</tt>.<br>
  (Usually "meter" is used for talking about the consistent stress
  pattern of whole lines of poetry --but I'm using it here to refer
  to just the stress pattern of particular words, mostly because
  $meter is easier to type than $metrical_structure or
  $stress_pattern!)</p>
  <pre>
while (&lt;IN&gt;) {
     chomp;
     ($word, $pron) = split(' ', $_);
 
     $meter = '';
      # This is where we'll stack up a
      # '0', '1', or '2', one for each
      # vowel-character-group in this
      # word, as seen in $pron
     
     $next_stress_flag = '0'; # initial value
     foreach my $x (
          $pron =~ m/[',]|[-\&amp;yYaeiouAEIOU\@]+/g
           # loop over the vowels and accent marks
           # in $pron &mdash; before we go changing $pron!
     ) {
         if ($x eq ',') {
           $next_stress_flag = '2'; # secondary stress
         } elsif ($x eq "'") {
           $next_stress_flag = '1'; # primary stress
         } else {
           # It's a vowel
           $meter .= $next_stress_flag;
            # Note it as another syllable
           $next_stress_flag = '0';
            # Clear flag for next time
         }
     }
 
     # okay, NOW we can change it
     $pron =~ tr&lt;/ _,'&gt;&lt;&gt;d;
 
     print OUT join("\t", $word, $pron, $meter), "\n";
   }

</pre>

  <p>In case the whole business of $next_stress_flag being set in
  one iteration for use in the next doesn't make much sense. Here's
  a rough English summary of how <tt>$meter</tt> is devised for
  each word:</p>

  <p>Each time a vowel-character cluster is found in this word's
  $pron, add a character to <tt>$meter</tt> representing the stress
  level of this syllable. If this syllable was preceded by an
  apostrophe, note this syllable as "1". If it was preceded by a
  comma, note this syllable as a "2". Otherwise, note it as a
  "0".</p>

  <p>What this whole bother gives us is a mpron.dat file like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
accipitrine        0100    &amp;ksIpItrIn
Accius             100     &amp;kSi@s
acclaim            01      @kleIm
acclamation        2010    &amp;kl@meIS@n
acclamation_medal  201010  &amp;kl@meIS@nmEd-l
acclamatory        01020   @kl&amp;m@toUri
acclimate          010     @klaImIt
acclimation        2010    &amp;kl@meIS@n
acclimation_fever  201010  &amp;kl@meIS@nfiv@r
acclimatise        0102    @klaIm@taIz
acclimatize        0102    @klaIm@taIz
acclivity          0100    @klIvIti
</pre>

  <p>There are three tab-separated fields to each line. If we
  merely want to know the number of syllables in a word, we just
  count the number of characters in the second field. But if we
  want to know more (say, to stipulate the stress pattern of those
  syllables), we have the data to do that, too.</p>

  <p>Now recall that we're looking for a word that meets these
  criteria:</p>
  <pre>
&bull; rhymes with "toad"
&bull; is three syllables long
&bull; and those three syllables have to have the stress pattern
 /_/ (stressed, unstressed, stressed).
</pre>

  <p>We figured out that we could formalize "rhymes with 'toad'" as
  a matter of matching the regex <tt>m/oUd$/</tt>. But when it
  comes to matching the stress pattern of the word, we're thinking
  in terms of stressed and unstressed - a two-term distinction -
  but the data we've got (from the Moby Pronunciator, but most
  pronunciation databases do it this way) represents stress in
  terms of primary stress, secondary stress, and unstressed --a
  three-term distinction.</p>

  <p>After some experimentation, I settled on this as the best way
  to reconcile these two systems: When I say "stressed", I mean
  having primary ("1") or secondary ("2") stress. When I say
  "unstressed", I mean having secondary ('2") stress, or no stress
  ("0").</p>

  <p>So we can now formulate "I want the word to go DUM-duh-DUM" as
  a matter of its meter string matching the regex
  <tt>/[12][02][12]/</tt>.</p>

  <p>Now, to pull off a search with these criteria, we could go
  back to our command-line grep pattern:</p>
  <pre>
% grep 'oUd$' mpron.dat
</pre>

  <p>and amend it with:</p>
  <pre>
% grep 'oUd$' mpron.dat | grep '[12][02][12]' | more
</pre>

  <p>But all this grepping is getting rather cumbersome, and won't
  work terribly nicely with increasingly complex search patterns.
  In the end, it'd be so much simpler if we just wrote a custom
  (and therefore customizable!) search tool in Perl.</p>

  <h3>A Simple mpron Searcher</h3>

  <p>Since there are three fields in our database, it makes sense
  to be able to provide search criteria for any of those three
  fields. And currently, using regular expressions seems the most
  powerful way to stipulate search patterns. So each of our
  searches could be thought of as specified by three regular
  expressions: the first to match the spelling form of the word
  (probably not your primary interest, but it could be useful), the
  second to match the meter of the word, and the third to match the
  pronunciation of the word.</p>

  <p>So I figure this search tool (which we might as well call
  mpron) could have the command line syntax:</p>
  <pre>
% <b>mpron spelling_re stress_re pron_re</b>
</pre>

  <p>...with the assumption that if we stipulate nothing for one or
  any of these regexes, then we. re not imposing any limitation on
  that field. So "rhymes with toad" would be just a matter of:</p>
  <pre>
% <b>mpron  ''  ''  'ouD$'</b>
</pre>

  <p>We can implement this simply with a program like this:</p>
  <pre>
 ($word_re, $meter_re, $pron_re) = @ARGV[0,1,2];
   open(IN, '&lt;mpron.dat') or die "Can't read-open mpron.dat: $!";
 
   print  # For the record, note our input
     "# Word RE: &lt;$word_re&gt;  ",
     "Meter RE: &lt;$meter_re&gt;  ",
     "Pron RE: &lt;$pron_re&gt;\n";
 
   # Then loop over every line
   while (&lt;IN&gt;) {
       chomp;
       print $_, "\n" # the matching line
       if
         ...it meets all our criteria...
   }

</pre>

  <p>Now, how do we formalize "it meets all our criteria"? We could
  just say:</p>
  <pre>
 
   if
       $bits[0] =~ m/$word_re/oi
                     # /o for "compile this regex once",
                     # /i for case insensitive &mdash; I figure
                     #    that'd be useful for just $word_re
    &amp;&amp; $bits[1] =~ m/$meter_re/o
    &amp;&amp; $bits[2] =  m/$pron_re/o

 
</pre>

  <p>However, that makes sense only if we've provided all three
  criteria. We don't want to bother trying to match an element of
  <tt>@bits</tt> against the contents of a variable like
  <tt>$meter_re</tt> if there's nothing in that variable (that is,
  if the search criterion it corresponds to is no criterion at
  all).</p>

  <p>For each kind of test, we want the comparison to succeed if
  there was a criterion and it matches, or if there was no search
  criterion at all. In terms of logical operators, this is an "or"
  relationship. Specifically,</p>
  <pre>
 
pass this test if:
  there was no criterion specified OR I pass the criterion
</pre>

  <p>Passing each of the three criteria is a matter of matching the
  appropriate regex, as with:</p>
  <pre>
$bits[1] =~ m/$meter_re/o
</pre>

  <p>As for how to express "there was no criterion specified", we
  can simply test the string length of the variable containing the
  regex:</p>
  <pre>
 !length($meter_re)
</pre>

  <p>This is true when <tt>$meter_re</tt> is empty. Put it all
  together and you get:</p>
  <pre>
 !length($meter_re) || $bits[1] =~ m/$meter_re/o
</pre>

  <p>For all the tests put together:</p>
  <pre>
print $_, "\n" if
      (!length($word_re)  || $bits[0] =~ m/$word_re/oi)
   &amp;&amp; (!length($meter_re) || $bits[1] =~ m/$meter_re/o)
   &amp;&amp; (!length($pron_re)  || $bits[2] =~ m/$pron_re/o );

</pre>

  <p>Incidentally, you can use the and operator (the low-precedence
  variant of &amp;&amp;) to minimize the number of parentheses:</p>
  <pre>
 print $_, "\n" if
         !length($word_re)  || $bits[0] =~ m/$word_re/oi
     and !length($meter_re) || $bits[1] =~ m/$meter_re/o
     and !length($pron_re)  || $bits[2] =~ m/$pron_re/o ;
</pre>

  <p>And that's all we've got to do for a fully featured program
  that searches any of mpron.dat's fields.</p>

  <p>Let's put it to work. Our command line for "find three
  syllable word, rhyming with 'toad', and having a DUM-duh-DUM
  stress pattern" is:</p>
  <pre>
  mpron  ''  '^[12][02][12]$'  'ouD$'
</pre>

  <p>The ^ and $ in ^[12][02][12]$ is so that the stress pattern
  string consists <i>entirely</i> of that stress pattern, instead
  of merely having that stress pattern in the word somewhere. Here
  we go!</p>

  <h3>AcAccommodatingnother Notation</h3>

  <p>One minor quibble, though: it's a bit cumbersome converting
  our /_/ (DUM-duh-DUM) notation into the regex ^[12][02][12]$. We
  should have our program accept the slash and underscore notation.
  We can do that by just adding, very early in our program, some
  code to convert from that notation (if that's what it sees) into
  regex notation. Namely:</p>
  <pre>
 if ($meter_re =~ m&lt;^[/_]+$&gt;) {
    # If the string consists entirely of
    #  slashes and underscores...
    $meter_re =~ s&lt;/&gt;&lt;[12]&gt;g;
    $meter_re =~ s&lt;_&gt;&lt;[20]&gt;g;
    $meter_re = '^' . $meter_re . '$';
</pre>

  <p>This translates /_/ to ^[12][02][12]$ as the second
  argument:</p>
  <pre>
  
  % <b>mpron '' '/_/' 'oUd$' | less</b>
  # Word RE: &lt;&gt;  Meter RE: &lt;<b>^[12][20][12]$</b>&gt;  Pron RE: &lt;oUd$&gt;
  alamode         102     &amp;l@moUd
  ...and so on...

  
</pre>

  <p>By the way, if you want /_/ to mean "ends in DUM-duh-DUM"
  instead of specifically "consists entirely of DUM-duh-DUM", then
  you could change that last line to this instead:</p>
  <pre>
     $meter_re = $meter_re . '$';
                      # no '^' at the beginning

</pre>

  <p>The only question left to answer is: what exactly did our
  poetic toad gleam and dance like? No program can tell you which
  of the twenty-six matching words (three-syllable, /_/, rhyming
  with "toad") that we found is <i>le mot juste</i>, but given the
  circumstances, the choice is clear:</p>
  <pre>
 I chanced upon a lovely toad,
 It gleamed and danced like microcode!
