  <h4><i>John Orwant</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->

  <p>At O'Reilly's 1999 Open Source conference, I emceed and judged
  the Second Perl Quiz show, which pitted teams of Perl hackers
  against on another for enduring frame and a motley collection of
  prizes. Here are the questions, including a few that I didn't
  ask.</p>

  <p>Four teams played, with all participants winning one of the
  following:</p>

  <p>&bull; VA Linux: A cube fridge and $40 to fill it with junk
  food</p>

  <p>&bull; perltoys.com: Magnetic Perl Poetry Kits</p>

  <p>&bull; Geek Cruises: 50% off a state room for the Perl Whirl
  Alaska Tour</p>

  <p>&bull; O'Reilly &amp; Associates $50 and $25 gift
  certificates</p>

  <p>&bull; TPJ: Free two-year subscriptions</p>

  <p>The winning team was London.pm, consisting of Richard Clamp,
  Peter Haworth, Nick-Ing Simmons, and Andy Wardley.</p>

  <h3>Sample Questions</h3>

  <p>The Perl Quiz Show isn't like Jeopardy or Wind Ben Stein's
  Money. It's modeled after College Bowl, a family of collegiate
  tournaments that I participated in at MIT. I was never very good,
  so I was eventually promoted int management --I started judging
  the contests instead of playing in them.</p>

  <p>There are two types of questions in College Bowl and the Perl
  Quiz Show: toss-ups and bonuses. Individuals answer toss-ups; the
  whole team answers bonus questions. When a player buzzes in and
  correctly answers a toss-up, his team earns ten points. More
  importantly, his team earns the right to answer a bonus question
  worth 20,25, or 30 points. Here's the sample toss-up used to warm
  up the teams.</p>

  <p><b>TO.</b> This company started in a barn in Newton,
  Massachusetts,</p>

  <p><i>This question was read slowly to indicate how the best
  toss-up questions are written: with the most obscure information
  at the beginning</i></p>

  <p>and originally specialized in technical writing
  consulting.</p>

  <p><i>At this point, a few people in the crowd already knew the
  answer.</i></p>

  <p>Their consulting business slowed down in 1985, so they tried
  publishing some of their material as books, and thought they
  might give them away to promote their consulting business.</p>

  <p><i>Most people had a good guess in mind after this
  question</i></p>

  <p>In 1988, they were mobbed by participants at the MIT X
  Conference for their Xlib manuals, and soon after they focused on
  publishing computer books.</p>

  <p><i>Now just about everyone knew</i></p>

  <p>They now publish more than 120 books, many of which have
  pictures of animals on the cover.</p>

  <p><i>If you haven't buzzed in by now, you shouldn't be
  playing.</i></p>

  <p>They've recently branched out int the conference business.</p>

  <p><i>And the kilowatt spotlight over the head:</i></p>

  <p>For ten points, name this company that is hosting the
  conference YOU'RE AT RIGHT NOW.</p>

  <p><i>Because many toss-ups are designed so with a giveaway at
  the end, the questions aren't as challenging in print as they are
  when spoken. Remember that when you read these questions: the
  skill is no in answering the question correctly so much as
  answering it before the other team.</i></p>

  <p>Answer: O'REILLY &amp; Associates</p>

  <p><i>The capitalization indicates the essential part of the
  answer that players had to utter. Here, anyone who buzzed in only
  had to say "O'Reilly"; they didn't have to give the full name of
  the company.</i></p>

  <p>Now let's look at a bonus question.</p>

  <p><b>BO.</b> Twenty-point bonus. I'll give you four book titles;
  you tell me whether O'Reilly published the book or not.</p>

  <p><i>Occasionally, a bonus question is linked to the previous
  toss-up.</i></p>

  <p>a. Using Samba</p>

  <p>Answer: YES</p>

  <p><i>That's an easy one</i></p>

  <p>b. The Adventure of Food</p>

  <p>Answer: YES</p>

  <p><i>Surprisingly, the team got this one right. Too bad it was
  only a sample question</i></p>

  <p>c. Danger!</p>

  <p>Answer: YES</p>

  <p><i>Sounds like a dime-store detective novel</i></p>

  <p>d. Curious George Learns Assembler</p>

  <p>Answer: NO (Also accept UNFORTUNATELY NOT)</p>

  <p><b>TOSS-UPS</b></p>

  <p>The four teams each played a semifinal round: the two winners
  advanced to the final round. The questions in the final round
  were slightly harder.</p>

  <p><b>ROUND ONE (SEMIFINAL)</b></p>

  <p><b>T1.</b> Movies have their Oscars, music has Grammies, and
  TV has Emmys. This year, the Internet Movie Database(imdb.com)
  won this award, which is given to web sites.</p>

  <p><b>T2.</b> This hybrid data structure is available in Perl
  5.005, allowing you to refer to array elements with names instead
  of numbers.</p>

  <p><b>T3.</b> This newspaper has many more web visitors than
  actual paper subscribers, and has run stories entitled "Bill
  Gates Grants Self 18 Dexterity, 20 Charisma", "Chess
  Supercomputer Beaten Up By More Popular Computer", "Microsoft
  Patents Ones, Zeros", "Apple Employee Fired For Thinking
  Different" and "New Smokable Nicotine Sticks," For ten points,

  you undefine to make Perl read an entire file directly into a
  single string?</p>

  <p><b>T5.</b> The baud rate of regular fax machines is a common
  modem speed, but slow by today's standards. For ten points, name
  this speed.</p>

  <p><b>T6.</b> There are many sorting algorithms; Perl uses this
  variety. What is it?</p>

  <p><b>T7.</b> His relevance to Perl is somewhat obscure: the Perl
  source code is full of Tolkien quotes, and he's directing the
  Lord of the Rings trilogy, shot on location in New Zealand. Some
  of his other movies are Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, and Dead
  Alive.</p>

  <p><b>T8.</b> You can use it with Active Server Pages and the
  Windows Scripting Host. This package is an ActiveX scripting
  engine that lets you incorporate Perl into any ActiveX scripting
  host. For ten points, what is it?</p>

  <p><b>T9.</b> It had both modules and classes back in 1977. Every
  official module had an identifier: one or two letters followed by
  a single digit, and a name, such as White Plume Mountain, the
  Village of Hommlet, and Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl.
  Some of the classes were fighter, thief, cleric, and magic-user.
  For ten points, name this game.</p>

  <p><b>T9-Bonus.</b> Twenty point chaotic evil bonus. D&amp;D set
  came with five types of dice: 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided,
  12-sided, and 20-sided. I'll give you a situation, you tell me
  which type of die is used in it.</p>

  <p>a. Determining you character's strength, intelligence, wisdom,
  dexterity, constitution, and charisma.</p>

  <p>b. How many hit points a first-level magic user has.</p>

  <p>c. You're hit by lightning and need to make a saving
  throw.</p>

  <p>d. How many hit points a first-level cleric has.</p>

  <p><b>T10.</b> What does this print?</p>

print e ** pi;
</tt>
</pre>

  <p><b>T11.</b> If Larry Wall is the father of Perl, and Perl is
  the mother of the World Wide Web, and the Internet is the father
  of the World Wide Web, what relation is Larry to Al Gore?</p>

  <p><b>T12.</b> Perl doesn't have any Year 2000 bugs, but if you
  rely on storing the Unix time in a 32-bit integer, you'll get
  bugs in what year?</p>

  <p><b>T13.</b> What will this print? You can provide you answer
  in exponential notation if you wish.</p>
  <pre>
<tt>
print (1 &lt;&lt; (1 &lt;&lt; 5))
</tt>
</pre>

  <p><b>T14.</b> A computer utilizing this medium was used to solve
  the Traveling Salesman Problem in 1995 by executing 100 trillion
  operations per second, 100 times faster than the fastest
  supercomputer of the day. This medium let the computer perform 20
  quintillion operations for every joule of energy, and was able to
  store one bit per cubic nanometer, which is one trillion times
  the storage density of videotape. For ten points, what is this
  medium, best known for its double helix?</p>

  <p><b>T15.</b> Guess that scalar. This scalar holds the time at
  which your program began running.</p>

  <p><b>T16.</b> (Tiebreaker; not asked.) Guess that operator: if
  you stick this operator in between <tt>$x</tt> and <tt>$y</tt>,
  it will set <tt>$x</tt> to <tt>$y</tt> unless <tt>$x</tt> is
  already true.</p>

  <p><b>ROUND TWO (SEMIFINAL)</b></p>

  <p><b>T17.</b> This country has the highest number of Internet
  hosts per capita, and the master site of the CPAN is located
  there. On a clear day you can see Estonia from its tallest
  building, which is a mere twelve stories high. Linux started
  there.</p>

  <p><b>T18.</b> Guess that module. It has <tt>Purity, Terse,</tt>
  and <tt>Deepcopy</tt> methods. It's bundled with Perl, and
  written by Gurusamy Sarathy. It's most commonly used to pretty
  print complex data structures with its <tt>Dumper</tt>
  method.</p>

  <p><b>T19.</b> The last meeting of this group was in Oslo, and at
  some of their workshops, they us humming to vote on proposals.
  Their motto is "Rough consensus and running code", and they're
  charged with maintaining the RFC Internet standards.</p>

  <p><b>T20.</b> This character can be used as a shorter equivalent
  of the double colon. For ten points, what is this character,
  whose string quoting behavior is emulated by the <tt>q</tt>
  function?</p>

  <p><b>T21.</b> In 1995, Perl won the Nobel prize in this
  discipline, in part for discovering the tau lepton in the mid
  1970's. For ten points, name this discipline.</p>

  <p><b>T22.</b> What will this print?</p>
  <pre>
<tt>
my $i; if ($i = 6) { print "success"} else { print "failure" }
</tt>
</pre>

  <p><b>T23.</b> You're Gordon Freeman, a scientist in this popular
  computer game. After an explosion nearly destroys the underground
  plant you work in, you have to restart various machines and kill
  various aliens. Your fellow scientists are eager to be rescued by
  Marines until the Marines start massacring them in an attempt to
  cover up the aliens' existence. For ten points, what is this
  game, which has the same name as a term having to do with
  radioactive decay?</p>

  <p><b>T24.</b> You want Perl to make use of an already existing C
  library. What utility is commonly used to create a stub
  interface?</p>

  <p><b>T25.</b> The Netcraft web server survey has been compiled
  every August since 1995. In this year's survey, these two web
  servers place first and second in terms of popularity
  percentages. What are they, in order?</p>

  <p><b>T26.</b> In my opinion, the scariest addition to regular
  expressions in 5.005 is <tt>? {<i>something</i>}</tt>. For ten
  points, tell me what this does?</p>

  <p><b>T27.</b> For a quick ten points, hit your buzzer now.</p>

  <p><b>T28.</b> New in 5.004, this pragma accounts for the fact
  that not every language uses a period as a decimal point, and
  that not ever language has the same letters as English. Its name
  is related to L10N, which stands for "localization."</p>

  <p><b>T29.</b> "It is dark in here." "The door is closed." "The
  Diet Coke can is 41 degrees Fahrenheit." So reads the web page
  for this device hooked up to the Internet. The device itself is
  at 48 degrees, and its freezer compartment is 12 degrees.</p>

  <p><b>T30.</b> Where is the Internet top level domain
  <tt>.to</tt> located?</p>

  <p><b>T31.</b> <tt>travesty, server, client, who, findtar,
  rmfrom, wrapsuid, uudecode,rename.</tt> These are all programs in
  what directory of the Perl distribution?</p>

  <p><b>ROUND THREE (FINAL)</b></p>

  <p><b>T32.</b> Two words, pronounced the same. One word is a U.S.
  army rank, the other is the name for the core of an operation
  system, and is also what you find plenty of on corn on the
  cob.</p>

  <p><b>T32-Bonus.</b> Twenty point bonus. Microkernels verses
  monolithic kernels. (<i>Here, I spoke off the cuff about the
  difference between the two.</i>) I'll give you four operating
  systems, and you tell me whether it has a monolithic kernel or a
  microkernel.</p>

  <p>a.MS-DOS<br>
  b.GNU Hurd<br>
  c.Linux<br>
  d.NT<br></p>

  <p><b>T33.</b> Guess that scalar. By default, out-of-memory
  errors aren't trappable. But they can be if your Perl was
  compiled with <tt>PERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK</tt> and you create an
  emergency memory pool with this scalar, which has a caret
  followed by the thirteenth letter of the alphabet.</p>

  <p><b>T34.</b> According to searchwords.com, this is the most
  popular search term. Surprisingly, it's not pornographic, but is
  instead a popular audio format. For ten points, name this format,
  whose name is derived from MPEG3.</p>

  <p><b>T35.</b> If you turn on warnings with <tt>-w</tt>, what
  error do you get if your Perl statement is a plain string, and
  you don't do anything with it?</p>

  <p><b>T36.</b> Pencil and paper ready: According to Win Treese's
  Internet Index, there are 7.6 billion commercial email messages
  sent every day. If each message were a regular snail mail letter
  paying U.S. first class rates, tell me how much that would cost
  per year, within ten percent.</p>

  <p><b>T37.</b> Guess that scalar. You could use it to cope with
  division by zero errors, because this variable contains the error
  message from the last <tt>eval</tt> command. For ten points, name
  this variable.</p>

  <p><b>T38.</b> US Sen. Jon Kyl introduced a bill known as the
  Internet________Prohibition Act in 1997. The act makes it a crime
  to perform this activity online, even though you can do it on
  Indian reservations and in Nevada. For ten points, what is this
  activity?</p>

  <p><b>T39.</b> Perl almost always ignores your comments. Name
  something that you can put in your comments that Perl <i>will</i>
  pay attention to.</p>

  <p><b>T40.</b> According to the 9/12/97 issue of the Wall Street
  Journal, this is the number of miles of undersea cable. It's a
  funny number, because light could travel it in almost exactly on
  second.</p>

  <p><b>T41.</b> In Unix, Ctrl-Z suspends a process; Ctrl-C
  interrupts a process. You can keep these from happening in your
  Perl program with signal handlers. For ten points, give me the
  signal handler that lets you trap either Ctrl-Z or Ctrl-C.</p>

  <p><b>T42.</b> Pick the most appropriate unit: days, weeks,
  months, or years: If you have a cable modem that gives you a
  constant 1.5 megabit downstream rate, how long would it take you
  to download the Library of Congress, compressed?</p>

  <p><b>T43.</b> Guess that scalar. This scalar is true if you're
  inside an <tt>eval</tt> and false otherwise. For ten points, name
  this serpentine scalar.</p>

  <p><b>T44.</b> Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert wrote disparaging
  book about these computational entities and single-handedly
  quashed neural net research for almost two decades. For ten
  points, what is the name of this single-layer neural network?</p>

  <p><b>T45.</b> On August 16 they announced plans to provide
  Virtual Private Network (or VPN) support for their 594 series of
  network controllers. They specialize in IP connectivity with
  product lines that include Remote Access Servers and Switches for
  Ethernet and token ring LAN's, terminal servers and serial
  connectivity products for UNIX and NT platforms and Network
  Controllers for IBM AS/400s. They trade on the Toronto Stock
  Exchange under the symbol PL, and trade on the NASDAQ under the
  symbol PERL.</p>

  <p><b>T46.</b> What does <tt>close</tt> do if you don't provide a
  filehandle to close?</p>

  <p><b>BONUSES</b></p>

  <p>Bonus questions are typically more in-depth, because the
  entire team gets to confer before giving an answer.</p>

  <p><b>ROUND ONE (SEMIFINAL)</b></p>

  <p><b>B1.</b> Twenty point bonus. This is the first bonus of the
  game, so let's have a question about beginnings. What regular
  expression metacharacter matches the actual beginning of the
  string? It's not the caret, since that matches the beginning of
  each line, and in a multiline string it'll match multiple times.
  The metacharacter I'm looking for matches only the very
  beginning.</p>

  <p><b>B2.</b> Twenty point bonus. You can specify the background
  color of a web page with the BGCOLOR attribute of the BODY tag.
  If you set BGCOLOR to a pound sign followed by six hex digits,
  the first two indicate the amount of red, the second two indicate
  the amount of green, and the third two indicate the the amount of
  blue. For instance, 00FF0 is a saturated green, and FFFFFF is
  white. For all twenty points, give me a good yellow.</p>

  <p><b>B3.</b> Twenty point bonus. This special variable holds the
  name of your Perl program. On some operating systems, you can set
  it, and make your program seem like it's named something else.
  Give me the short name of the variable, and the long name
  provided by the English module, for ten points each.</p>

  <p><b>B4.</b> Thirty point bonus. A correctly functioning Perl
  program ends with the following two lines.</p>
  <pre>
}BEGIN{
        @ARGV = &lt;*M*&gt;
</pre>

  <p>These lines are not part of a string. "Here" documents don't
  come into play, and there are no sneaky eval tricks. There are no
  funky characters after these two lines, nor is there a
  <tt>__DATA__</tt> or <tt>__END__</tt> previously. The program has
  no signal handlers, it does not launch another process, and it
  doesn't make strange us of symbol tables or otherwise play with
  itself. The program does not use any module of pragma.</p>

  <p>These two lines are executed just fine. If you put a print
  before or after the <tt>@ARGV</tt> line, it's executed too.</p>

  <p>What's the (simple!) explanation?</p>

  <p><b>B5.</b> There's a freeware porn detector that spiders
  through the web and saves images if the amount of continuous skin
  tone over image exceeds this threshold, expressed as a percent.
  As it turns out, this is the exact same threshold that Perl uses
  to determine whether a file is binary or text for the <tt>-B</tt>
  and <tt>_-T</tt> flags. If more than this percentage of the
  characters are "odd characters" (like control characters or
  characters with the eighth bit set), it's deemed a binary file.
  For twenty points, name this amount, within ten percentage
  points.</p>

  <p><b>B6.</b> For ten points each, give me the two reasons why
  laptop CPU speeds are typically slower than desktop CPU
  speeds.</p>

  <p><b>B7.</b> Twenty point bonus. Describe what this
  displays:</p>
  <pre>
<tt>print scalar(localtime);</tt>
</pre>

  <p><b>B8.</b> Thirty point bonus. According to the St. Petersburg
  Times, in what year is the U.S. expected to use the Internet to
  collect Census data?</p>

  <p><b>B9.</b> Twenty point bonus. Name that command-line switch,
  for five points each.</p>

  <p>a. You'd use this switch to execute a Perl program in a larger
  message, because it tells the interpreter to skip down until it
  finds the first list beginning with <tt>#!</tt> and containing
  the word <tt>perl</tt><br>
  b. You'd use this to append a newline automatically to every
  <tt>print</tt> statement.<br>
  c. You'd use this switch to verify that your Perl program is
  syntactically correct.<br>
  d. You'd use this switch to specify a directory where modules are
  located.</p>

  <p><b>B10.</b> Twenty point bonus. Netcraft compiles an annual
  web server survey, and compiles its results by polling every
  server it can find, worldwide. Within a factor of the two, how
  many sites was that, for the 1999 survey?</p>

  <p><b>B11.</b> This is a twenty-five point bonus in five parts;
  as soon as you get one wrong, the question is over. If the
  derived class Rabbit inherits form the base class Rodent and you
  invoke Rabbit::Forage, what does Perl do..(<i>this question
  doesn't work so well in print, since each subquestion gives away
  the answer to the previous subquestion.</i>)</p>

  <p>a. After failing to find it in the Rabbit class?<br>
  b. After failing to find it in the Rodent class?<br>
  c. After failing to find it in UNIVERSAL?<br>
  d. After failing to find a Rabbit::AUTOLOAD?<br>
  e. After failing to find a Rodent::AUTOLOAD?</p>

  <p><b>ROUND TWO (SEMIFINAL)</b></p>

  <p><b>B12.</b> Twenty-five point bonus. I'm going to describe
  five pairs of built-in Perl functions. The last letters of the
  first function are the first letters of the second function: you
  mash them together and give me the combined name. For instance,
  if I say "the function that adds something to the end of an
  array" and "the function that adds something to the beginning of
  an array", you'd say "pushift". The "sh" is shared.</p>

  <p>a. The function that removes something form the end of an
  array, and the function that readies a directory for reading.<br>
  b. The function that converts a binary structure into regular
  Perl variables, and the function that declares a global
  namespace.<br>
  c. The function that displays a formatted record, and the
  function that reports where a file pointer is.<br>
  d. The function that clears all variables beginning with a
  specified letter, and the function that you'd use to keep your
  server from hanging onto a port after it's no longer used.<br>
  e. Finally, what two single letter built-in functions combine to
  make a third built-in function.</p>

  <p><b>B13.</b> Twenty-point bonus. Tell me whether these
  statements about DBI, the Database Interface, are true or
  false.</p>

  <p>a. Both ODBC and DBI provide a generic interface to multiple
  database engines.<br>
  b. DBI supports multi-threading<br>
  c. DBI runs on Windows 95<br>
  d. You can manipulate Microsoft Access database from DBI.</p>

  <p><b>B14.</b> Twenty-five point bonus. Guess that module. I'll
  name five modules that might or might not exist on the CPAN; you
  tell me if they do.</p>

  <p>a. Net::Video<br>
  b. WWW::Robot<br>
  c. Games::WordFind<br>
  d. Modem::Dial<br>
  e. Tie::BikePower</p>

  <p><b>B15.</b> Thirty point bonus. For ten points, what does this
  do?</p>
  <pre>
<tt>goto (qw(alpha beta gamma))[rand 3];</tt>
</pre>

  <p>For the remaining twenty points, we'll use some audience
  participation. I contend that <tt>goto</tt> is used far more
  often than people admit. I'll ask the crowd to applaud if they've
  used <tt>goto</tt> in the last month, and then if they've used
  <tt>redo</tt> in the last month. For all twenty points, tell me
  whether the amount of applause will be significantly higher for
  <tt>goto</tt>, significantly higher for <tt>redo</tt>, or about
  the same.</p>

  <p><b>B16.</b> Thirty points if you get it on the first try, 20
  on the second, 10 on the third, and 5 points if you get it on the
  fourth try. What country has the largest number of top-level
  domains ending its two-letter country code? Hint: it's not the
  U.S., since there aren't that many <tt>.us</tt> domains.</p>

  <p><b>B17.</b> Twenty point bonus. There are four steps to
  building and installing a CPAN module on a Unix system once
  you've downloaded and unpacked it. For five points each, what are
  the four steps? Each step is something you type at the command
  line.</p>

  <p><b>B18.</b> Twenty point bonus. What CGI environment variable
  can you use to determine which browser is visiting your
  pages?</p>

  <p><b>B19.</b> Twenty point bonus. To the nearest ten percent,
  what proportion of Internet users have English as their primary
  language, according to a survey by Global Reach?</p>

  <p><b>B20.</b> Twenty point bonus. I'll give you four Perl
  constructs; you tell me whether they're executed at run-time or
  compile-time when they appear by themselves in Perl programs.</p>

  <p>a. <tt>require</tt> statements<br>
  b. <tt>BEGIN</tt> blocks<br>
  c. <tt>use</tt> statements<br>
  d. <tt>srand()</tt></p>

  <p><b>B21.</b> Thirty point bonus. Here's a palindromic program;
  it reads the same backwards as forwards. What will it
  display?</p>
  <pre>
<tt>print $;,(1 =&gt; "able was i ere i saw elba" &lt;= 1),;$ tnirp</tt>
</pre>

  <p><b>B22.</b> Thirty point bonus. Which of these HTTP status
  constants exist? Tell me yes or no for each.</p>

  <p>a. HTTP_NOT_FOUND<br>
  b. HTTP_GONE<br>
  c. HTTP_PAYMENT_REQUIRED<br>
  d. HTTP_TOO_MANY_USERS<br>
  e. HTTP_LANGUAGE</p>

  <p>Finally for five points, what is the numeric HTTP status code
  for HTTP_NOT_FOUND?</p>

  <p><b>B23.</b> Twenty point bonus. Name two ways to embed

  <p><b>B25.</b> Twenty point bonus. You have a function that
  accepts either one or two arrays, and you want those arrays to be
  implicitly passed by reference. That is, if you're passing in
  <tt>@red</tt> and <tt>@blue</tt>, you want the advantages of by
  reference but you don't want to have to include the backslashes.
  What prototype should you use?</p>

  <p><b>ROUND THREE (FINAL)</b></p>

  <p><b>B29.</b> Twenty-five point bonus. I'll give you five
  built-in Perl functions; you tell me the maximum number of
  arguments it accepts, for five points each. I'm counting lists
  and expressions as single arguments, so for instance "push" takes
  two arguments: an array and a list;</p>

  <p><b>B30.</b> Twenty-five point bonus. Perl programmers love
  their weird symbols. I'll give you four esoteric symbol names;
  you tell me a more common name for that character. For instance,
  if I say "ampersand", you'd say "and".</p>

  <p>a. Octothorpe<br>
  b. Solidus<br>
  c. Quadrathorpe<br>
  d. Pilcrow<br>
  e. Lemniscate</p>

  <p><b>B31.</b> Thirty point bonus. Perl has a somewhat unearned
  reputation for being hard to read. We all show how clear it can
  be by writing lucid programs. But we could also show how murky it
  isn't by comparing it to something worse. There's a language
  called Befunge that is two-dimensional, with a stack and an
  instruction pointer that moves character by character through the
  program. Here's a program that prints "Hello, world."</p>
  <pre>
<tt>
0".dlrow , olleH"&gt;v
                 ,:
                 ^_@
</tt>
</pre>

  <p><i>At this point, I explained how Befunge worked. Full details
  are at http://www.loungelizard.com/pascal/befunge/beffaq/html,
  but you can get the gist of it from <tt>v</tt>. In the program
  above, the characters are processed from left to right until that
  <tt>v</tt> is encountered. Then the characters are processed from
  top to bottom, until _ is encountered. _ is a "horizontal if",
  which sends control to the right or the left depending on the
  contents of the stack.</i></p>

  <p>What will this print?</p>
  <pre>
<tt>
                v,&lt;
          0"lreP" &gt;^
                +
                +
              &gt;v"

  <p><b>B32.</b> Thirty-point bonus. This HTTP header field is used
  by a browser to avoid downloading a web page that is already in

  give you some extra time.</p>

  <p><tt>perl -e "print substr(**.**, 7, 2)"</tt></p>

  <p><b>B35.</b> Twenty-point bonus. XML documents often have
  associated DTDs, or document type definitions. I'll give you four

  b. HTML<br>
  c. News stories<br>
