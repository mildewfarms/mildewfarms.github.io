  <p>This is an article about making easy jobs easy. It is also
  about MakeMaker, cross-platform installation issues, and a few
  other details that are not so easy.</p>

  <p>Microsoft Windows does not, by default, install a make utility
  -- something that can figure out how (and in what order) to
  compile files into working programs. While several Win32 versions
  of <tt>make</tt> are freely available, they are incompatible with
  each other. Most Win32 Perl users aren't able to compile or build
  programs at all -- they installed the binary version of Perl, and
  lack a compiler or make equivalent. But as I'll show in this
  article, Perl is all you need to build many modules on Win32 --
  providing they've been prepared as I describe below.</p>

  <p>The primary ingredient is MakeMaker, bundled with Perl and
  available as ExtUtils::MakeMaker. Normally, MakeMaker expects
  that the tools used to build Perl will still be around -- a bad
  assumption for end users who installed Perl in binary form.
  MakeMaker also expects to find information about the build
  environment in Config.pm; again, a bad assumption for users who
  didn't build their own Perl.</p>

  <p>For our purposes, we're going to consider modules with the
  following characteristics:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>It's written entirely in Perl with no binary
    components.</li>

    <li>It works without any modification on a wide variety of
    operating systems, including Windows.</li>

    <li>It includes test programs and test data files in a t
    subdirectory. The tests might create additional files.</li>

    <li>It might include example programs in an eg
    subdirectory.</li>

    <li>Most of the target users don't consider themselves
    programmers, and don't frequently use software development
    tools. They would never entertain the idea of building Perl
    from source.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The module we will use as an example, MARC.pm, fits all of
  these criteria. MARC (MAchine Readable Catalog) is available on
  the CPAN, and its primary use is converting between the
  electronic interchange formats used by library catalogs and book
  distributors, and other useful formats such as HTML, XML, and
  plain text. There are many useful applications for this module,
  and the internal structure is interesting as well, but all that
  is beyond the scope of this article. We are concerned with how to
  distribute and install it.</p>

  <p>MakeMaker was designed to make this easy on systems with
  complete sets of development tools. The installation instructions
  for nearly every Perl module looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
  perl Makefile.PL # Create the Makefile
  make             # Create temporary directories and copy files
  make test        # Confirm it works as expected
  make install     # Put files where they belong
 
</pre>

  <p>For a Perl-only module, the command h2xs -A -X -n MARC will
  even create a usable <tt>Makefile</tt>.PL for us:</p>
  <pre>
  use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
  # See lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm for details of how to influence
  # the contents of the Makefile that is written.
  WriteMakefile(
      'NAME'    =&gt; 'MARC',
      'VERSION_FROM' =&gt; 'MARC.pm', # finds $VERSION
  );
</pre>

  <p>That certainly qualifies as easy -- unless, like many Windows
  users, you don't have a copy of <tt>make</tt>. You could grab one
  off the net, but not just any <tt>make</tt> will do -- you have
  to match whichever one is named in Config.pm. Or maybe you have
  the right make, but some other essential parameter differs
  between your configuration and the configuration of the person
  who created the module. Librarians may be good at managing
  structured data -- but if MARC had to provide instructions for
  hand-tweaking Config.pm, it wouldn't qualify as easy.</p>

  <p>Let's take a step back. Our module is 100% pure Perl, yet
  we're required to use a utility traditionally used to compile
  programs. We're not even analyzing any dependencies -- it's just
  a single module that we want to test and install. So what
  function is make providing for us? If we look under the hood,
  make test does essentially this:</p>
  <pre>
  PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 $(FULLPERL) -I$(INST_LIB) -I$(PERL_LIB)
      -e 'use Test::Harness qw(&amp;runtests); runtests @ARGV;' t/*.t
 
</pre>

  <p>In other words, make test sets up an environment and runs a
  Perl script. The equivalent section in the Makefile adds a couple
  directories to @INC as well as support for
  <tt>$Test::Harness::verbose</tt>. The environment variable
  PERL_DL_NONLAZY isn't even used on Win32.</p>

  <p>For <tt>make install</tt>, the script resolves to a call to
  the <tt>install()</tt> method in ExtUtils::Install. This suggests
  that we can do everything we need with a sequence of all-Perl
  commands:</p>
  <pre>
  perl Makefile.PL    # Create temporary directories, copy files
                      # and PLUS generate test.pl and install.pl    
  perl test.pl        # Confirm it works as expected
  perl install.pl     # Put files where they belong
 
</pre>

  <p>Now that's EASY. And it resembles the traditional sequence,
  too. While there is no support for developer options like
  <tt>make clean</tt> and <tt>make dist</tt>, end users won't miss
  them. This method also won't scale to cover the general cases and
  arbitrary degrees of complexity like <tt>make</tt> and MakeMaker,
  and sometimes those are the best tools. However, for our example
  module, we can get away with this simple installation
  process.</p>

  <p>Let's look at a <tt>Makefile</tt>.PL that provides this
  install sequence. The first few lines will be familiar:</p>
  <pre>

  # Makefile.PL
  #
  use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
  # See lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm for details of how to influence
  # the contents of the Makefile that is written.
  
  require 5.004;
  
  unless ($^O eq "MSWin32") {
      WriteMakefile(
          'NAME'         =&gt; 'MARC',
          'VERSION_FROM' =&gt; 'MARC.pm', # finds $VERSION
          'SKIP'         =&gt; [qw(tool_autosplit)],
          'clean'        =&gt; {FILES =&gt; "t/output*.* output*.*"},
      );
      exit;
  }
  
</pre>

  <p>Perl 5.004 is a prerequisite for various methods in MARC.pm.
  It is also the earliest Windows port with MakeMaker support --
  and we still use MakeMaker tools, just not called via
  <tt>make</tt>. The exit makes things act the traditional way on
  systems other than Win32. SKIP and clean are explained in the
  MakeMaker documentation.</p>
  <pre>
  
  use File::Copy;
  use File::Path;
  use Pod::Html;
  
  # a low-fat version of parse_version from ExtUtils::MM_Unix.
  my $version = simple_version("MARC.pm");
  my $INST_LIBDIR  = "./lib";
  my $INST_HTMLDIR = "./html";
  my $INST_FILES  = "MARC.pm";
  my $INST_NAME  = "MARC";
  my @HTML_FILES  = "MARC";
  
  # probably should auto-generate @cleanfiles
  my @cleanfiles = qw( output.txt output.html output.xml output.urls
           output2.html t/output.txt t/output.html
           t/output.xml t/output.urls t/output2.html
           output.isbd t/output.isbd );
 
</pre>

  <p>On Win32, you want to avoid depending on the shell for
  anything; for instance, MakeMaker's make clean translates into
  <tt>rm -rf</tt> <i>list_with_wildcards</i>, which the Win32 shell
  will reject. Consequently, it's best to maintain an explicit list
  of the files to be cleaned, which we do above with the
  <tt>@cleanfiles array</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
  print &lt;&lt;INTRO3;
                                        MARC version $version
  
                                No 'Makefile' will be created
                                Test with:    perl test.pl
                                Install with: perl install.pl

    
  INTRO3
 
</pre>

  <p>This displays a little reminder of the installation sequence
  for those who didn't read the README. The distribution includes
  two README files -- a README with linefeeds for CPAN, and a
  README.txt with both carriage returns and linefeeds for Win32
  editors. Since Win32 Perl ports work fine with linefeed-only
  termination, and some other operating systems dislike the
  carriage returns, the rest of the files we use are
  linefeed-only.</p>

  <p>Next, we create the make-target-replacement scripts:</p>
  <pre>

  my $dfile = "test.pl";
  unlink $dfile, @cleanfiles;        # a bit like "make clean"
  print "Creating new $dfile\n";
  open (DEFAULT, "&gt; $dfile") or die "Can't create $dfile: $!\n";
  
  print DEFAULT &lt;&lt;"TEST4";    # double quotes -- need interpolation
  # Created by Makefile.PL
  # $INST_NAME Version $version


  TEST4
</pre>

  <p>"Here" documents (in the snippet above, everything between the
  two TEST4 tokens constitutes a here document) are quoted in the
  same way as the initial token. The first TEST4 is double quoted,
  so the entire here document is double quoted, which means that
  $INST_NAME and <tt>$version</tt> are replaced by their values.
  Since the rest of test.pl does not interpolate variables, single
  quoting is used.</p>
  <pre>

print DEFAULT &lt;&lt;'TEST4';    # single quotes -- minimize character quoting
use Test::Harness;
runtests ("t/test1.t");

print "\nTo run individual tests, type:\n";
print "    C:\\&gt; perl t/test1.t Page_Pause_Time (0..5)\n";
print "See README and other documentation for additional information.\n\n";

TEST4

close DEFAULT;
</pre>

  <p>The optional Page_Pause_Time just adds a delay after each page
  of output, since some Win32 shells don't redirect STDERR
  properly.</p>
  <pre>
  
  unless (-d $INST_LIBDIR) {
      File::Path::mkpath([ "$INST_LIBDIR" ],1,0777) or
          die "ERROR creating directories: ($!)\n";
  }
  unless (-d $INST_HTMLDIR) {
      File::Path::mkpath([ "$INST_HTMLDIR" ],1,0777) or
          die "ERROR creating directories: ($!)\n";
  }
  File::Copy::copy($INST_FILES,$INST_LIBDIR) or
      die "ERROR copying files: ($!)\n";
          
</pre>

  <p>This is most of what a plain make actually does on simple
  modules like ours.</p>
  <pre>
  foreach $source (@HTML_FILES) {
      pod2html(
           "--norecurse",
           "--infile=$source.pm",
           "--outfile=$INST_HTMLDIR/$source.html"
          );
  }
</pre>

  <p>On systems with standard support for online manual pages, the
  make builds new manual pages from pod embedded in the module. On
  Win32, HTML versions are created by the pod2html invocation
  above.</p>
  <pre>
  $dfile = "install.pl";
  unlink $dfile, "pod2html-itemcache","pod2html-dircache";
  print "Creating new $dfile\n";
  open (DEFAULT, "&gt; $dfile") or die "Can't create $dfile: $!\n";
  
  print DEFAULT &lt;&lt;"INST5";
  # Created by Makefile.PL
  # $INST_NAME Version $version
  
  
  INST5
  
</pre>

  <p>Now we create a single-quoted string containing the program
  code we are writing. This means we don't have to escape every $,
  making it easier to read and debug. We can use printf to
  interpolate a variable into this string.</p>
  <pre>
  my $template = &lt;&lt;'INST5';        # a single-quoted string
  use Config qw(%Config);
  use strict;
  use ExtUtils::Install qw( install );
  
  my $FULLEXT = "%s";        #### &lt;&lt; printf puts $INST_NAME here
  my $INST_LIB = "./lib";
  my $HTML_LIB = "./html";
  
</pre>

  <p>This next section unveils a nasty little secret. The key in
  %Config used to determine where to install the HTML changed from
  5.004 to 5.005. No users have reported hitting the die below, so
  the autodetection seems adequate for all the releases I've made
  to date.</p>
  <pre>
  my $html_dest = "";    # edit real html base here if autodetect fails
  
  if (exists $Config{installhtmldir} ) {
      $html_dest = "$Config{installhtmldir}";
  } elsif (exists $Config{installprivlib} ) {
      $html_dest = "$Config{installprivlib}";
      $html_dest =~ s%\\lib%\\html%;
  }
  
  if ( length ($html_dest) ) {
      $html_dest .= '\lib\site';
  } else {
      die "Can't find html base directory. Edit install.pl manually.\n";
  }
  
</pre>

  <p>After all the smoke and mirrors (and <tt>make</tt> and
  <tt>blib</tt> and <tt>install_default</tt>), the final
  destination is the same for us as for MakeMaker. Both sequences
  copy files to the Promised Land and update the Holy Books with
  essentially identical install commands.</p>
  <pre>

  install({
         read =&gt; "$Config{sitearchexp}/auto/$FULLEXT/.packlist",
           write =&gt; "$Config{installsitearch}/auto/$FULLEXT/.packlist",
         $INST_LIB =&gt; "$Config{installsitelib}",
         $HTML_LIB =&gt; "$html_dest"
        },1,0);


 __END__
  INST5
  
  printf DEFAULT $template, $INST_NAME;
  close DEFAULT;
</pre>

  <p>By using printf with our single-quoted string as a template,
  we limit interpolation to the specific location intended. The
  actual <tt>Makefile</tt>.PL adds the <tt>simple_version()</tt>
  subroutine at the end. But its internals are not relevant to this
  article. Did we make an easy job easy? Let's review what the user
  sees and does.</p>
  <pre>
    <u>traditional MakeMaker</u>         <u>Win32 sequence</u>

    perl Makefile.PL              perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test                     perl test.pl
    make install                  perl install.pl
</pre>

  <p>Looks easy to me. Many Perl Win32 users want to become more
  adept at managing their Perl installation, but are daunted by the
  initial learning curve. When we can succeed at making easy jobs
  easy, we help open Perl to a whole new group of users.</p>
