  <p>Since the release of JPL (a collection of libraries and
  modules for linking Perl and Java), there has been a great deal
  of interest in finding some method of converting Perl source code
  into Java class files. And why not? At least in theory, it should
  be possible to take advantage of all the work that's gone into
  Malcolm Beattie's Perl compiler to write a back end that emits a
  Java class file.</p>

  <p>Because I've done a little bit of hacking on JPL, I've been
  interested in this myself. So, about a year ago, I set out to
  learn something about compilers. In a move that met this goal
  (and had the added side effect of increasing the average student
  age), I enrolled in a compiler design class at the University of
  Rhode Island. The decision to take the class was made easier by
  the fact that the class project involved writing a compiler for
  the Java virtual machine.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1999, I decided to apply what was left of my
  knowledge from that class. Determined to write something
  (anything!) that could take Perl source in one end and spit out a
  Java class file on the other end, I wrote a simple module that
  handles a subset of Perl. It's not something you could get a lot
  of use out of yet, but it is a start.</p>

  <p>Let's take a look at some of the things I learned in class and
  while writing B::JVM::Jasmin. As we do this, we'll learn a few
  things about the mysterious Perl Compiler as well.</p>

  <h3>The Basics</h3>

  <p>Anyone who wants to write a program that generates a Java
  class file is going to encounter the same problems. The freely
  available Jasmin assembler makes one of these problems go away,
  and the fact that we are working with the Perl Compiler makes
  another go away.</p>

  <h3>What's a Virtual Machine?</h3>

  <p>A virtual machine is a computer that you can't break by
  sticking a screwdriver between the motherboard and CPU. That's
  because a virtual machine is a conceptual entity. Like a
  computer's CPU, a virtual machine can take a list of instructions
  and execute them in sequence. Virtual machines generally exist
  first as a specification, and then as implementations.</p>

  <p>The Java virtual machine uses a stack for many elementary
  operations. For example, if you want to multiply two numbers, you
  push those two numbers on the stack, and then execute a
  multiplication instruction, such as imul. This multiplication
  instruction removes the top two numbers from the stack,
  multiplies them together, and puts the result back on the
  stack.</p>

  <p>Let's consider a simple virtual machine that has a stack and
  understands six instructions:</p>

  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
    <tr>
      <td><b>Instruction</b></td>

      <td align="center"><b>Action</b></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left"><tt>push
      NUMBER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt></td>

      <td align="right">Push the number on the stack.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><tt>add</tt></td>

      <td>Remove and add the top two<br>
      numbers on the stack, leaving<br>
      the result on the stack.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><tt>mul</tt></td>

      <td>Remove and multiply the topz<br>
      two numbers on the stack,<br>
      leaving the result on the stack.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>print</td>

      <td>Remove and print the number<br>
      on the top of the stack.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>How would this virtual machine handle a simple task, such as
  printing out the result of 2 * 3? The task would be broken down
  into a series of machine instructions:</p>

  <p><tt>push 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; push 2 onto the stack<br>
  push 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; push 3 onto the stack<br>
  mul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; multiply the top
  two stack items<br>
  print&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; display the
  result<br></tt></p>

  <p><a href="images/fig-one.gif"><b>Figure 1</b></a> shows how the
  stack responds to the first three instructions.</p>

  <p>Now that we've seen how this virtual machine <i>should</i>
  work, let's look at a simple implementation in Perl:</p>
  <pre>
 my @stack = ();
   
   # Read all the lines that follow __ DATA __ in this file.
   #
   while (&lt;DATA&gt;) {
   
       # Read the instruction and argument (if any).
       #
       ($instruction, $arg) = split(/\s+/, $_);
   
       # Process one of the four instructions:
   
       if ($instruction eq 'push') {
   
           push @stack, $arg;
   
       } elsif ($instruction eq 'mul') {
   
               my $a = pop @stack;
               my $b = pop @stack;
               push @stack, $a * $b;
   
       } elsif ($instruction eq 'add') {
   
               my $a = pop @stack;
               my $b = pop @stack;
               push @stack, $a + $b;
   
       } elsif ($instruction eq 'print') {
   
               my $a = pop @stack;
               print "$a\n";
   
       }
   
   }
   
   __DATA__
   push 2
   push 3
   mul
   print
</pre>

  <p>This may look simple now, but things can get a little tricky.
  Think about how you might evaluate print <tt>2 + 3 * 4</tt>;. Why
  does the following code produce the incorrect answer?</p>
  <pre>
 <tt>
 push2 
 push 3
 add
 push 4
 mul
 print
 </tt>
 
</pre>

  <p>How would you correct it in a systematic fashion that could be
  applied to other expressions? We'll see the answer shortly, when
  we consider how a parse tree works.</p>

  <h3>What's In a Class File?</h3>

  <p>A class file is a little more complicated than you might
  expect. <b><a href="images/fig-two.gif">Figure 2</a></b> shows a
  summary of all the different parts of a class file. There is
  quite a bit of stuff to keep track of, such as:</p>

  <p><b>Magic Number</b></p>

  <blockquote>
    The first four bytes of the file spell out the hexadecimal
    number 0xCAFEBABE. This lets programs such as /usr/bin/file
    figure out what type of file it's dealing with.
  </blockquote>

  <p><b>Major and Minor Version</b></p>

  <blockquote>
    These identify the version of virtual machine the classfile was
    compiled for. This works out to the number 45.3, and probably
    hasn't changed since the first release of the JDK. While the
    Java language and supporting class libraries have evolved quite
    a bit, the Java Virtual Machine itself has been relatively
    stable.
  </blockquote>

  <p><b>Constant Pool Count</b>- The size of the constant pool.</p>

  <p><b>Constant Pool</b> - All of the constants belonging to the
  class.</p>

  <p><b>Access Flags</b> - A flag that specifies whether the class
  is publicly visible, an abstract class, and other class
  attributes.</p>

  <p><b>This class</b> - This is an index to the location of the
  class name in the constant pool.</p>

  <p><b>Superclass</b> - This is an index to the location of the
  superclass name in the constant pool.</p>

  <p><b>Interface count</b> - The number of interfaces implemented
  by this class.</p>

  <p><b>Interfaces</b> - All of the interfaces this class
  implements.</p>

  <p><b>Field count</b> - The number of fields this class has.
  Fields are also known as <i>properties</i> or <i>data
  members</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fields</b> - All the fields of this class.</p>

  <p><b>Methods count</b> - The number of methods of this
  class.</p>

  <p><b>Methods count</b> - All the methods of this class.</p>

  <p><b>Attributes count</b> - The number of attributes this class
  has. The should not be confused with fields. Attributes store
  extended class information, such as the location of the original
  source file.</p>

  <p><b>Attributes</b> - All the attributes of this class.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, you don't need to worry about the structure of a
  class file if you want to generate your own class files. Jasmin
  is capable of reading assembler, and generates a class file for
  you.</p>

  <h3>Bytecode as Machine Language</h3>

  <p>The parts of the class file that are most important to us are
  the machine instructions that make your programs go. In the
  example we saw earlier, these machine instructions took the form
  of names (<tt>push, add, mul, print</tt>) that are used the same
  way assembler code is used. Assembler code is made up of
  human-readable mnemonics;the idea here is that it's easier to
  remember that imul multiplies numbers than to remember that 0x68
  does the same thing.</p>

  <p>An assembler is a tool that converts these mnemonics into
  machine instructions, or <tt>opcodes</tt>. For example, the JVM's
  imul (integer multiply) instruction is 0x68 in hexadecimal, but
  0x68 isn't the hexadecimal value of the text string
  "<tt>imul</tt>". The only relationship between "<tt>imul</tt>"
  and 0x68 is that by convention, you and the assembler have agreed
  that you'll represent 0x68 as "<tt>imul</tt>". In fact, because
  there is no standard Java assembler code; another assembler might
  choose to implement 0x68 as <tt>INT_MULT</tt> or some such
  thing.</p>

  <p>How is an assembler different than a compiler? The main
  difference between an assembler and a compiler is that a compiler
  interprets the meaning of some source code, and an assembler
  makes a direct translation from mnemonic assembler code to
  machine code.</p>

  <p>For example, a compiler knows that 2 + 3 * 4 means that the 3
  and the 4 should be multiplied before the 2 is added. An
  assembler knows no such thing about the code. It assumes that
  statements will be executed in sequence. We'll look at some of
  the things that a compiler does shortly.</p>

  <h3>Jasmin: an Assembler for Java</h3>

  <p>Jasmin is an assembler for Java that takes a lot of the hassle
  out of developing classes in Java machine code. For the most
  part, all you have to worry about is writing the assembler code.
  To generate a class, feed the assembler into Jasmin, and then run
  java on the resulting class.</p>

  <p>Here's a short listing of Jasmin assembler for the first
  assembler program we looked at earlier:</p>
  <pre>
   1  .class public sample
   2  .super java/lang/Object
&#13;   3  .method public static main([Ljava/lang/String;)V
   4      .limit stack 3
   5      .limit locals 0
&#13;   6      getstatic java/lang/System/out Ljava/io/PrintStream;
  
   7      sipush 2
   8      sipush 3
   9      imul
   
  10      invokestatic
          java/lang/String/valueOf(I)Ljava/lang/String;
  11      invokevirtual 
          java/io/PrintStream/println(Ljava/lang/String;)V
&#13;  12      return
  13  .end method
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>Lines 1-2 define the name of the class and its immediate
  superclass.</p>

  <p>Lines 3-6 define the public static void <tt>main()</tt>
  method, setting up the size of its stack (3) and the number of
  local variables (0). From here to line 13, all the code is
  contained within this method, which is automatically called if
  you load the class with the Java interpreter.</p>

  <p>Line 6 pushes the object <tt>java.lang.System.out</tt> on the
  stack. This is Java's equivalent of STDOUT.</p>

  <p>Lines 7-9 is the Java equivalent of:</p>

  <p><tt>push 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; push 2 onto the stack<br>
  push 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; push 3 onto the stack<br>
  mul &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; multiply the top two
  stack items<br></tt></p>

  <p>which we saw earlier as our sample input to a mythical virtual
  machine.</p>

  <p>Lines 10-11 convert the integer on the stack to a string, and
  invoke the <tt>println()</tt> method of the object we pushed in
  line 6.</p>

  <p>Lines 12-13 return from the method and end it.</p>

  <h3>Using Jasmin</h3>

  <p>To assemble this program, simply run the command:</p>

  <p><tt>jasmin sample.asm</tt></p>

  <p>This creates the file <tt>sample.class</tt>:</p>

  <p><tt>bash-2.01$ ls -l sample.class<br>
  -rw-r. r. 1 bjepson bjepson 371 Oct 12 12:56 sample.class<br>
  bash-2.01$ file sample.class<br>
  sample.class: compiled Java class data, version 45.3<br></tt></p>

  <p>You can run the class by feeding it into the Java
  interpreter:</p>

  <p><tt>bash-2.01$ java sample<br>
  6<br></tt></p>

  <p>Jasmin and documentation is included in Jon Meyer and Troy
  Downing's <i>Java Virtual Machine</i>, published by O'Reilly
  &amp; Associates. Jasmin is also available from
  http://mrl.nyu.edu/meyer/jasmin/.</p>

  <h3>Growing a Tree</h3>

  <p>Let's return to the question I posed earlier. Is there a
  systematic way to correctly handle a case like print 2 + 3 * 4;?
  Upon inspection, it's easy to see that the correct answer is:</p>

  <p><tt>push 3<br>
  push 4<br>
  mul<br>
  push 2<br>
  add<br>
  print<br></tt></p>

  <p>But how do you know that? How would you handle a more
  complicated case, such as print <tt>2 + 3 * 4 * (6 + 3 *
  2)</tt>;? I'm sure you could work out the answer on paper, but we
  need a technique that can get this right automatically, without
  human intervention.</p>

  <p>This is where the front end comes in. The front end of the
  compiler parses the source code and passes a representation of
  that source code to a back end.</p>

  <h3>From Code to Tree</h3>

  <table border="1" align="center" celspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
   <b>Rule       </b>               <b> Result</b>
 PRINT-STATEMENT        PRINT EXPRESSION SEMICOLON
 EXPRESSION(1)          PRINT INTEGER OPERATOR EXPRESSION
 EXPRESSION(1)          PRINT INTEGER OPERATOR INTEGER OPERATOR EXPRESSION
 EXPRESSION(3)          PRINT INTEGER OPERATOR INTEGER OPERATOR INTEGER
 Simplified             PRINT 2 + 3 * 4
 
</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>There are three components of the front end that we need to
  know about: the lexer, the parser, and the semantic analyzer.
  Whether these are distinct modules within the Perl compiler is
  not important (and I don't know enough about the Perl compiler to
  tell you, anyway).What is important is that these components are
  included in most compilers.</p>

  <p>In this section, we'll look at how you might implement
  something that can parse a command like print <tt>2 + 3 * 4</tt>;
  This is not meant to be an accurate portrayal of how Perl handles
  this, but it is meant to give you enough information to
  understand how a back end like B::JVM::Jasmin works.</p>

  <p>This discussion is deliberately simplified. It ignores the
  fact that any decent front end would fold 2 + 3 * 4 into 14
  before handing it off to the back end. There are a number of
  other simplifications, but these have been made to make it easy
  to explain the issues involved with a compiler.</p>

  <p>The <b>lexer</b> is responsible for reading a stream of source
  code (such as a program file or something passed in through
  <tt>-e</tt>), and breaking it up into tokens. A token is often a
  language keyword (such as <tt>print</tt>), a string (such as
  "<tt>hello</tt>"), or a number (such as 2). As the lexer reads
  the source file, it sends a series of tokens to the parser. When
  the lexer sees a statement like <tt>print 2 + 3 * 4</tt>;, it
  tells the parser something like:</p>

  <p><tt>Here comes a statement:<br>
  Token: PRINT<br>
  Token: INTEGER(2)<br>
  Token: OPERATOR (+)<br>
  Token: INTEGER (3)<br>
  Token: OPERATOR (*)<br>
  Token: INTEGER (4)<br>
  Token: SEMICOLON<br></tt></p>

  <p>The <b>parser</b>, in turn, matches this to some rules, such
  as:</p>

  <p><tt>EXPRESSION(1) : = INTEGER OPERATOR EXPRESSION<br>
  EXPRESSION(2) : = EXPRESSION OPERATOR INTEGER<br>
  EXPRESSION(3) : = INTEGER<br>
  PRINT-STATEMENT : = PRINT EXPRESSION SEMICOLON<br></tt></p>

  <p>A parser also often knows something about arithmetic
  precedence. It knows that multiplication should be handled before
  addition, so as it reads these rules, it applies them in the
  fashion shown just above.</p>

  <p>This seems kind of stupid. We just applied a bunch of rules
  and got back what we put in. What's the point?</p>

  <table border="1" align="center" celspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
        <b>Rule </b>         <b> Result</b>
  PRINT-STATEMENT       PRINT EXPRESSION SEMICOLON
  EXPRESSION(2)         PRINT EXPRESSION OPERATOR INTEGER
  EXPRESSION(1)         PRINT INTEGER OPERATOR EXPRESSION OPERATOR INTEGER
  EXPRESSION(2)         PRINT INTEGER OPERATOR INTEGER OPERATOR INTEGER
  Simplified            PRINT 2 * 3 + 4
 
</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The point is the choice of rules and the order in which the
  rules were applied. The application of these rules preserves the
  operator precedence. Take a look at Figure 3, which depicts the
  parse tree for this expression.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/jepson-fig3.gif"><img src=
  "images/jepson-fig3_th.gif" width="200" height="103" alt=
  "figure three" border="0"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 3:</b> the parse tree for this
  expression</p>

  <p>Because 3 * 4 is stuck in its own little branch off to the
  lower right, we know that they will be evaluated before the
  addition is performed. If the expression had been 2 * 3 + 4, the
  rules would be applied in the table show to the left.</p>

  <p>Figure 4 shows the parse tree for <tt>print 2 * 3 + 4</tt>;.
  <b>Semantic Analysis</b>. After the parser has had its way with
  the input, it passes the tree on to other parts of the front end
  for semantic analysis. Although a parser can handle simple things
  like operator precedence, the semantic analyzer is needed to
  interpret more complex aspects of a language, such as whether a
  value should be interpreted in a scalar or list context.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/jepson-fig4.gif"><img src=
  "images/jepson-fig4_th.gif" width="200" height="124" alt=
  "figure 4" border="0"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 4:</b> the parse tree for <tt>print 2
  * 3 + 4</tt>;</p>

  <p>In this article, we're not going to see any examples of
  semantic analysis, but it's an important enough part of the front
  end to merit mentioning.</p>

  <p>Figure 5 shows a now leaner version of the tree that preserves
  all the information we need.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/jepson-fig5.gif"><img src=

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 5:</b> a now leaner version of the
  tree</p>

  <h3>Walking the Tree</h3>

  <p>The compiler back end "walks" the tree produced by the front
  end; its path is shown by the arrows in Figure 5. How does the
  syntax tree preserve information</p>

  <p>about the precedence of operators? Because the tree isolates
  certain operations (such as multiplication) when other operations
  (such as addition), are dependent upon their completion. In this
  case, 2 + EXPRESSION is dependent on the completion of 3 * 4.</p>

  <h3>The Story of O</h3>

  <p>O is a module that is part of the Perl compiler. It's
  essentially a controller for various back ends; to use any
  compiler back end, you need to use O. Here's an example of how
  you can <tt>use</tt> O to activate the B::Terse back end, which
  walks the Perl syntax tree and prints out some brief information
  about what's going on. Note that in order to avoid 2 + 3 * 4
  being folded into a single constant, I've used variables to refer
  to the numbers.</p>
  <pre>
bash-2.01$ perl -MO=Terse -e 'print $two + $three * $four;'
   LISTOP (0xb4a18) leave
       OP (0xb4a40) enter
       COP (0xb49e0) nextstate
       LISTOP (0xb4998) print
           OP (0xb49c0) pushmark
           BINOP (0x27be0) add [2]
               UNOP (0xb4758) null [15]
                   GVOP (0x37880) gvsv  GV (0x2903c) *two
               BINOP (0x27ba0) multiply [1]
                   UNOP (0xb4868) null [15]
                       GVOP (0xb4778) gvsv  GV (0x28fdc) *three
                   UNOP (0xb4978) null [15]
                       GVOP (0xb4888) gvsv  GV (0x28fc4) *four
</pre>

  <p>This is a slightly different way of looking at the parse tree.
  But as the last five lines indicate, the multiplication is
  isolated as we wanted.</p>

  <h3>From Perl to Java</h3>

  <p>B::JVM::Jasmin is a back end to the Perl compiler; it emits a
  Jasmin source file. You can feed this file into Jasmin and get a
  Java class file as a result. B::JVM::Jasmin is essentially a
  proof-of-concept work. It shows that it's possible to generate
  Java bytecode from Perl, but it doesn't go far enough, because it
  doesn't handle advanced features of Perl.</p>

  <p>The O module talks to a back end by calling the back end's
  <tt>compile()</tt> method. The <tt>compile()</tt> method in
  B::JVM::Jasmin opens up the output file, and calls the
  <tt>mywalk()</tt> method, which walks the Perl parse tree.</p>

  <p>As Jasmin walks the parse tree, it encounters various opcodes,
  which roughly correspond to what we saw in the parse tree. Every
  opcode can have up to two corresponding methods that handle it:
  the pre_action, which is executed before mywalk() handles any of
  that opcode's children, and the post_action, which is executed
  after the children are handled.</p>

  <p>Here is a summary of what <tt>mywalk()</tt> does for every
  node it encounters on the parse tree:</p>

  <p><tt>Execute the pre_action, and store its output.<br>
  Execute the post_action, and store its output.<br>
  Emit the output of the pre_action.<br>
  If the current node has children:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each child:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call mywalk() on this
  child.<br>
  Emit the output of the post_action.<br></tt></p>

  <p>B::JVM::Jasmin only pays attention to a subset of the full
  tree that the compiler provides, shown below as a subset of the
  B::Terse output we saw earlier:</p>
  <pre>
  LISTOP (0xb4998) print
        BINOP (0x27be0) add [2]
                GVOP (0x37880) gvsv  GV (0x2903c) *two
            BINOP (0x27ba0) multiply [1]
                    GVOP (0xb4778) gvsv  GV (0x28fdc) *three
                    GVOP (0xb4888) gvsv  GV (0x28fc4) *four
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>Before we can get any useful output from B::JVM::Jasmin, let's
  expand our example ( <tt>print $two + $three * $four;</tt>) to
  assign some values to the three variables. (Remember, we are
  using variables instead of constants only to keep Perl from
  folding them into one number at compile time).</p>
  <pre>
<tt>
 $two = 2;
 $three = 3;
 $four = 4;
 print $two + $three * $four;
</tt>
</pre>

  <p>Figure 6 shows what B::JVM::Jasmin does with the first three
  lines; the resulting source code for Jasmin follows. Note that
  B::JVM::Jasmin automates storage for local variables, by
  assigning the first variable it encounters to JVM local #1, the
  second to JVM local #2, and so forth:</p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 6:</b> what B::JVM::Jasmin does with
  the first three lines;</p>
  <pre>
<tt>
   sipush 2  ; push the value 2
   istore_1  ; store it in local variable 1 (corresponds to $two)
   sipush 3  ; push the value 3
   istore_2  ; store it in local variable 2 ($three)
   sipush 4  ; push the value 4
   istore_3  ; store it in local variable 3 ($four)
</tt>
</pre>

  <p>Figure 7 shows how the pre_action and post_action are executed
  for the remainder of the program. Notice how the print opcode
  sets up the PrintStream object on the way in, and then expects a
  value on the stack on the way out as it invokes
  <tt>println()</tt>. Here is the output:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/jepson-fig7.gif"><img src=
  "images/jepson-fig7_th.gif" width="200" height="126" alt=
  "figure 7" border="0"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 7:</b> shows the pre_action and
  post_action</p>
  <pre>
<tt>
    1  getstatic java/lang/System/out Ljava/io/PrintStream;
    2  iload_1   
    3  iload_2   
    4  iload_3 
    5  imul   
    6  iadd      
    7  invokestatic 
       java/lang/String/valueOf(I)Ljava/lang/String;
    8  invokevirtual 
       java/io/PrintStream/print(Ljava/lang/String;)V
</tt>
</pre>

  <p>Line 1 pushes the object <tt>java.lang.System.out</tt> on the
  stack (Java's STDOUT).</p>

  <p>Line 2, 3, and 4 fetch the contents of <tt>$two, $three</tt>,
  and <tt>$four</tt>.</p>

  <p>Line 5 multiplies the top two items (<tt>$four</tt> and
  <tt>$three</tt>).</p>

  <p>Line 6 adds the top two items (<tt>$two</tt> and 12).</p>

  <p>Lines 7 and 8 convert the integer on the stack to a string,
  and invoke the <tt>println()</tt> method of the object we pushed
  in line 1.</p>

  <h3>It's Alive!</h3>

  <p>When we pump B::JVM::Jasmin's output through Jasmin and then
  the JVM, we see the correct output: 14.</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>Compilation is tricky business. Thankfully, someone's done
  some of the hard work for us. Malcolm Beattie's Perl Compiler
  handles the front end, and Jon Meyer's Jasmin takes care of part
  of the back end's work. There still is much to be done, though.
  B::JVM::Jasmin is just a small part, and doesn't take into
  account things like subroutines, modules, classes, regular
  expressions, and many other things. To a certain extent, some of
  these ideas will port over to Java well. Others, like regular
  expressions and multiple inheritance, will be tricky.</p>

  <p>What does the future hold? All eyes of the JPL mailing list
  are upon Bradley M. Kuhn, who is working on implementing
  something a little more advanced than B::JVM::Jasmin as part of
  his graduate research. B::JVM::Jasmin was useful as a prototype,
  but future work in this area will probably be built using
  B::JVM::Jasmin as a reference, rather than a foundation. That's
  one of the best things a prototype can hope for!</p>
