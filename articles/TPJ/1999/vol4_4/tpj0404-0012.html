  <p>Martin Brown and his collaborators at Osborne have squeezed
  out two books containing nearly 1200 pages of annotated Perl
  references. While the monolithic, phonebook-like <i>Perl:
  Annotated Archives</i> demands a two-inch slice on your bookshelf
  and the cost of a dinner-and-movie-for-two from your wallet, the
  slimmer <i>Programmer's Reference</i> is no less transforming a
  tome, especially for the casual learner.</p>

  <h3>Perl Programmer's Reference</h3>

  <p><i>The Programmer's Reference</i>, which we might call The
  Shorter Brown, advertises a fingertip interface to Frequently
  Ignored Details -- issues that never quite formulate themselves
  into full questions because we are too busy staying on-task
  during our fertile work time. A twelve-page table of contents
  acts as a second index.</p>

  <p>The Shorter Brown has a 100-page section describing all of
  Perl's functions, but the brevity of the individual descriptions
  and the absence of explicit examples will leave readers with
  questions. Perl's syntactic flexibility -- which has given us
  Perl poetry, after all -- is entirely absent in Brown's tour of
  the base command set. [<i>Editor's note: Brown has a third book,
  the 1179-page</i> Perl: The Complete Reference, <i>which has a
  similar section describing all of Perl's functions, but with
  examples as well.</i>]</p>

  <p>The real value of <i>Perl: Programmer's Reference</i> is the
  250+ page summary of Perl's standard library. Here, Brown's
  brevity works in his favor. The moderately-accomplished Perl
  hacker will discover the trove of enormously useful modules that
  come with every distribution. These pages should be perused daily
  until the breadth and depth of Perl is appreciated. Many future
  reinventions of the wheel will be prevented by a knowledge of the
  standard library, and Brown's survey is as light and accessible
  as a reference should be. It's worth the $17 cover price by
  itself.</p>

  <p>The short sections on execution flags and debugger and
  compiler options provide a useful and accessible introduction to
  these aspects of Perl. Brown's quick tour opens their utility to
  general users and reveals the connection to standard library
  functions that also manage command lines. Brown gives compiling
  and debugging a precis with just enough detail to introduce the
  casual user to the common experience of dumping core and how to
  manage the pieces. Serious Perl hackers should look elsewhere for
  design criteria and strategies for developing manageable
  code.</p>

  <p>Brown's chapter of example code is better at demonstrating
  Perl's flexibility than as a didactic how-to of material covered
  in the other chapters. Last, Brown gives us a rare and
  thoughtful, annotated bibliography for Perl students of all
  levels of interest and ability.</p>

  <h3>Perl Annotated Archives</h3>

  <p>Brown boasts at the beginning of <i>Annotated Archives</i> --
  the Fatter Brown -- that his telephone book-sized work is for
  everyone: beginner through advanced. Indeed, somewhere within and
  between the 800 pages and "bonus" compact disc there lie several
  books, and not just for Perl devotees but for network, system,
  and database administrators. If you think of <i>Annotated
  Archives</i> as a collection of books on common managerial tasks
  unified by Perl, it justifies the $50 price tag. The best reader
  would be the ardent student hacker who could follow Brown's
  instruction blindly and obsess through the copious details on his
  or her own. As a shelf ballast for occasional reference, it is
  quite a luxury.</p>

  <p>Then again, the $50 is cheap if you use <i>Annotated
  Archives</i> as a self-taught course in system administration.
  Brown's extensive use of sample code (with numbered lines for
  reference) is interspersed with balanced instruction expressed in
  clear and uncondescending prose. Occasional programmer's notes
  are set aside from the narrative to provide a second level of
  discourse of a more technical nature.</p>

  <p><i>Annotated Archives</i> hangs its hat on sample code. The
  book begins with examples that have a pedagogical nature and
  can't be immediately used by the working sysadmin who needs a
  quick hack. As the topics progress from basic text manipulation
  to practical problem solving, the code becomes more and more
  excisable for narrowly defined system administration problems. As
  the narrative roves around from HTML document management to mail
  handling to network management, the examples look more like a
  patchwork quilt and become less generalizable. The result is an
  educational experience that moves from the classroom to
  laboratory to the minutiae of the real world as the pages
  turn.</p>

  <p><i>Annotated Archives</i> should not be confused with CPAN,
  the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. Thankfully, Brown keeps
  the discussion on Perl's administrative applications and steers
  clear of the frenzied and eclectic CPAN world.</p>

  <p>Brown notes that all <i>Annotated Archives</i> source code is
  available at his web site as well as on the accompanying CD-ROM.
  Regrettably, the editors at Osborne chose to include the "bonus"
  CD-ROM, which may have been intended to justify the $50 cover
  price, but I'm sure the number of Internetless web database
  hackers is quite small.</p>

  <p>In summary, the Shorter Brown is remarkably meaty for its
  size, while The Fatter Brown is an uncoiling rope ladder to
  practical Perl gurudom. Both might merit space on your bookshelf.
  You can buy the Shorter Brown on impulse without feeling guilty,
  but buy the Fatter Brown with a purpose.</p>_ _END_ _
