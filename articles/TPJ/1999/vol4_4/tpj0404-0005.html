  <p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been playing with MPEG level 3 (MP3), that
  wonderful technology that allows you to take a huge CD audio file
  and reduce its size more than tenfold without perceptible loss of
  fidelity. The last year has seen an explosion of MP3-related web
  sites, encoding and playing software, Internet-based CD
  databases, and even hardware products such as the Diamond
  Multimedia Rio MP3 player.</p>

  <p>One of the neat things that MP3 supports is streaming audio.
  Instead of downloading the entire MP3 file to disk and then
  launching a player application to play it, the player retrieves
  the audio stream directly from the network, playing the music in
  real time as it downloads. Provided that the available network
  bandwidth is sufficient, it is much more satisfying to click on a
  link and instantly hear the music than to wait for a long
  download to complete.</p>

  <p>On the client side, streaming MP3 audio is supported by
  several of the more popular MP3 players, including WinAmp on
  Microsoft Windows systems, and the open source Xmms program for
  Unix machines. On the server side, streaming MP3 audio is
  supported by the commercial Shoutcast system on Windows
  platforms, and by the open source Icecast system on Linux and
  other Unix platforms. In addition to providing streaming MP3
  audio to clients, the Shoutcast and Icecast systems implement a
  form of Internet broadcasting that allows people with the
  appropriate client software to send an audio stream to an
  Internet server. The server relays the broadcast along a set of
  replica servers, which in turn stream the audio to anyone who
  tunes in to the proper channel.</p>

  <p>I played with the Icecast server for a while, but wasn&rsquo;t
  particularly interested in its broadcasting abilities. I really
  just wanted to stream static MP3 files from the comfort and
  convenience of my Apache web server. So I started looking into
  how Shoutcast/Icecast do MP3 streaming. The result was
  Apache::MP3, an Apache module written to run under the mod_perl
  embedded interpreter.</p>

  <h3>Playlists, Streams, and ID3 Tags</h3>

  <p>It turns out that the core of MP3 streaming is not difficult
  at all. All that you have to do for a rudimentary form of
  streaming is put an MP3 file on a web server, fire up your
  favorite stream-savvy MP3 player, and tell the player to open the
  sound file&rsquo;s URL. The MP3 player contacts the web server,
  generates a correctly-formed GET request for the sound file, and
  plays it as soon as the data begins to appear. So what more needs
  to be done?</p>

  <p>There were two things that bothered me about this. The first
  problem was that I had to open up the URL from within the player
  application. Although WinAmp has a "mini-browser" built into it,
  its browser window is small and its abilities are extremely
  limited (and it displays advertising). Other players have no
  built-in browser at all, which required me to type in the URLs by
  hand, something I avoid whenever possible. Ideally I would like
  to click on a link in Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer,
  and have the player application pop up and immediately begin
  playing the audio stream.</p>

  <p>A second annoyance was that when the player application opens
  an MP3 URL, it displays the http:// URL in its playlist and title
  area. Call me compulsive, but I don&rsquo;t care to see the URL
  in the playlist. I&rsquo;d rather see the artist&rsquo;s name,
  the title of the album, and the title of the track.</p>

  <p>My initial solution to problem number one was to configure my
  Web browser to use Xmms as the helper application for MP3 files,
  which I did by adding the line below to my .mailcap file. Mailcap
  files, often located in home directories, contain a list of MIME
  types and an application to launch upon encountering data of that
  type. This line makes audio/mpeg messages trigger the Xmms
  application.</p>

  <p><tt>audio/mpeg; xmms %s</tt></p>

  <p>This didn&rsquo;t work at all the way I wanted. Netscape
  downloaded the entire file to disk, and then launched Xmms to
  play it.</p>

  <p>My next solution was only slightly better. I changed the
  .mailcap entry to read:</p>

  <p><tt>audio/mpeg; xmms %u</tt></p>

  <p>A little-known Netscape extension to the <tt>.mailcap</tt>
  file replaces %u with the URL being downloaded. This caused Xmms
  to stream the requested URL, which was great, but while the data
  was streaming, Netscape went ahead and downloaded the entire file
  to a temporary directory, which it then deleted as soon as the
  download was finished. There went half my bandwidth!</p>

  <p>After poking about a bit in the Icecast sources, I discovered
  the <i>playlist</i>. A playlist is a list of one or more files or
  URLs that you can pass to an MP3 player. When an MP3 player is
  asked to open a playlist, it loads and plays each file or URL in
  the order specified. Playlists have a MIME type of audio/mpegurl
  and a straightforward format. A sample playlist is shown in
  Figure 1.</p>

  <table border="0" celllspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Figure 1: A playlist is a list of files or URLs for an
        MP3 player to load and play:</b>

        <p>[playlist]</p>NumberOfEntries=4<br>
        File1=http://stein.cshl.org/samples/the_wheel/Imbolc.mp3<br>

        File2=http://stein.cshl.org/samples/the_wheel/Samhain.mp3<br>

        File3=http://stein.cshl.org/samples/the_wheel/Merry_Men.mp3<br>

        File4=http://stein.cshl.org/samples/the_wheel/The_Process.mp3

        <p><img src="images/mp3.gif" width="342" height="121" alt=
        "mp3"></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>With this knowledge, the solution to the first problem became
  clear. Arrange for Apache to generate playlists on the fly, and
  then declare the MP3 player to be the helper application for MIME
  type <tt>audio/mpegurl:</tt></p>

  <p><tt>audio/mpegurl; xmms %s</tt></p>

  <p>As it turned out, on Windows and Macintosh systems the
  streaming audio players register themselves as audio/mpegurl
  helper applications when they are first installed, so this step
  is only necessary on Unix systems.</p>

  <p>So much for problem 1. But what about problem 2? MP3 files
  ordinarily embed information about the artist, title, genre, and
  track in a data structure called an <i>ID3</i> tag. The problem
  is that this information is located at the very end of the file,
  a position that is very inconvenient for a streaming protocol
  that doesn&rsquo;t get to the end of the file until all its work
  is done. I knew that MP3 players were able to display title
  information while streaming Shoutcast/Icecast broadcasts, so
  there must be some way that these servers transmitted the
  information at the very beginning of the broadcast.</p>

  <p>Examining the Icecast source code revealed one such method.
  Before an Icecast server begins to transmit the MP3 data, it
  sends a series of headers that describe the audio stream. A
  typical set of headers is shown in <a href=
  "tpj0404-0005b.html"><b>Figure 2</b></a>.</p>

  <p>It begins with an HTTP-like status, <tt>ICY 200</tt> OK,
  followed by a set of icy- lines. The important fields are
  icy-name, which provides the name of the work to display in the
  player window; icy-genre, which specifies the genre of the piece,
  icy-url, which causes WinAmp to display the specified page in its
  mini-browser window; and icy-br, which specifies the bitrate of
  the MP3 file. I&rsquo;m not sure what icy-pub means, but
  presumably it has something to do with the broadcast aspect of
  the Shoutcast/Icecast protocol. (No, and I don&rsquo;t know what
  the "icy" prefix means either; if the protocol is published, I
  haven&rsquo;t been able to find it.)</p>

  <p>When a Shoutcast/Icecast server responds to a GET request from
  a player, it provides this header as a substitute for the
  standard HTTP header. In addition to providing this data up
  front, the servers also respond to clients that request the data
  via a UDP-based mechanism. This is to satisfy clients that enter
  a musical broadcast halfway, so my application doesn&rsquo;t need
  to handle this.</p>

  <p>Having accomplished this bit of reverse engineering, my last
  research task was to figure out how to read the ID3 tags in order
  to get them into the Shoutcast headers. Fortunately, this task
  was rendered trivial by Chris Nandor&rsquo;s MPEG::MP3Info, a
  Perl module capable of reading and writing ID3 tags.</p>

  <h3>Apache::MP3</h3>

  <p>Apache::MP3 is designed to respond to requests for a playlist
  document ending in the extension <tt>.pls</tt> (which is
  standard), or a streaming MP3 document ending in the extension
  <tt>.mps</tt> (which I made up for this application). Neither of
  these documents exist as static files, but are generated as
  needed dynamically from a directory structure containing MP3
  files.</p>

  <p>The rules for the playlist construction are a bit tricky.
  Consider a Web root that contains a top-level directory named
  <tt>samples</tt>, and that it contains four files arranged in the
  following manner:</p>
  <pre>
  /samples/the_wheel/Imbolc.mp3
  /samples/the_wheel/Samhain.mp3
  /samples/the_wheel/Merry_Men.mp3
  /samples/the_wheel/The_Process.mp3
</pre>

  <p>A request for the URL <tt>/samples/the_wheel/
  Merry_Men.pls</tt> makes Apache::MP3 look at the
  <tt>/samples/the_wheel</tt> directory, notice that there is a MP3
  file with the same basename as the requested playlist, and
  autogenerate a playlist containing the single URL
  http://my.site/samples/the_wheel/Merry_men.mps. Notice that the
  URL generated by Apache::MP3 is a request for a <tt>.mps</tt> URL
  rather than for the MP3 file itself. The <tt>.mps</tt> URL will
  be used in a second request to generate an MP3 stream.</p>

  <p>Apache::MP3 can also generate a playlist for an entire
  directory of MP3 files. Just take the directory name and add a
  .pls extension. For example, if the browser requests the URL
  <tt>/samples/the_wheel.pls</tt>, Apache::MP3 will construct a
  playlist containing the four URLs
  <tt>/samples/the_wheel/Imbolc.mps</tt> through
  <tt>/samples/the_wheel/The_Process.mps</tt>.</p>

  <p>When Apache::MP3 receives a request for a URL ending in the
  extension <tt>.mps</tt>, it looks for the corresponding MP3 file,
  extracts its ID3 tags with MPEG::MP3Info, constructs a
  Shoutcast/Icecast header, and streams the file to the client.</p>

  <p>Apache::MP3 is implemented as an Apache module using the
  mod_perl API. This makes it fast and flexible. If you are
  unfamiliar with the mod_perl API, I refer you to the introductory
  article that Doug MacEachern and I wrote for TPJ #9. To install
  Apache::MP3, copy MP3.pm to the directory where your Apache
  mod_perl modules live: either the Perl site-specific module
  directory, or one that was specifically configured for use by
  Apache. Then add the following directives to your Apache
  configuration file:</p>
  <pre>
   AddType audio/mpeg .mp3
   AddType audio/mpegurl .pls
   AddType audio/x-shoutcast-stream .mps

  &lt;Files ~ "\.(pls|mps)$"&gt;
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::MP3
  &lt;/Files&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The first three directives assign the appropriate MIME types
  to the file extensions <tt>.mp3, .pls,</tt> and <tt>.mps</tt>.
  The first two are standard, but the third one is new. The
  Shoutcast/Icecast system doesn&rsquo;t use MIME types for its
  audio streams, but I felt that there should be some MIME type
  entry for the purpose of documentation. This is followed by a
  &lt;<tt>Files</tt>&gt; section declaring that requests for files
  ending in .pls or .mps should be handled by mod_perl. The
  <tt>SetHandler</tt> directive tells Apache to pass the request to
  the mod_perl interpreter, and the <tt>PerlHandler</tt> directive
  tells mod_perl to run and load the Apache::MP3 module.</p>

  <p>The code for Apache::MP3 is shown in <a href=
  "tpj0404-0005a.html"><b>Listing 1</b>.</a> It begins by bringing
  in the various modules the code needs, including the list of
  commonly-used Apache server result codes, the MPEG::MP3Info
  module, the IO::Dir package for object-oriented directory handle
  access, and Apache::File, a lightweight alternative to the
  IO::File object-oriented file access class.</p>

  <p>The entry point for Apache::MP3 is a subroutine named
  <tt>handler()</tt>, which extends from lines 22 to 51. It is
  called by mod_perl to process very request that comes in for a
  <tt>.pls</tt> or <tt>.mps</tt> URL. <tt>handler()</tt> begins by
  storing the Apache request object from the subroutine stack into
  a variable named <tt>$r</tt>. The request object will be used for
  all communication with the Apache server. The code then
  reconstructs the URL for the server by calling various methods in
  the request object (lines 26-29). This server URL will be used
  later in various places later.</p>

  <p>Lines 30-33 parse out the basename of the requested file (the
  name without the extension), the physical directory that the
  requested file lives in, and the virtual directory (in URL space)
  of the requested URL. We need both the physical and the virtual
  directory paths because we will be retrieving information about
  files located on the physical file system, but transmitting back
  a playlist containing URLs. Notice the use of the request
  object&rsquo;s filename() method to retrieve the request
  translated into a physical filesystem path, and uri() to recover
  the same information expressed as a URL. Lines 34-44 deal with a
  request for a playlist. We call the request object&rsquo;s
  <tt>content_type()</tt> method, and test to see if it matches
  MIME type <tt>audio/mpegurl</tt>. Testing the request indirectly
  via its MIME type is cleaner because it avoids hard-coding file
  extensions into the module. If the MIME type matches, then this
  is a request for a playlist. We now test to see whether the
  basename corresponds to a directory, and if so call an internal
  routine named <tt>dir2playlist()</tt> with arguments that make it
  generate a playlist for the entire directory. Otherwise, we
  generate a playlist that contains only a single entry, by calling
  <tt>dir2playlist()</tt> with arguments that make the subroutine
  include only those MP3 files that share the common basename.</p>

  <p>Lines 45-50 deal with a request for a streaming MP3 file, MIME
  content type <tt>audio/x-shoutcast-stream</tt>. The code calls an
  internal subroutine named <tt>search4mp3()</tt> to retrieve MP3
  files in the directory that share the same basename. If no
  matching MP3 file is found, the handler aborts by returning an
  error code of DECLINED. Otherwise it calls a routine named
  <tt>send_stream()</tt> to stream the file to the client.</p>

  <p>Lines 52-64 implement the <tt>search4mp3()</tt> function. It
  takes three arguments: the request object, the directory to
  search in, and an optional search string containing the basename
  to match. It searches through the indicated directory and returns
  all files of type <tt>audio/mpeg</tt> whose basenames match the
  search string. The search string may be undefined, in which case
  all MP3 files are returned. We search for MP3 files in this way
  rather than simply tacking a <tt>.mp3</tt> extension onto the
  basename in the name of flexibility. Perhaps this module will
  need to support MPEG level 4 files some day; or perhaps some of
  the files in the directory are generated by a DOS program that
  uses the uppercase <tt>.MP3</tt> extension.</p>

  <p>The logic of <tt>search4mp3()</tt> is simple. It quotes
  metacharacters in the search string by calling Perl&rsquo;s
  <tt>quotemeta()</tt> function (line 55) and stores the result in
  a variable named <tt>$pattern</tt>. It uses IO::Dir to create a
  new directory handle and loops through each entry in the
  directory. For each directory entry, it tests to see if its name
  matches the pattern, skipping the test if no basename was
  specified. It then calls the request object&rsquo;s
  <tt>lookup_file()</tt> method to ask Apache what it thinks the
  file&rsquo;s MIME type is. If the entry matches
  <tt>audio/mpeg</tt>, then the entry is pushed onto a growing
  list. For searches in which no search string was specified,
  <tt>search4mp3()</tt> returns all MP3 files in the directory.
  Otherwise, <tt>search4mp3()</tt> usually returns a list of length
  zero (nothing found) or one (a single MP3 file found). If the web
  server allows several alternative extensions for MP3 audio files,
  however, it is possible for <tt>search4mp3()</tt> to return a
  list greater than length 1.</p>

  <p>Lines 66-80 implement <tt>dir2playlist()</tt>, which generates
  a playlist containing one or more MP3 URLs. It is called with the
  Apache request object, the directory to search in, the basename
  of the file to search for, and a URL prefix to prepend to the
  names of all matching files. This URL prefix contains the
  hostname and port, as well as the partial directory path.
  <tt>dir2playlist()</tt> calls <tt>search4mp3()</tt> to retrieve
  the list of matching MP3 files and stores them into an array
  named <tt>@mp3</tt> (lines 68-69). If this array is empty, the
  routine returns DECLINED, causing Apache to return the standard
  "File not found" error.</p>

  <p>Otherwise <tt>dir2playlist()</tt> sets the outgoing content
  type to <tt>audio/mpegurl</tt> and sends the HTTP header by
  calling the request object&rsquo;s <tt>send_http_header()</tt>
  method (line 71). After calling the request object&rsquo;s
  <tt>header_only()</tt> method to check whs the playlist file a
  line at a time by calling the request object&rsquo;s
  <tt>print()</tt> method repeatedly. Most of the action occurs in
  lines 75-78, where the subroutine loops through all the MP3 files
  in the <tt>@mp3</tt> array. Each one is transformed into a
  corresponding .mps file using a string substitution, and
  incorporated into the playlist, producing a format like the one
  shown earlier in Figure 1.</p>

  <p>The last and most interesting part of this module is the
  subroutine <tt>send_stream()</tt> (lines 82-105), which is
  responsible for converting an MP3 file into a
  Shoutcast/Icecast-compatible stream. It receives three arguments:
  the request object, the physical path to the MP3 file to send,
  and the URL of the server. This last argument is required in
  order to satisfy WinAmp, which likes to pop up a mini-browser
  showing the home page of the streaming audio source.</p>

  <p>Lines 84-85 call two functions imported from MPEG::MP3Info to
  recover information about the requested MP3 file.
  <tt>get_mp3tag()</tt> returns the ID3 tag structure containing
  information about the content of the audio file. It is a hash
  reference containing keys like TITLE, ARTIST, and so forth.
  <tt>get_mp3info()</tt> returns low-level information about the
  audio file, such as its bitrate, length, and MPEG layer.
  <tt>get_mp3tag()</tt> may return an undefined value if no ID3
  information has been ever added to the audio file, but if
  <tt>get_mp3info()</tt> returns undef, it&rsquo;s a good
  indication that the file isn&rsquo;t a valid MP3 file, in which
  case we bail out by returning DECLINED. Otherwise we try to open
  the file for reading by calling Apache::File&rsquo;s
  <tt>new()</tt> method (line 87). If, for whatever reason, this
  fails, we again bail by returning the DECLINED result code.</p>

  <p>The next step is to generate a human-readable title string
  from the ID3 tag information. This title scrolls across the MP3
  player&rsquo;s main screen and appears in its playlist window.
  After experimenting with various formats, I decided that I liked
  this one the best:</p>
  <pre>
TITLE - ARTIST - ALBUM - YEAR - COMMENT 
</pre>

  <p>Lines 88-91 assemble this title from the ID3 tag information
  in such a way that undefined fields are simply ignored. If the
  TITLE field is undefined, then we default to the current URL.</p>

  <p>Line 92 retrieves the ID3 genre tag, which is needed by the
  Shoutcast/Icecast headers. This information does not seem to be
  used by the clients that I&rsquo;ve examined, and is probably
  used instead by the Shoutcast/Icecast system to create directory
  listings of available audio channels.</p>

  <p>Lines 93 through 102 construct the Shoutcast/Icecast headers.
  Notice that these headers replace the normal HTTP headers &mdash;
  the usual call to <tt>send_http_header()</tt> is absent. (This is
  one reason that it would be difficult to write this module in the
  form of a CGI script.) We print out the ICY status line, the
  title of the work, the genre, the URL, and the audio bitrate
  recovered earlier from the call to <tt>get_mp3info()</tt>. We use
  carriage return/linefeed pairs <tt>(\r\n)</tt> at the end of each
  line rather than a simple newline because that&rsquo;s the way
  that Shoutcast/Icecast servers do it. The header is terminated by
  a blank line.</p>

  <p>If the client sent a HEAD request, we stop here and return an
  OK status code (line 102). I doubt whether MP3 players ever make
  HEAD requests, but this was very useful during debugging when I
  only wanted to see the Shoutcast/Icecast headers. Otherwise, the
  subroutine calls the Apache request object&rsquo;s
  <tt>send_fd()</tt> method to send the contents of the MP3 file to
  the client. This call suspends further processing until the
  entire file has been streamed to the client, or the client
  cancels. (Apache itself won&rsquo;t be suspended, just the one
  server process or thread that is handling the current request.)
  When <tt>send_fd()</tt> returns, we return with a result code of
  OK.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>With Apache::MP3 installed, I am able to load and play the
  entire contents of a directory with a single click of the mouse
  on a link like this one:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;a href="/samples/the_wheel.pls"&gt;The Wheel&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Xmms comes up (see the screenshot in Figure 1) and immediately
  begins to stream and play the first file. When done, Xmms moves
  on to the next. The playlist window is initially populated by the
  raw URLs of each selection, since the player hasn&rsquo;t yet
  received the title information. As each file begins to stream,
  the title provided by Apache::MP3 replaces the URL and scrolls
  across the player&rsquo;s main window. Neat!</p>

  <p>To stream a single file, use a link like this one:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;a href="/samples/the_wheel/Imbolc.pls"&gt;Imbolc (Autumn)&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Finally, to download the entire MP3 file to disk in the
  conventional manner, use this link:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;a href="/samples/the_wheel/Imbolc.mp3"&gt;Download Imbolc (Autumn)&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Since this is neither a <tt>.pls</tt> nor a <tt>.mps</tt> URL,
  it is handled by Apache as a normal static file request.</p>

  <p>I can think of three enhancements to this module. The first
  would be the ability to place an image of the album&rsquo;s cover
  art in the MP3 directory. If the module noticed the existence of
  this image file during streaming, it would use the image
  file&rsquo;s URL as the value of the icy-url: header rather than
  the home page of the server. The effect of this would be to make
  WinAmp&rsquo;s mini-browser display the album&rsquo;s cover art
  while streaming the file. Another useful capability would be
  specifying the order of files appended to the playlist, which
  currently come out in essentially random order. Finally, if you
  want to get really fancy, you could hook this module up to MySQL
  so that playlists cold be constructed dynamically from relational
  database queries. Go wild!</p>
