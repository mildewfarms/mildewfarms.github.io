  <p>This document (available as perlhack.pod in the Perl
  distribution) explains how Perl development takes place, ending
  with some suggestions for people wanting to become bona fide
  porters.</p>

  <p>The perl5-porters mailing list is where the Perl standard
  distribution is maintained and developed. The list gets anywhere
  from 10 to 150 messages a day, depending on the heatedness of the
  debate. Most days there are two or three patches, extensions,
  features, or bugs being discussed at a time. A searchable archive
  of the list is at:</p>
  <pre>
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/
</pre>

  <p>The list is also archived under the Usenet group name
  perl.porters-gw at:</p>
  <pre>
    http://www.deja.com/
</pre>

  <p>List subscribers (the porters themselves) come in several
  flavors. Some are quiet curious lurkers, who rarely pitch in and
  instead watch the ongoing development to ensure they're
  forewarned of new changes or features in Perl. Some represent
  vendors, who are there to make sure that Perl continues to
  compile and work on their platforms. Some patch any reported bug
  that they know how to fix, some are actively patching their pet
  area (threads, Win32, the regex engine), while others seem to do
  nothing but complain. In other words, it's your usual mix of
  technical people.</p>

  <p>Over this group of porters presides Larry Wall. He has the
  final word in what does and does not change in the Perl language.
  Various releases of Perl are shepherded by a <i>pumpking</i>, a
  porter responsible for gathering patches and deciding on a
  patch-by-patch and feature-by-feature basis what goes into the
  release. For instance, Gurusamy Sarathy is the pumpking for the
  5.6 release of Perl.</p>

  <p>In addition, various people are pumpkings for different areas.
  For instance, Andy Dougherty and Jarkko Hietaniemi share the
  Configure pumpkin, and Tom Christiansen is the documentation
  pumpking.</p>

  <p>Larry sees Perl development as emulating the U.S. government:
  there's the Legislature (the porters), the Executive branch (the
  pumpkings), and the Supreme Court (Larry). The legislature can
  discuss and submit patches to the executive branch all they like,
  but the executive branch is free to veto them. Rarely, the
  Supreme Court will side with the executive branch over the
  legislature, or the legislature over the executive branch.
  Mostly, the legislature and the executive branch are supposed to
  get along and work out their differences without impeachments or
  lawsuits.</p>

  <p>You might sometimes see people talk about Rule 1 or Rule 2.
  Larry's power as Supreme Court is expressed in The Rules:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Larry is always by definition right about how Perl should
    behave. This means he has final veto power on the core
    functionality.</li>

    <li>Larry is allowed to change his mind about any matter at a
    later date, regardless of whether he previously invoked Rule
    1.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Got that? Larry is always right, even when he was wrong. It's
  rare to see either Rule exercised, but they are often alluded
  to.</p>

  <p>New features and extensions to the language are contentious,
  because the criteria used by the pumpkings, Larry, and other
  porters are not codified in a few small design goals, as with
  some other languages. Instead, the heuristics are flexible and
  often difficult to fathom. Here is one person's list, roughly in
  decreasing order of importance, of heuristics that new features
  have to be weighed against:</p>

  <p>&bull; Does concept match the general goals of Perl?</p>

  <p>These haven't been written anywhere in stone, but one
  approximation is:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Keep it fast, simple, and useful.</li>

    <li>Keep features/concepts as orthogonal as possible.</li>

    <li>No arbitrary limits (platforms, data sizes, cultures).</li>

    <li>Keep it open and exciting to use/patch/advocate Perl
    everywhere.</li>

    <li>Either assimilate new technologies, or build bridges to
    them.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>&bull; Where is the implementation?</p>

  <p>All the talk in the world is useless without an
  implementation. In almost every case, the person or people who
  argue for a new feature will be expected to implement it. Porters
  capable of coding new features have their own responsibilities,
  and won't necessarily be available to implement your idea, no
  matter how good.</p>

  <p>&bull; Backwards compatibility</p>

  <p>It's a cardinal sin to break existing Perl programs. New
  warnings are contentious &mdash; some say that a program that
  emits warnings is not broken, while others say it is. Adding
  keywords has the potential to break programs, and changing the
  meaning of existing token sequences or functions might break
  programs.</p>

  <p>&bull; Could it be a module instead?</p>

  <p>Perl 5 has extension mechanisms &mdash; modules and XS &mdash;
  specifically to avoid the need to keep changing the Perl
  interpreter. You can write modules that export functions, you can
  give those functions prototypes so they can be called like
  built-in functions, you can even write XS code to mess with the
  runtime data structures of the Perl interpreter if you want to
  implement really complicated things. If it can be done in a
  module instead of in the core, it's highly unlikely to be
  added.</p>

  <p>&bull; Is the feature generic enough?</p>

  <p>Is this something that only the submitter wants added to the
  language, or would it be broadly useful? Sometimes, instead of
  adding a feature with a tight focus, the porters might decide to
  wait until someone implements a more generalized feature. For
  instance, instead of implementing a "delayed evaluation" feature,
  the porters are waiting for a macro system that would permit
  delayed evaluation and much more.</p>

  <p>&bull; Does it potentially introduce new bugs?</p>

  <p>Radical rewrites of large chunks of the Perl interpreter have
  the potential to introduce new bugs. The smaller and more
  localized the change, the better.</p>

  <p>&bull; Does it preclude other desirable features?</p>

  <p>A patch is likely to be rejected if it closes off future
  avenues of development. For instance, a patch that placed a true
  and final interpretation on prototypes is likely to be rejected
  because there are still options for future prototypes that
  haven't been addressed.</p>

  <p>&bull; Is the implementation robust?</p>

  <p>Good patches (tight, complete, correct code) stand more chance
  of going in. Sloppy or incorrect patches might be placed on the
  back burner until the pumpking has time to fix them, or might be
  discarded altogether without further notice.</p>

  <p>&bull; Is the implementation generic enough to be
  portable?</p>

  <p>The worst patches make use of a system-specific feature. It's
  highly unlikely that nonportable additions to the Perl language
  will be accepted.</p>

  <p>&bull; Is there enough documentation?</p>

  <p>Patches without documentation are probably ill-thought out or
  incomplete. Nothing can be added without documentation, so
  submitting a patch for the appropriate pod pages as well as the
  source code is always a good idea. If appropriate, patches should
  add to Perl's test suite as well.</p>

  <p>&bull; Is there another way to do it?</p>

  <p>Larry has said "Although the Perl Slogan is <i>There's More
  Than One Way to Do It</i>, I hesitate to make 10 ways to do
  something." This is a tricky heuristic to navigate, though -- one
  man's essential addition is another man's pointless cruft.</p>

  <p>&bull; Does it create too much work?</p>

  <p>This can mean work for the pumpking, work for Perl
  programmers, or work for module authors. Perl is supposed to be
  easy.</p>

  <p>&bull; Patches speak louder than words</p>

  <p>Working code is always preferred to pie-in-the-sky ideas. A
  patch to add a feature stands a much higher chance of making it
  to the language than a random feature request, no matter how
  fervently argued the request might be. This ties into "Will it be
  useful?", as the fact that someone took the time to make the
  patch demonstrates a strong desire for the feature.</p>

  <p>If you're on the list, you might hear the word "core" bandied
  around. It refers to the standard distribution. "Hacking on the
  core" means you're changing the C source code of the Perl
  interpreter. "A core module" is one that ships with Perl.</p>

  <p>The source code to the Perl interpreter, in its different
  versions, is kept in a repository managed by a revision control
  system (currently the Perforce program, see
  http://perforce.com/). The pumpkings and a few others have access
  to the repository to check in changes. Periodically the pumpking
  for the development version of Perl will release a new version,
  so the rest of the porters can see what's changed. Plans are
  underway for a repository viewer, and for anonymous CVS access to
  the latest versions.</p>

  <p>Always submit patches <tt>to perl5-porters@perl.org</tt>. This
  lets other porters review your patch, which catches a surprising
  number of errors in patches. Either use the diff program
  (available in source code form from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/),
  or use Johan Vromans' makepatch utility, described in TPJ #15 and
  available from CPAN/authors/id/JV/). Unified diffs are preferred,
  but context diffs are accepted. Do not send RCS-style diffs or
  diffs without context lines. More information is given in the
  <tt>Porting/patching.pod</tt> file in the Perl source
  distribution. Please patch against the latest
  <tt>development</tt> version (e.g., if you're fixing a bug in the
  5.005 track, patch against the latest 5.005_5x version). Only
  patches that survive the heat of the development branch get
  applied to maintenance versions.</p>

  <p>Your patch should also update the documentation and test
  suite.</p>

  <p>To report a bug in Perl, use the perlbug program bundled with
  Perl (if you can't get Perl to work, send mail to the address
  <tt>perlbug@perl.com</tt> or <tt>perlbug@perl.org</tt>).
  Reporting bugs through perlbug feeds into our automated
  bug-tracking system, access to which is provided through the web
  at http://bugs.perl.org/. It often pays to check the archives of
  the perl5-porters mailing list to see whether the bug you're
  reporting has been reported before, and if so whether it was
  considered a bug.</p>

  <p>The CPAN testers (http://testers.cpan.org/) are a group of
  volunteers who test CPAN modules on a variety of platforms. Perl
  Labs (http://labs.perl.org/) automatically tests Perl source
  releases on platforms and gives feedback to the CPAN testers
  mailing list. Both efforts welcome volunteers.</p>

  <p>To become an active and patching Perl porter, you'll need to
  learn how Perl works on the inside. Chip Salzenberg, a pumpking,
  has written articles on Perl internals for TPJ explaining how
  various parts of the Perl interpreter work. The <tt>perlguts</tt>
  documentation explains the internal data structures. And, of
  course, the C source code (sometimes sparsely commented,
  sometimes commented well) is a great place to start (begin with
  <tt>perl.c</tt> and take it from there). A lot of the style of
  the Perl source is explained in the <tt>Porting/pumpkin.pod</tt>
  file in the source distribution.</p>

  <p>It is essential that you be comfortable using a good debugger
  (such as <tt>gdb</tt> or <tt>dbx</tt>) before you can patch perl.
  Stepping through Perl as it executes a script is perhaps the best
  (if sometimes tedious) way to gain a precise understanding of the
  overall architecture of the language.</p>

  <p>If you build a version of the Perl interpreter with
  -DDEBUGGING, Perl's -D command line flag emits copious debugging
  information (see the perlrun manpage). If you build a version of
  Perl with compiler debugging information (typically with your C
  compiler's -g option instead of -O), you can step through the
  execution of the interpreter with your favorite C symbolic
  debugger, setting breakpoints on particular functions.</p>

  <p>It's a good idea to read and lurk for a while before chipping
  in. That way you'll get to see the dynamic of the conversations,
  learn the personalities of the players, and hopefully be better
  prepared to make a useful contribution when do you speak up.</p>

  <p>If after all this you still think you want to join the
  perl5-porters mailing list, send mail to
  <tt>perl5-porters-subscribe@perl.org</tt>. To unsubscribe, send
  mail to <tt>perl5-porters-unsubscribe@perl.org</tt>.</p>
