  <p>This article talks about the Net::DNS::Update module, and how
  you can use it to remotely update information on a DNS server.
  You might do this if you are a DNS administrator wanting to
  balance load between a range of machines, or if you are the owner
  of a domain and want to programmatically update the information
  in that domain even though you don't have access to the DNS
  server's configuration files.</p>

  <h3>DNS Basics</h3>

  <p>Whenever you send mail or visit a web site, your computer has
  to know how to reach a remote computer. In particular, it has to
  translate a name like "perl.com" to its Internet address,
  199.45.135.9. Only when that address is known can your mail
  program send mail to webmaster@perl.com and your web browser
  display http://www.perl.com/CPAN/.</p>

  <p>The act of translating hostnames to Internet addresses is
  called <i>name resolution</i>, and the infrastructure supporting
  it is called the Domain Name System, or DNS. In this article,
  I'll demonstrate how to access some of the new features of The
  Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (BIND) Version 8 with the Net::DNS
  modules. In particular, I'll focus on Net::DNS::Update, which
  allows you to change the information stored in a nameserver on
  the fly. You could use this technique to take a crashed box in a
  server farm out of rotation, manage PPP or DHCP clients, or
  perform load balancing.</p>

  <p>To get the most out of this article you should have a decent
  knowledge of the workings of DNS and BIND, a BIND version 8
  nameserver, and a zone to play around with. A <i>zone</i> is
  similar to a domain such as perl.com, but it could also refer to
  a subdomain such as test.perl.com. While it is possible that the
  code examples will work with other RFC 2136-compliant
  nameservers, I haven't tested anything other than BIND 8 running
  on Unix.</p>

  <p>A full description of DNS is beyond the scope of this article.
  For those who want the full story, I highly recommend O'Reilly's
  <i>DNS &amp; Bind</i> book by Albitz &amp; Liu.</p>

  <h3>DNS Servers</h3>

  <p>Without doubt, the most popular nameserver is BIND
  (http://www.isc.org/bind.html). The current BIND implementation,
  BIND 8, is maintained by the Internet Software Consortium (ISC),
  and supports a feature called dynamic update; see
  http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2136.txt for the low-level
  description of the <i>dynamic update</i> protocol. BIND 8 has
  been in production use since May 1997, so you shouldn't fear
  upgrading.</p>

  <p>One way to tell if your system is running BIND 8 is to look at
  how your <i>named</i> gets started. If it uses a file called
  <tt>named.conf</tt>, it is version 8. The older model, version 4,
  which is still quite common, uses <tt>named.boot</tt>. You could
  also look at the <i>named</i> log messages when it starts up.
  Mine looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
Dec 16 11:41:09 hudsucker named[14993]: starting. named 
                         8.1.2 Thu Jan  8 12:47:42 PST 1998
jsd@hudsucker.gamespot.com:/usr/home/jsd/build/bind/src/bin/named


</pre>

  <p>If your system uses version 4, you should upgrade to version
  8, since that's the only version being actively maintained and
  developed. BIND 4 has been deprecated by the ISC.</p>

  <h3>Dynamic Update</h3>

  <p>Originally, zone files (the files that map IP addresses to
  names and vice versa) were fairly static. You'd set up a machine,
  give it an address, and that was the end of the story. Most
  machines on the net were mainframes then, so there was no
  compelling need for a flexible, dynamic protocol.</p>

  <p>In this day of dialup PPP, DHCP, and server farms, things are
  clearly different. We need a way to dynamically update entries in
  a zone file on the fly. Enter RFC 2136 and Net::DNS::Update.</p>

  <p>Net::DNS is a collection of object-oriented modules designed
  to interface with nameservers. The author, Michael Fuhr, claims
  they're slow, but I've never encountered any debilitating speed
  problems. Usually you have more than enough latency in your
  network to offset any problems with script speed!</p>

  <h3>Setting Up Your Nameserver</h3>

  <p>Before you can start writing code, you must configure your
  nameserver to accept dynamic updates. I recommend creating a
  separate zone for dynamic updates because BIND writes out the
  zone file when it changes, and it writes it out in a compact form
  without any formatting or comments you might have put in the
  original.</p>

  <p>So, say your zone is test.com and you want to create
  <tt>dyn.test.com</tt> to hold the dynamic updates. Put the
  following lines in your <tt>named.conf</tt> file:</p>
  <pre>
   zone "dyn.test.com" {
     type master;
     file "db.dyn.test.com";
     allow-update { 10.0.0.0/24; };
   };
</pre>

  <p>There are several salient features in this entry. First, the
  zone name, which is self-evident. The <tt>type</tt> is either
  <tt>master</tt> or <tt>slave</tt>. In this case we are
  authoritative for <tt>test.com</tt> and all its subdomains, so we
  are the <tt>master</tt>.</p>

  <p>The filename can be whatever you want; it is created in the
  directory specified in the options section of your configuration
  file. The really important feature is the <tt>allow-update</tt>
  directive. Without this, the nameserver rejects all updates for
  the zone. I have specified the hosts in the IP/Netmask form. The
  number after the slash is the number of "one" bits in the
  netmask, counted from the left hand side. So, rendering the above
  in binary would give us:</p>
  <pre>
          00001010 00000000 00000000 00000000  host address
          11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000  netmask
</pre>

  <p>In English, this means that any IP address starting with
  10.0.0 is allowed to update the zone.</p>

  <p>If this discussion of host addresses and netmasks has you
  dizzy, don't worry. You aren't the first to be perplexed.
  However, I recommend that you spend some time learning about
  them, because if you deal with DNS or other Internet protocols on
  a regular basis, you will undoubtedly encounter them over and
  over again.</p>

  <h3>Delegating The Zone</h3>

  <p>Now that you have created a new zone, you need to tell your
  nameserver where to get information on it. In the
  <tt>test.com</tt> zone file, you need to add the following
  line:</p>
  <pre>
         dyn IN NS nameserver.test.com
</pre>

  <p>This assumes that <tt>test.com</tt> is already being served by
  <tt>nameserver.test.com</tt> and that you are creating
  <tt>dyn.test.com</tt> on the same machine. Now when people ask
  <tt>nameserver.test.com</tt> about <tt>dyn.test.com</tt>, it
  sends them a response which points right back at the same
  machine. Obviously that's redundant in this case, but remember
  that one of the key features of DNS is its distributed nature --
  you could just have easily directed queries about dyn.test.com to
  a machine on the other side of the world. This process is known
  as <i>delegation</i>.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, you can declare yourself authoritative for any
  zone, regardless of whether or not this is actually the case.
  What happens in this situation is that any clients using your
  nameserver for resolution will take whatever it says as gospel,
  whereas the rest of the net will get different information from
  the real authoritative nameservers. This could be extremely
  confusing, so if you are unsure whether you are authoritative for
  a zone, double check with the appropriate registry, or use dig to
  find the answer. dig is an excellent tool bundled with the BIND
  package. It is invaluable for diagnosing DNS problems.</p>
  <pre>
 $ dig test.com
 
 ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 2.2 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; test.com 
 ;; res options: init recurs defnam dnsrch
 ;; got answer:
 ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 6
 ;; flags: qr rd ra; Ques: 1, Ans: 1, Auth: 2, Addit: 2
 ;; QUESTIONS:
 ;;      test.com, type = A, class = IN
 
 ;; ANSWERS:
 test.com.       3568    A       207.206.9.99
 
 ;; AUTHORITY RECORDS:
 test.com.       3571    NS      mercury.xa.com.
 test.com.       3571    NS      grail.BOOKS.com.
</pre>

  <p>It turns out that the real world test.com is served by
  <tt>mercury.xa.com</tt> and <tt>grail.books.com</tt>. Replies
  coming from any other sources are <i>non-authoritative</i>. The
  reverse of this situation, where a server is designated
  authoritative but is not responding authoritatively for a
  request, is called a <i>lame delegation</i>. If you run
  <i>named</i> with the default logging levels, you will see plenty
  of lame delegation warning messages!</p>

  <p>We're still not done setting up. In the example below, we are
  going to dynamically change the address of <tt>ftp.test.com</tt>.
  Except that to avoid messing up the test.com zone, we are really
  going to change <tt>ftp.dyn.test.com</tt>. We need to make an
  alias that maps <tt>ftp.dyn.test.com</tt> to
  <tt>ftp.test.com</tt>. In DNS jargon, such an alias is called a
  CNAME, which means "canonical name."</p>

  <p>So put the following line in the test.com zone file:</p>
  <pre>
       ftp IN CNAME ftp.dyn.test.com.
</pre>

  <p>It's time to restart the nameserver. I recommend using the
  <tt>ndc restart</tt> command. See your BIND documentation for
  details.</p>

  <p>Now that we've configured a nameserver and delegated the zone,
  we can actually get down to writing some Perl code!</p>

  <h3>Using Net::DNS::Update</h3>

  <p>For this example, let's imagine that you have two FTP servers,
  <tt>ftp1.test.com</tt> and <tt>ftp2.test.com</tt>, both
  containing the same content. Their IP addresses are 10.0.0.1 and
  10.0.0.2, respectively. You want users who come to ftp.test.com
  to end up on either of those machines, and you want the load
  distributed evenly between them. (Note that you don't need a
  script like this to achieve a round-robin distribution. That
  functionality is already built into BIND; this example is meant
  to be instructive rather than practical.) Here's the Perl
  script:</p>
  <pre>

 1 use strict;
 2 use Net::DNS;
 3 
 4 while (1) {
 5   set_dns('10.0.0.1');
 6   sleep 300;
 7   set_dns('10.0.0.2');
 8   sleep 300;
 9 }
10 
11 sub set_dns {
12   my $new_ip=shift;
13   my $update = new Net::DNS::Update('dyn.test.com');
14      $update-&gt;push('update', rr_del('ftp.dyn.test.com'));
15      $update-&gt;push('update', 
                      rr_add("ftp.dyn.test.com 1800 A $new_ip"));
16   
17   my $res = new Net::DNS::Resolver;
18      $res-&gt;nameservers('nameserver.test.com');
19   my $reply = $res-&gt;send($update);
20   if (defined $reply) {
21     if ($reply-&gt;header-&gt;rcode ne "NOERROR") {
22       print $reply-&gt;header-&gt;rcode,"\n";
23     } else {
24       print "Update to $new_ip succeeded!\n";
25     }
26   } else {
27     print 'Update failed: ', $res-&gt;errorstring, "\n";
28   }
29 }
</pre>

  <p>In lines 4-8, we set up an infinite loop that changes the IP
  address and sleeps for five minutes. The interesting stuff
  happens in the <tt>set_dns()</tt> subroutine. In line 12, we grab
  the IP address that we're going to associate with
  <tt>ftp.dyn.test.com</tt>, and create a new Net::DNS::Update
  object in line 13. Lines 14 and 15 push data into the update
  packet.</p>

  <p>Update packets are processed atomically -- once the nameserver
  determines that you are allowed to initiate your change, all of
  the requests in your packet are serviced in order, with no
  possibility of any other requestor changing data out from under
  you while your changes are being made. So, in our packet, we have
  a request to delete the current RR (resource record) set for
  <tt>ftp.dyn.test.com</tt>, followed by an immediate request to
  insert a new RR for <tt>ftp.dyn.test.com</tt>. The format of the
  string passed to <tt>rr_add()</tt> is a little odd, but should be
  familiar to anyone who's worked with zone files. The first field
  is the hostname, of course. The second field is the
  <i>time-to-live</i> for the entry, expressed in seconds. This one
  says that this record is valid for 300 seconds (5 minutes), at
  which point any nameserver caching it should throw it out and
  request a new one from another nameserver. (Unfortunately the DNS
  resolver clients in MacOS and Windows are broken to various
  degrees, and often ignore the timeouts. Sometimes it appears that
  your machine is fixated on a given IP address; the only way to
  get it to look up the new information is to reboot.)</p>

  <p>Now we have a nice packet of data. Net::DNS::Update doesn't
  actually do anything with the data besides put it in a format
  that a nameserver recognizes. Now we have to bring in
  Net::DNS::Resolver. This is a somewhat misleading name, with
  roots in history. As I mentioned earlier, it used to be that
  nameservers were largely read-only. Clients that talked to DNS
  servers were known as <i>resolvers</i>, since resolving names to
  IP addresses was their exclusive function. Nowadays even though
  DNS clients can read and write, they are still called
  "resolvers."</p>

  <p>In line 17, we create the resolver object, and in line 18, we
  tell it that the nameserver it will talk to is
  <tt>nameserver.test.com</tt>. Line 19 is where all the magic
  happens. The <tt>send()</tt> method sends our carefully crafted
  update packet off to the nameserver specified in the resolver
  object.</p>

  <p>At this point, you should check your nameserver logfiles to
  see if there are any messages about your action. A common
  mistake, such as not setting the permissions in
  <tt>named.conf</tt> properly, results in an error message like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
   Jan  7 10:29:38 ns1 named[12691]: unapproved update
 from [205.216.163.199].3251 for dyn.test.com
</pre>

  <p>If you don't see any errors, check the zone file directory for
  a file named <tt>dyn.test.com.log</tt>. This contains a log of
  your update requests, in a format like this:</p>
  <pre>

   [DYNAMIC_UPDATE] id 804 from [205.216.163.199].1541 at 
                                  915837961 (named pid 84):
   zone:   origin dyn.test.com class IN serial 199817937
   update: {delete} ftp.dyn.test.com. IN 
   update: {add} ftp.dyn.test.com. 1800 IN A 10.0.0.1
</pre>

  <p>Lines 20-28 do some error-checking on the response. If the
  update fails because the nameserver is unavailable or some other
  network-related error occurred, <tt>$reply</tt> is undefined, and
  an error message is available in <tt>$res-&gt;errorstring</tt>.
  On the other hand, if the nameserver accepts the packet, it puts
  a cryptic shorthand message indicating the status of the request
  in <tt>$reply-&gt;header-&gt;rcode</tt>. For example, NOERROR
  means the update was accepted and performed. Some other common
  return codes are listed below.</p>
  <pre>
  Common Nameserver Return Codes


  <b>Return Code</b>    <b>Meaning </b>

  NOTAUTH       This nameserver is not authoritative for the zone 
                you requested. 


  REFUSED       The nameserver refused your request for security 
                reasons. (Your IP address is probably not listed in     
                named.conf.)

 
  NOTZONE       A name in the update packet does not exist in the 
                target zone. 
</pre>

  <p>At this point, your IP change has taken effect. Remember that
  due to the distributed nature of DNS, your change may not be
  instantly visible everywhere. Any client that previously looked
  up <tt>ftp.test.com</tt> will hang on to the old response until
  it expires, at which point it will request a new one.</p>

  <h3>Paths For Further Exploration</h3>

  <p>As I mentioned, the above script is merely an example, in that
  each IP address is active for only five minutes. Although
  round-robin is quite useful as a basic method of load balancing,
  what happens when <tt>ftp1</tt> crashes, or is taken down for
  routine maintenance? When you put it back up, it has zero users,
  but even though <tt>ftp2</tt> has many users, new connections are
  still assigned in a round-robin fashion. You need a way to
  intelligently know how many connections are active and reassign
  the IP address to the least-loaded machine. If you alter the
  <tt>while</tt> loop at the top of the example program to query
  each machine and determine its load, you can then intelligently
  decide whether to change the IP address to <tt>ftp1</tt>.</p>

  <p>As you've seen, the basics of dynamic update are easy to learn
  and implement. Using this framework you could write an
  application which queries several machines to find out which one
  is best able to service new requests, or monitor a pool of
  machines and take a crashed box out of rotation. Some other ideas
  include: having <tt>name.mydomain.com</tt> be your laptop no
  matter how it's connected, providing aliases for servers on a
  network with free resources say, (freedisk.domain.com,
  freecpu.domain.com, freeram.domain.com), or using mod_perl to
  configure Apache and the DNS server from one virtual host
  configuration file.</p>
