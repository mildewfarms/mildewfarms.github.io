  <h3>WHAT'S HAPPENING, DUDE</h3>

  <p>Have you ever wanted to learn the latest Perl techniques while
  watching caribou graze on the Alaskan shore? Heck, who hasn't?
  Our wishes can be reality. The <b>Perl Whirl</b> , an event
  combining all the best in Alaskan cruising with all the best in
  Perl training, is slated for May 29 --June 5, 2000. Check out
  <a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.geekcruises.com/</a> for
  details.</p>

  <p>The third annual <b>Perl Conference</b> from <b>O'Reilly</b>
  (now part of the <b>Open Source Convention</b>) has come and
  gone. There were whole bunches of good sessions, and O'Reilly has
  now posted the available materials online at <a href=
  "http://conferences.oreilly.com/cd/perl3/" target=
  "resource window">http://conferences.oreilly.com/cd/perl3/</a>.
  Conference guy Nathan Torkington is already hard at work
  organizing next year's offerings.</p>

  <p>Larry Wall (that guy who, you know, created Perl) enlightened
  and entertained with the Third State of the Onion speech, this
  time an exploration of chemistry and molecules and atoms and fun
  things that Wall did in a previous life as a chemistry student.
  It was another post-modern talk, moving in, around, and
  occasionally on top of a larger point about Perl. Read and view
  the presentation at <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/1999/08/onion/talk.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/1999/08/onion/talk.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Lots of awards were doled out at the conference. As usual,
  awards were presented to the best submitted papers and modules.
  Peter J. Braam, Michael Callahan, and Phil Schwan won for their
  paper on <b>The InterMezzo Filesystem</b>, a distributed
  filesystem written in Perl. Uri Guttman and Larry Rosler won for
  <b>A Fresh Look at Efficient Perl Sorting</b>, which discussed
  techniques of using packed records to do a single comparison
  rather than doing several comparisons as is common inthe
  map/sort/map technique. Gary Spivey won an award for <b>MEADE</b>
  (A Modular, Extensible, Adaptable Design Environment for ASIC and
  FPGA Development). In the special awards, Rocco Caputo won the
  Best Module award for his <b>POE</b> (which is basically an OS
  written in Perl), and Damian Conway (who won twice last year) won
  the Most Useful award for <b>Coy</b>, described in this
  issue.</p>

  <p>In the <b>Perl Bowl</b>, programmers were pitted against one
  another in head-to-head competition, while announcers conducted
  commentary and line-by-line analysis. Jason Kruger was
  victorious, winning a 400MHz Celeron machine from VA Linux
  Systems. The following day, Jon Orwant hosted the second annual
  <b>Perl Quiz Show</b>. <b>London Perl Mongers</b> Andy Wardley,
  Peter Haworth, Richard Clamp, and Nick Ing-Simmons won it
  all.</p>

  <p>Also given out were the <b>White Camel Awards</b>, a joint
  effort from O' Reilly and the <b>Perl Mongers</b>. Tom
  Christiansen was granted the Perl Advocacy Award for his
  contributions to Perl evangelism and documentation. Kevin Lenzo
  won the Perl Community Award for his work in starting up and
  running the first annual Yet Another Perl Conference (yapc), a
  low-cost conference for Perl users. Adam Turoff won the Perl User
  Group Award for his work in starting up and providing assistance
  to Perl Mongers. Each recipient was awarded an oversize check for
  $3000, which presumably was accompanied by a smaller check for
  $3000 that can be taken to a bank for exchange into legal
  tender.</p>

  <p>More groups have joined the Perl Monger fold in the last few
  months. In the USA, new groups include Columbia MO, Palo Alto CA,
  Salisbury MD, South Lake Tahoe CA, Sussex WI, Tacoma WA, Thousand
  Oaks CA, and Walnut Creek CA. In the rest of the world: Caracas
  (Venezuela), Cardiff (Wales), Chandigarh (India), Croydon (United
  Kingdom), Faro (Portugal), Franca (Brazil), Guimaraes (Portugal),
  Manila (Philippines), Oxford (United Kingdom), Peking (China),
  Reading (United Kingdom), S&atilde;o Paulo (Brazil), Seoul (South
  Korea), Taipei (Taiwan), Wellington (New Zealand).</p>

  <p>The transference of the services provided by the now-defunct
  <b>Perl Institute</b> to the ever-growing Perl Mongers is pretty
  much complete. Many of the services are hosted either on the new
  Perl Mongers advocacy site at <a href="http://www.perl.org/"
  target="resource window">http://www.perl.org/</a> or on other
  sites in the perl.org and cpan.org domains. The <b>perlbug</b>
  database is now on <a href="http://bugs.perl.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://bugs.perl.org/</a>, and the perl.org
  mailing lists (as well as ftp.perl.org and ftp.cpan.org) are
  being hosted by <b>ValueClick</b>. Graham Barr's <b>CPAN
  Testers</b> is now located at <a href="http://testers.cpan.org/"
  target="resource window">http://testers.cpan.org/</a>.</p>

  <p>At The Perl Conference, Barr unveiled the <b>CPAN</b> Search
  Site, a comprehensive site for searching the CPAN. Each module
  has its own page, containing links to all of the documentation,
  reports from CPAN testers, and more. Enjoy it at <a href=
  "http://search.cpan.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://search.cpan.org/</a>.</p>

  <p>Kurt Starsinic started <b>Perl Labs</b> at <a href=
  "http://labs.perl.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://labs.perl.org/</a>, a farm of computers
  to build Perl in various configurations.</p>

  <p>Perl Mongers, in conjunction with <b>CareerMosaic</b>, has a
  <b>Perl Mongers Career Center</b> at <a href=
  "http://jobs.perl.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://jobs.perl.org/</a>. One can post
  resumes, and job opportunities, and search the various
  offerings.</p>

  <p><b>Perl News</b> is now at <a href="http://www.news.perl.org/"
  target="resource window">http://www.news.perl.org/</a> and has
  some cool new features available, including better searching and
  an RSS file for including the Perl News headlines in other
  services.</p>

  <p>O' Reilly' s Perl site, <a href="http://www.perl.com" target=
  "resource window"><b>http://www.perl.com/</b></a>, has a new
  managing editor: TPJ columnist Mark-Jason Dominus. He will be
  handling much of the content on the site, and has started a new
  feature on the site: weekly summaries of <b>perl5-porters</b>,
  the mailing list for development of perl. The summaries are also
  sent by mail each week; subscribe by sending mail to <a href=
  "mailto:p5p-digest-subscribe@plover.com">p5p-digest-subscribe@plover.com</a>.</p>

  <p>The defunct Perl <b>packrats</b> list has been revived, for
  keeping track of various bits of interest related to Perl. The
  list began in 1993, but fizzled out in 1995. Send the message
  subscribe packrats your_email_address to <a href=
  "mailto:majordomo@history.perl.org">majordomo@history.perl.org</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Perl4Lib</b> (<a href="http://www.vims.edu/perl4lib/"
  target="resource window">http://www.vims.edu/perl4lib/</a>) is an
  unmoderated mailing list for librarians interested in Perl.</p>

  <p><b>Manning Publications</b>, publisher of Damian Conway's
  <b>Object Oriented Perl</b>, has released <b>Elements of
  Programming with Perl</b> by Andrew L. Johnson. The book
  introduces programming using Perl, and assumes no prior
  programming experience.</p>

  <p>Windows NT Workstation Configuration and Maintenance is a
  newly released O'Reilly title,covering automated management of NT
  workstations with Perl. Alligator Descartes and Tim Bunce are
  writing <b>Programming the Perl DBI</b> for O'Reilly; it should
  be available soon.</p>

  <p>Chip Salzenberg has been working on an experimental rewrite of
  Perl in C++, called <b>Topaz</b>. <a href="http://www.perl.com"
  target="resource window">www.perl.com</a> posted an interview
  with Salzenberg, as well as his Perl Conference talk about it
  (both in RealAudio and as an MP3).</p>

  <p>Okay, it isn't Perl for the Pilot, but it is something. Robert
  Spier has released the perl 5.00503 docs for the Palm Pilot, in
  two formats: TealDoc and Plain Palmdoc. See <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/R/RS/RSPIER/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/R/RS/RSPIER/</a>.</p>

  <p>Arved Sandstrom has written <b>MacSWIG</b> and an accompanying
  tutorial, which you can find at
  http://macperl.com/depts/Tutorials/. SWIG (Simplified Wrapper
  Interface Generator) is a tool to create interfaces from
  low-level languages to high-level ones. It is similar to Perl's
  XS (Sandstrom also has a tutorial for XS on the Mac posted in the
  same place), but is language independent, having been extended to
  Perl, Python, Tcl, Java, Eiffel, and Guile. Mac <b>SWIG</b>
  currently supports only the PowerPC architecture.</p>

  <h4><b>STUFF TO HORK OFF THE NET</b></h4>

  <p>As of this writing, the latest development release of Perl is
  5.005_62. Development of Perl 5.6 still continues, though the
  tentative schedule for its beta release has lapsed.</p>

  <p><b>ActiveState</b> presses on with releases of its software.
  <b>ActivePerl</b>, its release of Perl for Win32, is at build
  522; <b>PDK</b> (the Perl Development Kit) is at version 1.2.4;
  <b>PerlEx</b> (a Perl plugin for NT web servers) is at version
  1.1.6. All of this can be had at <a href=
  "http://www.activestate.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.activestate.com/</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Netscape::Bookmarks</b> by Kirrily 'Skud' Roberts processes
  and manipulates Netscape bookmark files.</p>

  <p>Based on HTTP::Daemon and LWP, <b>kirra-http-server</b>
  (<a href="http://kyla.kiruna.se/~goran/perl/" target=
  "resource window">http://kyla.kiruna.se/~goran/perl/</a>) uses
  Perl 5.005 threads and XML for configuration.</p>

  <p>Jon Peterson's <b>Apache::Archive</b> shows the contents of
  tar and tar.gz files to users, allowing them to select portions
  of the archive to view. <b>Apache::OWA</b> from Svante
  S&ouml;rmark runs scripts written using Oracle's PL/SQL Web
  Toolkit. Chad Hogan wrote <b>Apache::SetWWWTheme</b>, which
  generates themes for displayed pages, including sidebars and
  navigation bars. Stas Bekman wrote <b>Apache::VMonitor</b> to
  monitor server processes.</p>

  <p>Mark Summerfield wrote <b>CGI::QuickForm</b> for the quick
  creation and parsing of forms and form data.
  <b>CGI::EncryptForm</b> by Peter Marelas encrypts data that is
  passed back to an HTML form in a hidden field, for more secure
  transactions that need to maintain state. Sam Tregar's
  <b>HTML::Pager</b> creates a set of HTML pages for arbitrary
  data.</p>

  <p>Ken MacLeod's <b>libxml</b> is a distribution of various XML
  modules for use with XML::Grove, XML::DOM, and other packages.
  Chang Liu wrote <b>XML::Node</b>, a simplified interface to
  XML::Parser (the basis of all things XML). Jonathan Eisenzopf's
  <b>XML::RSS</b> creates RSS files, which can be used to
  distribute headlines and summaries on news sites (such as Perl
  News) for distribution on sites like <a href=
  "http://my.netscape.com" target=
  "resource window">my.netscape.com</a>.</p>

  <p>Russ Allbery has been hard at work on better POD utilities,
  and his <b>podlators</b> distribution includes converters for POD
  into various formats. <b>Pod::Tree</b> from Steven McDougall
  parses POD into a syntactic tree and can create HTML based on the
  tree.</p>

  <p>Robert Rothenberg wrote <b>RTF::Document</b> and
  <b>RTF::Group</b> for generating RTF (rich text format) files and
  manipulating RTF groups. Martin Hosken authored the
  <b>Text::PDF</b> distribution for creating and manipulating PDF
  files.</p>

  <p>The <b>GD</b> module, from Lincoln Stein, is an interface to
  Thomas Boutell's <b>gd</b> graphics library. Most GIF libraries
  rely on LZW compression, for which Unisys owns the patent.
  Because of <b>Unisys</b>. cracking down on what it considers to
  be infringements, the gd library no longer supports GIFs. Boutell
  replaced GIF support with a newer format called PNG. As such, the
  GD module has followed suit, and supports only PNG; and instead
  of <b>GIFgraph</b>, the <b>Chart::PNGgraph</b> module can be used
  for creating graphs with it.</p>

  <p>The GIF format is not dead yet, though. How else could you
  make cheap, easy, portable animations of men wearing hardhats for
  your Under Construction web site? Benjamin Low's
  <b>Image::ParseGIF</b> divides animated GIFs into individual
  frames.</p>

  <p>Edwin Pratomo wrote <b>Algorithm::Permute</b>, which permutes
  arrays. Chip Turner's <b>Math::GMP</b> is designed to be a
  drop-in replacement for Math::BigInt, relying on the GNU
  <b>gmp</b> library for greater speed.</p>

  <p>Jon Orwant has posted a pair of modules relating to his book,
  <b>Mastering Algorithms with Perl:</b>
  <b>Statistics::Table::F</b> for F-ratios, and
  <b>Statistics::Table::t</b> for t-tests. One of Orwant's
  co-authors, Jarkko Hietaniemi, released the Graph distribution,
  for performing various kinds of graph theoretic operations.</p>

  <p><b>B::Fathom</b> from Kurt Starsinic evaluates the readability
  of Perl code. <b>B::Size</b>, by Doug MacEachern, measures the
  size of Perl OPs and the building blocks of Perl's guts: SVs,
  AVs, and HVs.</p>

  <p>The <b>Conjury</b> system by James H. Woodyatt is a general
  purpose software construction framework, an alternative to the
  make utility.</p>

  <p>Michael Schwern's <b>Carp::Assert</b> provides assertions for
  Perl programs.</p>

  <p>The <b>Thesaurus</b> module, from David Rolsky, creates lists
  of related items. Mark Rogaski's <b>Tree::Ternary</b> implements
  ternary search trees, as described by Jon Bentley and Robert
  Sedgewick in the April 1998 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal.</p>

  <p>John Nolan's <b>Data::Walker</b> lets you navigate a data
  structure much as you'd walk through a directory structure.
  <b>Data::HexDum</b>p, by Fabien Tassin, creates hexadecimal dumps
  of data.</p>

  <p><b>DBIx::TextInde</b>x, by Daniel Koch, performs full-text
  searching in SQL databases.</p>

  <p>The <b>Units</b> package, from Robert Rothenberg, is a
  collection of modules for parsing strings with unit measurements
  (such as "12pt" or&nbsp;" 3 meters" ) and converting them to some
  other unit (such as picas or inches).</p>

  <p>John Porter's <b>Tie::HashDefaults</b> lets hash keys have
  default values; his <b>Tie::OffsetArray</b> ties one array to
  another with an offset index.</p>

  <p>Taisuke Yamada wrote <b>Tie::LDAP</b> for tying an LDAP
  (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) database to a hash.
  Yamuda's <b>Schedule::Match</b> module manages schedules with a
  structure similar to crontab's format, and has methods for
  detecting scheduling conflicts.</p>

  <p>Even though we know it is usually evil, sometimes bulk
  mailings are necessary and perfectly legal and ethical. Jim
  Thomason's <b>Mail::Bulkmail</b> is a fast and efficient tool for
  any bulk mailer folks wearing white hats.</p>

  <p><b>Net::AIM</b>, from Areyh Goldsmith, implements the AOL
  Instant Messenger TOC protocol, and <b>Net:xAP</b> from Kevin
  Johnson is a base class for the "Access Protocol" family of
  protocols, including a module for IMAP access.</p>

  <p><b>Mac::Glue</b> and <b>Mac::AppleEvents::Simple</b> have been
  updated to support the Mac OS 9 capability of sending Apple
  events over TCP/IP.</p>

  <p>Seth Johnson's <b>Audio::DSP</b> is an interface to the DSP
  audio device under Unix.</p>

  <p>Dan Urist's <b>Proc::ProcessTable</b> provides a consistent
  interface to the process table on Unix and Unix-like
  platforms.</p>

  <p><b>Tk::Month</b>, by Anthony Iano-Fletcher, provides a
  calendar widget for your graphical programs.</p>_ _END_ _
