  <p>In most programming tasks, we humans carefully state the
  problem, code an algorithm to solve the problem, and turn the
  computer loose to run the algorithm. Then we hope the correct
  solution pops out, and if it doesn't we send an irate bug report
  to the people who developed our programming language.</p>

  <p><i>Genetic algorithms</i> (GAs) offer a different approach; we
  still carefully state the problem, but we let the computer find a
  suitable algorithm and apply that algorithm to the problem to
  produce a solution. Generating algorithms programmatically
  usually means working with code as data, which has traditionally
  left it more in the realm of LISP and related languages. But Perl
  can also generate and evaluate code on the fly, so it is also
  capable of handling generalized GAs.</p>

  <p>The core principle behind a GA is that of evolution. You start
  with a set of random <i>organisms</i>, each of which is a
  program. You then run each of these programs and determine their
  <i>fitness</i>, which is the degree to which they succeed at the
  required task. Once the fitness of each is determined, you jump
  through some hoops to remove bad entries (natural selection),
  randomly permute some remaining entries (mutation), and
  intermingle other entries (hot algorithmic sex).</p>

  <p>After repeating this process through several generations, the
  population will begin to converge on a solution. Often, it is not
  quite the solution you were expecting, and therein lies lot of
  the fun in building a GA engine.</p>

  <h3>The Genetic Code</h3>The genetic code we will use to describe
  our organisms has many parallels to genetic code found in real
  plants and animals. It also has a huge number of divergences.
  Draw analogies at your own risk.

  <p>The GA task we'll set before ourselves is to find algebraic
  expressions that can generate a certain predetermined set of data
  points when applied to a given set of input data. We'll call
  these algebraic expressions our organisms, and we'll represent
  them as simple binary syntax trees composed of <i>functions</i>
  and <i>terminals</i>. Each function has two branches representing
  its arguments, and each argument can either be another function
  or a terminal. Terminals are dead-end leaf nodes and are usually
  constants or one of the input parameters in the problem. For
  instance, in an organism represented by the algorithm
  <tt>add(multiply(2,x),5)</tt>, we have the functions
  <tt>add()</tt> and <tt>multiply()</tt>, and the terminals 2, x,
  and 5.</p>

  <p>Each problem requires some twiddling by the Genetic Engineer.
  You need to determine a set of functions and terminals that will
  be part of your organisms' makeup. You might think of these as
  roughly equivalent to the various base pairs in DNA, or perhaps
  to various short sequences of base pairs. For the example we'll
  show here, we're trying to fit a function to the data:</p>
  <pre>
<font size=
"-1">-1407, -931, -577, -327, -163, -67, -21, -7, -7, -3, 23, 89, 213, 413, 707, 1113, 1649</font>
</pre>

  <p>...which just happens to be the output of 3x<sup>3</sup> +
  2x<sup>2</sup> &ndash; x &ndash; 7 applied to each integer on the
  interval [&ndash;8,8]. To hit this (and we'll assume that we have
  no idea what the solution should look like) we'll use a function
  set that includes:</p>
  <pre>
  sin(x,y)
  log(x,y)
  mul(x,y)
  add(x,y)
</pre>

  <p>Now we know that the real solution only needs the last two, so
  the first two are there just to confuse the GA. We picked
  <tt>sin(x,y)</tt> because some regions on the graph look like
  they might be sinusoidal. We picked <tt>log(x,y)</tt> just to
  drive up the computing time and make things interesting.</p>

  <p>We know that <tt>sin(x,y)</tt> and <tt>log(x,y)</tt> look odd,
  since <tt>sin()</tt> and <tt>log()</tt> only take one argument
  apiece. But by our definition, each function in our syntax tree
  has two branches. In the case of unary functions, we simply throw
  the second argument away, but it is valuable to keep it in the
  data structure, as a mutation may change a <tt>sin()</tt> to an
  <tt>add()</tt> and suddenly make the second argument interesting.
  As the second argument could be a whole tree of functions on its
  own, this could get very interesting indeed.</p>

  <p>So given these functions, we build an array of functions as
  strings. Remember we said that we needed code as data? Here it
  is, to be <tt>eval</tt>'ed later:</p>
  <pre>
  my @functions = (
  # Format is 'function &lt;pretty version&gt;: &lt;actual code&gt;'
  'function add($a,$b): ($a+$b)',
  'function mul($a,$b): ($a*$b)',
  'function sin($a,$b): sin($a)',
  'function log($a,$b): do{my $_a=$a; $_a ? log(abs($_a)) :  0}',
  );
</pre>

  <p>Notice that our <tt>log()</tt> function is protected from zero
  or negative values. Any function that has sensitive arguments
  needs to be appropriately protected from them as there will be no
  chance to trap the errors outside of the evaluation. In this
  case, we need to protect it in a rather obscure way from Perl's
  constant-folding optimizer - try running the one-liner <tt>0 ?
  log(abs(0)) : 0</tt> to see the problem.</p>

  <p>Next we need terminals. For this exercise we have two: x (the
  parameter that we will vary over the interval of interest, i.e.
  the input to these algebraic expressions) and a constant integer
  between -9 and 9. We specify these as subroutine references:</p>
  <pre>
  my @terminals = (
    sub { '$x' }, # The input parameter
    sub { '$x' },
    sub { int(rand(20) - 10) },  # Some random number
    sub { int(rand(20) - 10) },
                  );
</pre>

  <p>...which return either the name of the parameter ('x') or the
  random number. &hellip; Now, what does this code <i>look</i>
  like? Well, as we said, it's a syntax tree that looks something
  like so:</p>
  <pre>
digraph stree {
  mul  [ label = "mul()" ];
  add  [ label = "add()" ];
  sin  [ label = "sin()" ];
  mul2 [ label = "mul()" ];
  x1   [ label = "x" ];
  x2   [ label = "x" ];
  x3   [ label = "x" ];
  c1   [ label = "-5" ];
  c2   [ label = "7" ];

  mul -&gt; add;
  mul -&gt; mul2;
  mul2 -&gt; x1;
  mul2 -&gt; x3;
  add -&gt; sin;
  add -&gt; c1;
  sin -&gt; x2;
  sin -&gt; c2; }
</pre>

  <p>...which corresponds to
  <tt>mul(add(sin(x,7),&ndash;5),mul(x,x))</tt> which in turn
  reduces to <tt>(sin(x)&ndash;5)x<sup>2</sup></tt>, which is, of
  course, wrong. Let's hope evolution can help.</p>

  <h3>Assembling an Organism</h3>We'll represent each organism as a
  Perl object. If making little genetic organisms isn't a good
  opportunity to use object-oriented programming, we don't know
  what is.

  <p>Now, it's one thing to know what a bridge looks like, but
  designing and building a bridge is something else altogether. We
  think it's safe to say the same is true of organisms. We'll build
  ours recursively, with some sanity checks.</p>

  <p>First we check against a maximum depth value and plug in only
  terminals past this point. This keeps the tree from getting too
  crazy at the outset (it will get crazy enough later). If we are
  inside the maximum depth, we randomly select a function or
  terminal (with an arbitrary 2:1 weight towards terminals). If we
  selected a function, then we call the organism's
  <tt>_buildTree()</tt> method again to get two more nodes to use
  as input to the function. And so on.</p>
  <pre>
  sub _buildTree {
    my $self = shift;
    my $depth = shift || 0;
  
    my %tree;
    $tree{contents} = ($depth&gt;$maxdepth or int rand(3)) ?
                       &amp;{$terminals[rand @terminals]} :
                       $functions[rand @functions];

    if ($tree{contents} =~ /^function /) {
      $tree{'a'} = $self-&gt;_buildTree($depth + 1);
      $tree{'b'} = $self-&gt;_buildTree($depth + 1);
    }

    return \%tree;
  } 
</pre>

  <p>This builds for us a hash of nodes, each of which has three
  components: <tt>$tree{contents}</tt>, which contains either a
  terminal value (a constant or <tt>$x</tt> in this case) or a
  function; <tt>$tree{'a'}</tt> and <tt>$tree{'b'}</tt> are
  references to other nodes. If the content is a terminal, left and
  right pointers are not generated.</p>

  <h3>Survival of the Fittest</h3>Just generating random organisms
  is not enough. We need to rank them according to their fitness,
  so we can decide which to cull out. We also need to determine
  fitness so that we know when to stop: unlike real evolution, we
  are trying to hit a fixed target. Evolution, however, is a
  feedback mechanism, and is therefore designed to hit a moving
  target. This means that once we reach a perfect fit for the data,
  the algorithm will keep trying new things even though the current
  fit is perfect. This will result in the program oscillating
  around the correct answer, which doesn't help. If you are trying
  to find an algorithm to hit a moving target, you still need to
  know the fitness at each generation, though you will probably
  have to do some statistical work on your results in order to find
  the mean success rate over the changing target.

  <p>We calculate the fitness by averaging the difference between
  each fixed data point and the corresponding result of the
  organisms' function (its phenotype). Thus fitness is a
  non-negative number, and a fitness of zero indicates a perfect
  organism. To calculate the output of the syntax tree, we have a
  function called <tt>fitness()</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
  sub fitness {
      # Determine the fitness of an organism in this crazy world
  
      my ($org, @target) = @_;
      my $sumdiff = 0;
  
      foreach (0..$#target) {
         $sumdiff += abs($org-&gt;evaluate({'x'=&gt;$_}) - $target[$_]);
      }
      return $sumdiff/@target;
  } 
</pre>

  <p><tt>fitness()</tt> repeatedly calls the Organism's
  <tt>evaluate()</tt> method at points on the interval that
  interest us. Think of the <tt>evaluate()</tt> method as the
  Organism's whole reason for existence; if the Organism were a
  leech, the method would be called <tt>suck_blood()</tt>. If it
  were a gerbil, the method would be called <tt>freak_out()</tt>.
  The method simply applies the embedded behavior of the Organism
  to the given input data. In this case, we evaluate a
  single-variable algebraic expression for a given number.</p>

  <p>The <tt>evaluate()</tt> method is just a simple front-end
  which calls Perl's eval on the result of the Organism's
  <tt>expression()</tt> method.</p>
  <pre>
  sub evaluate {
      my $self = shift;
      my $params = shift;
  
      my $x = $params-&gt;{'x'};
      return eval $self-&gt;expression;
  }

  sub expression {  # Turn the syntax tree into a Perl expression
      my $self = shift;
      my $tree = shift || $self-&gt;{tree};
  
      # Check the cache
      return $self-&gt;{expr} if defined $self-&gt;{expr};
  
      local $_ = $tree-&gt;{contents}; # A shortcut for the current node
  
      if ( s/^function [^:]*: (.*)/$1/ ) { # Extract the Perl expression
           s/\$([a-zA-Z]+)/$self-&gt;expression($tree-&gt;{$1})/ge;
    }
  
    $self-&gt;{expr} = $_ if $tree eq $self-&gt;{tree}; # A nasty trick
    return $_;
  } 
</pre>

  <p>Since <tt>expression</tt> works on a recursive data structure,
  it's natural that it's a recursive subroutine. If the current
  node represents a function, we scan the function description and
  pull out the Perl expression that implements that function. Then
  we replace any embedded variables (<tt>$a</tt> or <tt>$b</tt>)
  with the Perl expression their syntax tree represents. If the
  current node is a terminal, we leave it alone. Note that we have
  to go to a little bit of trouble to avoid touching the
  <tt>$_a</tt> variable in the logarithm function.</p>

  <p>We happen to particularly like the way the
  <tt>expression()</tt> method combines its recursion and caching
  techniques. Building the Perl code from the syntax tree is a
  pretty intensive process, and we don't want to do it over and
  over again for the same Organism, so we cache our results. We
  only want to put the result in the cache when we're done with the
  work; that is, when we exist from the topmost call to this
  recursive subroutine. We detect whether that's the case by
  comparing the node we're currently working on to the topmost node
  in <tt>$self</tt>'s tree. If they're the same, we cache and
  finish. The trick is to compare these two references as strings.
  When a reference is used in a string context, it contains a
  representation of the reference's memory address, so if the two
  references evaluate to the same string, they're the same
  reference. Sneaky. Most of the time this type of caching requires
  a wrapper function to handle the caching, and a recursive
  function to do the real work.</p>

  <p>So now that we know how to evaluate the success or failure of
  each Organism, we need to do something about it.</p>

  <h3>Sex and Mutation</h3>It won't be enough to just throw out the
  bottom half of the list and generate a new set of random
  organisms from scratch. This would be akin to trying to make a
  watch from a bucket of parts by shaking the bucket until a watch
  spontaneously assembles. Evolution doesn't work that way, and we
  don't have enough time to wait for pure randomness to cough up
  the algebra we want.

  <p>So what we do is rank the organisms by fitness and perform
  three operations on the list:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>1. Cull some bad organisms from the bottom of the
    list.</li>

    <li>2. Mutate some percentage of the remainder by randomly
    changing a node on the syntax tree.</li>

    <li>3. Mate some individuals with some others to produce
    offspring with similar attributes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Culling is simple: we just unshift the same number of
  organisms that we are going to add by mating. In the case of our
  example, we have set the parameter <tt>$mates</tt> to 5, so we
  remove that many individuals. In point of fact what we actually
  do is mate and pop five times. Same thing.</p>

  <p>Mutating is also pretty straightforward: we grab an organism
  at random and mutate it with its <tt>mutate()</tt> method:</p>
  <pre>
sub mutate {
  my $self = shift;

  my @index = $self-&gt;_treeIndex;
  %{$index[rand @index]} = %{$self-&gt;_buildTree($maxdepth-1)};
  $self-&gt;clear_cache;
} 
</pre>

  <p>This is a little deceptive. What it does is generate a list of
  the nodes in the syntax tree with <tt>_treeIndex()</tt>, and then
  pick a random one and substitute a new randomized branch. This
  mutation mechanism is pretty drastic, so we don't do it often.
  The likelihood of improving an organism is very small, though it
  is important to keep some random element of change happening
  within the population to keep it from settling at some local
  maximum that fits the function well, but not as well as we
  want.</p>

  <p>The <tt>clear_cache()</tt> method simply clears the cached
  information we built in the <tt>expression()</tt> method, since
  it's no longer valid. The index generator looks like so:</p>
  <pre>
sub _treeIndex {
  # Generates a list of all the nodes in this tree. These are
  # references to the stuff in the object itself, so changes to the
  # elements of this list will change the object.
  
  my $self = shift;
  my $tree = shift || $self-&gt;{tree};
  my @sofar = @_;
  
  # Dump the content nodes into a list
  
  if ($tree-&gt;{contents} =~ /^function /) {
    return(@sofar,
        $tree,
        $self-&gt;_treeIndex($tree-&gt;{'a'}, @sofar),
        $self-&gt;_treeIndex($tree-&gt;{'b'}, @sofar)
       );
} else {
    return(@sofar, $tree);
  }
} 
</pre>

  <p>And naturally it is recursive as well. Maybe this article
  should have been about recursion instead, but we were confident
  that you already knew all about recursion.</p>

  <p>Finally, we take the top <i>n</i> organisms and mate them with
  a random other organism from the list. Each mating involves
  taking a tree index of each partner, selecting a random point in
  each, and grafting the end of one list on to the beginning of the
  other. This is known as a crossover permutation, which is similar
  to the genetic scrambling that occurs in sexual reproduction.</p>

  <p>The mate() method also uses _treeIndex():</p>
  <pre>
sub mate {
  my ($self, $partner) = @_;
  my $self_clone = dclone $self;
  
  # Get part of a node from $partner and stick it
  # somewhere in $self_clone
  my @clone_index = $self_clone-&gt;_treeIndex;
  my @partner_index = $partner-&gt;_treeIndex;
  
  %{ $clone_index[rand @clone_index] } = 
  %{ dclone $partner_index[rand @partner_index] };
  
  $self_clone-&gt;clear_cache;
  return $self_clone;
} 
</pre>

  <p>This is not so different from the mutation, except that we
  know that each half of the new tree previously belonged to some
  relatively successful individual, so the chances are higher that
  the result will also be fit than if we did a random mutation.
  Note that we use <tt>dclone()</tt> from the <tt>Storable</tt>
  module to create deep copies of complex structures rather than
  write our own cloning routine. This is because we are lazy.</p>

  <h3>The Terrifying Results</h3>When all of this is plugged into a
  framework that iterates over generations, tests results, and
  dumps the results on screen, we discover that there is an awful
  lot of incomprehensible output. This output needs to be examined
  by hand to determine what's going on, although I'm sure that
  someone out there is willing to donate routines to assist in the
  analysis. One run we did for 1000 generations came up with the
  following results.

  <p>By generation 50 the GA had stumbled on a 12 node equation
  that simplified to 3x<sup>3</sup>, which gave it a mighty good
  fit over the complete interval, though this is deceptive as the
  method we use for testing fitness is inordinately happy with
  fitting the ends where the numbers are huge. A better fitness
  test would weight the targets evenly so that the fit in the
  middle would be better. Still, this gave us a substantially
  complete fit and showed that the GA could establish the order of
  the target polynomial very rapidly.</p>

  <p>By generation 200 the GA had found the second term - the
  results reduced to 3x<sup>3</sup> + 2x<sup>2</sup>. Again, given
  the fitness calculation it seemed unlikely that it would discover
  any further refinements of interest as the 'value' of such
  refinements was so small. This outlines the importance of
  selecting a fitness function that reflects your needs! Our
  fitness function basically said that we are interested primarily
  in matching the broad strokes of the curve without regard for the
  details, which is what we got.</p>

  <p>By termination the GA had started fiddling with sines and
  natural logs in order to better fit the middle region of the
  graph. This dead end caused it to actually diverge from the real
  curve outside of the tested interval, while improving the fit
  inside - while it better met our stated criteria, it was actually
  taking us further afield. Again, it shows how important it is to
  tell computers what you want rather than make them guess.</p>

  <p>Overall, the convergence to our stated criteria was very rapid
  and effective, as we had very solid fitness levels and the order
  of the polynomial correctly established by generation 50.</p>

  <h3>Other Applications</h3>This GA engine could easily be
  extended to do different work. Simply fitting functions to data
  is cute, but by altering the function set, the terminal set, and
  the evaluation process, the GA can be used to generate behavioral
  algorithms for robots, control system solutions, and so on. Not
  that it's going to be easy: your evaluation routines will become
  very complex for non-mathematical projects, but it's still
  feasible. Examples from Koza's <i>Genetic Programming</i>
  include:

  <ul>
    <li>Emulate food foraging behavior in ants</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The terminal set is <tt>MoveRandomly</tt>,
  <tt>MoveToNest</tt>, <tt>PickUp</tt>, and
  <tt>DropPheromone</tt>.</p>

  <p>The function set contains custom routines
  <tt>IfFoodHere()</tt>, <tt>IfCarryingFood()</tt>,
  <tt>MoveToAdjacentFoodElse()</tt>,
  <tt>MoveToAdjacentPheromoneElse()</tt>, and <tt>Progn</tt> (which
  executes a list of instructions - we think we can just drop it
  and <tt>eval</tt> everything, but we haven't tried. You tell
  us.)</p>

  <p>It's not instantly clear how to do this, but it should be
  possible. We look forward to hearing the results of your own
  experiments on the Perl-AI mailing list!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Find the Fourier Series for a given periodic function</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The terminal set is just a constant from -10.000 to
  10.000.</p>

  <p>The function set contains <tt>XSIN()</tt>, <tt>XCOS()</tt>, +,
  -, *, and %. XSIN and XCOS are two-argument functions taking the
  coefficient and the harmonic (truncated to an integer).</p>

  <p>There are plenty more, including ones that develop neural nets
  and other sophisticated decision-making or controlling
  algorithms. We recommend you pick up Koza's book to investigate
  further.</p>

  <h3>Going Further</h3>As research in genetic programming has
  advanced, some new mechanisms have been considered. One of the
  more interetsing ones is 'islanding'. This involves running more
  than one population in isolation from each other, and
  occasionally migrating some small number of the fittest
  individuals from one 'island' to another.

  <p>When you first run your GA, you will probably notice that the
  speed of convergence and the quality of the result depends quite
  heavily on the initial set of organisms and the nature of the
  first few mutations and matings. This is probably a flaw in our
  engine somewhere, but if it is fundamental to GAs, then islanding
  provides a way to occasionally introduce 'ideas' to each system
  that are both good and novel. In theory this should increase the
  fitness of each population.</p>

  <p>You have probably also noticed that we have built the GA so
  that it can be distributed - because the algebraic expressions
  are implemented as strings to be evaluated rather than as
  references to subroutines, expensive runs can be designed so that
  the organisms are serialized and shipped to sepearate processors
  for the fitness runs. We haven't done this yet, so we're looking
  forward to either your results or your donations of hardware to
  facilitate the project. A farm of Sparcs would be fine.</p>

  <h3>Other Fitness Functions</h3>For the purposes of this article,
  we thought it best to use a relatively na&iuml;ve fitness
  calculation (just add the error at all the data points), rather
  than spend time talking about how to come up with a better
  function. If you experiment with various other methods for
  calculating the fitness, you may achieve better results or faster
  convergence. Let us know how it works out!
