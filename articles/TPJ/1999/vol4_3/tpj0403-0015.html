  <h4><i>Craig McElwee</i></h4>

  <p>The thing about magicians is that they do some rather amazing
  things and make it look easy. You know it's not really magic, but
  without a key secret or two, there is simply no way you can
  manage the same feat. The same can be said for putting together a
  little SQL-based web application on Windows; seeing the pros do
  it in a few paragraphs of documentation makes it look easy, then
  you try it yourself and it's no-go. Where to turn?</p>

  <p>This is what I faced some months ago. I considered myself a
  competent Perl programmer who simply hadn't yet had the need for
  a SQL (Structured Query Language) database. I knew I'd eventually
  need one, but I'd survived with tied hashes and CSV files until
  then.</p>

  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td align="center" bgcolor="#CCCC99"><b>CSV files</b></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is simply a text file
        with lines containing data separated by commas, like this:
        'Johannes,Smythe,505 Oyster Street,555-5555'. This is a
        good method of saving data in "flat file" (that is, plain
        old text file) databases, since each line is a record which
        can be read by a Perl script, and the data extracted by
        splitting on the commas. Assuming the above line is in a
        file called addresses.txt, you could do something like
        this:
        <pre>
open(IN, "&lt;addresses.txt");
while($line = &lt;IN&gt;) {
  ($first, $last, $address, $phone) = split /,/, $line;
  mangle data to heart's content...
}
</pre>

        <p>If there are already commas in your data, this won't
        work; you'll have to use a different delimiter, such as the
        pipe symbol ("|"). There is even a DBI::DBD for CSV files,
        so you could start writing scripts with DBI now, and when
        your needs require a "real" database, migrating the scripts
        will be as easy as changing one line in your program.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The turning point came after I had put together a small web
  application at work: a customer address book with search
  capabilities. I had combined several databases of customer info
  into one CSV file, (they were pipes, not commas, but no one seems
  comfortable with my calling it a PSV file), one record per
  line.</p>

  <p>The application consisted of three HTML pages. One was a
  frameset, one was a "Welcome to this app" page, and the last was
  a menu bar with several buttons to call CGI scripts which
  generated the content pages. One of the buttons, LIST ALL, called
  a CGI script which read through the CSV file one line at a time,
  pulling out each customer name and putting it into an array to be
  sorted. The user could then click on a customer name and be shown
  that customer's full contact information, formatted to resemble a
  rolodex card.</p>

  <p>There was also a text box with a search button activating a
  CGI script, which displayed the rolodex cards matching the search
  keyword. On each card was a MODIFY button, which redisplayed the
  rolodex card with each field in a text box so it could be edited
  and saved. Finally, there was a NEW button to add a new customer.
  Yes, it was a very sophisticated web application, now known as
  SupportNet (no patents pending).</p>

  <p>My manager called me in one day and, as he was wont to do,
  discussed a few features he wanted my application to have. He
  wanted to add "a few more" functions to each card to help our
  support people be more productive. Click a button and an email
  window would pop open with the customer's email address already
  in the TO field. Click a different button and Microsoft Word
  would open up with a partially written letter. Click a button and
  a composition window would pop up to let you make notes about the
  customer's problem. A button which would autodial the phone. Oh,
  and each and every above action should be journaled, one journal
  per Rolodex card, with the action, date, time, and who did what.
  And the journals would have to be searchable, able to be sorted
  on different values, and each item listed would be hyperlinked to
  the actual item for perusal. I was given the standard in-house
  development budget: $0 and a gig of disk space on an NT server.
  He asked how long it would take; I said I'd get back to him and
  left to sketch out the design.</p>

  <p>I figured most of these tasks wouldn't be difficult at all.
  Cookies would keep track of what each support person did. Email
  and note composition would be a new browser window with an
  appropriately formatted form. I was pretty sure I had read
  something about using Perl and OLE to manipulate Word and dial
  phones. The stumbling blocks I saw were intertwined: how to
  construct the journals, and that CSV file.</p>

  <p>There were several schemes to keep all the client files
  centrally located and keep track of who they belonged to. Most of
  these seemed like workarounds to cope with the CSV file, which
  also had inherent problems with record locking since the file had
  to be manipulated by multiple users simultaneously. It quickly
  became obvious that I should let a proper database do the work;
  the CSV file had to go.</p>

  <p>Let me qualify "proper." I had to use Microsoft Access -
  that's what was already installed and all my budget would allow.
  Before I added any new features I wanted to convert the CSV file
  to Access and prove it still worked. Essentially my conversion
  task list looked like this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Put data into database: Convert PSV file to Access.</li>

    <li>Get data out of database: Modify scripts to connect to
    database and then use SQL <tt>SELECT</tt> statements instead of
    <tt>while(&lt;INFILE&gt;)</tt> to retrieve data. So, on with it
    already!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I would have to create a new database, but I had already
  discovered that CSV files - even my pipe-delimited ones - could
  be imported into Access with little difficulty. Open Access,
  select <tt>File/New Database...</tt> and from the resulting
  window, select <tt>Blank Database</tt> and click <tt>OK</tt>.
  After choosing a location for the database, feed it: <tt>Select
  File/Get External Data/Import...</tt> First change the select box
  labeled <tt>Files of type</tt> to <tt>Text Files</tt>. (If you
  only have <tt>Microsoft Access</tt> and <tt>ODBC Databases</tt>
  available as choices, then follow the message below (<tt>Not all
  file types are installed by default...</tt>) and run Office Setup
  to add all the data access options, which makes <tt>Text
  Files</tt> available. This is painless and takes less than 60
  seconds to do.)</p>

  <p>Now just change to the directory where your CSV file is and
  double-click it. You should be presented with an <tt>Import Text
  Wizard</tt> window, in the middle of which are the first several
  lines of your CSV file. If <tt>Fixed Width</tt> is selected (the
  default), click on the <tt>Delimited</tt> radio button and click
  <tt>Next</tt>. In <tt>Choose the delimiter...</tt> click
  <tt>Other</tt> and fill in your delimiter. If your delimiter is a
  tab, semicolon, comma, or space, then by all means click that
  radio button. The first few lines of your CSV file should now be
  displayed with lines separating the data. Each column represents
  a field, and each row a record, in your database table. You are
  almost there - click <tt>Next</tt>.</p>

  <p>Your next choice is to import this data as a new or existing
  table. This is rather self-evident, but if you are not sure,
  choose <tt>New</tt> and click <tt>Next</tt>. Now you give names
  to all the fields; click in a column to highlight it, and fill in
  a field name at the top. Anything will do, but let me recommend
  keeping field names short and without spaces - this will save
  headaches later when you are debugging Perl scripts with SQL
  statements inside. When you are done, click <tt>Next</tt> and on
  the next screen, let Access add a Primary Key field and click
  <tt>Next</tt> again. Enter a name for your table, and click
  <tt>Finish</tt>. You can quit now or double-click on the table
  icon to see a spreadsheet view of your database table. You can
  add, delete, or edit data as you will. When you are done, save
  your database and close Access.</p>

  <p>Back to Perl: for getting the data out, I had read about DBI
  (the Database Interface) in TPJ. It had an ODBC database driver,
  and Access was ODBC compliant (or so I hoped, since Microsoft
  developed ODBC and it stands for Open DataBase Connectivity). I
  figured the script conversion from flat-file to SQL would be a
  piece of cake: just toss in a few Perl modules and add a few
  lines of code and presto: I look like a genius.</p>

  <p>So I started looking closely at the articles and
  documentation. I managed to install DBI and DBD::ODBC without
  incident - I recommend Steve Lidie's article in <a href=
  "../vol3_4/ewtoc.html" target="resource window">TPJ #12</a> for
  details. So far so good. In my head, my test script went like
  this: open a connection to the database, for every record in the
  table print the record, close the database. So I started to write
  it.</p>

  <p>I had a lot of documentation at hand, the Camel, Panther, and
  Ram books, Perl Journals with DBI articles, and PODs and other
  myriad information from the Internet. And do you know what? While
  being chock full of useful information, most of these sources all
  made the same assumptions. Specifically, people tended to say
  things like "enter the connection string" and "DSN" assuming I
  knew what these were. I didn't.</p>

  <p>Eventually I realized that I needed an Access ODBC driver
  installed - I couldn't believe it wasn't automatically installed
  in the standard Microsoft "ActiveBloat" installation methodology.
  After the standard exploration through the nether regions of
  Microsoft's site, I found the download: <a href=
  "http://www.microsoft.com/data/download/mdacfull.exe" target=
  "resource window">http://www.microsoft.com/data/download/mdacfull.exe</a>.
  Yes, there is other stuff in this installation, but there seems
  to be no way to get just the ODBC driver without a bunch of
  unneeded stuff.</p>

  <p>Once I had it, installation was a snap. If you are following
  along, the procedure is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Double-click on mdacfull.exe (Forgot where you downloaded
    it? Type <nobr><tt>dir /s \mdacfull.exe</tt></nobr> at a DOS
    prompt).</li>

    <li>Click <tt>Yes</tt> to accept Microsoft's license
    statement.</li>

    <li>Click <tt>Continue</tt> to go forward with the
    installation.</li>

    <li>At this point Setup looks for installed components and asks
    whether you want a Complete or Custom installation. Complete is
    fine, automatically installing everything. If you would prefer
    a more discriminating install, choose Custom. To do what's
    mentioned in this article you only need three components: ODBC,
    OLE DB, and the ODBC driver for Microsoft Access. You can save
    yourself about 2 megabytes of disk space by unchecking the
    other components.</li>

    <li><tt>Setup</tt> checks for sufficient disk space, copies
    files to your system, and presents a dialog box informing you
    that setup was completed successfully. Click <tt>OK</tt> and
    you're done.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Still my simple test script didn't work:</p>
  <pre>
  'Database connection not made: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] 
  Data source name not found and no default driver specified 
  (SQL-IM002)(DBD: db_login/SQLConnect err=-1) at test.pl line 14.'
</pre>

  "images/sql1_sm.gif" align="center" alt="Figure 1" border="0"
  width="250" height="203"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1</b></font></p>

  <p>Errors like this abounded. Luckily, I happened to decide that
  I didn't like the editor I was using and downloaded and installed
  a different one from the net. When I went to the control panel to
  remove the old one. And there I saw the 32bit ODBC applet, which
  I opened (<a href="images/sql1.gif">Figure 1</a>), and which had
  tabs saying <tt>User DSN</tt>, <tt>System DSN</tt>, and <tt>File
  DSN</tt>. Jackpot! (DSN stands for Data Source Name, and is akin
  to using a filehandle in your scripts to reference a file. Just
  think of it as a database handle.)</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/sql2.gif"><img src=
  "images/sql2_sm.gif" align="center" alt="Figure 2" border="0"
  width="250" height="164"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2</b></font></p>

  <p>You want to use System DSN since it allows access to your
  database by other users and system services. Click the
  <tt>Add...</tt> button, select <tt>Microsoft Access Driver</tt>
  (<tt>*.mdb</tt>) from the displayed list, and click
  <tt>Finish</tt>. The "ODBC Microsoft Access 97 Setup" screen will
  be displayed (<a href="images/sql2.gif">Figure 2</a>). For DSN,
  put in anything you like, but keep it short and sweet since you
  will use this in every script. Fill in the <tt>Description</tt>
  field if you like. In the <tt>Database</tt> section, click
  <tt>Select...</tt> and use the Explorer-like interface to find
  and select your database file. Then click <tt>OK</tt>. If you
  would like to add a username and password, click
  <tt>Advanced...</tt> and enter it in the appropriate fields
  (<a href="images/sql3.gif">Figure 3</a>). Now click <tt>OK</tt>
  and you should see your database listed under the System DSN tab
  (<a href="images/sql4.gif">Figure 4</a>). Click <tt>OK</tt> to
  continue.</p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 4</b></font></p>

  <p>That mystery solved, it only took a minute to get a valid
  connection string, and presto - database output. The test script
  was simply this:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# test.pl  - test connection to Access database
&#13;<b>use DBI;</b>
&#13;$dsn  = 'TPJ';        # Configure $dsn, $user, and $pass in...
$user = 'perl';       # ...Control Panel/32bit ODBC
$pass = 'lerp';      
$dbd  = 'ODBC';       # A must if using ODBC.
&#13;# Connect to the database
$dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($dsn, $user, $pass, $dbd, {RaiseError =&gt; 1})
    or die "Database connection not made: $DBI::errstr";
&#13;# Prepare the statement for execution
# The table in the CSV file was named "Rolodex"
$stmt = $dbh-&gt;prepare(" SELECT * FROM Rolodex " );   
&#13;# Check if statement prepared correctly
die "ERROR: Cannot prepare statement: $DBI::errstr\n" 
unless                                    (defined $stmt);
&#13;# Execute the statement at the database level
$stmt-&gt;execute;
&#13;# Print out first 5 records, each field on a line
for (1..5) {
    @record = $stmt-&gt;fetchrow();
    print "\n\n\nRECORD:\n";
    foreach $field (@record) {
	   print "$field\n";
    }
}
&#13;# Clean up and go home
$stmt-&gt;finish;        # Release the statement handle resources
$dbh-&gt;disconnect;     # Close database handle
</pre>

  <p>When I incorporated the above into a CGI script complete with
  HTML statements, it became the LIST ALL script available on the
  TPJ web site:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
# Lists all practices
&#13;<b>use DBI;</b>
&#13;$dsn  = 'SupportNet';    # Configure $dsn, $user, and $pass
$user = 'perl';         # in Control Panel/32bit ODBC
$pass = 'lerp';
$dbd  = 'ODBC';         # A must if using ODBC.
&#13;##==========================###=========================##
&#13;# This is just a bunch of HTML to start the document
print &lt;&lt;END;
Content-type: text/html\n\n
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;SupportNet&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script language="javascript"&gt;
&lt;!-- hide code from browsers that dislike embedded scripts
    function display(x) {
        document.forms[0].elements[0].value = x;
        document.forms[0].submit();
    }
// --&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body  background="../img/backgrnd.gif"&gt;
    &lt;a href="../SupportNet/home.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Client List&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;form action="/cgi-bin/rolodex" method="POST" target="main"

<b>END</b>
&#13;# Connect to the database
$dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($dsn, $user, $pass, $dbd, 
                    {RaiseError =&gt; 1, AutoCommit =&gt; 0 })
  || print "&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Database connection not made: $DBI::errstr&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;";
&#13;# Prepare the statement for execution
$stmt = $dbh-&gt;prepare( "SELECT ID, practice FROM Rolodex" );
&#13;if ( !defined $stmt ) {
    print "&lt;b&gt;ERROR: Cannot prepare statement: $DBI::errstr\n&lt;/b&gt;";
}
&#13;$stmt-&gt;execute;     # Execute the statement at the database level
&#13;# Build hash from the extracted data
while (( $id, $prac ) = $stmt-&gt;fetchrow()) {  
    $practices{$prac} = $id;                  #  PracticeName = DB_ID#
}
&#13;$stmt-&gt;finish;      # Release the statement handle resources
&#13;# This "foreach" line can be read backwards as:
# 'Take the keys from the hash %practices, sort them, 
#  then process them one-by-one'
&#13;foreach $pract (sort keys %practices) {
    next if $pract =~ /^$/;                # Skip blanks
    print "&lt;a href='javascript:display(\"$practices{$pract}\")'
onMouseOver=\"window.status=\'ROLODEX this\';return true\"&gt;$pract&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;\n";
}
&#13;print "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;";           # Print HTML footers
print "&lt;/center&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;";
print "&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;";
&#13;$dbh-&gt;disconnect;                    # Close database handle
</pre>

  <p>The HTML snippet to call this script looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;form action="/cgi-bin/listall.pl" method="post"&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" value="List All"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Armed with this knowledge, converting my little CSV-based web
  application to a SQL-based one became the rather trivial task it
  was supposed to be. Here's to your first attempt being just as
  easy - just don't tell people how little time it took, and accept
  the compliments graciously.</p>
