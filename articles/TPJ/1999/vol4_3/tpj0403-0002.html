  <h3>What is Precedence?</h3>What's 2+3x4?

  <p>You probably learned about this in grade school; it was
  fourth-grade material in the New York City public school I
  attended. If not, that's okay too; I'll explain everything.</p>

  <p>It's well-known that 2+3x4 is 14, because you are supposed to
  do the multiplication before the addition. 3x4 is 12, and then
  you add the 2 and get 14. What you do <i>not</i> do is perform
  the operations in left-to-right order; if you did that you would
  add 2 and 3 to get 5, then multiply by 4 and get 20.</p>

  <p>This is just a convention about what an expression like 2+3x4
  means. It's not an important mathematical fact; it's just a rule
  we set down about how to interpret certain ambiguous artihmetic
  expressions. It could have gone the other way, or we could have
  the rule that the operations are always done left-to-right. But
  we don't have those rules; we have the rule that says that you do
  the multiplication first and then the addition. We say that
  multiplication <i>takes precedence over</i> addition.</p>

  <p>What if you really do want to say 'add 2 and 3, and multiply
  the result by 4'? Then you use parentheses, like this: (2+3)x4.
  The rule about parentheses is that expressions in parentheses
  must always be fully evaluated before anything else.</p>

  <p>If we always used the parentheses, we wouldn't need rules
  about precedence. There wouldn't be any ambiguous expressions. We
  have precedence rules because we're lazy and we like to leave out
  the parentheses when we can. The fully-parenthesized form is
  always unambiguous. The precedence rule tells us how to interpret
  a version with fewer parentheses to decide what it would look
  like if we wrote the equivalent fully-parenthesized version. In
  the example above:</p>

  <p>a. 2+(3x4) b. (2+3)x4</p>

  <p>Is 2+3x4 like (a) or like (b)?</p>

  <p>The precedence rule just tells us that it is like (a).</p>

  <h3>Rules and More Rules</h3>In grade school you probably learned
  a few more rules:
  <pre>
    4 x 5<sup>2</sup>
</pre>

  <p>Which of these interpretations is correct?</p>
  <pre>
    (4 x 5)<sup>2</sup>  = 400 or 4 x (5)<sup>2</sup> = 100
</pre>

  <p>The rule is that exponentiation takes precedence over
  multiplication, so it's 100, and not 400.</p>

  <p>What about 8 &ndash; 3 + 4? Is this like (8 &ndash; 3) + 4 = 9
  or 8 &ndash; (3 + 4) = 1? Here the rule is a little different.
  Neither + nor &ndash; has precedence over the other. Instead, the
  &ndash; and + are just done left-to-right. This rule handles the
  case of 8 &ndash; 4 &ndash; 3 also. Is it (8 &ndash; 4) &ndash; 3
  = 1 or is it 8 &ndash; (4 &ndash; 3) = 7? Subtractions are done
  left-to-right, so it's 1 and not 7. A similar left-to-right rule
  handles ties between x and /.</p>

  <p>Our rules are getting complicated now:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Exponentiation first</li>

    <li>Then multiplication and division, left to right</li>

    <li>Then addition and subtraction, left to right</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Maybe we can leave out the 'left-to-right' part and just say
  that all ties will be broken left-to right? No, because for
  exponentiation that isn't true.</p>
  <pre>
     2<sup>2</sup>3
</pre>

  <p>means</p>
  <pre>
    2(<sup>2</sup>3) = 256,    not   (2<sup>2</sup>)<sup>3</sup>  = 64.
</pre>

  <p>So exponentiations are resolved from upper-right to
  lower-left. Perl uses the token ** to represent exponentiation,
  writing x**y instead of x<sup>y</sup>. In this case x**y**z means
  x**(y**z), not (x**y)**z, so ** is resolved right-to-left.</p>

  <p>Programming languages have this same notational problem,
  except that they have it even worse than mathematics does, partly
  because they have so many different operator symbols. For
  example, Perl has at least seventy different operator symbols.
  This is a problem, because communication with the compiler and
  with other programmers must be unambiguous. You don't want to be
  writing something like 2+3x4 and have Perl compute 20 when you
  wanted 14, or vice versa.</p>

  <p>Nobody knows a really good solution to this problem, and
  different languages solve it in different ways. For example, the
  language APL, which has a whole lot of unfamiliar operators like
  <i>p</i> and <img src="images/triangle-slash.gif" border="0" alt=
  "" align="top">, dispenses with precedence entirely and resolves
  them all from right to left. The advantage of this is that you
  don't have to remember any rules, and the disadvantage is that
  many expressions are confusing: If you write 2x3+4, you get 14,
  not 10. In Lisp the issue never comes up, because in Lisp the
  parentheses are required, and so there are no ambiguous
  expressions. (Now you know why Lisp looks the way it does.)</p>

  <p>Perl, with its seventy operators, has to solve this problem
  somehow. The strategy Perl takes (and most other programming
  languages as well) is to take the fourth-grade system and extend
  it to deal with the new operators. The operators are divided into
  many 'precedence levels', and certain operations, like
  multiplication, have higher precedence than other operations,
  like addition. The levels are essentially arbitrary, and are
  chosen without any deep plan, but with the hope that you will be
  able to omit most of the parentheses most of the time and still
  get what you want. So, for example, Perl gives * a higher
  precedence than +, and ** a higher precedence than *, just like
  in grade school.</p>

  <h3>An Explosion of Rules</h3>Let's see some examples of the
  reasons for which the precedence levels are set the way they are.
  Suppose you wrote something like this:
  <pre>
    $v = $x + 3;
</pre>

  <p>This is actually ambiguous. It might mean</p>
  <pre>
    ($v = $x) + 3;
</pre>

  <p>or it might mean</p>
  <pre>
    $v = ($x + 3);
</pre>

  <p>The first of these is silly, because it stores the value
  <tt>$x</tt> into <tt>$v</tt>, and then computes the value of
  <tt>$x+3</tt> and then throws the result of the addition away. In
  this case the addition was useless. The second one, however,
  makes sense, because it does the addition first and stores the
  result into <tt>$v</tt>. Since people write things like</p>
  <pre>
    $v = $x + 3;
</pre>

  <p>all the time, and expect to get the second behavior and not
  the first, Perl's = operator has low precedence, lower than the
  precedence of +, so that Perl makes the second
  interpretation.</p>

  <p>Here's another example:</p>
  <pre>
    $result = $x =~ /foo/;
</pre>

  <p>means this:</p>
  <pre>
    $result = ($x =~ /foo/);
</pre>

  <p>which looks to see if <tt>$x</tt> contains the string
  <tt>foo</tt>, and stores a true or false result into
  <tt>$result</tt>. It doesn't mean this:</p>
  <pre>
    ($result = $x) =~ /foo/;
</pre>

  <p>which copies the value of <tt>$x</tt> into <tt>$result</tt>
  and then looks to see if <tt>$result</tt> contains <tt>foo</tt>.
  In this case it's likely that the programmer wanted the first
  meaning, not the second. But sometimes you do want it to go the
  other way. Consider this expression:</p>
  <pre>
    $p = $q =~ s/w//g;
</pre>

  <p>Again, this expression is interpreted this way:</p>
  <pre>
    $p = ($q =~ s/w//g);
</pre>

  <p>All the w's are removed from <tt>$q</tt>, and the number of
  successful substitutions is stored into <tt>$p</tt>. However,
  sometimes you really do want the other meaning:</p>
  <pre>
    ($p = $q) =~ s/w//g;
</pre>

  <p>This copies the value of <tt>$q</tt> into <tt>$p</tt>, and
  then removes all the w's from <tt>$p</tt>, leaving <tt>$q</tt>
  alone. If you want this, you have to include the parentheses
  explicitly, because = has lower precedence than =~.</p>

  <p>Often the rules do what you want. Consider this:</p>
  <pre>
    $worked = 1 + $s =~ /pattern/;
</pre>

  <p>There are five ways to interpret this:</p>
  <pre>
a.  ($worked = 1) + ($s  =~ /pattern/);

b. (($worked = 1) + $s)  =~ /pattern/;

c.  ($worked = (1 + $s)) =~ /pattern/;

d.   $worked = ((1 + $s) =~ /pattern/);

e.   $worked = (1 + ($s  =~ /pattern/));
</pre>

  <p>We already know that + has higher precedence than =, so it
  happens before =, and that rules out (a) and (b).</p>

  <p>We also know that =~ has higher precedence than =, so that
  rules out (c).</p>

  <p>To choose between (d) and (e) we need to know whether + takes
  precedence over =~ or vice versa. (d) will convert $s to a
  number, add 1 to it, convert the resulting number to a string,
  and do the pattern match. That is a pretty silly thing to do. (e)
  will match <tt>$s</tt> against the pattern, return a boolean
  result, add 1 to that result to yield the number 1 or 2, and
  store the number into <tt>$worked</tt>. That makes a lot more
  sense; perhaps <tt>$worked</tt> will be used later to index an
  array. We should hope that Perl chooses interpretation (e) rather
  than (d). And in fact that is what it does, because =~ has higher
  precedence than +. =~ behaves similarly with respect to
  multiplication.</p>

  <p>Our table of precedence is shaping up:</p>
  <pre>
1. **         (right to left)
        
2. =~

3. *, /       (left to right)

4. +, &ndash;       (left to right)

5. =        
</pre>

  <p>How are multiple = symbols resolved? Left to right, or right
  to left? The question is whether this:</p>
  <pre>
    $a = $b = $c;
</pre>

  <p>will mean this:</p>
  <pre>
    ($a = $b) = $c;
</pre>

  <p>or this:</p>
  <pre>
    $a = ($b = $c);
</pre>

  <p>The first one means to store the value of <tt>$b</tt> into
  <tt>$a</tt>, and then to store the value of <tt>$c</tt> into
  <tt>$a</tt>; this is obviously not useful. But the second one
  means to store the value of <tt>$c</tt> into <tt>$b</tt>, and
  then to store that value into <tt>$a</tt> also, and that
  obviously is useful. So = is resolved right to left.</p>

  <p>Why does =~ have lower precedence than **? No good reason.
  It's just a side effect of the low precedence of =~ and the high
  precedence of **. It's probably very rare to have =~ and ** in
  the same expression anyway. Perl tries to get the common cases
  right. Here's another common case:</p>
  <pre>
    if ($x == 3 &amp;&amp; $y == 4) { &hellip; }
</pre>

  <p>Is this interpreted as:</p>
  <pre>
a. (($x == 3)  &amp;&amp;  $y) == 4

b.  ($x == 3)  &amp;&amp; ($y == 4)

c.  ($x == (3  &amp;&amp;  $y)) == 4

d.   $x == ((3 &amp;&amp;  $y) == 4)

e.   $x == (3  &amp;&amp; ($y == 4))
</pre>

  <p>We really hope that it will be (b). To make (b) come out,
  &amp;&amp; will have to have lower precedence than ==; if the
  precedence is higher we'll get (c) or (d), which would be awful.
  So &amp;&amp; has lower precedence than ==. If this seems like an
  obvious decision, consider that Pascal got it wrong.</p>

  <p>|| has precedence about the same as &amp;&amp;, but slightly
  lower, in accordance with the usual convention of mathematicians,
  and by analogy with * and +. ! has high precedence, because when
  people write</p>
  <pre>
    !$x &hellip;some long complicated expression&hellip;
</pre>

  <p>they almost always mean that the ! applies to the <tt>$x</tt>,
  not to the entire long complicated expression. In fact, almost
  the only time they don't mean this is in cases like this one:</p>
  <pre>
    if (! $x-&gt;{'annoying'}) { &hellip; }
</pre>

  <p>it would be very annoying if this were interpreted to mean</p>
  <pre>
    if ((! $x)-&gt;{'annoying'}) { &hellip; }
</pre>

  <p>The same argument we used to explain why ! has high precedence
  works even better and explains why -&gt; has even higher
  precedence. In fact, -&gt; has the highest precedence of all. If
  ## and @@ are any two operators at all, then</p>
  <pre>
    $a ## $x-&gt;$y
</pre>

  <p>and</p>
  <pre>
    $x-&gt;$y @@ $b
    $a ## ($x-&gt;$y)
</pre>

  <p>and</p>
  <pre>
    ($x-&gt;$y) @@ $b

    ($a ## $x)-&gt;$y
</pre>

  <p>or</p>
  <pre>
    $x-&gt;($y @@ $b)
</pre>

  <p>For a long time, the operator with lowest precedence was the ,
  operator. The , operator is for evaluating two expressions in
  sequence. For example,</p>
  <pre>
    $a*=2 , $c*=3
</pre>

  <p>doubles <tt>$a</tt> and triples <tt>$c</tt>. It would be a
  shame if you wrote something like this:</p>
  <pre>
    $a*=2 , $c*=3 if $change_the_variables;
</pre>

  <p>and Perl interpreted it to mean this:</p>
  <pre>
    $a*= (2, $c) *= 3 if $change_the_variables;
</pre>

  <p>That would just be bizarre. The very very low precedence of ,
  ensures that you can write</p>
  <pre>
    EXPR1, EXPR2
</pre>

  <p>for any two expressions at all, and be sure that they are not
  going to get mashed together to make some nonsense expression
  like <tt>$a*= (2, $c) *= 3</tt>.</p>

  <p>, is also the list constructor operator. If you want to make a
  list of three things, you have to write</p>
  <pre>
    @list = ('Gold', 'Frankincense', 'Myrrh');
</pre>

  <p>because if you left off the parentheses, like this:</p>
  <pre>
    @list = 'Gold', 'Frankincense', 'Myrrh';
</pre>

  <p>what you would get would be the same as this:</p>
  <pre>
    (@list = 'Gold'), 'Frankincense', 'Myrrh';
</pre>

  <p>This assigns <tt>@list</tt> to have one element (Gold) and
  then executes the two following expressions in sequence, which is
  pointless. So this is a prime example of a case where the default
  precedence rules don't do what you want. But people are already
  in the habit of putting parentheses around their list elements,
  so nobody minds this very much, and the problem isn't really a
  problem at all.</p>

  <h3>Precedence Traps and Surprises</h3>This very low precedence
  for , causes some other problems, however. Consider this common
  idiom:
  <pre>
open(F, "&lt; $file") || die "Couldn't open $file: $!";
</pre>

  <p>This tries to open a filehandle, and if it can't it aborts the
  program with an error message. Now watch what happens if you
  leave the parentheses off the open call:</p>
  <pre>
open F, "&lt; $file"  || die "Couldn't open $file: $!";
</pre>

  <p>, has very low precedence, so the || takes precedence here,
  and Perl interprets this expression as if you had written
  this:</p>
  <pre>
open F, ("&lt; $file"  || die "Couldn't open $file: $!");
</pre>

  <p>This is totally bizarre, because the die will only be executed
  when the string "&lt; <tt>$file</tt>" is false, which never
  happens. Since the die is controlled by the string and not by the
  open call, the program will not abort on errors the way you
  wanted. Here we wish that || had lower precedence, so that we
  could write</p>
  <pre>
try to perform big long hairy complicated action  || die ;
</pre>

  <p>and be sure that the || was not going to gobble up part of the
  action the way it did in our open example. Perl 5 introduced a
  new version of || that has low precedence for exactly this
  purpose. It's spelled or, and in fact it has the lowest
  precedence of all Perl's operators. You can write</p>
  <pre>
    try to perform big long hairy complicated action or die ;
</pre>

  <p>and be quite sure that or will not gobble up part of the
  action the way it did in our open example, whether or not you
  leave off the parentheses. To summarize:</p>
  <pre>
open(F, "&lt; $file") or die "Couldn't open $file: $!";  # OK
open F, "&lt; $file"  or die "Couldn't open $file: $!";  # OK
open(F, "&lt; $file") || die "Couldn't open $file: $!";  # OK
open F, "&lt; $file"  || die "Couldn't open $file: $!";  # Whooops!
</pre>

  <p>If you use or, you're safe from this error, and if you always
  put in the parentheses, you're safe. Pick a strategy you like and
  stick with it.</p>

  <p>The other big use of || is to select a value from the first
  source that provides it. For example:</p>
  <pre>
$directory = $opt_D || $ENV{DIRECTORY} || $DEFAULT_DIRECTORY;
</pre>

  <p>It looks to see if there was a <tt>-D</tt> command-line option
  specifying the directory first; if not, it looks to see if the
  user set the <tt>DIRECTORY</tt> environment variable; if neither
  of these is set, it uses a hard-wired default directory. It gets
  the first value that it can, so, for example, if you have the
  environment variable set and supply an explicit <tt>-D</tt>
  option when you run the program, the option overrides the
  environment variable. The precedence of || is higher than that of
  =, so this means what we wanted:</p>
  <pre>
$directory = ($opt_D || $ENV{DIRECTORY} || $DEFAULT_DIRECTORY);
</pre>

  <p>But sometimes people have a little knowledge and end up
  sabotaging themselves, writing this:</p>
  <pre>
$directory = $opt_D or $ENV{DIRECTORY} or $DEFAULT_DIRECTORY;
</pre>

  <p>or has very very very low precedence, even lower than =, so
  Perl interprets this as:</p>
  <pre>
($directory = $opt_D) or $ENV{DIRECTORY} or $DEFAULT_DIRECTORY;
</pre>

  <p><tt>$directory</tt> is always assigned from the command-line
  option, even if none was set. Then the values of the expressions
  <tt>$ENV{DIRECTORY}</tt> and <tt>$DEFAULT_DIRECTORY</tt> are
  thrown away. Perl's <tt>-w</tt> option will warn you about this
  mistake if you make it. To avoid it, remember this rule of thumb:
  use || for selecting values, and use or for controlling the flow
  of statements.</p>

  <h3>List Operators and Unary Operators</h3>A related problem is
  that all of Perl's 'list operators' have high precedence, and
  tend to gobble up everything to their right. (A 'list operator'
  is a Perl function that accepts a list of arguments, like open as
  above, or print.) We already saw this problem with open. Here's a
  similar sort of problem:
  <pre>
@successes = (unlink $new, symlink $old, $new, open N, $new);
</pre>

  <p>This isn't even clear to humans. What was really meant was</p>
  <pre>
@successes = (unlink($new), symlink($old, $new), open(N, $new));
</pre>

  <p>which performs the three operations in sequence and stores the
  three success-or-failure codes into <tt>@successes</tt>. But what
  Perl thought we meant here was something totally different:</p>
  <pre>
@successes = (unlink($new, symlink($old, $new, open(N, $new))));
</pre>

  <p>It thinks that the result of the open call should be used as
  the third argument to symlink, and that the result of symlink
  should be passed to unlink, which will try to remove a file with
  that name. This won't even compile, because symlink needs two
  arguments, not three. We saw one way to dismbiguate this; another
  is to write it like this:</p>
  <pre>
@successes = ((unlink $new), (symlink $old, $new), (open N, $new));
</pre>

  <p>Again, pick a style you like and stick with it.</p>

  <p>Why do Perl list operators gobble up everything to the right?
  Often it's very handy. For example:</p>
  <pre>
@textfiles = grep -T, map "$DIRNAME/$_", readdir DIR;
</pre>

  <p>Here Perl behaves as if you had written this:</p>
  <pre>
@textfiles = grep(-T, (map("$DIRNAME/$_", (readdir(DIR)))));
</pre>

  <p>Some filenames are read from the <tt>dirhandle</tt> with
  <tt>readdir</tt> and the resulting list is passed to map, which
  turns each filename into a full path name and returns a list of
  paths. Then grep filters the list of paths, extracts all the
  paths that refer to text files, and returns a list of just the
  text files from the directory.</p>

  <p>One possibly fine point is that the parentheses might not
  always mean what you want. For example, suppose you had this:</p>
  <pre>
    print $a, $b, $c;
</pre>

  <p>Then you discover that you need to print out double the value
  of <tt>$a</tt>. If you do this you're safe:</p>
  <pre>
    print 2*$a, $b, $c;
</pre>

  <p>but if you do this, you might get a surprise:</p>
  <pre>
    print (2*$a), $b, $c;
</pre>

  <p>If a list operator is followed by parentheses, Perl assumes
  that the parentheses enclose all the arguments, so it interprets
  this as:</p>
  <pre>
    (print (2*$a)), $b, $c;
</pre>

  <p>It prints out twice <tt>$a</tt>, but doesn't print out
  <tt>$b</tt> or <tt>$c</tt> at all. (Perl will warn you about this
  if you have <tt>-w</tt> on.) To fix this, add more
  parentheses:</p>
  <pre>
    print ((2*$a), $b, $c);
</pre>

  <p>Some people will suggest that you do this instead:</p>
  <pre>
    print +(2*$a), $b, $c;
</pre>

  <p>Perl does what you want here, but I think it's bad advice
  because it looks bizarre.</p>

  <p>Here's a similar example:</p>
  <pre>
    print @items, @more_items;
</pre>

  <p>Say we want to join up the <tt>@items</tt> with some
  separator, so we use join:</p>
  <pre>
    print join '---', @items, @more_items;
</pre>

  <p>Oops; this is wrong; we only want to join <tt>@items</tt>, not
  <tt>@more_items</tt> also. One way we might try to fix this
  is:</p>
  <pre>
    print (join '---', @items), @more_items;
</pre>

  <p>This falls afoul of the problem we just saw: Perl sees the
  parentheses, assumes that they contain the arguments of print,
  and never prints <tt>@more_items</tt> at all. To fix, use</p>
  <pre>
 print ((join '---', @items), @more_items); or
 print join('---', @items), @more_items;
</pre>

  <p>Sometimes you won't have this problem. Some of Perl's built-in
  functions are <i>unary operators</i>, which means that they
  always get exactly one argument. <tt>defined</tt> and <tt>uc</tt>
  are examples. They don't have the problem that the list operators
  have of gobbling everything to the right; they only gobble one
  argument. Here's an example similar to the one I just showed:</p>
  <pre>
    print $a, $b;
</pre>

  <p>Now we decide we want to print <tt>$a</tt> in all lower case
  letters:</p>
  <pre>
    print lc $a, $b;
</pre>

  <p>Don't we have the same problem as in the print join example?
  If we did, it would print <tt>$b</tt> in all lowercase also. But
  it doesn't, because <tt>lc</tt> is a unary operator and only gets
  one argument. This doesn't need any fixing.</p>

  <h3>Complete Rules of Precedence</h3>Finally, here's Perl's
  complete precedence table:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>left</td>

      <td>&nbsp;</td>

      <td>terms and list operators (leftward)</td>
    </tr>

  <p>This is straight out of the <tt>perlop</tt> documentation that
  comes with Perl. <i>left</i> and <i>right</i> mean that the
  operators associate to the left or the right, respectively;
  <i>nonassoc</i> means that the operators don't associate at all.
  For example, if you try to write</p>
  <pre>
    $a &lt; $b &lt; $c
</pre>

  <p>Perl will deliver a syntax error message. Perhaps what you
  really meant was</p>
  <pre>
    $a &lt; $b &amp;&amp; $b &lt; $c
</pre>

  <p>The precedence table is much too big and complicated to
  remember; that's a problem with Perl's approach. You have to
  trust it to handle to common cases correctly, and be prepared to
  deal with bizarre, hard-to-find bugs when it doesn't do what you
  wanted. The alternatives, as I mentioned before, have their own
  disadvantages.</p>

  <h3>How to Remember all the Rules</h3>Probably the best strategy
  for dealing with Perl's complicated precedence hierarchy is to
  cluster the operators in your mind:
  <pre>
Arithmetic:     +, -, *, /, %, **
Bitwise:        &amp;, |, ~, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;
Logical:        &amp;&amp;, ||, !
Comparison:     ==, !=, &gt;=, &lt;=, &gt;, &lt;
Assignment:     =, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.
</pre>

  <p>and try to remember how the operators behave within each
  group. Mostly the answer will be 'they behave as you expect.' For
  example, the operators in the 'arithmetic' group all behave the
  according to the rules you learned in fourth grade. The
  'comparison' group all have about the same precedence, and you
  aren't allowed to mix them anyway, except to say something
  like</p>
  <pre>
    $a&lt;$b == $c&lt;$d
</pre>

  <p>which compares the <i>truth values</i> of <tt>$a&lt;$b</tt>
  and <tt>$c&lt;$d</tt>.</p>

  <p>Then, once you're familiar with the rather unsurprising
  behavior of the most common groups, just use parentheses
  liberally everywhere else.</p>

  <h3>Quiz</h3>Now try to guess how Perl will interpret the
  following expressions:
  <pre>
a. $x = $x | $y &lt;&lt; 3;

b. $y % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; $y % 100 != 0 || $y % 400 == 0

c. $V = 4/3*$PI*$r**3;

d. $x = 1 || $x &lt;= 10
</pre>

  <h3>Answers</h3>
  <pre>
a. $x = ($x | ($y &lt;&lt; 3));

b. ((($y % 4) == 0) &amp;&amp; (($y % 100) != 0)) || (($y % 400) == 0) 
   (This computes whether or not the year <tt>$y</tt> is a leap year.)

c. $V = ((4/3)*$PI*($r**3)); (Volume of a sphere with radius <tt>$r</tt>.)

d. ($x &gt;= 1) || ($x &lt;= 10)
</pre>
