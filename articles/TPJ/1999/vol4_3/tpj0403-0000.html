  <h3>MIDI::Simple</h3>In <a href="../vol4_1/ewtoc.html" target=
  "resource window">TPJ #13</a>, Sean Burke discusses his work
  creating an extensible composition language. As early as the late
  70s, an Australian company named Fairlight built and sold a
  digital synthesizer called the CMI (Computer Musical Instrument).
  They developed a system for controlling the synthesizer that
  predated and had much in common with MIDI, which only appeared in
  1984.

  <p>MCL is a relatively simple language that can be extended with
  program control statements and more, and can be generated by Perl
  or any other text processing system. For information about MCL,
  visit <a href="http://www.fairlightesp.com" target=
  "resource window">http://www.fairlightesp.com</a> or <a href=

  target=
  "resource window">http://farben.latrobe.edu.au/mikropol/volume4/smith-m/smith.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Perl has a fine history of giving new life to the best work of
  the past, and there's an opportunity here to draw upon
  trailblazing systems such as MCL.</p>

  <h4><i>The author responds:</i></h4>

  <p>Larry Wall has often talked about Perl being eclectic (see
  <a href="../vol1_1/ewtoc.html" target="resource window">TPJ
  #1</a>), having all sorts of influences, being a Postmodern
  computer language, and so on. I prefer a more enjoyably menacing
  perspective: Perl, I say, is the Borg of computer languages. Perl
  programmers (ruthless drones, all of us!) scour the universe for
  other computer languages. Once they are found, their unique and
  interesting features are assimilated into the Perl
  Collective.</p>

  <p>Granted, it's hard to think of CPAN, comp.lang.perl.*, or the
  perl5-porters list as anything like an efficient, single-minded
  cooperative hive mind. Maybe that's just because of a temporary
  shortage of mind-control implants.</p>

  <p>But seriously, back to music: a basic issue in the design of
  music languages basically comes down to "beyond just being a
  series of notes, what is music? Is it basically intervals?
  themes? measures? instruments?" No single answer is completely
  satisfying for all purposes - the <i>same</i> way that there's no
  really satisfying-for-all-purposes answer to the question "what,
  basically, is the way to program? functionally? procedurally?
  with OOP?" Perl's answer to the latter question is to allow
  "multiparadigmatic" design - basically, pick and choose as you
  like for the problem at hand. <i>That</i> is also the right
  answer to the question about the way to design music languages, I
  think; and that's why I'm hoping Perl will prove to be a great
  language for music programming.</p>

  <h3>Hate Mail</h3>

  <p>Dear Perl Journalists:</p>

  <p>I think the perl [sic] cadre (Wall, Orwent [sic], Torkington,
  Sarathy, et al.) has been subordinated.</p>

  <p>Larry Wall is paid by Active State [sic], which is in
  partnership [sic] with, gulp, Microsoft. Next, I expect to see a
  beaten and humiliated 'Father of Perl' up at the lectern,
  confessing to incorrect thought, like Zinoviev at the Moscow Show
  Trials in 1938. Hey, why not treat us to an article about unholy
  union?</p>

  <p>And your website. Ugh. It is password protected - which will
  cut down visits radically, as I am sure you know. Maybe I oughta
  tattoo It has been taken over by an anonymous corporate entity -
  an entity which tells me I am 'family'. Hey pop! Loan me 20
  bucks!</p>

  <p>Lies! - All lies! I better slow down, not get worked up.</p>

  <p>I think your Summer 1999 issue is a portent of Things To Come.
  Dumbed-down content. Boring. No fun. A dud.</p>

  <h4><i>TPJ Responds:</i></h4>

  <p>Larry was abducted by a secret military project known only as
  "Counterforce X" while flying over Roswell, New Mexico, en route
  to YAPC. He was melted down for his DNA, and an alien
  shapechanger has taken his place. (PROOF: his eyesight, once
  notoriously bad, is better!)</p>

  <p>Larry can now communicate telepathically with the other
  abductees. This loose-knit cabal of world leaders and influence
  peddlers includes Bill Gates, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the
  entire writing staff of the Teletubbies. In secret conferences
  held quarterly, the alien plants meet to exchange protein and
  recharge their death rays.</p>

  <p>They take care of each other, which is why Larry is working
  for O'Reilly who are in bed with the obviously financially
  unjustifiable ActiveState who are a front organization for
  Microsoft. Bill Gates is funding Larry's 'family', his evil
  experiments with recombinant tropical fish and three-phase power,
  and his work on UTF-8. Can it be a coincidence that Klingon has
  its own section of Unicode?</p>

  <p>So as the new millennium draws near, their nefarious plans are
  ready to hatch. The replicators are in place, the protein vats
  far beneath the earth's surface contain millions of larvae whose
  sharp teeth are already visible to the few armed guards watching
  their facilities. Vancouver, Mountain View, Redmond, Cambridge,
  and Washington D.C. form corners of a pentagram in L-space, whose
  center is directly over Boulder, Colorado. (Proof, at last, of
  what we've long suspected: Tom Christiansen is the Devil.)</p>

  <p>When computers fail on January 1, 2000, and the world is
  plunged into darkness and chaos, they will act. While we humans
  are weak and vulnerable, they will begin unleashing their spawn
  upon us. For we are but food for their young. Their codename for
  this evil plot for world domination? Windows 2000.</p>

  <p>Be prepared. Stockpile your arms now. Horde the water. Buy all
  the canned food in your local supermarket chain. (This message
  brought to you by Safeway. Safeway, providing food and drink to
  prepared militia for over sixty years.) Move to a state with no
  prying law enforcement officials (this message brought to you by
  Montana. Montana, proudly accommodating separatists and gun nuts
  since 1889), and buy a large ranch with clear line of fire to the
  boundary. Make ammunition from garlic and silver, the only known
  and proven anti-alien measures (this message brought to you by
  the Garlic and Silver Lobby, stopping aliens for over fifty
  years).</p>

  <p>Oh, and whatever you do, don't use Perl! Perl is the mind
  control tool of the alien colonists! There are other, safer,
  untainted languages. I've heard good things about Python. Some
  say it is the white bread and vanilla ice cream of programming
  languages, and that must be good.</p>

  <p>So, fellow humans, be deceived no more! There is a plot, you
  knew it all along. The Warren Commission <i>was</i> a coverup.
  Roswell has been the most significant center for American
  politics this century! You knew it! But now it's coming to a
  head, and you must be ready. You must gathers your weapons and
  open up a large map of America and ask yourself and your
  families:</p>
