  <p>I wanted to like this book. I really did, and I tried hard.
  There's a big gap in the Perl literature right now: There's no
  other book about Perl that's aimed at nonprogrammers. It's very
  difficult to write such a book, and I was willing to ignore a
  certain number of technical errors because of this. If the book
  had good qualities that would make it useful as a tutorial for a
  complete beginner in spite of minor inaccuracies in the details,
  I wanted to find that out. But I read it and was appalled.</p>

  <p>It would be very easy to spend a lot of time picking at the
  small technical errors, but I think that would miss the point
  about what is wrong with this book, so I'm not going to do it.
  The big problem with <i>Perl 5 for Dummies</i> is that it is not
  aimed at nonprogrammers. After chapter 4 or 5, it is structured
  like a reference manual: The chapters are laid out topically,
  with all the string functions in one chapter and all the number
  functions in another, instead of being ordered with simple things
  first and more difficult things later on.</p>

  <p>There are hardly any example programs. Chapter 22, which
  contains ten useful example programs, is a pleasant exception,
  but it is too little and too late. The examples that are included
  don't follow a progression from simple things to more complicated
  ones. Usually, when you are writing a book about programming,
  even one that is not aimed at Dummies, you like your first
  example to as simple as possible, something like this:</p>
  <pre>
        print "Hello, world\n";
</pre>

  <p>This gives the reader a chance to solve a lot of very
  difficult preliminary problems: How do they create a program
  file? How do they run the compiler? Where did the output go? With
  those problems solved, it is safe to move on to studying the
  language itself. You don't want to saddle the user with having to
  learn a new language <i>and</i> a new environment at the same
  time. But the first example program in <i>Perl 5 for Dummies</i>
  is 48 lines long. And after the 48 lines of source code, author
  Paul Hoffman has this to say:</p>

  <blockquote>
    For now, don't worry about what this program does. Trust me, it
    does something, but that's not the point of this chapter. In
    fact, you'll see exactly what it does at the beginning of the
    next chapter.
  </blockquote>

  <p>If he had started with a simple program, he would not have had
  to apologize for it, and he wouldn't have had to put it off until
  the next chapter, and the explanation would not have taken up six
  pages. It seems obvious, doesn't it? The book is for Dummies, so
  you start with a simple example. But that's not what the author
  does. I have no explanation for this.</p>

  <p>This sort of poor planning and poor organization abounds. A
  gross example: Hoffman explains the <tt>for (EXPR;EXPR;EXPR)</tt>
  construction before he explains the <tt>foreach (LIST)</tt>
  construction.</p>

  <p>Another example: When Hoffman discusses logical operators, he
  puts in a garbled explanation of the <tt>xor</tt> operator. The
  problem here isn't the garbling; it's the presence of
  <tt>xor</tt>, which should be omitted. But the book has
  referencemanualitis, which means that a section about logical
  operators has to discuss all the logical operators. In a
  reference manual that is fine, because a reference manual is
  supposed to be complete. In a book for dummies with no previous
  programming experience it is madness. Time and time again Hoffman
  will say that something is not very useful, and then explain it
  anyway.</p>

  <p>Now please repeat the preceding paragraph several more times,
  with xor replaced by <tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt>, <tt>continue</tt>,
  <tt>redo</tt>, the <tt>/o</tt> regex modifier, the <tt>\Z</tt>
  regex metacharacter, the <tt>-S</tt>, <tt>-b</tt>, <tt>-c</tt>,
  <tt>-p</tt>, and <tt>-t</tt> filetests, the reset function, the
  <tt>select</tt> function, the <tt>caller</tt> function, bit
  operations, and hex and octal numbers. None of these things has
  any place in a book for Dummies, and in many cases Hoffman
  <i>says so</i>, turning around immediately after explaining them
  to say that they should be avoided or are rarely useful.</p>

  <p>Another symptom of referencemanualitis is that Hoffman rarely
  takes advantage of natural opportunities to show examples that
  reinforce things he's explained earlier. For example, on pages
  141&ndash;142 he is discussing <tt>localtime</tt>. His example
  program looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
 ($Second, $Minute, $Hour, $DayOfMonth, $Month, $Year,
        $WeekDay, $DayofYear, $IsDST) = localtime(time);
 $RealMonth = $Month + 1;
 print "$RealMonth/$DayofMonth/$Year";
</pre>

  <p>Then he explains the potential for danger:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Also note that the year is the number of years since 1900, not
    the two-digit year number. Thus, in a few years, the program
    above will display something like 9/13/101, which looks
    completely silly.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here is a squandered opportunity to reinforce the % operator,
  which he discussed, with an inept example, way back on page 90.
  He can explain how to fix the problem <i>and</i> show a typical
  use of % at the same time&ndash;but he doesn't. Correcting the
  month number would have been a good opportunity to use the ++ or
  += operators, which he discussed at length on page 92, but again
  the opportunity is missed. The second edition shows an example
  with % -- and also suggests an incorrect fix that will cause a
  Y2100 fault.</p>

  <p>There is little development of the subject matter or
  explication of the connections between related items; like a
  reference manual, it's mostly just an enumeration of
  features.</p>

  <p>Often Hoffman just doesn't seem to have a clear idea of who
  his audience is. On page 90, he punts on the notion of operator
  precedence and says that you should use parentheses everywhere. I
  can understand that. Perl operator precedence is a complicated
  business. I do not think I would have punted so soon, because by
  page 90 the only operators that have been introduced are basic
  arithmetic operators, and the precedence rules for those are the
  same rules that everyone learns in elementary school; it might
  have been nice for Hoffman to mention that the precedence is the
  same in Perl as it was in fourth grade, instead of
  scaremongering. But Hoffman is the author and I can respect the
  decision; if he thinks that operator precedence is too scary for
  the Dummies I am not going to disagree. But then on page 92 he
  mentions the <tt>log</tt> function, and without explaining what
  it is:</p>

  <blockquote>
    log takes the natural log (base e) of its argument
  </blockquote>

  <p>Does this make sense? Did the people who couldn't understand
  3+2*4 on page 90 suddenly learn about Napierian logarithms two
  pages later? Hoffman's either patronizing them on page 90 or
  confusing them on page 92. Another example: On page 143 is a
  warning: "The <tt>rand</tt> function is not meant to be used in
  strong cryptography..." Hello? Sorry, I must have gotten off at
  the wrong floor; I thought this was the book for Dummies. If the
  Dummies are trying to build strong cryptographic systems,
  <tt>rand</tt> is going to be the least of their problems.</p>

  <p>When there are simple and difficult explanations, you can
  usually count on Hoffman to find the difficult explanation, and
  then to tell you how difficult it is. For example: (page 93)</p>

  <blockquote>
    <tt>int</tt> can be a bit tricky because it rounds down for
    positive numbers and rounds up for negative numbers.
  </blockquote>

  <p>He's right; that is tricky. Wait, which way does it round
  again? Up, down, positive, negative, I can't remember. But if he
  had said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <tt>int</tt> is very simple: It throws away the fractional part
    of a number, leaving the integer part.
  </blockquote>

  <p>then it is a lot easier <i>and</i> you understand the name so
  that next week you might remember what it does. Another example
  of this: In the ill-advised explanation of <tt>xor</tt>, he
  says</p>

  <blockquote>
    The operator returns true if the two things have different
    truth values but returns false if they have the same truth
    value. (See table 8-2.)
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here's the simple version:</p>

  <p><tt>$soup xor $salad</tt> is true if either <tt>$soup</tt>
  <i>or</i> <tt>$salad</tt> is true, but not both.</p>

  <p>Then you dispense with the table.</p>

  <p>What went wrong here? It could just be bad writing. Bad
  writers don't stop to think whether there might be a better way
  to say something; they just write the first thing that comes into
  their heads. Part of the problem is the whole 'Dummies' approach,
  which encourages the writer to write a confusing explanation and
  then to discount the reader's confusion as coming from the
  subject matter rather than the inept explanation; a reader who is
  willing to be insulted and categorized as a 'Dummy' is not going
  to demand a better explanation. If things are confusing, they
  will assume it is their own fault instead of putting the blame
  where it belongs, on the writer.</p>

  <p>But I think a large part of the problem is that Hoffman
  doesn't understand the subject very well. He spends a lot of time
  scaremongering, by which I mean that he spends a lot of time
  warning the reader to stay away from dangerous spots in the
  language, when actually these spots are safe and easily
  understood. This is usually a sign of ignorance and fear. I
  mentioned one of these scares before; here is another:</p>

  <blockquote>
    You can do "numberish" things to strings, but the results are
    almost impossible to predict accurately...Perl tries hard to
    find numbers in the strings and do the "right thing" with them,
    but you cannot always guess what that "right thing" is. Don't
    risk it: Always use math functions and operators just for
    numbers. (p.93)
  </blockquote>

  <p>Perl looks for a number at the beginning of the string and
  ignores the string starting from the first character that can't
  be part of a number, so that "123xyz" behaves just like 123. How
  hard would it have been to say this? It's not the warning that I
  object to, or the advice that this feature is best avoided; it's
  the scaremongering. It's <i>not</i> hard to predict what Perl
  will do. It's <i>easy</i>. When you write a book, it's your job
  to educate and enlighten the reader. But passages like this one
  encourage the reader to remain ignorant and afraid. They say
  "This is too complicated for you to ever understand, so just give
  up." When the reader gives up on trying to understand something,
  it means the writer has failed. When the writer <i>tells</i> the
  reader to give up, he is manufacturing his own failure.</p>

  <p>Here is another scare:</p>

  <blockquote>
    And, here's a place where Perl gets really confusing. If you
    use the name of a list in scalar context, Perl interprets it as
    the length of the list. This little bit of shorthand is
    terribly confusing to even advanced programmers unless they
    look at it carefully. (p.111)
  </blockquote>

  <p>There are certainly many surprises lurking in Perl's context
  sensitivity, but in my experience this is not one of them.
  Beginners take to this idea quite easily, and find it simple and
  natural, if you use the right example. The right example is:</p>
  <pre>
        if (@array &gt; 4) { it has more than 4 elements }
</pre>

  <p>In spite of his warning, Hoffman even uses this construction
  himself without seeming to notice!</p>

  <p>I speculate this this scaremongering is a reflection of
  Hoffman's own fear and uncertainty around these areas, and that
  rather than research them and clear them up for himself, he's
  chosen to duplicate his ignorance in the reader. He calls
  <tt>$a[3]</tt> a 'slice' (p.100), and at first I thought that
  that was a clever linguistic innovation even though it was
  unconventional. But later I realized that he did not flout the
  convention on purpose; I don't think Hoffman understands what
  'slice' normally means. (On page 154, he abandons this
  terminology.) All this supports the theory that Hoffman doesn't
  understand what context is or how it works, and that that's what
  leads to his various technical errors, bad examples,
  scaremongering, and other nastiness.</p>

  <p>A final major problem, perhaps of the same type: hashes are
  deferred until chapter 16, and the discussion is too short and
  (as usual) lacks real examples. Hoffman insists on calling them
  'associative arrays', instead of 'hashes', "because it defines
  better what they are used for, not how they are implemented."
  That argument makes sense and carries some weight, but on the
  other side of the scale is the consideration, which apparently
  hasn't occurred to him, that 'associative array' takes
  <i>seven</i> times as long to say and to read as 'hash'. When you
  say 'hash' it suggests that you are talking about something very
  basic and very important; when you say 'associative array' you
  are talking about something obscure and abstruse. Hoffman's
  choice of terminology and placement of hashes in the book implies
  that hashes are an obscure and unimportant feature of Perl. But
  hashes are <i>essential</i> to Perl, and they are not hard to
  explain, even to Dummies. ("Just like arrays, but the index is a
  string instead of a number.") I can't imagine what went wrong
  here.</p>

  <p><b>Summary</b>: This is a really rotten book. Very few books
  are able to attain as many as eight major flaws:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>'Dummy' approach encourages and reinforces the reader's
    disability</li>

    <li>Lack of concrete programming examples</li>

    <li>Lack of general discussion of how to program, apart from
    language-specific features</li>

    <li>Reference manual organization style</li>

    <li>Inclusion of too many useless and abstruse features</li>

    <li>Complicated explanations where simple ones are
    possible</li>

    <li>Scaremongering and panic instead of calm explanation of
    affairs</li>

    <li>Many, many technical errors, some very serious</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If IDG had fixed any six of these problems in the second
  edition of the book, if would still be an unusually bad book.
  None of them are fixed. The second edition has more minor
  improvements. For example, in the second edition Hoffman actually
  explains his 48-line example program instead of presenting it
  without comment. But all the serious problems remain.</p>

  <p>As far as I can tell, <i>Perl 5 for Dummies</i> is not good
  for anything at all. A Dummy who wants to learn Perl will be
  better off with O'Reilly's <i>Learning Perl</i>. That book is not
  really suitable, because it is not aimed at nonprogrammers, but
  <i>Perl 5 for Dummies</i> is even worse in that regard, and at
  least Learning Perl is clearly written, accurate, and has
  effective examples. There is still plenty of room in the world
  for a book about Perl aimed at nonprogrammers, but <i>Perl 5 for
  Dummies</i> is not it.</p>

  <p>Note: <i>Perl 5 for Dummies</i> was published in 1997, and
  although it's still easy to find in stores, it is out of print.
  Why did I review an out-of-print book? Because when I called up
  IDG Books' Public Relations department to get the review copy,
  that's what they sent me. It seems that their PR department is as
  incompetent as their editing department.</p>

  <p>Nearly all the comments in this review apply to both editions.
  When page numbers are given, they refer to the first edition.</p>
