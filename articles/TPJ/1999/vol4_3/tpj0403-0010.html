  <h2 align="center">Hiding Object Data with Closures</h2>

  <h4><i>Nigel Chapman</i></h4>

  <p>Tom Christiansen's object-oriented Perl tutorial (the
  <tt>perltoot</tt> documentation bundled with Perl) describes a
  way of making the data stored in an object inaccessible to the
  outside world using closures. It is a technique that deserves to
  be better known, so in this article I will elaborate on Tom's
  description and add a little background.</p>

  <p>First the object-oriented background, and a warning. The three
  great object-oriented virtues might be correctness,
  maintainability, and re-usability. (I'll leave it to you to work
  out how these relate to the three great virtues of a programmer.)
  They don't necessarily include efficiency, and the techniques I'm
  going to describe are not the fastest. If that bothers you, don't
  use them.</p>

  <p>Those of us who like to use objects and classes do so, in
  part, in order to manage the complexity of medium to large size
  programs by breaking them into pieces and restricting the way in
  which separate pieces interact with one another. An extra benefit
  of this is that other people can then take some of our pieces and
  use them in their programs, too. The basic idea is to organize a
  program as a set of objects that know various things about their
  own state and can perform certain actions in response to messages
  from other objects asking them to do so. There is no other way
  the object's state can be changed - in anthropomorphic terms, the
  object takes responsibility for organizing its own internal
  state, and doesn't allow any other object or function to change
  it directly.</p>

  <p>The set of actions an object can perform - the set of messages
  it responds to - depends on the sort of object it is, so objects
  can be grouped into classes according to the actions they
  perform. A program can be designed by thinking about the sorts of
  things that it models. These sorts of things are then
  characterized by their behavior, and this leads to a
  specification of some classes. A particular program performs a
  task by creating some objects belonging to these classes, which
  then carries out the desired computation by exchanging messages
  that cause them to carry out actions.</p>

  <p>The well-known object-oriented programming languages such as
  C++, Java, and Oberon implement objects as structures (or
  records) that hold the data values representing the object's
  state, and ensure that these values can only be altered by the
  functions - or <i>methods</i>, as they are more often called in
  the context of object-oriented programming - which implement the
  actions characteristic of the class to which the object belongs.
  The methods provide a well-defined interface to the object. The
  user of the object can only affect it by calling methods (sending
  it messages, if you prefer), never by directly altering the
  values stored in the object structure. This means that the user
  does not need to know how the values are stored, because only the
  external effect of the method matters. (In some languages, it is
  possible to write down a set of equations, or <i>axioms</i>, that
  define the effect of the methods purely in terms of each other,
  without reference to any internal representation at all. You
  can't do this in C++ or Java, though. Or in Perl.)</p>

  <p>This <i>data hiding</i> has several advantages. It leaves the
  implementor of the class free to change the representation at any
  time. As long as the interface is left in place, and the methods
  provide the same external behavior (satisfy the same set of
  axioms) the user of the class will be none the wiser. Thus, if
  there is some compelling reason to change the representation of a
  class, the changes are entirely confined to the definition of the
  class itself. An example would be a class for storing dates,
  which provides methods for doing simple arithmetic on dates
  (adding ninety days, and so on). If a hapless programmer decided
  to store the year as two decimal digits, then when the truth
  finally dawned, the necessary changes would be confined to the
  date class and its methods, not scattered around every program
  that manipulated dates.</p>

  <p>Another advantage concerns debugging. If a program misbehaves
  and preliminary investigations show that some object has an
  unexpected value that is causing the problem, you know that the
  only place you need to look is in the methods of the class to
  which the offending object belongs, because that is the only code
  that can alter the value. If any function at all is able to alter
  the values stored in an object, then all functions are
  potentially suspect (especially if you use global variables).</p>

  <p>Perl has facilities for defining classes and creating objects
  belonging to them (see the online documentation or a good Perl
  book for more details), but, unlike the mainstream
  object-oriented languages it provides no special linguistic
  support for data hiding. Usually, Perl programmers rely on
  documentation, a bit of convention, and common sense.</p>

  <h3>A Simple Example</h3>To see how this works, consider a simple
  example. Suppose you were writing a collection of Perl scripts to
  control the scheduling of events of some sort, and you wished to
  provide an interface resembling the programming controls of a
  domestic VCR. That is, to set up an event, your user would be
  presented with a display showing hours and minutes, and could
  cycle through these using up and down arrows to set a time for
  something to happen. (If you want to be extravagant, let's
  suppose that the purpose of this system is to provide an
  integrated environmental control for all the timed devices in
  someone's house - central heating, VCR, microwave oven, and so
  on.) We won't be concerned with the details of the display here -
  we know it can be done, possibly with Perl/Tk. One of the sorts
  of things that such a program is manipulating is time settings,
  containing a number of hours and a number of minutes. My scenario
  is supposed to suggest that the things you can do to time
  settings are increment or decrement each of the components
  separately; you will also want to be able to get a representation
  of the current time setting as a string.

  <p>Hence, we need a class <tt>TimeSetting</tt>, with methods
  <tt>hrs_up()</tt>, <tt>hrs_down()</tt>, <tt>mins_up()</tt>,
  <tt>mins_down()</tt>, and <tt>value()</tt>. We also need a
  constructor, which I'll call <tt>new()</tt>, to make
  <tt>TimeSetting</tt> objects. I'll give it an initial pair of
  integer values as arguments. (It's trivial to test whether these
  are supplied and set a default otherwise.) Having decided on
  those methods, I know how to use <tt>TimeSetting</tt> objects
  even though I haven't yet decided how to store their values, or
  how to implement the methods.</p>

  <p>Conceptually, there are two sorts of methods: <i>object
  methods</i> and <i>class methods</i>. Object methods are called
  with an object as their first argument, and typically use the
  data stored in that particular object. To distinguish method
  calls from ordinary subroutine calls, a different syntax is
  employed. If <tt>$t</tt> is a <tt>TimeSetting</tt> object, then I
  would increment the hours component like this:</p>
  <pre>
 $t-&gt;hrs_up(); 
</pre>

  <p>The method is sometimes said to be called through the object
  reference that is the value of <tt>$t</tt>. This reference will
  be passed to the method as its first (in this case, its only)
  argument. For constructors, this doesn't work, because there may
  be no object to call the constructor through. Instead, the class
  name is used, once again being passed as an implicit argument to
  the method. Although the same syntax can be used, it is customary
  to use a more readable alternative, called <i>indirect object
  syntax</i>, where the class name is written between the method
  name and any arguments, rather like the filehandle is specified
  with <tt>print()</tt> in <tt>print MYFILE "string"</tt>. I could
  create a <tt>TimeSetting</tt> and assign its reference to
  <tt>$t</tt> like this:</p>
  <pre>
 my $t = new TimeSetting 23, 58; 
</pre>

  <p>The object to which <tt>$t</tt> refers is a
  <tt>TimeSetting</tt> holding two minutes to midnight.</p>

  <p>Now consider the implementation. I'll store the pair of values
  in a hash, using <tt>HOURS</tt> and <tt>MINUTES</tt> as keys, so
  the hash looks like a structure, in a way that is probably
  familiar to you. All the methods live in a package called
  <tt>TimeSetting</tt>, stored in <tt>TimeSetting.pm</tt>, because
  that's how Perl classes work. The constructor initializes the
  hash (it should check its arguments are in range, but I have
  omitted the test to keep the code uncluttered) and returns a
  blessed reference to it, which will serve as the object. If you
  have never worked with Perl's object-oriented features before,
  this may be a little obscure, but it's quite simple. Blessing a
  reference marks the thing it refers to as belonging to a class.
  This means that methods can be called through the reference using
  the object-oriented method call syntax, and their names will be
  looked up in the class.</p>

  <p>Apart from the constructor, the other methods are
  straightforward. Each shifts its first argument, which will be
  the reference through which the method was called; that is, the
  reference to the hash containing the object's data. This is then
  dereferenced, and the value-changing methods do some arithmetic
  on one of the values, while <tt>value()</tt> formats them with
  <tt>sprintf()</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
    package TimeSetting;

    sub new {
        my $class = shift;
        my ($h, $m) = @_;
        return bless {
            HOURS =&gt; $h,
            MINUTES =&gt; $m
        }, $class;
    }

    sub hrs_up {
        my $this = shift;
        ++$this-&gt;{HOURS} &lt; 24 or $this-&gt;{HOURS} = 0;
    }

    sub hrs_down {
        my $this = shift;
        --$this-&gt;{HOURS} &gt;= 0 or $this-&gt;{HOURS} = 23;
    }

    sub mins_up {
        my $this = shift;
        ++$this-&gt;{MINUTES} &lt; 60 or $this-&gt;{MINUTES} = 0;
    }

    sub mins_down {
        my $this = shift;
        --$this-&gt;{MINUTES} &gt;= 0 or $this-&gt;{MINUTES} = 59;
    }

    sub value {
        my $this = shift;
        return sprintf("%02d:%02d", $this-&gt;{HOURS},
                                    $this-&gt;{MINUTES});
    }

    1; 
</pre>

  <p><tt>TimeSetting</tt> is certainly a class, and, provided you
  play by the rules, all the benefits I've advertised will follow
  from its use. For example, I could change the stored
  representation of the time to a number of minutes past midnight,
  without requiring any program that uses <tt>TimeSettings</tt> to
  be changed. Any weird values such as <tt>199:88</tt> can only be
  generated by the methods in this class, so, should such a value
  get thrown out during debugging, I would know where to look.
  (Remember, I&rsquo;ve elided some range checking code from the
  constructor.) Or would I? Only, as I said, if everyone plays by
  the rules. I should have produced some documentation explaining
  how to use <tt>TimeSetting</tt> objects, and I could then
  reasonably expect people to use them correctly. But Perl cannot
  offer any guarantees: the blessed reference is still a reference
  to a hash, as well as being blessed, and it can still be
  dereferenced and indexed. This is legal, if unwise:</p>
  <pre>
    my $t = new TimeSetting 23, 58;
    $t-&gt;{HOURS} = 199;
    $t-&gt;{MINUTES} = 88;
</pre>

  <p>Usually, in the Perl world, we say that anybody who does
  something like that either deserves anything they get or knows
  what they're doing and should not be constrained by repressive
  language rules. I have a lot of sympathy for this point of view,
  but I also have some sympathy for the notion that if a
  programming language can help us avoid mistakes, we should let
  it. Remember that object-oriented techniques are only really
  relevant in large programs, or when we are re-using software
  components. It is then conceivable that deep in a chain of
  subroutine calls, someone might mistake a reference to a
  <tt>TimeSetting</tt> for some other sort of reference, and use it
  in such a way as to violate the <tt>TimeSetting</tt> axioms. And
  then there is deliberate interference. In the Perl community, we
  usually dismiss as paranoia worries about people interfering with
  our code, but there are occasions when such worries are
  justified. The typical scenario is some programmer feeling that
  it is necessary for them to use an object in a way its designer
  didn't intend, but which still seems to be consistent with its
  semantics. For example, somebody might want to extract the hours
  from a <tt>TimeSetting</tt>. Even if they do this in a
  respectable way by deriving their own class and adding the new
  method there, their code will still break if a new version of the
  <tt>TimeSetting</tt> class is produced that uses the
  seconds-after-midnight representation. For a widely-distributed
  class, this could mean a maintenance nightmare for the original
  programmer.</p>

  <p>For circumstances where it might matter if the representation
  of an object is accessed other than through its methods, there is
  a better way of storing data in objects in Perl. It is based on
  closures. Not everybody is familiar with closures, so before
  showing how they can protect data, I will briefly review their
  more conventional use.</p>

  <h3>Closures</h3>In Perl, we can create references to
  subroutines; in particular, we can create references to anonymous
  subroutines, using an expression of the form
  <pre>
 sub { body }
</pre>

  <p>Much like pointers to functions in C, references to
  subroutines effectively allow us to assign a subroutine to a
  scalar variable, store it in an array or hash, or pass it as an
  argument to or return it as the result of another subroutine.
  Perl's references to subroutines are more powerful than C's
  function pointers, because of the way free variables are treated.
  A free variable is one that is not local (where I use the word
  'local' in its conventional, lexically scoped, sense, which has
  little to do with Perl's <tt>local()</tt> function). Since a
  reference to an anonymous subroutine can be created in any
  context in which an expression can be used, it may access the
  local variables of an enclosing block. Consider, for example, the
  following:</p>
  <pre>
sub multiplier {
    my $x = shift;
    return sub {
       return $x * shift;
    }; 
}
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>$x</tt> used inside the anonymous subroutine is the
  local variable <tt>$x</tt> of <tt>multiplier()</tt>. It continues
  to refer to this variable, even after the anonymous subroutine
  has been returned as the result, and even when it is subsequently
  used. If, for example, I call <tt>multiplier()</tt> like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
$doubler = multiplier(2); 
</pre>

  <p>then <tt>$x</tt> will be initialized to 2 within
  <tt>multiplier()</tt>. Hence, the value returned by multiplier is
  a reference to a subroutine that multiplies its argument by 2 - a
  doubler, in fact, so that <tt>&amp;amp;$doubler(5)</tt> is 10. On
  the other hand,</p>
  <pre>
$quadrupler = multiplier(4); 
</pre>

  <p>sets <tt>$quadrupler</tt> to a subroutine that multiplies its
  argument by four. These two subroutines do not interfere with
  each other. The free variable is bound dynamically at the time
  the anonymous subroutine is created, so each value returned by
  <tt>multiplier()</tt> has its own <tt>$x</tt>, set to the value
  of <tt>multiplier()</tt>'s argument.</p>

  <p>If you are used to C's model of function calls, this may seem
  very strange - C functions can't access free variables, and the
  locals of a function cease to exist once control returns from the
  function. However, once you grant that it makes sense to refer to
  free variables (and a long tradition of programming languages
  sanctions the practice) then it also makes sense for a subroutine
  that is returned in this way to go on referring to them.
  Obviously, arranging that everything works properly is a slight
  headache for the language implementors, but it can be done. The
  value of an anonymous subroutine is a thing called a
  <i>closure</i>, which not only holds the code to be executed, but
  also contains the environment in which the closure was created -
  that is, the free variables.</p>

  <p>Closures have many uses. In Perl, one of them is the topic of
  this article: protecting the data of objects from outside
  interference. The key observation is that the free variables of a
  closure created inside a subroutine are the locals of that
  subroutine, and these are out of scope, and therefore truly
  inaccessible, anywhere else. In the example above, the name
  <tt>$x</tt> cannot be used at all outside <tt>multiplier()</tt>
  to refer to the variable initialized at the beginning of that
  subroutine. There are only two ways to access the value of a
  subroutine's local variables from outside the subroutine: one is
  to create a reference to them and pass that out of the
  subroutine, which is inviting interference; the other is to pass
  out a closure which accesses them, which means that access is
  only provided through the code of that closure. And this is just
  what we want with objects: access to the data should only be
  possible through methods.</p>

  <p>There is more than one way to organize the details, but the
  strategy is to store the object's data in local variables of the
  constructor, and use closures, created inside the constructor and
  called from the methods, to perform the actions of the class. To
  make the closures available for subsequent use, I'll store them
  in a hash, and bless a reference to that hash to return as the
  object. My constructor looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my ($h, $m) = @_;
    my %methods;

    $methods{HRS_UP}    = sub { ++$h &lt; 24 or $h = 0  };
    $methods{HRS_DOWN}  = sub {  - $h &gt;= 0 or $h = 23 };
    $methods{MINS_UP}   = sub { ++$m &lt; 60 or $m = 0  };
    $methods{MINS_DOWN} = sub {  - $m &gt;= 0 or $m = 59 };
    $methods{VALUE} = sub { return sprintf("%02d:%02d", $h, $m) };
    return bless \%methods, $class;
}

and the methods now look very simple:

  sub hrs_up {
      my $this = shift;
      &amp;amp;{$this-&gt;{HRS_UP}}();
  } 
</pre>

  <p>...and so on. This class can be used in exactly the same way
  as the previous implementation by programs that only use its
  methods to access objects. Programs that de-reference the object
  and change its data directly will no longer work.</p>

  <p>The scheme is not bulletproof. It is certainly the case that
  the variables <tt>$h</tt> and <tt>$m</tt> can only be changed
  using the methods of this class, which is what I wanted. But like
  any object reference, one returned by this constructor can be
  de-referenced, which leads to some entertaining
  possibilities:</p>
  <pre>
    my $t = new TimeSetting 10, 30;
    my $hu = $t-&gt;{HRS_UP};
    &amp;amp;$hu(); 
</pre>

  <p><tt>$t-&gt;value()</tt> now returns 11:30. We could call this
  a feature, like a <tt>with</tt> statement, but updating an object
  without the object is not really in the spirit of the game. At
  this point, I would be inclined to revert to the Perl
  establishment's approach, and say that anyone who does this wants
  their head examined, but it is possible to guard against it. The
  built-in function <tt>caller</tt> returns, among other things,
  the name of the package from which a subroutine call originated,
  so the closures could check this to see that they had only been
  called from <tt>TimeSetting</tt>. Unfortunately, this check can
  only be made at runtime.</p>

  <p>It's also possible for someone to assign new closures to
  elements of the hash inside a <tt>TimeSetting</tt> object or add
  new elements. Again, we could call this a feature. Doing so would
  not compromise the object's data, but it would, for all intents
  and purposes, change its class dynamically. There are programming
  languages in which you can do this - JavaScript, for example. I
  can't think of a sensible reason to do so (I can't even think of
  a silly reason) but I am aware that some people program in a
  style radically different from mine, so I'm prepared to believe
  that it might be a useful feature. You can, however, prevent it
  by using a variation on the implementation just given. (It is
  essentially this variation that is described in the
  <tt>perltoot</tt> documentation, although there only get/set
  methods are being used, so the methods can be collapsed into a
  single piece of code.) Instead of building a separate closure for
  each method, just build one that selects a different branch to
  execute depending on a key passed as an argument, and return a
  blessed reference to the closure as the object.</p>
  <pre>
sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my ($h, $m) = @_;
    my $methods = sub {
        my $key = shift;
        if    ($key eq HRS_UP)    { ++$h &lt; 24 or $h = 0  }
        elsif ($key eq HRS_DOWN)  {  - $h &gt;= 0 or $h = 23 }
        elsif ($key eq MINS_UP)   { ++$m &lt; 60 or $m = 0  }
        elsif ($key eq MINS_DOWN) {  - $m &gt;= 0 or $m = 59 }
        elsif ($key eq VALUE)  { return sprintf("%02d:%02d", $h, $m) }
    };
    return bless $methods, $class;
  }

sub hrs_up {
    my $this = shift;
    &amp;amp;$this(HRS_UP);
} 
</pre>

  <p>...and so on.</p>

  <h3>What About Inheritance?</h3>My original scheme presents no
  problems for inheritance. Additional closures can be added to the
  hash, and methods to call them can be added to the interface. You
  can't sensibly derive anything from a <tt>TimeSetting</tt>, so
  consider a new example. Suppose we want to create objects to
  connect to different sorts of network resources - to keep things
  manageable, let's say Web pages and FTP sites. A very simple (too
  simple) model could be built by deriving classes for the two
  sorts of resource from a common base class that stored the host
  and pathname components of a URL. Using closures and local
  variables, this might be defined something like this:
  <pre>
    package NetResource;

    sub new {
        my $class = shift;
        my ($host, $path) = @_;
        my %methods;

        $methods{GET_HOST} = sub { return $host };
        $methods{GET_PATH} = sub { return $path };
        return bless \%methods, $class;
    }

    sub get_host {
        my $this = shift;
        &amp;amp;{$this-&gt;{GET_HOST}}();
    }

    sub get_path {
        my $this = shift;
        &amp;amp;{$this-&gt;{GET_PATH}}();
    }

    1; 
</pre>

  <p>I won't let you change the data once a NetResource object has
  been constructed, so there are no methods to assign new values to
  <tt>$host</tt> and <tt>$path</tt>.</p>

  <p>A <tt>HTTPResource</tt> class can be derived, which adds a
  <tt>connect()</tt> method:</p>
  <pre>
    package HTTPResource;

    use NetResource;
    @ISA = qw(NetResource);

    sub new {
        my $class = shift;
        my $this = SUPER::new $class @_;

        $this-&gt;{CONNECT} = sub {
        
        # make the connection using $this-&gt;get_host() and
        # $this-&gt;get_path() to find the components of the URL
        
        };
        return $this;
    }

    sub connect {
        my $this = shift;
        &amp;amp;{$this-&gt;{CONNECT}}();
    }
     
    1; 
</pre>

  <p>Here, you gain nothing from the use of closures, because there
  is no private data in the derived class. For an FTP resource, we
  might want to store a username and password, which makes the
  <tt>FTPResource</tt> class more interesting:</p>
  <pre>
    package FTPResource;

    use NetResource;
    @ISA = qw(NetResource);

    sub new {
        my $class = shift;
        my $this = SUPER::new $class @_;
        my ($user_id, $password) = ($_[2], $_[3]);
        

        $this-&gt;{CONNECT} = sub {
        # make the connection using $this-&gt;get_host() and
        # $this-&gt;get_path() to find the components of the URL
        # and $user_id and $password for identification
        
        };
        return $this;
    }

    sub connect {
        my $this = shift;
        &amp;amp;{$this-&gt;{CONNECT}}();
    }

    1; 
</pre>

  <p>I can use these classes in this manner:</p>
  <pre>
my $web_page = new HTTPResource vwww.macavon.demon.co.uk', 
                                             'index.html';
# use methods from the base class
print "host: ", $web_page-&gt;get_host(), "\n";
print "path: ", $web_page-&gt;get_path(), "\n";
# use a method from the derived class
$web_page-&gt;connect();

my $cpan = new FTPResource 'ftp.demon.co.uk', 
          'pub/mirrors/perl/CPAN', 'Groucho', 'swordfish';
# use a method from the other derived class
$cpan-&gt;connect(); 
</pre>

  <p>You can even do something very C++-like, and move the
  <tt>connect()</tt> method up into the base class, like this:</p>
  <pre>
package NetResource;

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my ($host, $path) = @_;
    my %methods;

    # $methods{GET_HOST}, $methods{GET_PATH}
    # as before
    
    $methods{CONNECT} = sub {
        die "Can't connect to an abstract net resource\n";
    };
    return bless \%methods, $class;
}

sub connect {
    my $this = shift;
    &amp;amp;{$this-&gt;{CONNECT}}();
}

# Other methods as before

1; 
</pre>

  <p>The derived classes no longer need to define a
  <tt>connect()</tt> method - calls to it through
  <tt>HTTPResource</tt> and <tt>FTPResource</tt> objects will find
  <tt>NetResource::connect()</tt> via <tt>@ISA</tt> - but they must
  still assign their closures to the <tt>CONNECT</tt> element of
  <tt>%methods</tt>. This saves you a little typing, but doesn't
  really gain you much else, in the absence of statically typed
  objects in Perl. (If you go along with the idea that Perl is a
  post-modern language, you could take a leaf out of the
  architects' book, and say that you are making an 'ironic
  reference' to pure virtual functions in C++.)</p>

  <p>One thing that may seem problematical to a conventional
  object-oriented Perl programmer is that methods in derived
  classes cannot access the data in the base class. This is
  deliberate. There is little point in protecting this data if all
  that a programmer needs to do to gain access to it is derive a
  new class. Derived classes should only be able to access data in
  their base class through its methods, just like any other code.
  This means that more thought has to go into the design of base
  classes, but object-oriented design is not easy if it is to be
  done properly.</p>

  <p>The more robust variation of the data hiding scheme, using a
  closure as the object itself, is less amenable to inheritance,
  since the closure returned by <tt>new()</tt> cannot be extended.
  Instead, an object would have to store a reference to its parent
  closure, and pass on method calls it could not handle to that.
  This begins to duplicate the built-in inheritance mechanism
  <tt>@ISA</tt>. For this reason, despite its potential for
  oddness, I prefer the original implementation.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>You're probably concerned about the
  inefficiency of the schemes I have described. Basically, you get
  one method call for the price of two, which doesn't sound like a
  good deal. Although this is only a linear slowdown, and a
  sufficiently aggressive optimizer could eliminate the extra call,
  it's worth emphasizing that this approach to objects is only
  worthwhile where correctness, maintainability, and re-usability
  are more important than runtime efficiency or ease of hacking.
  Traditionally this has not been the case. Most Perl scripts are
  short, sharp, and to the point. However, as Perl becomes more
  widely accepted as a serious programming language, and is used
  for more complex tasks, these concerns will become more relevant,
  and, where object-oriented features are used, protecting data
  using closures will be seen as a worthwhile precaution. What is
  interesting to the programming language devotee is that its
  protection is provided not by some special feature based on
  operating system access permissions, but by old-fashioned scope
  alone, and that whereas the data hiding facilities of C++ can be
  undermined in a host of ways, there is no way around the fact
  that if a variable is out of scope, you just can't get at it.

  <p><b>Note</b>: Although the <tt>perltoot</tt> documentation is
  the immediate source of the data hiding scheme described in this
  article, it is not the first example of traditional scope rules
  being applied in a similar way. In particular, Malcolm Atkinson
  and Ron Morrison have described using the 'first class' functions
  and lexical scoping of their programming language PS-Algol to
  provide an effective separation of a class interface from its
  implementation.</p>

  <p>The theory, proposed by the Chapmanian scholar Hauptmann, that
  <i>Perl: The Programmer's Companion</i> is an elaborate forgery,
  written by an embittered Hebridean piper known as MacBean of
  Acharacle, is now widely discredited. <!-- end of file --></p>
