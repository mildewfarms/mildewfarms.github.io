  <h2 align="center">Operator Overloading in Perl</h2>

  <h4><i>Hildo Biersma</i></h4>

  <p>This article describes operator overloading in Perl. Operator
  overloading is a language feature that allows user-defined types
  to act in the same way as built-in types, such as strings and
  numbers. As such, operator overloading is one of the main
  strengths of C++ and one of the most glaring omissions in
  Java.</p>

  <p>This article will start by implementing a simple user-defined
  type, then extend it to act as much like a built-in type as
  possible. After reading it, you will be able to decide how and
  when operator overloading should be used and how to implement
  these features for your own types.</p>

  <h3>Defining Your Own Types</h3>Perl 5 has always allowed you to
  add you own data types to the language via object-oriented
  programming. In this article, we will define our own 'Date' type,
  which stores date stamps with a resolution of one day. It will
  support easy formatting in textual, European, and US formats,
  provide easy comparison between dates and allow simple arithmetic
  on dates.

  <p>We start by defining a simple <tt>Date</tt> class, in its own
  module. The class contains a new method shown below:</p>
  <pre>
# Constructor: get day, month, year, return object
sub new {
    my ($class, %args) = @_;    # Argument checking
    $args{'month'} -= 1;             # should be done here
    $args{'year'} -= 1900;           # and here
&#13;    my $ctime = timelocal(0,0,0, $args{'day'}, 
    $args{'month'}, $args{'year'});
    my $this = { 'ctime' =&gt; $ctime };
    return bless $this, $class;
}
</pre>

  <p>The constructor as shown computes a Unix timestamp and stores
  this inside the object. This is an implementation detail, of
  course; the object might as well store the day, month and year
  values instead of the Unix time. A full implementation would also
  perform error checking and throw an exception if the arguments
  are invalid or incomplete.</p>

  <p>The <tt>Date</tt> class can be used as shown below:</p>
  <pre>
use Date;
&#13;my $d1 = new Date('day' =&gt; 31,  'month' =&gt; 12, 'year' =&gt; 1999);
my $d2 = new Date('month' =&gt; 2, 'day' =&gt; 29,   'year' =&gt; 2000);
&#13;Adding Methods To The Date Class
&#13;Now, to make the class a bit more useful, we add three formatting 
methods that allow us to show the date in a textual format, a US 
format, and a European format:
&#13;# Create a nice string for a date, like "Dec 31, 1999"
sub as_string {
    my ($this) = @_;
&#13;    my ($dd, $mm, $yy) = (localtime($this-&gt;{'ctime'}))[3,4,5];
    $mm = (qw(Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec))[$mm];
    $yy += 1900;
    return "$mm $dd, $yy";
}
    
    
# Return in US format, e.g. 12-31-1999
sub us_fmt {
    my ($this) = @_;
    
    my ($dd, $mm, $yy) = (localtime($this-&gt;{'ctime'}))[3,4,5];
    $mm += 1;
    $yy += 1900;
    return "$mm-$dd-$yy";
}
    
    
# Return in European format, e.g. 31-12-1999
sub euro_fmt {
    my ($this) = @_;
    
    my ($dd, $mm, $yy) = (localtime($this-&gt;{'ctime'}))[3,4,5];
    $mm += 1;
    $yy += 1900;
    return "$dd-$mm-$yy";
}
</pre>

  <p>These methods can be used as shown below:</p>
  <pre>
use Date;
    
my $d1 = new Date('day' =&gt; 31,  'month' =&gt; 12, 'year' =&gt; 1999);
my $d2 = new Date('month' =&gt; 2, 'day' =&gt; 29,   'year' =&gt; 2000);
&#13;foreach my $dateval ($d1, $d2) {
    my $sd = $dateval-&gt;as_string();
    my $ed = $dateval-&gt;euro_fmt();
    my $ud = $dateval-&gt;us_fmt();
    print "Text: $sd; US format: $ud; Euro format: $ed\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>The script generates the following output:</p>
  <pre>
Text: Dec 31, 1999; US format: 12-31-1999; Euro format: 31-12-1999
Text: Feb 29, 2000; US format: 2-29-2000; Euro format: 29-2-2000
</pre>

  <h3>A Minor Problem</h3>A minor problem occurs when we display
  date values without using any of the formatting methods displayed
  above. If you print <tt>$d1</tt>, you will get a string that
  indicates the class, the implementation, and the memory address
  of your object, like this: <tt>Date=HASH(0x80f11fc)</tt>. That's
  not too informative.

  <p>When you use the date values with other operations, e.g.
  numerical addition, numerical subtraction, comparison, or
  sorting, you get unfortunate effects: Perl operates on the values
  generated by converting your object to a string like
  "<tt>Date=HASH(0x80f11fc)</tt>".</p>

  <h3>Introducing Overloading</h3>Operator overloading circumvents
  these problems, because it lets you provide your own versions of
  built-in operations like addition and subtraction. Your new
  (overloaded) versions are automatically invoked in any expression
  involving objects of your class.

  <p>With our <tt>Date</tt> class, overloading can be applied to
  the built-in operators such as conversion-to-text
  ("stringification"), comparison, addition, and subtraction. All
  operator overloading features in Perl use the <tt>overload</tt>
  module, which is a standard part of Perl 5.004 and later
  versions.</p>

  <p>Let's start by adding overloading for the conversion-to-string
  operator. Whenever this is called, we do not want to see things
  like <tt>Date=HASH(0x80f11fc)</tt>; instead, we want to invoke
  the <tt>as_string()</tt> method. We start by altering the Date
  class as follows:</p>
  <pre>
package Date;
    
use overload ('""' =&gt; 'as_string');
</pre>

  <p>That's all you need! From now on, printing a date object
  displays the proper value.</p>

  <p>The syntax for the <tt>overload</tt> module is quite simple:
  following the <tt>use overload</tt>, list the operations to be
  overloaded, followed by their implementation. The implementation
  can either be a reference to a subroutine
  (<tt>\&amp;amp;amp;as_string</tt>), or a string with the name of
  a method to be called (<tt>'as_string'</tt>).</p>

  <p>The difference between supplying a subroutine reference and a
  method name has to do with inheritance: when you supply a
  reference, you make sure the overloaded operator calls that exact
  subroutine, inheritance be damned. When you supply a method name,
  the overloaded operator will call that name and respect
  inheritance. In general, use of method names is preferable.</p>

  <h3>Overloading More Methods</h3>Now that we've seen how to
  overload the stringification operator, let's do more. It would be
  useful if we could add a number of days to a date, e.g. <tt>$day
  + 2</tt>, and have that work properly.

  <p>We start by adding an <tt>add()</tt> method to our
  <tt>Date</tt> class:</p>
  <pre>
# Add an integer number of days to a date
sub add {
    my ($this, $days) = @_;
&#13;    my $retval = { 'ctime' =&gt; $this-&gt;{'ctime'} };
    $retval-&gt;{'ctime'} += $days * 24 * 60 * 60;
    bless $retval, ref($this);
&#13;    return $retval;
}
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>add()</tt> method must take care to build a new
  object, which it modifies and returns. Users wouldn't be happy if
  <tt>$b = $a + 1</tt> modified <tt>$a</tt>! Also, the object is
  built using the two-argument form of bless, making this code safe
  for inheritance. (When called with a derived object, we create a
  new object of the exact same class.) Combined with the
  appropriate change to the <tt>use overload</tt> instruction, this
  allows you to run the program below:</p>
  <pre>
use Date;
    
my $d1 = new Date('day' =&gt; 31, 'month' =&gt; 12, 'year' =&gt; 1999);
my $d2 = $d1 + 1;
my $d3 = 100 + $d1;
print "$d1 $d2 $d3";
</pre>

  <p>The output is shown here:</p>
  <pre>
	Dec 31, 1999 Jan 1, 2000 Apr 9, 2000
</pre>

  <p>But wait! We have <tt>$d1 + 1</tt> as well as <tt>100 +
  $d1</tt> - how does that work?</p>

  <h3>Overloading And Associativity</h3>Whether you call
  <tt>$object + number</tt> or <tt>number + $object</tt>, the same
  method is called. Obviously, the number cannot be asked to add a
  date value to itself and return a new date. This works fine for
  commutative operators such as + and *, where the order of the
  operands doesn't matter. For non-commutative operators like -,
  this is obviously not desired. So Perl adds a third parameter to
  the method being called. This parameter is false if the arguments
  are in the proper order, but true if the parameters are reversed,
  as in the case of <tt>100 + $date</tt>.

  <p>All this allows us to build a proper implementation of the
  subtraction operator. We want to support the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Subtract a number of days from a date, giving a new
    date</li>

    <li>Complain when someone tries to subtract a date from a
    number.</li>

    <li>When two dates are subtracted from each other, show the
    difference in days.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The code below shows how to do this. Note that we've moved the
  cloning of a date into its own method, <tt>copy()</tt>, which is
  also invoked from <tt>add()</tt>. This is just for convenience.
  An alternative design strategy would be to require the
  <tt>Date</tt> class and all derived classes to support a less
  messy <tt>clone()</tt> method.</p>
  <pre>
# Add an integer number of days to a date
sub add {
    my ($this, $days) = @_;
&#13;    my $retval = $this-&gt;copy();
    $retval-&gt;{'ctime'} += $days * 24 * 60 * 60;
&#13;    return $retval;
}
&#13;# Subtract a number of days from a date or subtract two dates
sub subtract {
    my ($first, $second, $reverse) = @_;
&#13;    if (ref($second)) {# Second parameter is a reference
        if (UNIVERSAL::isa($second, 'Date')) {
        my $val = $first-&gt;{'ctime'} - $second-&gt;{'ctime'};
        $val /= 24 * 60 * 60;
        return $val;
}
        confess "Cannot subtract non-date [$second] from [$first]";
    } else {# Second parameter not a reference
if ($reverse) {
    confess "Cannot call [[$second - $first]";
}
my $retval = $first-&gt;copy();
$retval-&gt;{'ctime'} -= $second * 24 * 60 * 60;
return $retval;
    }
}
&#13;
# Copy constructor
sub copy {
    my ($this) = @_;
&#13;    return bless { %$this }, ref($this);
}
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>subtract()</tt> method shown in the sidebar uses the
  <tt>UNIVERSAL</tt> class to determine whether the second object
  is a <tt>Date</tt> object or a derived class, before accessing
  the ctime field inside the object. This code is careful to check
  the type (is this really a <tt>Date</tt> object?), while still
  allowing other classes to be derived from <tt>Date</tt>.
  Alternately, you could support "interfaces" (in the Java design
  style) and assume a <tt>ctime()</tt> method is supported by the
  second object. It all depends on your programming and design
  style.</p>

  <p>Let's use these methods with the following code:</p>
  <pre>
use Date;
&#13;my $d1 = new Date('day' =&gt; 1,   'month' =&gt; 1,  'year' =&gt; 1999);
my $d2 = new Date('day' =&gt; 31,  'month' =&gt; 12, 'year' =&gt; 1999);
my $d3 = $d1 - 1;
my $days = $d1 - $d2;
print "$d1 / $d2 / $d3 / $days\n";
&#13;# The next one dies, so let's see...
eval { 100 - $d1 };
print $@;
</pre>

  <p>We see the following output:</p>
  <pre>
Jan 1, 1999 / Dec 31, 1999 / Dec 31, 1998 / -364
Cannot call [[100 - Jan 1, 1999] at Date.pm line 80
        Date::subtract('Jan 1, 1999', 100, 1) called at date1.pl line 10
        eval {...} called at date1.pl line 10
</pre>

  <h3>Full overloading implementations</h3>A fully overloaded
  user-defined data type needs far more than this. Besides mere
  string conversion and simple arithmetic, you want to be able to
  compare two date objects using ==, &gt;, or <tt>gt</tt>, sort
  objects using Perl's built-in sort function, use more complex
  operators such as += and ++, and cope with calls to undefined
  methods.

  <p>Please refer to the <tt>overload</tt> documentation bundled
  with Perl to see which operators can be overloaded: more than
  fifty are supported. In many cases, this is so much work it's not
  worth the effort. Of course, Perl can help with this as well.</p>

  <h3>Automatically generating overloaded methods</h3>Suppose that
  you do not change the <tt>Date</tt> class above, but invoke:
  <pre>
use Date;
&#13;my $d1 = new Date('day' =&gt; 1,  'month' =&gt; 1, 'year' =&gt; 1999);
$d1++;
$d1 += 5;
print "Date: $d1\n";
</pre>

  <p>Possibly to your surprise, this will work properly. The reason
  is quite simple: Perl is able to build its own implementation of
  the ++ and += operators using the + operator that has been
  defined. As you can guess, the efficiency of these generated
  operators is slightly less than that of hand-crafted methods that
  just modify an existing object, but hey, you get them for
  free.</p>

  <p>In a similar fashion, Perl autogenerates all comparison
  operators if you provide <tt>cmp</tt> and &lt;=&gt;. It creates
  unary minus (negation) from the subtraction operator, and
  supports concatenation using string conversion. This magic
  drastically cuts down the amount of operators you need to
  write.</p>

  <p>The code below defines a single <tt>compare()</tt> method,
  used for string and numerical comparisons. Once this has been
  defined, all Perl comparison operators will work properly.</p>
  <pre>
package Date;
    
use overload ('cmp' =&gt; 'compare',
             '&lt;=&gt;' =&gt; 'compare',
             '""'  =&gt; 'as_string',
             '-'   =&gt; 'subtract',
             '+'   =&gt; 'add');
    
# Compare two values by comparing their ctimes
sub compare {
    my ($first, $second) = @_;
    
    unless (UNIVERSAL::isa($second, 'Date')) {
      confess "Can only compare two Date objects, not $second";
    }
    return ($first-&gt;{'ctime'} &lt;=&gt; $second-&gt;{'ctime'});
}
</pre>

  <h3>The Fallback Mechanism</h3>A question remains: what will Perl
  do if you try to use an operator you haven't defined? Normally,
  Perl will complain and throw a fatal exception. Witness the
  output produced by trying to use the exponentiation operator on a
  <tt>Date</tt>:
  <pre>
Operation '**': no method found,
    left argument in overloaded package Date,
    right argument has no overloaded magic at date2.pl line 4.
</pre>

  <p>As you can see, Perl dies. If you define a useful numerical
  conversion operator (called <tt>0+</tt>) for your class, all
  normal numerical operators could act on that converted numerical
  value. (Obviously, no such useful conversion exists for the
  <tt>Date</tt> class.)</p>

  <p>It turns out Perl can do just that - provided that you allow
  it to. This is done through a <i>fallback</i> mechanism that
  allows Perl to use conversions, followed by the normal
  implementation of all operators. The fallback mechanism is
  enabled at the <tt>use overload</tt> line, and can be set to the
  following values:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>undef</tt>, to automatically generate ++ and += from +,
    but to throw an exception for unknown cases such as **</li>

    <li><i>true</i>, to generate operators and then fall back to
    the normal Perl operators on failure</li>

    <li><i>false</i>, to never generate methods or fall back to
    normal Perl operators</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a silly example, the code below alters the <tt>Date</tt>
  class to turn on fallback and use a numerical conversion that
  generates the weekday number. Now, ** will exponentiate using the
  weekday number.</p>
  <pre>
package Date;
    
use overload ('fallback'  =&gt; 1,
                  '0+'  =&gt; 'to_number',
                  'cmp' =&gt; 'compare',
                  '&lt;=&gt;' =&gt; 'compare',
                  '""'  =&gt; 'as_string',
                  '-'   =&gt; 'subtract',
                  '+'   =&gt; 'add');
# Silly numerical conversion operator
sub to_number {
    my ($this) = @_;
    
    return (localtime($this-&gt;{'ctime'}))[6];
}
</pre>

  <h3>Overloading And Inheritance</h3>Overloading can be combined
  at will with inheritance. Any subclass automatically inherits all
  methods from the parent class and can then go on to override or
  add any operator at will. As an example of this, we'll define a
  <tt>EuroDate</tt> class that behaves exactly the same way as the
  normal <tt>Date</tt> class, except that the string representation
  is now in European format, not text format.
  <pre>
package EuroDate;
    
use strict;
use Date;
use vars qw(@ISA);
    
@ISA = qw(Date);
    
use overload ('""'  =&gt; 'euro_fmt');
    
1;
</pre>

  <p>Everything behaves exactly as you expect.<br>
  In the case of inheritance, there are a few traps that you should
  avoid:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Overload methods by supplying a method name, not a
    subroutine reference. If you supply a code reference, virtual
    methods provided by derived classes will not be invoked.</li>

    <li>When you create new objects, as in the <tt>add()</tt> and
    <tt>subtract()</tt> methods above, make sure you use the
    two-argument form of bless to create objects of the proper
    class.</li>

    <li>When you check the class of an object, don't check the ref
    value, but use the <tt>isa()</tt> method from the
    <tt>UNIVERSAL</tt> class.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Limitations of operator overloading</h3>However simple and
  elegant the Perl operator overloading mechanism may be, it has
  some limitations that C++ doesn't have. The most important of
  these are:

  <ul>
    <li>There is no support for a proper assignment operator or
    copy constructor. Assignment of a reference is therefore always
    a shallow copy. If you define an assignment operator, it is
    only invoked in special circumstances: when you have multiple
    references to the same underlying object, and a mutating
    operator such as += is invoked, then a copy is made first.</li>

    <li>A bug in Perl 5.004_04 and Perl 5.005_02 causes the
    <tt>cmp</tt> operator not to be invoked by default by the
    <tt>sort</tt> function, forcing you to write <tt>sort { $a cmp
    $b } @array</tt>. This will be fixed in a future release.</li>

    <li>You cannot override the "crows-foot" operator -&gt; used
    for method calls and dereferencing.</li>

    <li>You <i>can</i> override array and hash indexing, but you
    must use a different and conflicting mechanism called
    <tt>tie</tt>.</li>

    <li>Since there is no proper copy constructor, the difference
    between pre-increment and post-increment ++ is largely
    academic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>This article has shown you how to use operator
  overloading for your own datatypes. As you've seen, simple things
  can be done very easily, and complex behavior can be created when
  you need to. The Perl overloading mechanism is general, yet
  flexible enough to be applied to your own classes as well.

  <p>So, why are you still debugging using <tt>Data::Dumper</tt>
  and suffering through output of the form <tt>MyType=HASH
  (0xDEADBEEF)</tt>? Why are you still invoking <tt>compare($first,
  $second)</tt> when implementing both <tt>$first == $second</tt>
  and <tt>$first eq $second</tt> would be trivial?</p>

  <h3>References</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>For Perl, the bundled overload documentation (perldoc
    overload) is the definitive reference.</li>

    <li>For operator overloading in general, the C++ language
    reference (Stroustrup) introduces all the concepts you need, as
    well as the C++ implementation &ndash; which is both more
    powerful and less elegant than the Perl version.</li>

    <li>The Math::Complex, Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat modules
