  <h4><i>Johan Vromans</i></h4>

  <p><i>"When you have two copies of a piece of information, at
  least one of them is wrong."</i></p>

  <p>This theorem is often used in information technology to
  emphasize that you should avoid copying information, because when
  you do, you have to spend effort keeping all the copies up to
  date.</p>

  <p>However, copying often cannot be avoided; programs, data
  files, documents, and web pages are frequently copied all over
  the world. This article describes a technique to help keeping
  copies of sets of documents consistent and up to date. Although
  the technique is most widely used in software development, it is
  applicable to virtually any type of data.</p>

  <p><b><tt>diff</tt> and <tt>patch</tt></b></p>

  <p>When people collaborate on a program, how can they keep all
  the programs consistent, so that the changes from different
  people don't conflict? One solution is to ship the latest version
  to everyone after every change, but that's not feasible if the
  program is large. Another solution is to publish changes as
  individual update files in the format generated by the Unix
  <tt>diff</tt> program (also available for Win32; see <a href=
  "tpj0403-0016a.html">Listing 1</a>: How <tt>diff</tt> and
  <tt>patch</tt> Work &amp; <tt>diff</tt> and <tt>patch</tt> for
  Win32 and the Mac). With <tt>diff</tt> and <tt>patch</tt>, you
  can apply someone else's changes to your own program (or
  document, or data file, or web page).</p>

  <p>The <tt>patch</tt> program, which automates the process of
  integrating the update files to a set of source files, was
  written by none other than Larry Wall, author of Perl.</p>

  <p><tt>patch</tt> solved only part of the problem, however.
  Synchronizing two versions of a source tree (or web site)
  requires more than just changing individual source files.
  Sometimes new files need to be created, and obsolete files need
  to be removed. <tt>diff</tt> and <tt>patch</tt> don't do these
  things well.</p>

  <p>In the rest of this article, I'll assume that we're talking
  about a program with multiple files of source code, although the
  techniques apply to any collection of files.</p>

  <h3>The Problem</h3>To properly update a source tree, we need to
  worry about a few things:

  <ul>
    <li>Verify that the update file was not damaged during
    transport over the Internet.</li>

    <li>Apply the changes generated by the <tt>diff</tt> program to
    each source file. This is what the <tt>patch</tt> program
    does.</li>

    <li>Create any new files required. <tt>patch</tt> can do this,
    but some versions can only create files in existing
    directories.</li>

    <li>Create any new directories required. <tt>patch</tt> can do
    this, but some versions can only create directories if new
    files are being created there simultaneously.</li>

    <li>Remove obsolete files. Some versions of <tt>patch</tt> can
    handle this.</li>

    <li>Remove obsolete directories.</li>

    <li>Adjust access (read, write, and execute permissions) of
    files and directories.</li>

    <li>Adjust the file dates (time stamps) of the modified files.
    Some versions of <tt>patch</tt> can handle this under certain
    circumstances.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The <tt>makepatch</tt> Package</h3>The makepatch package
  performs all of the tasks that <tt>diff</tt> and patch don't. It
  contains two Perl programs: <tt>makepatch</tt> and
  <tt>applypatch</tt>. <tt>makepatch</tt> builds a patch kit that
  can be applied reliably; <tt>applypatch</tt> integrates the patch
  kit on the receiving end.

  <p>This article describes version 2.00a of the <tt>makepatch</tt>
  package.</p>

  <h3>Generating The Patch Kit</h3><tt>makepatch</tt> generates a
  patch kit from two source trees: the original, and the new tree.
  Here's how it does that:

  <ul>
    <li>It traverses the tree directories and runs the
    <tt>diff</tt> program on each pair of corresponding files,
    accumulating the output into a patch kit.</li>

    <li>It knows about certain conventions for patch kits. For
    example, it knows that the list of files is usually specified
    in a file called <tt>MANIFEST</tt>. If a file named
    <tt>patchlevel.h</tt> exists, it is handled first so
    <tt>patch</tt> can verify the version of the source tree.</li>

    <li>To deal with the imperfect versions of <tt>patch</tt> out
    there, it supplies <tt>Index</tt>: and <tt>Prereq</tt>: lines
    so that <tt>patch</tt> can unambiguously locate the files to
    patch and verify them if possible.</li>

    <li>Last but not least, it relocates the <tt>patch</tt> to the
    current directory to avoid problems when patch needs to create
    new files.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The generated patch kit is valid input for the <tt>patch</tt>
  program, making use of <tt>patch</tt>'s feature of ignoring
  everything it does not understand.</p>

  <p>As a special service, <tt>makepatch</tt> prepends a small
  shell script to the patch kit that, when fed to a standard Bourne
  shell, creates the necessary directories and files and removes
  obsolete ones. Of course, this requires that the receiving
  platform supports both the shell and Unix filename conventions,
  so the shell script is pretty much useful only for Unix. These
  limitations can be overcome by using the <tt>applypatch</tt>
  utility instead.</p>

  <h3>Applying the patch kit</h3><tt>applypatch</tt> takes care of
  everything that <tt>patch</tt> doesn't:

  <ul>
    <li><tt>applypatch</tt> verifies that the patch kit is complete
    and has not been corrupted during transfer.</li>

    <li>It applies some heuristics to verify that the directory in
    which the <tt>patch</tt> is going to be applied really does
    contain a source tree.</li>

    <li>It creates new directories and files as necessary.</li>

    <li>It applies the patch by running the <tt>patch</tt> program
    for you.</li>

    <li>Upon completion, obsolete files, directories, and
    <tt>patch</tt> backup files (<tt>.orig</tt> files) are removed.
    The access modes of new files are set, and the timestamps of
    all the modified files are adjusted.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To allow <tt>applypatch</tt> to do its job, <tt>makepatch</tt>
  appends additional information (like checksums) to the patch
  kit.</p>

  <p><tt>applypatch</tt> only requires Perl and <tt>patch</tt>; no
  other operating system support is necessary. This makes it
  possible to apply patches on any operating systems supporting
  these two programs.</p>

  <h3>General Usage</h3>Suppose you have an archive
  <tt>pkg-1.6.tar.gz</tt>, containing the sources for the
  <tt>pkg</tt> package version 1.6. You also have a directory tree
  <tt>pkg-1.7</tt> containing the sources for version 1.7. The
  following command generates a patch kit that updates the 1.6
  sources into their 1.7 versions:
  <pre>
     makepatch pkg-1.6.tar.gz pkg-1.7 &gt; pkg-1.6-1.7.patch 
</pre>

  <p>By default, <tt>makepatch</tt> provides a few lines of
  progress information:</p>
  <pre>
    Extracting pkg-1.6.tar.gz to /tmp/mp21575.d/old ...
    Manifest MANIFEST for pkg-1.6 contains 1083 files.
    Manifest MANIFEST for pkg-1.7 contains 1292 files.
    Processing the filelists ...
    Collecting patches ...
      266 files need to be patched.
      216 files and 8 directories need to be created.
      7 files need to be removed.
</pre>

  <p>To apply the generated patch kit, go to the directory
  containing the 1.6 sources and feed the kit to applypatch:</p>
  <pre>
    cd old/pkg-1.6
    applypatch pkg-1.6-1.7.patch 
</pre>

  <p><tt>applypatch</tt> verifies that it is executing in the right
  place and makes all neccessary updates. The program provides no
  feedback information by default.</p>

  <p>Over the last couple of years, <tt>makepatch</tt> has been
  used extensively by several developers and teams all over the
  Internet, including the Perl 5.6 development team. The program
  has evolved from a simple wrapper around the <tt>diff</tt>
  program to a tool that provides a lot of interesting features for
  everyone involved in maintaining source documents. I'll mention
  just a few of these.</p>

  <h3>Fetching Source Files From Archives</h3>The set of sources
  <tt>makepatch</tt> operates on need not be explicitly present on
  disk. <tt>makepatch</tt> can process files that are archived in
  any of several popular archive formats (<tt>.tar</tt>,
  <tt>.tar.gz</tt>, <tt>.tgz</tt>, <tt>.tar.bz2</tt> and
  <tt>.zip</tt>). Other archive formats can be easily added without
  changing the program.

  <h3>Selecting The Source Files</h3>The list of files constituting
  the source tree can be specified in a <tt>MANIFEST</tt> file, but
  it can also be generated on the fly by recursively traversing the
  source tree. File names can be excluded using shell style
  wildcards and Perl regular expression patterns. There are
  predefined patterns to exclude the <i>version control files</i>
  generated the revision control systems, and they can be activated
  with a single command line option.

  <h3>A Word About Manifest Files</h3>

  <p>A manifest file lists the files comprising a package. Manifest
  files are traditionally called <tt>MANIFEST</tt> and reside in
  the top level directory of the package. Although there is no
  formal standard for the contents of manifest files,
  <tt>makepatch</tt> uses the following rules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the second line of the manifest file looks like a
    separator line (for example, it's empty, or contains only
    dashes), it is discarded and so is the first line.</li>

    <li>Empty lines and lines that start with a # are ignored.</li>

    <li>If there are multiple space-separated "words" on a line,
    the first word is considered to be the filename.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>makepatch Options</h3><tt>makepatch</tt> accepts lots of
  options. Full detail is available in the documentation provided
  with the package, but here are brief descriptions:

  <ul>
    <li><tt>-description text</tt> provides descriptive text for
    the patch.</li>

    <li><tt>-diff command</tt> uses <tt>command</tt> to generate
    the differences between the two versions of the files.</li>

    <li><tt>-patchlevel pfile</tt> specifies an alternate file to
    be used in lieu of <tt>patchlevel.h</tt>.</li>

    <li><tt>-automanifest mfile</tt> specifies an alternate
    manifest file.</li>

    <li><tt>-nomanifest</tt> says not to use a manifest file.</li>

    <li><tt>-manifest mfile</tt> indicates the name of the current
    manifest file.</li>

    <li><tt>-oldmanifest omfile</tt> indicates the name of the
    manifest file for the old source tree. It's meant to be used in
    conjunction with <tt>-newmanifest</tt>.</li>

    <li><tt>-newmanifest nmfile</tt> indicates the name of the
    manifest file for the new source tree.</li>

    <li><tt>-[no]recurse</tt> prevents recursion beyond the initial
    directories.</li>

    <li><tt>-[no]follow</tt> traverses symbolic links to
    directories as if they were real directories.</li>

    <li><tt>-infocmd command</tt> adds the output of
    <tt>command</tt> before each patch chunk.</li>

    <li><tt>-exclude pattern</tt> excludes files that match the
    given shell pattern.</li>

    <li><tt>-exclude-regex pattern</tt> excludes files that match
    the given pattern.</li>

    <li><tt>-[no]exclude-vc</tt> excludes files and directories
    that belong to the CVS, RCS, and SCCS revision control
    systems.</li>

    <li><tt>-extract pattern=command</tt> defines additional
    extraction rules for archives.</li>

    <li><tt>-[file]list</tt> instructs <tt>makepatch</tt> to read a
    manifest file, and outputs the list of files included in the
    manifest.</li>

    <li><tt>-prefix string</tt> prefixes every entry in the
    manifest file with string.</li>

    <li><tt>-nosort</tt> retains the order of filenames from the
    manifest file.</li>

    <li><tt>-[no]ident</tt> reports the program name and
    version.</li>

    <li><tt>-[no]verbose</tt> displays information about
    <tt>makepatch</tt> activity to STDERR.</li>

    <li><tt>-[no]quiet</tt> is the opposite of
    <tt>-verbose</tt>.</li>

    <li><tt>-[no]help</tt> displays a short help message and
    exits.</li>
  </ul>These options needn't be specified on the command line.
  <tt>makepatch</tt> looks for options in the following order:

  <ul>
    <li>The environment variable <tt>MAKEPATCHINIT</tt>. When this
    environment variable is set, its contents are considered to be
    command line options that are processed upon startup. All
    normal options are allowed, plus one: <tt>-rcfile
    filename</tt>.</li>

    <li>On startup, <tt>makepatch</tt> first tries to process a
    file named <tt>/etc/makepatchrc</tt>, if it exists.</li>

    <li>Next, <tt>makepatch</tt> processes a file named
    <tt>.makepatchrc</tt> in the user's home directory, if it
    exists.</li>

    <li>After processing this file, <tt>makepatch</tt> processes a
    <tt>.makepatchrc</tt> in the current directory, if it exists.
    An alternative name for this file can be specified with the
    <tt>-rcfile</tt> option in the <tt>MAKEPATCHINIT</tt>
    environment variable.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In all option files, empty lines and lines starting with ; or
  # are ignored. All other lines are considered to contain options
  exactly as if they had been supplied on the command line.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Finally, <tt>makepatch</tt> looks for options on the
    command line.</li>
  </ul>For an extensive list of the possible options, see the
  <tt>makepatch</tt> documentation.

  <h3>Current status and future directions</h3>The current version
  of the <tt>makepatch</tt> package is 2.00a found at
  <tt>authors/id/JV/makepatch-2.00a.tar.gz</tt> on the CPAN. It
  requires Perl 5, and a suitable version of the <tt>diff</tt> and
  <tt>patch</tt> programs.

  <p>The next version of <tt>applypatch</tt> will apply its own
  patches, eliminating the need for the <tt>patch</tt> program.
  Also, a future version of <tt>makepatch</tt> might be able to
  generate the patch information, eliminating the need for the
  <tt>diff</tt> program on the source platform. This will be
  especially interesting for users on platforms like Windows, where
  these programs are not available by default.</p>
