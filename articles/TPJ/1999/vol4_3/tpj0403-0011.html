  <h2 align="center">Turning a Perl Program into an NT Service</h2>

  <h4><i>Kevin Meltzer</i></h4>

  <p>One of the most frequently asked questions about Perl for
  Win32 is how to make a Perl program run as a Windows NT Service.
  An NT Service is like a Unix daemon: it's a long-lived background
  process that accommodates requests, or performs specific tasks.
  For example, web and FTP servers can be set up as NT Services:
  they stay running even when no user is logged on, and start up
  automatically when your computer boots. This article will give
  step by step instructions on how to run a Perl program as an NT
  Service.</p>

  <h3>What's Needed</h3>There are two utilities needed to run a
  Perl program as a NT Service; srvany.exe and <tt>instsrv.exe</tt>
  (henceforth called <tt>srvany</tt> and <tt>instsrv</tt>).
  <tt>instsrv</tt> installs an instance of <tt>srvany</tt> as an NT
  Service; through the rest of the setup process described below,
  that instance of <tt>srvany</tt> runs the Perl program.

  <p>These utilities are included with the NT Resource Kit, and can
  also be found on the web. <tt>srvany</tt> can be downloaded at
  <a href=
  "ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/%20reskit/nt40/i386/srvany_x86.exe"
  target=
  "resource window">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/
  reskit/nt40/i386/srvany_x86.exe</a>, and both <tt>instsrv</tt>
  and <tt>srvany</tt> can be downloaded from <a href=
  "ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/%20bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt35/i386/"
  target="resource window">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/
  bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt35/i386/</a>. Those are the
  NT3.5 Resource Kit Utilities, but the <tt>srvany</tt> and
  <tt>instsrv</tt> you'll find there will work fine under NT
  4.0.</p>

  <p>The <tt>srvany</tt> program is what allows your Perl program
  to run as if it were an NT Service. Even though the Perl program
  itself isn't a "true" NT Service, it emulates one, and can be
  controlled as if it were one.</p>

  <h3>A Simple Example</h3>Below is a brief program that monitors a
  directory, in this case <tt>c:\temp</tt>, for files with the
  extension <tt>.foo</tt>. After finding any such files, the
  program deletes them. This is a simple script, just meant to show
  how a Perl program used as an NT Service can repeat a task over
  and over. If you try this example out, create a file with the
  extension <tt>.foo</tt> and move it into <tt>c:\temp</tt> to see
  the Service in action.
  <pre>
    # c:\perl\lib\MyService.pl

    $dir = "c:\\temp";
    while (1) {
        opendir(DIR,$dir) || die "can't opendir $dir: $!";
        while(my $file = readdir(DIR)) {
            unlink qq($dir\\$file) if $file=~/\.foo$/i;
        }
        sleep(3);
        closedir DIR;
    } 
</pre>

  <h3>Installing the NT Service</h3>Much of the setup process
  involves editing the NT Registry. If you do not feel comfortable
  doing this by hand, take advantage of the registry script
  provided below. The registry script creates all the values needed
  to run the Perl program as an NT Service. However, before editing
  the registry, <tt>srvany</tt> needs to be initialized by
  <tt>instsrv</tt>. The <tt>instsrv</tt> program starts srvany as
  an NT Service, and then after certain registry changes take
  effect, <tt>srvany</tt> will run your Perl program. The entire
  process can be done with the following nine steps.

  <p>1. To install <tt>srvany</tt>, open a command shell by
  clicking Start, then Run, and finally typing <tt>cmd</tt>. In the
  console window, type:</p>
  <pre>
    INSTSRV NAME_OF_SERVICE C:\WINNT\SRVANY.EXE     
</pre>

  <p>(If <tt>srvany</tt> is not located in <tt>C:\WINNT</tt>, this
  command needs to be changed accordingly.) This initializes an
  instance of <tt>srvany</tt> as an NT Service with
  <tt>NAME_OF_SERVICE</tt> as the Service name.
  <tt>NAME_OF_SERVICE</tt> might be the name of the Perl program
  being used ("example.pl"), or any other descriptor ("Monitor Temp
  Directory for foo extensions"). This name will appear under the
  Services application in the Control Panel.</p>

  <p>1.5. The registry script shown later performs steps 2 through
  7.</p>

  <p>2. The next step is to edit the Windows NT Registry using
  RegEdit. This can be started by clicking on Start, then Run, and
  typing <tt>regedit</tt>.</p>

  <p>3. Now locate the
  <tt>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NAME_OF_SERVICE</tt>
  registry key. The key can be found by either maneuvering through
  the registry tree, or by searching for NAME_OF_SERVICE
  (Edit-&gt;Find). Right click on the key and choose New, then Key.
  This will create what looks like a new folder. Name the new key
  <tt>Parameters</tt>.</p>

  <p>4. Right click on Parameters and select New, then String
  Value. In the space provided, type Application.</p>

  <p>5. Again, right click on <tt>Parameters</tt> and select New,
  then String Value. In the space provided, type
  <tt>AppParameters</tt>.</p>

  <p>6. Right click on Application and choose Modify, then type in
  the path to your Perl binary. For example,
  <tt>c:\perl\bin\perl.exe</tt>.</p>

  <p>7. Next, right click on <tt>AppParameters</tt> and select
  Modify. Enter the path to the program you want run as a Service.
  There are no more required registry changes, so RegEdit can now
  be closed.</p>

  <p>8. Now open the Control Panel and double-click the Services
  application. There should now be a service listed with the name
  of the service you chose in step one. The Startup option should
  be set to Automatic by default, but if it is not, click Startup
  and then Automatic if you want the Service to be started
  automatically when the machine boots. If you do not want it to
  start automatically, choose Manual. It is also best to have it
  log in as the System Account (which should be the default)
  because this way it will run no matter who is logged on to the
  machine, and even if no user is logged on. If appropriate, choose
  a user with the proper permissions for the application for the
  <tt>Log On As</tt> option. To get a little more information on
  Services, choose Start-&gt;Help-&gt;Find, type in
  <tt>Services</tt> and select "To configure startup for a
  service."</p>

  <p>9. Finally, choose the Service from the list of Services, and
  click the Start button to launch it. The program is now running
  as an NT Service.</p>

  <h3>A Little Helper</h3>Some may not feel comfortable with
  editing the registry by hand, so an alternative is to use this
  registry script to do it for you. Simply edit the areas noted in
  the comments, make sure the file has a <tt>.reg</tt> extension,
  and double click it to run.

  <h3>Summary</h3>With a little tweaking, the above example can be
  made into a useful application. For instance, it could be
  modified to monitor network traffic, parse incoming email, or
  maintain a directory in a more useful way than simply removing
  the occasional offending file.

  <p>I do suggest reading the documentation that comes with
  <tt>srvany</tt>, as well as what Microsoft has to say about the
  use of <tt>srvany</tt>. For example, Microsoft suggests stopping
  all Services running via <tt>srvany</tt> before any Service Pack
  installations. After following the instructions in this article,
  take a few moments to browse <a href="http://www.microsoft.com"
