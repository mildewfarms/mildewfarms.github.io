  <p>Many modern programming languages have <i>debuggers</i>, which
  let you examine the internals of your program as it runs. You can
  query the contents of variables to see how they change, or
  monitor how often a subroutine is called. My debugger, ptkdb, is
  a <i>visual</i> debugger. It lets you examine a variable's
  contents by moving your cursor over it, and it lets you set
  breakpoints with the click of a mouse. (A breakpoint is a
  position in your program where the debugger stops execution and
  lets you inspect your program's data structures.)</p>

  <p>There are other visual debuggers for Perl. SolutionSoft and
  ActiveState each make one, but they're only for Windows, and
  they're not free, like ptkdb. Because ptkdb is written in
  Perl/Tk, it works on all flavors of Unix as well as Windows.
  <a href="images/ptkdb1.gif">Figure 1</a> shows ptkdb in
  action.</p>

  <h3>Perl's Debugger</h3>Perl already has a built-in debugger.
  It's part of the standard distribution, and it's
  <i>line-oriented</i> - you type your commands, and you see a
  command prompt as you step through your program line by line, or
  when you hit a breakpoint. You invoke the debugger as follows:
  <pre>
   perl -d myprogram.pl 
</pre>

  <p>Or, to enter the debugger directly without a program at
  all,</p>
  <pre>
   perl -de 0 
</pre>

  <p>This is handy if you just want to execute a series of Perl
  statements without creating an actual program.</p>

  <p>When you run a program with the <tt>-d</tt> switch, Perl stops
  at the first line of code and displays a prompt. You can find out
  all of the options by typing h for help. Perl's debugger might be
  all you ever need, but if you want the convenience of a graphical
  debugger, you can install ptkdb.</p>

  <h3>Installing ptkdb</h3>ptkdb can be downloaded and installed
  from the CPAN at <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/A/AE/AEPAGE/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/A/AE/AEPAGE/</a>.
  The archive contains all the files needed to install ptkdb; you
  can use either the usual module installation process:
  <pre>
    perl Makefile.PL 
    make
    make test
    make install 
</pre>

  <p>Or, you can use the install_ptkdb.pl program, which uses a
  Perl/Tk user interface to guide you through the process.</p>

  <p>If you're unable to install ptkdb into your system's Perl
  library, you can run ptkdb from the directory where you invoke
  Perl:</p>
  <pre>
    cd myprogramdir
    mkdir Devel
    cp ptkdb.pm Devel
    perl -d:ptkdb myprogram.pl 
</pre>

  <h3>Running ptkdb</h3>Once ptkdb has been installed, you can
  debug your programs with it like so:
  <pre>
    perl -d:ptkdb myprogram.pl  
</pre>

  <p>The ptkdb window will appear and the first executable line of
  your program will be highlighted. At this point the debugger has
  stopped the program and is waiting for your command. If you use
  <tt>#!/usr/bin/perl</tt> (or an equivalent) to invoke your Perl
  program, you can add the <tt>-d:ptkdb</tt> immediately afterwards
  to invoke the debugger from inside the program.</p>

  <h3>Code Pane</h3>The left pane of the window is the <i>code
  pane</i>, which displays the Perl program that you're debugging.
  When the debugger hits a breakpointed line of code, this window
  automatically opens to the file and highlights the line. If you
  click on the line numbers along the side you can add or remove
  breakpoints. By default, lines with breakpoints are red.
  Breakpoints can be disabled in the <tt>Brkpts</tt> control panel
  by pushing the appropriate checkbox; disabled breakpoints are
  green. Lines that are not breakable have lines through them.

  <h3>Getting Around</h3>ptkdb has several tools that allow you to
  navigate your code. At the top of the Code window there is a text
  entry with <tt>Goto</tt>, <tt>Search</tt>, and <tt>Regex</tt>
  buttons. If you enter a line number into text box and press the
  <tt>Goto</tt> button, the program scrolls to that line. You can
  search for text with the <tt>Search</tt> box, and specify a
  search pattern with the <tt>Regex</tt> button. These features can
  be helpful for finding your way around programs written by
  others. (The searching and regular expression features are part
  of the Tk::Text widget that comes with Perl/Tk.)

  <h3>Expression Window</h3>The Expression window (the
  <tt>Exprs</tt> tab in the notebook to the right of the code)
  presents a list of expressions. Expressions can be typed into the
  <tt>Enter Expr:</tt> field and then listed as a hierarchical
  list. Every time the debugger interrupts program execution, the
  list of expressions will be reevaluated and displayed as shown in
  <a href="images/ptkdb2.gif">Figure 2</a>. Double clicking on an
  array or hash hides and unhides its members. Entries can be
  deleted with the <tt>Delete Expression</tt> button in the
  <tt>Data</tt> menu, or with Ctrl-D. Another way of displaying
  data (for Tk800 and above) is through <i>hot variable
  balloons</i>. When the debugger stops and you position the cursor
  over a variable such as <tt>$var</tt>, <tt>%var</tt>, or
  <tt>@var</tt> and leave it there for a second, a text balloon
  pops up displaying the value. If you have text selected, it
  evaluates the selected text as an expression and displays the
  result. If you have Gurusamy Sarathy's Data::Dumper module
  (included with Perl 5.005), it formats the contents of the
  variable.

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1</b></font></p>

  <h3>Subs Panel</h3>The <tt>Subs</tt> tab of the notebook brings
  up the subroutine panel, shown in <a href=
  "images/ptkdb3.gif">Figure 3</a>. This panel lists all of your
  modules and subroutines, displayed as a hierarchical list. This
  list is usually pretty long because of the Perl/Tk modules
  included by ptkdb, but you should be able to find your own
  packages easily. The subroutines are always listed with their
  fully qualified names, for example: <tt>main::mySub()</tt>.

  <p align="center"><a href="images/ptkdb3.gif"><img src=
  "images/ptkdb3_sm.gif" align="center" alt="Figure 3" border="0"
  width="150" height="222"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 3</b></font></p>

  <h3>Breakpoints</h3>Clicking the <tt>BrkPts</tt> tab displays the
  breakpoint control panel (<a href="images/ptkdb4.gif">Figure
  4</a>), which provides a list of the breakpoints you've set. The
  checkbox lets you disable a breakpoint, and there are control
  buttons to delete the breakpoint and visit the breakpoint's
  location in the code. The entry box is for a controlling
  expression; whenever the program reaches the breakpoint, the
  debugger evaluates the expression. If the expression is true, the
  debugger stops the program there to let you examine the program's
  variables.

  <p align="center"><a href="images/ptkdb4.gif"><img src=
  "images/ptkdb4_sm.gif" align="center" alt="Figure 4" border="0"
  width="150" height="189"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 4</b></font></p>

  <h3>Saving Configurations</h3>Breakpoints and their conditions
  can be saved between runs of the program: just use the <tt>Save
  Config...</tt> item under the <tt>File</tt> menu. If you use the
  name provided by the dialog box your configuration will
  automatically be reloaded the next time the program starts up.
  ptkdb will also do its best to put the breakpoints back on the
  same lines, even if you've changed the program in the interim.

  <h3>Customizing ptkdb: Startup Files and X resources</h3>When
  ptkdb launches, it checks for three startup files: a system
  startup file, a user startup file in your home directory, and a
  startup file in the directory from which Perl was started. Each
  of these files can contain a Perl program that will be run before
  the debugger stops at the first line of the program. ptkdb also
  provides functions that can be called to set breakpoints, set
  conditions, enter expressions, and customize the text in the code
  pane. Refer to the ptkdb pod documentation for details.

  <p>If you're using the X window system, you can customize fonts
  and colors with X resources. This includes fonts and colors; see
  your system's <i>xrdb</i> documentation for instructions. Windows
  users can now add X resources if their version of Perl/Tk is
  800.012 or higher. Fonts can be selected with the <i>xfontsel</i>
  utility.</p>

  <p>For example, say you wish to change the font that the code is
  displayed in. Open the <tt>.Xdefaults</tt> or
  <tt>.Xresources</tt> file in your <tt>$ENV{'HOME'}</tt> directory
  and add the following line: <tt>ptkdb.frame2.frame1.rotext.font:
  fixed</tt>. (Change <tt>fixed</tt> to whatever font specification
  you would like to use.) Other fonts can be set individually, or
  you can use <tt>ptkdb*font</tt> to specify all of them. The
  documentation contains a commented example section of
  <tt>.Xdefaults</tt> that you can use as a guide.</p>

  <h3>Debugging Web Programs with ptkdb</h3>One of the most
  valuable features of ptkdb is that it can be used to debug Perl
  CGI pages as they run on a web server. In fact, if your server is
  Unix, you can use ptkdb to debug these programs across a network.

  <p>In order to use ptkdb with your web server you have to have
  Perl/Tk and ptkdb installed in the same place that your server is
  getting its Perl libraries from, which isn't always the case in
  some installations. If all else fails, you can always create your
  own private installation of Perl (called, say, <tt>myperl</tt>),
  Perl/Tk, and ptkdb - about 18 meg in all. If you are going to be
  debugging on a different workstation than the web server using X,
  make sure that the web server has permissions to open XWindows on
  your workstation; typically this just requires you to type
  <tt>xhost +webserverName</tt>.</p>

  <p>At the top of your CGI program you probably have a line such
  as this:</p>
  <pre>
    #!/myperlPath/perl
</pre>

  <p>Change it to:</p>
  <pre>
    #!/myperlPath/perl -d:ptkdb 
</pre>

  <p>If you're on a different workstation than the web server
  you'll have to add this subroutine to the beginning of your CGI
  file:</p>
  <pre>
    sub BEGIN {
        $ENV{'DISPLAY'} = 'myWorkStation:0.0';
    } 
</pre>

  <p>This subroutine will be executed before the debugger is
  invoked, setting the display to your workstation for the ptkdb
  debugging window to appear. Once all of this is set up, open the
  web page that invokes your CGI program. It will take a few
  seconds for the debugger to load and bring up the window. When
  the window opens on your workstation, you're ready to debug.</p>

  <h3>The Future of ptkdb</h3>Many people have volunteered to add
  features to ptkdb; while these offers of assistance are
  appreciated, ptkdb has enough major features installed for now;
  I'm more concerned with keeping it stable and reliable.

  <p>The current plan is to allow version 1.10X to mature and
  stabilize. Bugs will be fixed and minor incremental improvements
  added. Version 1.2 will provide listings of lexical variables,
  better Perl/Tk application debugging, and perhaps actions or
  watchpoints, if enough people ask for them. Once these have been
  added, tested, and deployed, ptkdb 1.2 may find its way into the
  Perl/Tk distribution, if the Perl/Tk group is willing.</p>

  <p>Version 2.0 is being planned: a top to bottom rewrite of the
  entire system. The goal is to let third parties add independent
  modules to ptkdb. This would open up the ptkdb project to people
  who wish to contribute in a way that won't chain ptkdb to the
  success or failure of their individual efforts.</p>
