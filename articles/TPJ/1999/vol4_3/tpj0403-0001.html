  <h3>Goings-on</h3>"You're on the Island of Conclusions."

  <p>"But how did we get here?" asked Milo.</p>

  <p>"You jumped, of course," explained Canby. "That's the way most
  everyone gets here. It's really quite simple: every time you
  decide something without having a good reason, you jump to
  Conclusions whether you like it or not. It's such an easy trip to
  make that I've been here hundreds of times."</p>

  <p>"But this is such an unpleasant-looking place," Milo
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's true," admitted Canby; "it does look much better
  from a distance."</p>

  <p>--- The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster</p>

  <p><b>Microsoft</b> is now supporting <b>ActiveState</b>, the
  folks who produce ActivePerl and Perl tools for Win32, for Perl
  development and support.</p>

  <p>Of course, ActiveState has already been developing Perl for
  some time, but the Win32 Perl port is lacking in some key areas
  that Microsoft wants improved. The deal will bring a fork to
  Win32 Perl for the first time, implemented using threads and
  multiplicity. Since this code will be part of the Perl source, it
  will be under the same licensing as the rest of Perl, and other
  forkless platforms (VMS, Mac OS) could benefit too. The deal will
  also include globalization work, including Unicode support for
  %ENV and @ARGV strings, and Microsoft Installer support and
  PerlScript performance boosts (PerlScript is an ActiveX scripting
  engine).</p>

  <p>Many users on web sites, mailing lists, and Usenet criticized
  the move, saying that Microsoft is beginning to "embrace and
  extend" Perl. Some cited the fact that Microsoft is now paying
  ActiveState, which employs the current head of Perl development,
  <b>Gurusamy Sarathy</b>, and expressed fears that Microsoft would
  control Perl development. Others believed Microsoft would
  introduce a proprietary or incompatible version of Perl.</p>

  <p>Some members of the <b>perl5-porters</b> mailing list voiced
  their support for Sarathy and the deal. There was initial concern
  from some members, but their fears seemed to be allayed after a
  brief discussion. Noted Unix advocate <b>Tom Christiansen</b>
  said Win32 Perl being able to fork is a "tremendous thing," and
  added, "I'd say to reserve one's fears until there's something to
  fear." ActiveState CEO <b>Dick Hardt</b> emphasized that the
  Microsoft deal is good for Perl, and there isn't any real danger
  from Microsoft through the deal. "They're not controlling
  anything we're doing," he said.</p>

  <p>More information can be found on the ActiveState web site
  (<a href="http://www.activestate.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.activestate.com/</a>) including the
  press release and FAQ. Development under the deal has already
  begun, and a beta of the next version of Perl, 5.6, will include
  at least some of the Microsoft-funded code.</p>

  <p>"What's this," you say, "about 5.6?" The next version of Perl
  will sport a new versioning system. Rather than 5.006 and
  5.006_01, it will be called 5.6 and 5.6.1. Comparisons will
  likely be overloaded, so version 5.10 (should we get that far)
  will be greater than 5.6.</p>

  <p>Sarathy said that he is aiming for a beta release by August
  19th, right before the Perl Conference. The current stable
  releases of Perl are still 5.004_05 and 5.005_03, both being
  maintained by <b>Chip Salzenberg</b>. At the time of this
  writing, the most recent development version if 5.005_60.</p>

  <p>Richard Foley maintains the <b>perlbug database</b>, which
  tracks bugs sent to <a href=
  "mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a>. The database is
  online for perusal at <a href=
  "http://www.perl.org/perlbug/pbdb.cgi" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.org/perlbug/pbdb.cgi</a>, and
  has been recently extended to track bugs for multiple
  platforms.</p>

  <p><b>Perl Conference 3.0</b> (<a href=
  "http://conference.oreilly.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://conference.oreilly.com/</a>) came and
  went in August, but since this column's deadline came and went
  before TPC started, there's not much to say. The Monterey
  conference will include (included?) keynote addresses from former
  Apple guy Guy Kawasaki and Sun legend Bill Joy, with a full
  two-day program of Perl sessions (and two full days of sessions
  on Linux, Python, Apache, sendmail, and Tcl if participants
  somehow manage to get bored with the available Perl fare).</p>

  <p>The first annual <b>yet another perl conference</b> (<a href=
  "http://www.yapc.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.yapc.org/</a>) was a big hit. The
  June conference kicked off with a keynote by <b>Larry Wall</b>,
  which organizer and TPJ contributor <b>Kevin Lenzo</b> said
  helped legitimize the affair. Lenzo announced that next year the
  conference would once again be held at Carnegie Mellon
  University, with even greater access to facilities than this
  year, allowing for more attendees.</p>

  <p>Can we all handle one more event? <b>Camp Camel</b> (<a href=
  "http://www.inlink.com/~perlguy/campcamel/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.inlink.com/~perlguy/campcamel/</a>)
  is being sponsored by <b>Perl Mongers</b> (<a href=
  "http://www.pm.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.pm.org/</a>). It will be a free
  getaway for Mongers, held September 17&ndash;19 near
  Weyerhaeuser, Wisconsin.</p>

  <p>Perl Mongers and ActiveState announced a forthcoming CD-ROM at
  yapc, which will contain documents and resources for using Perl,
  and should be available soon (if it isn't already). Perl Mongers
  also announced the <b>White Camel Awards</b>, to be presented at
  the Perl Conference. They were presented to the "unsung heroes"
  who have devoted extraordinary time, creativity, and energy for
  non-technical work for the Perl community: Tom Christiansen,
  Kevin Lenzo, and Adam Turoff.</p>

  <p>Would you like to be a monger? Lots of new groups, as always,
  are forming. Most recent additions include, in these 50 states:
  Annapolis, Burbank, Cambridge MA, Columbus OH, Detroit, Elkins
  WV, Green Bay WI, Hanford CA, Harrisburg PA, Indianapolis, Irving
  TX, Kalamazoo MI, Louisville KY, Middletown NY, Milwaukee,
  Richmond IN, Sacramento, San Bernardino CA, San Jose CA, Sarasota
  FL, and Springfield MA.</p>

  <p>And abroad: Bathgate (Scotland), Berlin, Bratislava
  (Slovakia), Cape Town, Donetsk (Ukraine), Dunedin (New Zealand),
  Edinburgh, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain), Lucerne
  (Switzerland), Maceio (Brazil), Manchester (United Kingdom),
  Munich, New South Wales (Australia), Nottingham (UK), Porto
  (Portugal), South Wales (UK), Torino (Italy), Varese (Italy), and
  Wageningen (Netherlands).</p>

  <p>Some new books are hitting the shelves. Damian Conway's
  <b>Object Oriented Perl</b>, available from Manning Publications,
  is the first book devoted to OOP in Perl. Not to be outdone,
  O'Reilly has <b>Mastering Algorithms in Perl</b> by Jon Orwant,
  Jarkko Hietaniemi and John Macdonald, the first book devoted to
  algorithms in Perl. O'Reilly also has, for the programmer on the
  go, <b>The Perl CD Bookshelf</b>, which includes <b>Perl in a
  Nutshell</b>, <b>Programming Perl</b>, <b>Perl Cookbook</b>,
  <b>Advanced Perl Programming</b>, <b>Learning Perl</b>, and
  <b>Learning Perl for Win32 Systems</b> all on one CD-ROM. Okay,
  the CD-ROM is kinda-sorta not a book. So as a bonus, you can get
  something peripherally related to Perl, the new O'Reilly title
  <b>MySQL &amp; mSQL</b>.</p>

  <p>What else is new around the Internet? O'Reilly's <b><a href=
  "http://www.perl.com" target=
  "resource window">www.perl.com</a></b> has a new look with easier
  access to software, references, and documentation, daily recipes
  from the Perl Cookbook, news items, and Larry quotes. Elaine
  Ashton has <b>CPAST</b>, the Comprehensive Perl Arcana Society
  Tapestry (<a href="http://history.perl.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://history.perl.org/</a>). The name doesn't
  exactly say it, but as the acronym hints, the site is devoted to
  Perl history. Jeff Pinyan's <b>CRAP</b> is the Crusade to
  Reconstruct Awful Programs (<a href=
  "http://www.crusoe.net/~jeffp/perl/crap/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.crusoe.net/~jeffp/perl/crap/</a>).
  The name and acronym say it all.</p>

  <p>Along similar lines, Vicki Brown has the <b>Fun With Perl</b>
  list, devoted to code snippets, good and bad, that are remarkable
  for some reason. Send the body "subscribe" to <a href=
  "mailto:fwp-request@technofile.org">fwp-request@technofile.org</a>.
  In other list news, the MacPerl list archives are now online at
  <a href="http://bumppo.net/lists/mp.html" target=
  "resource window">http://bumppo.net/lists/mp.html</a> (including
  a Sherlock plugin) thanks to Nathaniel Irons, and Sean Burke has
  a list for the <b>MIDI-Perl</b> distribution at <a href=
  "mailto:midiperl-request@maths.ex.ac.uk">midiperl-request@maths.ex.ac.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Moving right along the ether, a new online periodical devoted
  to Perl, PerlMonth, has been going along steadily since May.
  <b>PerlMonth</b> (<a href="http://www.perlmonth.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perlmonth.com/</a>) has an excellent
  group of authors, including several TPJ authors, and covers a
  wide range of topics each month.</p>

  <p>Byte Bits</p>

  <p>Mark-Jason Dominus' <b>Tie::HashHistory</b> interposes itself
  between your program and a tied hash. Fetching and storing seem
  completely normal, but the module keeps a record of all the
  changes to the each key, and it can return a list of all the
  values the key has ever had, in chronological order.</p>

  <p><b>Tangram</b> from Jean-Louis Leroy makes objects persist in
  relational databases, and provides facilities for retrieving and
  filtering them. <b>Persistence::Object::Simple</b> is from Vipul
  Ved Prakash and provides persistence via <b>Data::Dumper</b>.</p>

  <p>Sean M. Burke released a couple of modules for dealing with
  classes, <b>Class::Classless</b> and <b>Class::BlackHole</b>. The
  former provides a framework for classless OOP, and the latter is
  a base class allowing unhandled method calls to be treated as
  no-ops. Benjamin Franz released <b>Class::ParmList</b> and
  <b>Class::NamedParams</b>, base classes for working with named
  parameters.</p>

  <p>Franz also released <b>Search::InvertedText</b>, an inverted
  indexing system suitable for medium scale searching. It requires
  his aforementioned Class:: modules, along with his modules
  <b>Tie::DB_File::SplitHash</b> (splits DB files into multiple
  files) and <b>Tie::FileLRUCache</b> (which implements a simple
  Least Recently Used cache).</p>

  <p><b>MandrakeSoft</b> is working on a project called
  <b>DiskDrake</b>, a hard disk partitioning system for Linux,
  written entirely in Perl/Gtk. See <a href=
  "http://www.linux-mandrake.com/diskdrake/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.linux-mandrake.com/diskdrake/</a>
  for more information.</p>

  <p>Metrowerks' flagship product <b>CodeWarrior</b>, a C, C++, and
  Java IDE for Windows and Mac OS, has a Perl plugin on the Pro 5
  Reference CD-ROM that allows scripting of builds and access to
  the IDE with Perl.</p>

  <p><b>BBEdit</b>, the popular Mac OS text editor, has built-in
  support for MacPerl in version 5.1. Perl programs (including
  droplets, runtimes, and all other types) can be opened and saved
  directly from BBEdit. From the MacPerl menu, one can run or
  syntax check a program, with errors optionally going to the
  BBEdit error browser. The HTML preprocessor can now call Perl
  programs, and Perl filters can be used to process the contents of
  a text window.</p>

  <p>Also released for MacPerl use is an updated <b>cpan-mac</b>,
  with tools and modules for using CPAN and installing modules. A
  new document <b>macperlmodinstall</b> discusses how to use these
  and other tools to download and install modules for use with
  MacPerl. Released into beta was <b>Mac::Glue</b>, which provides
  a framework for controlling Mac apps with MacPerl by providing
  vocabulary similar to AppleScript (Apple event terminology
  resources) to MacPerl. All of these are available at <a href=
  "http://pudge.net/macperl/" target=
  "resource window">http://pudge.net/macperl/</a>.</p>

  <p>The <b>Event</b> module, which provides a standard event loop
  for developing event-driven applications, has reached version
  0.51. Joshua N. Pritikin's module requires Perl 5.005_03 or
  greater, and should build on most Unix platforms. There is a
  perl-loop mailing list for discussion, hosted by perl.org.</p>

  <p><b>Crypt::Rot13</b> from Julian Fondren is better than
  tr/A-Za-z/N-ZA-Mn-za-m/ not just because it offers an OOP
  interface, but also because you can rotate the letters at some
  number between 0 and 26 other than 13. Fondren's
  <b>Text::Bastardize</b> corrupts innocent text, with methods for
  censoring inappropriate content, rot13, numerical abbreviations,
  pig Latin, and k3w1t0k.</p>

  <p><b>libxml</b> is a group of modules from Ken MacLeod for
  working with XML.</p>

  <p>Eric Bohlman released <b>Text::Query::Advanced</b> and
  <b>Text::Query::Simple</b>, both deriving from
  <b>Text::Query</b>, for matching text with boolean expressions.
  The advanced and simple modules are similar to the AltaVista
  advanced and simple searches. Loic Dachary wrote
  <b>Text::Query::SQL</b>, for converting queries into SQL
  statements.</p>

  <p>There is Yet Another template module, this one from John
  Porter, called <b>Text::Macros</b>, which allows user-defined
  macro styles in templates.</p>

  <p><b>Jcode</b> from Dan Kogai performs character set
  translations for Japanese (to/from Unicode, kana variants, UTF-8,
  and others). It requires MIME::Base64.</p>

  <p>Russ Allbery wrote <b>Pod::SimpleText</b> as a potential
  replacement for <b>Pod::Text</b> and <b>pod2text</b> in the Perl
  distribution. It uses <b>Pod::Parser</b> instead of implementing
  its own parsing, and can be subclassed easily
  (<b>Pod::Text::Color</b> and <b>Pod::Text::Termcap</b> are
  included).</p>

  <p>Arnar M. Hrafnkelsson wrote <b>File::FDpasser</b> for passing
  open file descriptors between unrelated processes. Arnar also
  wrote <b>Imager</b>, a module for creating high-quality, 24-bit
  images, using external libraries to work with PNG, JPEG, GIF, and
  other formats.</p>

  <p><b>Font:TTF</b>, by Martin Hosken, provides facilities to
  manipulate TTF font files.</p>

  <p>Tuomas J. Lukka wrote <b>Graphics::Simple</b>, a module that
  emulates something like the graphics API provided by Commodore-64
  or VIC-20 in Perl, and can be extended to any number of graphic
  devices. Currently Gnome Canvas and PostScript are supported.</p>

  <p>Ken MacFarlane's <b>Image::DeAnim</b> de-animates animated
  GIFs. It is designed to be used with a proxy server.
  <b>GIFGraph::Map</b> from Roman Kosenko creates image maps for
  use with graphs created with GIFGraph.</p>

  <p><b>Astro::SLA</b> from Tim Jenness provides access to the
  SLALIB library, used by writers of positional-astronomy
  applications. The library contains 171 routines that are mostly
  concerned with astronomical position and time, but some also have
  wider trigonometrical, numerical, and general applications.</p>

  <p><b>SETI::Stats</b> is a module from Martin Hamilton for
  processing SETI@home stats. SETI@home (<a href=
  "http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/" target=
  "resource window">http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/</a>) is the
  Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence at Home program, a
  distributed computing effort to analyze radio telescope data.</p>

  <p>Robert Rothenberg's <b>Bundle::Weather</b> is a collection of
  modules for processing weather information (forecasts,
  observations, and so on).</p>

  <p>Frank Tobin wrote <b>PGP::GPG::MessageProcessor</b> and
  <b>PGP::PGP5::MessageProcessor</b> to encrypt, sign, decrypt, and
  verify messages with GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) and PGP 5 (Pretty
  Good Privacy).</p>

  <p>Doug MacEachern wrote <b>Xmms</b>, a suite of modules to
  control the popular xmms MP3 player, offering an optional shell
  interface to the player. Similarly, <b>Audio::Play::MPG123</b>,
  from Marc Lehmann, controls the mpg123 MP3 player. Joern Reder's
  <b>MPEG::MP3Play</b> (in version 0.01 as of this writing) does
  direct playback of MP3 files, interfacing to the Xaudio SDK.</p>

  <p>Doug also released <b>Apache::DB</b>, which hooks the Perl
  debugger into mod_perl. Ask Bjorn Hansen's
  <b>Apache::Usertrack</b> is a Perl version of the Apache module
  <b>mod_usertrack</b>, and Matt Sergeant's <b>Apache::MimeXML</b>
  is a MIME encoding sniffer for XML files.</p>

  <p>Tom Phoenix wrote <b>List::Permutor</b> to provide all
  possible permutations of a list. Graham Barr re-released the
  <b>builtin</b> distribution as <b>Scalar::List::Utils</b>, a
  package of subroutines that some people have wanted in the Perl
  core.</p>
