  <h2 align="center">Threadsafing a Module</h2>

  <h4><i>Dan Sugalski</i></h4>

  <p>If you've played around much with threaded Perl, you've
  probably already discovered that many of the modules available,
  including some that ship with the base Perl distribution, aren't
  thread safe. And if you've written any modules that have been
  released to CPAN, you've probably already gotten mail from
  someone asking "Is your module thread safe?" This, of course,
  begs the question "How do I make my module thread safe?" a
  question that can seem pretty overwhelming, especially if you've
  got no experience with threads.</p>

  <p>What we're going to do in this article is show you what you
  need to do to make your Perl module thread safe. If you correctly
  implement everything we cover here, your module should be fine.
  Do be aware that we're talking strictly about making a module
  thread safe with a minimum of fuss. This is just the first, and
  easiest, step in taking full advantage of threads.</p>

  <h3>Locking Your Internal Data</h3>The first step to making your
  module thread safe is to use <tt>lock()</tt> to coordinate access
  to variables that might be accessed from more than one thread
  simultaneously. This includes package variables, lexicals
  declared outside the scope of a subroutine, and variables you
  access by reference.

  <p>If your module will be used with Perl 5.005 or higher,
  internal locking is simple. The <tt>lock()</tt> function locks a
  variable if your Perl was built with threads, and is a no-op
  otherwise. That's the easy part.</p>

  <p>If your module is going to run on versions of Perl 5.004 and
  below, things get a bit trickier. The easiest thing to do is put
  this piece of code at the beginning of the module:</p>
  <pre>
BEGIN {
    sub fakelock {};
    if ($] &lt; 5.005) {# $] holds the version number of your Perl
        *lock = \&amp;fakelock;
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>This code will create a <tt>lock()</tt> subroutine that does
  nothing if you're running on a version of Perl below 5.005.</p>

  <p>Once you're set with a <tt>lock()</tt> subroutine, just
  scatter them throughout your code wherever you need to lock
  things. The standard locking rules apply, of course, so if you're
  going to have several blocks that lock multiple variables, you'll
  want to make sure you lock them in the same order in each
  block.</p>

  <h3>Locking Your External Data</h3>Purely internal locking is
  relatively simple, since you've got full control over the source
  and can make whatever changes you need. Things get a bit tricker
  if your module uses package variables as part of its documented
  public interface. When that's the case, you're in the unenviable
  position of making sure code that's not under your control
  synchronizes access to shared resources.

  <p>Luckily, Perl provides you with a way to fix this. The answer
  is to <tt>tie</tt> your globals. This slows down your code, but
  as you're probably not accessing the globals that much the safety
  tradeoff is worth it. The following code chunk demonstrates one
  way to do this, tying the two variables <tt>$DEBUG</tt> and
  <tt>$BEHAVIOR</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
# This should be your real package name
package MyPackage;
use Config;

# Predeclare the variables you want to protect
use vars qw($DEBUG $BEHAVIOR);

BEGIN {
# This only needs to be different from your main package name
# if your main package can be tied to things.
    package MyPackage::ThrSafe;
    sub TIESCALAR {
       my $var;
       my $class = shift;
       return bless \$var, $class;
    }
    sub FETCH {
        my $var = shift;
        lock $var; # Lock goes up one level of reference
        return $$var;
    }
    sub STORE {
        my ($var, $val) = @_;
        lock $var;
        $$var = $val;
        return $val;
    }

# Tie the global variables to our threadsafing package
    if ($Config{usethreads}) {
        tie $DEBUG, 'MyPackage::ThrSafe';
        tie $BEHAVIOR, 'MyPackage::ThrSafe';
    }
} 
</pre>

  <p>As you can see from the example, the tie code is very simple;
  just enough to wrap a lock around the variable access. We also
  only tie <tt>$DEBUG</tt> and <tt>$BEHAVIOR</tt> if we're actually
  running on a threaded Perl (that is, if
  <tt>$Config{usethreads}</tt> is true). And, since the locks are
  only held for the duration of the subroutines, we don't even need
  any <tt>DESTROY</tt> code to clean things up.</p>

  <p>You may be tempted to do the tying only if the Thread module
  has acually been used. That's not a safe thing to do, though -
  our module might have been used <i>before</i> the Thread module,
  or the Thread module might get loaded in at runtime via
  <tt>do</tt>, <tt>require</tt>, or <tt>eval</tt>. Locking Your
  Code</p>

  <p>Sometimes it's more appropriate to lock code rather than data.
  You might, for example, have a subroutine that updates a
  configuration file, and the last thing that you want is to have
  multiple threads running at once. And it's often much simpler to
  lock a single subroutine rather than lock dozens of
  variables.</p>

  <p>Locking a subroutine is simple. If you're running with Perl
  5.005 or higher, make the first line of your subroutine</p>
  <pre>
    use attrs qw(locked); 
</pre>

  <p>and Perl will ensure that only one thread is in the subroutine
  at any one time. If your code might run on older versions of
  Perl, though, you don't want to do that. Instead, make the first
  line of the subroutine</p>
  <pre>
    lock(\&amp;subname); 
</pre>

  <p>where <i>subname</i> is the name of the subroutine being
  locked. The <tt>use attrs</tt> method is slightly faster, but the
  speed difference isn't that noticeable unless you're doing a lot
  of subroutine locking.</p>

  <p>Once the subroutine is locked, you can be sure that no other
  thread can enter it until the lock is released. Subroutine locks,
  by the way, are the only mandatory locks in Perl - when a thread
  locks a subroutine, Perl enforces that lock and will not let any
  other thread into that subroutine until the lock is released.
  While this isn't that big a deal if the subroutine lock is inside
  the subroutine (like we're talking about here), it can be an
  issue if you lock the subroutine someplace else.</p>

  <h3>Locking Your Methods</h3>If your code is object oriented,
  it's more useful to use <i>method locks</i> instead of subroutine
  locks. This allows multiple objects to be running the same
  subroutine simultaneously, but each object will only be in one
  locked subroutine in a single thread.

  <p>Once again, Perl 5.005 and higher provide this functionality.
  All you need to do to get Perl to use method locking rather than
  subroutine locking is to make this the first line of your
  subroutine:</p>
  <pre>
     use attrs qw(locked method); 
</pre>

  <p>and Perl will automatically use method locking instead of
  subroutine locking. If this subroutine is called as a method on
  an object, Perl will lock the object. If called as a static
  method, Perl locks the whole stash. (The stash, for those not
  familiar with Perl's guts, is a hash that holds a package's
  global variables and subroutines.)</p>

  <p>This makes duplicating the method locking behavior a bit
  trickier. The code to do so looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
   package MyPackage::SubPackage;
   sub locked_method {
       my $obj = shift;
       # Lock the object if we got one
       lock $obj                                if ref($obj);
       # Lock the stash if we didn't
       lock $::{'MyPackage::'}{'SubPackage::'}  unless ref($obj);
       # Do your stuff here while the locks are still in scope
   } 
</pre>

  <p>You'll need to update the stash lock line depending on what
  package the subroutine is actually in. While it's possible to
  determine this at runtime, it's pretty expensive, and Perl's
  method calls hurt enough as it is.</p>

  <p>One thing you'll notice here is that we're getting a lock just
  on the object or stash. Nothing special is done to match up the
  subroutine and object, or subroutine and stash. This is
  consistent with Perl's behavior - entering a locked method for an
  object or package prevents any other thread from entering a
  locked method for that object or package.</p>

  <h3>Coarser Locking</h3>Locking individual variables or
  subroutines is fine, but there are times when you need a coarser
  locking scheme. You may, for example, have groups of variables
  that are always locked en masse, or something such as a
  filehandle that can't be locked. While the best way to do this is
  with semaphores from Thread::Semaphore, that method has the
  disadvantage of not working on non-threaded Perl. For
  cross-version compatibility you're best off using a file-scoped
  lexical or two and coordinating your locks with them. For
  example:
  <pre>
      package MyPackage;
      my $package_lock;

      sub foo {
        lock $package_lock;
        # Do stuff
      }

      sub bar {
        lock $package_lock;
        # More stuff
      }

      sub baz {
        # Just do stuff without locks
      } 
</pre>

  <h3>Deadlocks</h3>A deadlock occurs when two threads have each
  locked a resource, and then each blocks trying to lock the
  resource the other owns. Deadlocks with threads are nasty because
  there's no way to get out of one. Once two threads are
  deadlocked, they will never recover. And unfortunately there's no
  way to check and see if something is already locked or would
  block if you tried.

  <p>While these shortcomings may be fixed in future releases of
  Perl (we are, to some extent, limited to the facilities provided
  by different platform's threading libraries), right now the only
  defense against deadlock is careful programming. To avoid them,
  follow these rules;</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Always obtain locks in the same order. Alphabetical order
    is the standard.</li>

    <li>Hold locks for as short a period as possible.</li>

    <li>If locks are nested, lock the outer locks first.</li>

    <li>Try not to call subroutines, especially subroutines whose
    source you don't control, while holding locks.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>A Note About Performance</h3>Now that we've covered how to
  lock things down for safety, we need to talk a bit about
  performance. It's very important that your code hold locks for as
  short a period of time as possible, and the locks need to be as
  specific as possible.

  <p>Actually acquiring a lock isn't really a performance killer.
  What can bite you is when a thread blocks trying to acquire a
  lock. Blocking and later waking up cost a little bit of time, but
  more importantly it creates a bottleneck - what folks doing
  threads call a <i>critical path</i>.</p>

  <p>Critical paths are usually bad, especially on multiprocessor
  machines, since they reduce the level of concurrency in your
  program. The more threads stuck trying to get into a critical
  path, the lower the level of concurrency. The lower the level of
  concurrency, the less well your CPU resources are used. In
  particularly bad cases, adding an extra CPU can actually decrease
  performance. Concurrency is your friend!</p>

  <p>Don't think that critical paths are only an issue on
  multiprocessor machines, though. You can cause yourself similar
  problems on a uniprocessor machine by holding a lock across a
  blocking system call, so just don't do that.</p>

  <h3>So What Have We Learned?</h3>

  <p>Hopefully, that proper locking is both good and reasonably
  simple.</p>
