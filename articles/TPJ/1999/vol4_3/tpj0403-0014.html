  <p>Consider a restaurant with no wait at the host station, but
  table service from the Registry of Motor Vehicles. Although there
  is pandemonium as servers rush all over, only a few bits of food
  make it onto the tables. A bevy of worried managers huddles just
  inside the kitchen. "We need more waiters, more cooks, and a
  bigger kitchen!" says one. "Too expensive! Same kitchen, more
  arms per cook and waiter," says another. "Better yet: no cooks.
  We'll serve the fixings; the clients will make sandwiches!" says
  a third.</p>

  <p>It is a rare scenario for Joe's Eats on the corner, but in
  Restaurant WWW, the appetites are voracious, patience is scarce,
  and quiet desperation rules in the image of an hour-glass. Faint
  indications of the underlying chaos may be heard as a server's
  hard disks thrash about retrieving data anonymous clients, but
  the loudest shouting is occurring in the kitchen where managers
  and developers hash through the various solutions - some
  portable, others powerful - to the web bottleneck problem.</p>

  <p>What'll it be? Server-side includes, or client-side applets?
  FastCGI, or faster CPU's? Embedded interpreters, or script
  co-processing? Not only are the choices daunting, but the
  implication for future expandability, portability, and even API
  accessibility is up in the air. And if you don't understand what
  these words mean, then heaven help you. Or better yet, let
  Lincoln Stein and Doug MacEachern help you.</p>

  <p>Stein and MacEachern, seasoned contributors to both CPAN's
  code content and its explanatory literature, have wandered away
  from the server scrum that has pitted the
  commercially-compromised and technically-challenged players like
  Sun/Netscape and Microsoft against each other and the
  freely-redistributable software community. In Writing Apache
  Modules with Perl and C, Stein and MacEachern alert us to the
  virtues of embedded interpreters, especially the Apache module
  "mod_perl," which itself executes Perl modules written either in
  plain Perl, or in C compiled into a Perl module.</p>

  <p>Apache Modules is an absolutely superb introduction to an
  advanced application of Perl. The authors warn the reader early
  on: know Perl and its modular structure, appreciate client-server
  architectures, don't balk at httpd or CGI binaries, and be
  proficient in HTML. That's a lot to ask of a Perl generalist, but
  the authors' prose is clear and moves with the didactic rigor and
  stylistic lightness that is the particular provenance of any
  discipline's principal innovators. In bold, secure language,
  Stein and MacEachern recount the historical issues surrounding
  the web's clogged servers and the myriad of limited solutions to
  the problem. They even pause to clear up the potential confusion
  regarding the double-denotive term "module" which can mean both
  Apache modules and Perl modules, two entirely different
  things.</p>

  <p>The last two hundred pages are an exhaustive API reference
  guide to Perl and C-compiled modules for mod_perl. The first four
  hundred pages address practical questions like content handling,
  maintaining server state between sessions, and customization. The
  ever-present issues of security, encryption, and authentication
  receive a chapter's attention. But Stein and MacEachern's most
  valuable contribution is in flattening an otherwise daunting
  learning curve to Perl serverdom. The opening chapters are an
  expert introduction to the history of web service, the advent of
  Apache, and the philosophy of mod_perl. The story traces a full
  circle, beginning with the obligatory "Hello, world" how-to and
  closing with an ironic "Goodbye World" example to illustrate the
  launching of subprocesses, that naive GOTO-like tactic that is
  largely responsible for the web bottleneck in the first place.
  But even the backwards-compatible "bad" solutions are among the
  options available to Apache Perl module developers.</p>

  <p>Together with Clinton Wong's <i>Web Client Programming with
  Perl</i>, Apache Modules gives the Perl-literate web enthusiast
  experience with both sides of the WWW interface without ever
  leaving a Perlesque setting, or even the O'Reilly shelf in the
  bookstore.</p>

  <p>When you are done reading the book, take a self-test by trying
  to read the fold-out quick reference card wedged inside the back
  cover. If you can understand the technical outline while
  imagining a six-armed waiter and millions of hungry patrons, then
  come on into the kitchen and join the debate.</p>
