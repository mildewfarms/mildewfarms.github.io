  <h2 align="center">Seven Useful Uses of <tt>local</tt></h2>

  <h4>Mark-Jason Dominus</h4>

  <p>In my article <i>Coping With Scoping</i> I offered the advice
  "Always use <tt>my</tt>; never use <tt>local</tt>." The most
  common use for both is to provide your subroutines with private
  variables, and for this application you should always use
  <tt>my</tt>, and never <tt>local</tt>. But many readers (and the
  tech editors) noted that <tt>local</tt> isn't entirely useless;
  there are cases in which <tt>my</tt> doesn't work, or doesn't do
  what you want. So I promised a followup article on useful uses
  for <tt>local</tt>. Here they are.</p>

  <h3>1. Special Variables</h3>

  <p><tt>my</tt> makes most uses of <tt>local</tt> obsolete. So
  it's not surprising that the most common useful uses of
  <tt>local</tt> arise because of peculiar cases where <tt>my</tt>
  happens to be illegal. The most important examples are the
  punctuation variables such as <tt>$"</tt>, <tt>$/</tt>,
  <tt>$^W</tt>, and <tt>$_</tt>. Long ago Larry Wall decided that
  it would be too confusing if you could <tt>my</tt> them; they're
  exempt from the normal package scheme for the same reason. So if
  you want to change them, but have the change apply to only part
  of the program, you'll have to use <tt>local</tt>. As an example
  of where this might be useful, let's consider a function whose
  job is to read in an entire file and return its contents as a
  single string:</p>
  <pre>
sub getfile {
   my $filename = shift;
   open F, "&lt; $filename" or die 
              "Couldn't open '$filename': $!";
   my $contents = '';
   while (&lt;F&gt;) {
      $contents .= $_;
   }
   close F;
   return $contents;
}
</pre>

  <p>This is inefficient, because the <tt>&lt;F&gt;</tt> operator
  makes Perl go to all the trouble of breaking the file into lines
  and returning them one at a time, and then all we do is put them
  back together again. It's cheaper to read the file all at once,
  without all the splitting and reassembling. (Some people call
  this <i>slurping</i> the file.) Perl has a special feature to
  support this: If the <tt>$/</tt> variable is undefined, the
  <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> operator will read the entire file all at
  once:</p>
  <pre>
sub getfile {
   my $filename = shift;
   open F, "&lt; $filename" or die 
              "Couldn't open '$filename': $!";
   $/ = undef;      # Read entire file at once 
   $contents = &lt;F&gt;; # Return file as one single 'line' 
   close F; 
   return $contents; 
}
</pre>

  <p>There's a terrible problem here, which is that <tt>$/</tt> is
  a global variable that affects the semantics of every
  <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> in the entire program. If <tt>getfile()</tt>
  doesn't put it back the way it was, some other part of the
  program is probably going to fail disastrously when it tries to
  read a line of input and gets the whole rest of the file instead.
  Normally we'd like to use <tt>my</tt>, to make the change local
  to the functions. But we can't here, because <tt>my</tt> doesn't
  work on punctuation variables; we would get this error if we
  tried.</p>
  <pre>
&#13;Can't use global $/ in "my" ...
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>Also, more to the point, Perl itself knows that it should look
  in the global variable <tt>$/</tt> to find the input record
  separator; even if we could create a new private variable with
  the same name, Perl wouldn't know to look there. So instead, we
  need to set a temporary value for the global variable
  <tt>$/</tt>, and that is exactly what <tt>local</tt> does:</p>
  <pre>
sub getfile {
   my $filename = shift;
   open F, "&lt; $filename" or die 
              "Couldn't open '$filename': $!";
   local $/ = undef;   # Read entire file at once
   $contents = &lt;F&gt;;    # Return file as one single 'line' 
   close F; 
   return $contents; 
} 
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>The old value of <tt>$/</tt> is restored when the function
  returns. In this example, that's enough for safety. In a more
  complicated function that might call some other functions in a
  library somewhere, we'd still have to worry that we might be
  sabotaging the library with our strange <tt>$/</tt>. It's
  probably best to confine our changes to the smallest possible
  part of the program:</p>
  <pre>
sub getfile {
   my $filename = shift; 
   open F, "&lt; $filename" or die 
              "Couldn't open '$filename': $!"; 
   my $contents; 
   { local $/ = undef;   # Read entire file at once 
      $contents = &lt;F&gt;;   # Return file as one single 'line' 
   }                     # $/ regains its old value
   close F; 
   return $contents; 
}
</pre>

  <p>This is a good practice, even for simple functions like this
  that don't call any other subroutines. By confining the changes
  to <tt>$/</tt> to just the one line we want to affect, we've
  prevented the possibility that someone in the future will insert
  some calls to other functions that will break because of the
  change. This is called <i>defensive programming</i>.</p>

  <p>Although you may not think about it much, localizing
  <tt>$_</tt> this way can be very important. Here's a slightly
  different version of <tt>getfile()</tt>, one which throws away
  comments and blank lines from the file that it gets:</p>
  <pre>
sub getfile {
   my $filename = shift; 
   local *F; 
   open F, "&lt; $filename" or die 
              "Couldn't open '$filename': $!";
   my $contents;
   while (&lt;F&gt;) { 
      s/#.*//;            # Remove comments 
	  next unless /\S/;   # Skip blank lines
      $contents .= $_;    # Save current (nonblank) line
   } 
   return $contents; 
}
</pre>

  <p>This function has a terrible problem. Here's the terrible
  problem: If you call it like this, it clobbers the elements of
  <tt>@array</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
foreach (@array) {
   ...  
   $f = getfile($filename); 
   ... 
}
</pre>

  <p>Why? Because inside a <tt>foreach</tt> loop, <tt>$_</tt> is
  aliased to the elements of the array; if you change <tt>$_</tt>,
  it changes the array. And <tt>getfile()</tt> <i>does</i> change
  <tt>$_</tt>. To prevent itself from sabotaging the <tt>$_</tt> of
  anyone who calls it, <tt>getfile()</tt> should have <tt>local
  $_</tt> at the top.</p>

  <p>Other special variables present similar problems. For example,
  it's sometimes convenient to change <tt>$"</tt>, <tt>$,</tt>, or
  <tt>$\</tt> to alter the way <tt>print</tt> works, but if you
  don't arrange to put them back the way they were before you call
  any other functions, you might get a big disaster:</p>
  <pre>
# Good style:
{ local $" = ')(';
   print "Array a: (@a)\n";
}
# Program continues safely...
</pre>

  <p>Another common situation in which you localize a special
  variable is when you want to temporarily suppress warning
  messages. Warnings are enabled by the <tt>-w</tt> command-line
  option, which in turn sets the variable <tt>$^W</tt> to a true
  value. If you reset <tt>$^W</tt> to a false value, that turns the
  warnings off. Here's an example: My <tt>Memoize</tt> module
  creates a front-end to the user's function and then installs it
  into the symbol table, replacing the original function. That's
  what it's for, and it would be awfully annoying to the user to
  get the warning every time they tried to use my module.</p>
  <pre>
Subroutine factorial redefined at Memoize.pm line 113
</pre>

  <p>So I have this, which turns off the warning for just the one
  line.</p>
  <pre>
  {
     local $^W = 0;                    # Shut UP!
     *{$name} = $tabent-&gt;{UNMEMOIZED};  
  }
</pre>

  <p>The old value of <tt>$^W</tt> is automatically restored after
  the chance of triggering the warning is over.</p>

  <h3>2. Localized Filehandles</h3>

  <p>Let's look back at that <tt>getfile()</tt> function. To read
  the file, it opened the filehandle <tt>F</tt>. That's fine,
  unless some other part of the program happened to have already
  opened a filehandle named <tt>F</tt>. In that case, the old file
  is closed, and when control returns from the function, that other
  part of the program is going to become very confused and upset.
  This is the 'filehandle clobbering problem'.</p>

  <p>This is exactly the sort of problem that local variables were
  supposed to solve. Unfortunately, there's no way to localize a
  filehandle directly in Perl.</p>

  <p>Well, that's actually a fib. There are three ways to do
  it:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>You can cast a magic spell in which you create an anonymous
    glob, extract the filehandle from it, and discard the rest of
    the glob.</li>

    <li>You can use the <tt>Filehandle</tt> or IO::Handle modules,
    which cast the spell I just described, and present you with the
    results, so that you don't have to perform any sorcery
    yourself.</li>

    <li>See below. The simplest and cheapest way to solve the
    filehandle clobbering problem is a little bit obscure. You
    can't localize the filehandle itself, but you can localize the
    entry in Perl's symbol table that associates the filehandle's
    name with the filehandle. This entry is called a 'glob'. In
    Perl, variables don't have names directly; instead the glob has
    a name, and the glob gathers together the scalar, array, hash,
    subroutine, and filehandle with that name. In Perl, the glob
    named <tt>F</tt> is denoted with <tt>*F</tt>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To localize the filehandle, we actually localize the entire
  glob, which is a little hamfisted:</p>
  <pre>
sub getfile {
   my $filename = shift; 
   local *F; 
   open F, "&lt; $filename" or die 
              "Couldn't open '$filename': $!";
   local $/ = undef;   # Read entire file at once 
   $contents = &lt;F&gt;;    # Return file as one 'line' 
   close F; 
   return $contents; 
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>local</tt> on a glob does the same as any other
  <tt>local</tt>: It saves the current value somewhere, creates a
  new value, and arranges that the old value will be restored at
  the end of the current block. In this case, that means that any
  filehandle that was formerly attached to the old <tt>*F</tt> glob
  is saved, and the <tt>open</tt> will apply to the filehandle in
  the new, local glob. At the end of the block, filehandle
  <tt>F</tt> will regain its old meaning again.</p>

  <p>This works pretty well most of the time, except that you still
  have the usual <tt>local</tt> worries about called subroutines
  changing the <tt>local</tt>ized values on you. You can't use
  <tt>my</tt> here because globs are all about the Perl symbol
  table; the lexical variable mechanism is totally different, and
  there is no such thing as a lexical glob.</p>

  <p>With this technique, you have the new problem that
  <tt>getfile()</tt> can't get at <tt>$F</tt>, <tt>@F</tt>, or
  <tt>%F</tt> either, because you localized them all, along with
  the filehandle. But you probably weren't using any global
  variables anyway. Were you? And <tt>getfile()</tt> won't be able
  to call <tt>&amp;F</tt>, for the same reason. There are a few
  ways around this, but the easiest one is that if
  <tt>getfile()</tt> needs to call <tt>&amp;F</tt>, it should name
  the local filehandle something other than <tt>F</tt>.</p>

  <p><tt>use FileHandle</tt> does have fewer strange problems.
  Unfortunately, it also sucks a few thousand lines of code into
  your program. Now someone will probably write in to complain that
  I'm exaggerating, because it isn't really 3,000 lines, some of
  those are whitespace, blah blah blah. Okay, let's say it's only
  300 lines to <tt>use FileHandle</tt>, probably a gross
  underestimate. It's still only <i>one</i> line to localize the
  glob. For many programs, localizing the glob is a good, cheap,
  simple way to solve the problem.</p>

  <h3>Localized Filehandles, II</h3>

  <p>When a localized glob goes out of scope, its open filehandle
  is automatically closed. So the <tt>close F</tt> in
  <tt>getfile()</tt> is unnecessary:</p>
  <pre>
sub getfile {
   my $filename = shift;
   local *F;
   open F, "&lt; $filename" or die 
              "Couldn't open '$filename': $!";
   local $/ = undef;    # Read entire file at once
   return &lt;F&gt;;          # Return file as one single 'line'
}  # F is automatically closed here
</pre>

  <p>That's such a convenient feature that it's worth using even
  when you're not worried that you might be clobbering someone
  else's filehandle.</p>

  <p>The filehandles that you get from FileHandle and IO::Handle do
  this also.</p>

  <h3>Marginal Uses of Localized Filehandles</h3>

  <p>As I was researching this article, I kept finding common uses
  for <tt>local</tt> that turned out not to be useful, because
  there were simpler and more straightforward ways to do the same
  thing without using <tt>local</tt>.</p>

  <p>Here is one that you see far too often. People sometimes want
  to pass a filehandle to a subroutine, and they know that you can
  pass a filehandle by passing the entire glob, like this:</p>
  <pre>
$rec = read_record(*INPUT_FILE);
&#13;sub read_record {
    local *FH = shift;
    my $record;
    read FH, $record, 1024;
    return $record;
}
</pre>

  <p>Here we pass in the entire glob <tt>INPUT_FILE</tt>, which
  includes the filehandle of that name. Inside
  <tt>read_record</tt>, we temporarily alias <tt>FH</tt> to
  <tt>INPUT_FILE</tt>, so that the filehandle <tt>FH</tt> inside
  the function is the same as whatever filehandle was passed in
  from outside. Then when we read from <tt>FH</tt>, we're actually
  reading from the filehandle that the caller wanted. But actually
  there's a more straightforward way to do the same thing:</p>
  <pre>
$rec = read_record(*INPUT_FILE);
    sub read_record {
    my $fh = shift;
    my $record;
    read $fh, $record, 1024;
    return $record;
}
</pre>

  <p>You can store a glob into a scalar variable, and you can use
  such a variable in any of Perl's I/O functions wherever you might
  have used a filehandle name. So the <tt>local</tt> here was
  unnecessary.</p>

  <h3>Dirhandles</h3>

  <p>Filehandles and dirhandles are stored in the same place in
  Perl, so everything this article says about filehandles applies
  to dirhandles in the same way.</p>

  <h3>3. The First-Class Filehandle Trick</h3>

  <p>Often you want to put filehandles into an array, or treat them
  like regular scalars, or pass them to a function, and you can't,
  because filehandles aren't really first-class objects in Perl. As
  noted above, you can use the <tt>FileHandle</tt> or
  <tt>IO::Handle</tt> packages to construct a scalar that acts
  something like a filehandle, but there are some definite
  disadvantages to that approach.</p>

  <p>Another approach is to use a glob as a filehandle; it turns
  out that a glob will fit into a scalar variable, so you can put
  it into an array or pass it to a function. The only problem with
  globs is that they are apt to have strange and magical effects on
  the Perl symbol table. What you really want is a glob that has
  been disconnected from the symbol table, so that you can just use
  it like a filehandle and forget that it might once have had an
  effect on the symbol table. It turns out that there is a simple
  way to do that:</p>
  <pre>
my $filehandle = do { local *FH };
</pre>

  <p><tt>do</tt> just introduces a block which will be evaluated,
  and will return the value of the last expression that it
  contains, which in this case is <tt>local *FH</tt>. The value of
  <tt>local *FH</tt> is a glob. But what glob? <tt>local</tt> takes
  the existing <tt>FH</tt> glob and temporarily replaces it with a
  new glob. But then it immediately goes out of scope and puts the
  old glob back, leaving the new glob without a name. But then it
  <i>returns the new, nameless glob</i>, which is then stored into
  <tt>$filehandle</tt>. This is just what we wanted: A glob that
  has been disconnected from the symbol table. You can make a whole
  bunch of these, if you want:</p>
  <pre>
for $i (0 .. 99) {
   $fharray[$i] = do { local *FH };
}
</pre>

  <p>You can pass them to subroutines, return them from
  subroutines, put them in data structures, and give them to Perl's
  I/O functions like <tt>open</tt>, <tt>close</tt>, <tt>read</tt>,
  <tt>print</tt>, and <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> and they'll work just
  fine.</p>

  <h3>4. Aliases</h3>

  <p>Globs turn out to be very useful. You can assign an entire
  glob, as we saw above, and alias an entire symbol in the symbol
  table. But you don't have to do it all at once.<br>
  If you say</p>
  <pre>
*GLOB = $reference;
</pre>

  <p>then Perl only changes the meaning of part of the glob. If the
  reference is a scalar reference, it changes the meaning of
  <tt>$GLOB</tt>, which now means the same as whatever scalar the
  reference referred to; <tt>@GLOB</tt>, <tt>%GLOB</tt> and the
  other parts don't change at all. If the reference is a hash
  reference, Perl makes <tt>%GLOB</tt> mean the same as whatever
  hash the reference referred to, but the other parts stay the
  same. Similarly for other kinds of references.</p>

  <p>You can use this for all sorts of wonderful tricks. For
  example, suppose you have a function that is going to do a lot of
  operations on <tt>$_[0]{Time}[2]</tt> for some reason. You can
  say</p>
  <pre>
*arg = \$_[0]{Time}[2];
</pre>

  <p>and from then on, <tt>$arg</tt> is synonymous with
  <tt>$_[0]{Time}[2]</tt>, which might make your code simpler, and
  probably more efficient, because Perl won't have to go digging
  through three levels of indirection every time. But you'd better
  use <tt>local</tt>, or else you'll permanently clobber any
  <tt>$arg</tt> variable that already exists. (Gurusamy Sarathy's
  <tt>Alias</tt> module does this, but without the
  <tt>local</tt>.)</p>

  <p>You can create locally-scoped subroutines that are invisible
  outside a block by saying</p>
  <pre>
*mysub = sub { ... } ;
</pre>

  <p>and then call them with <tt>mysub(...)</tt>. But you must use
  <tt>local</tt>, or else you'll permanently clobber any
  <tt>mysub</tt> subroutine that already exists.</p>

  <h3>5. Dynamic Scope</h3>

  <p><tt>local</tt> introduces what is called <i>dynamic scope</i>,
  which means that the 'local' variable that it declares is
  inherited by other functions called from the one with the
  declaration. Usually this isn't what you want, and it's rather a
  strange feature, unavailable in many programming languages. To
  see the difference, consider this example:</p>
  <pre>
first();
&#13;sub first {
	local $x = 1;
	my    $y = 1;
	second();
}
&#13;sub second {
    print "x=", $x, "\n";
    print "y=", $y, "\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>The variable <tt>$y</tt> is a true local variable. It's
  available only from its declaration through the end of the
  enclosing block. In particular, it's unavailable inside of
  <tt>second()</tt>, which prints <tt>"y="</tt>, not
  <tt>"y=1"</tt>. This is is called <i>lexical scope</i>.
  <tt>local</tt>, in contrast, does not actually make a local
  variable. It creates a new 'local' value for a <i>global</i>
  variable, which persists until the end of the enclosing block.
  When control exits the block, the old <i>value</i> is restored.
  But the variable, and its new 'local' value, are still global,
  and hence accessible to other subroutines that are called before
  the old value is restored. <tt>second()</tt> above prints
  <tt>"x=1"</tt>, because <tt>$x</tt> is a <i>global</i> variable
  that temporarily happens to have the value 1. Once
  <tt>first()</tt> returns, the old value will be restored. This is
  called <i>dynamic scope</i>, which is a misnomer, because it's
  not really scope at all.</p>

  <p>For 'local' variables, you almost always want lexical scope,
  because it ensures that variables that you declare in one
  subroutine can't be tampered with by other subroutines. But every
  once in a strange while, you actually do want dynamic scope, and
  that's the time to get <tt>local</tt> out of your bag of
  tricks.</p>

  <p>Here's the most useful example I could find, and one that
  really does bear careful study. We'll make our own iteration
  syntax, in the same family as Perl's <tt>grep</tt> and
  <tt>map</tt>. Let's call it <tt>listjoin</tt>; it'll combine two
  lists into one:</p>
  <pre>
@list1 = (1,2,3,4,5);
@list2 = (2,3,5,7,11);
@result = listjoin { $a + $b } @list1, @list2;
</pre>

  <p>Now the <tt>@result</tt> is <tt>(3,5,8,11,16)</tt>. Each
  element of the result is the sum of the corresponding terms from
  <tt>@list1</tt> and <tt>@list2</tt>. If we wanted differences
  instead of sums, we could have put <tt>{ $a - $b }</tt>. In
  general, we can supply any code fragment that does something with
  <tt>$a</tt> and <tt>$b</tt>, and <tt>listjoin</tt> will use our
  code fragment to construct the elements in the result list.</p>

  <p>Here's a first cut at <tt>listjoin</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
sub listjoin (&amp;\@\@) {
</pre>

  <p>Oops! The first line already has a lot of magic. Let's stop
  here and sightsee a while before we go on. The
  <tt>(&amp;\@\@)</tt> is a <i>prototype</i>. In Perl, a prototype
  changes the way the function is parsed and the way its arguments
  are passed. In <tt>(&amp;\@\@)</tt>, the <tt>&amp;</tt> warns the
  Perl compiler to expect to see a brace-delimited block of code as
  the first argument to this function, and tells Perl that it
  should pass <tt>listjoin</tt> a reference to that block. The
  block behaves just like an anonymous function. The <tt>\@\@</tt>
  says that <tt>listjoin</tt> should get two other arguments, which
  <i>must</i> be arrays; Perl will pass <tt>listjoin</tt>
  references to these two arrays. If any of the arguments are
  missing, or have the wrong type (a hash instead of an array, for
  example) Perl will signal a compile-time error.</p>

  <p>The result of this little wad of punctuation is that we will
  be able to write</p>
  <pre>
listjoin { $a + $b } @list1, @list2;
</pre>

  <p>and Perl will behave as if we had written</p>
  <pre>
listjoin(sub { $a + $b }, \@list1, \@list2);
</pre>

  <p>With the prototype, Perl knows enough to let us leave out the
  parentheses, the <tt>sub</tt>, the first comma, and the slashes.
  Perl has too much punctuation already, so we should take
  advantage of every opportunity to use less.</p>

  <p>Now that that's out of the way, the rest of <tt>listjoin</tt>
  is straightforward:</p>
  <pre>
sub listjoin (&amp;\@\@) {
    my $code = shift;           # Get the code block
    my $arr1 = shift;           # Get reference to first array
    my $arr2 = shift;           # Get reference to second array
    my @result;
    while (@$arr1 &amp;&amp; @$arr2) {
        my $a = shift @$arr1;   # Element from array 1 into $a
        my $b = shift @$arr2;   # Element from array 2 into $b
        push @result, &amp;$code(); # Execute code and get result
    }
    return @result;
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>listjoin</tt> simply runs a loop over the elements in the
  two arrays, putting elements from each into <tt>$a</tt> and
  <tt>$b</tt>, respectively, and then executing the code and
  pushing the result into <tt>@result</tt>. All very simple and
  nice, except that it doesn't work: By declaring <tt>$a</tt> and
  <tt>$b</tt> with <tt>my</tt>, we've made them lexical, and
  they're unavailable to the <tt>$code</tt>. Removing the
  <tt>my</tt>'s from <tt>$a</tt> and <tt>$b</tt> makes it work:</p>
  <pre>
$a = shift @$arr1;
$b = shift @$arr2;
</pre>

  <p>But this solution is boobytrapped. Without the <tt>my</tt>
  declaration, <tt>$a</tt> and <tt>$b</tt> are <i>global</i>
  variables, and whatever values they had before we ran
  <tt>listjoin</tt> are lost now.</p>

  <p>The correct solution is to use <tt>local</tt>. This preserves
  the old values of the <tt>$a</tt> and <tt>$b</tt> variables, if
  there were any, and restores them when <tt>listjoin()</tt> is
  finished. But because of dynamic scoping, the values set by
  <tt>listjoin()</tt> are inherited by the code fragment. Here's
  the correct solution:</p>
  <pre>
sub listjoin (&amp;\@\@) {
    my $code = shift;
    my $arr1 = shift;
    my $arr2 = shift;
    my @result;
    while (@$arr1 &amp;&amp; @$arr2) {
        local $a = shift @$arr1;
        local $b = shift @$arr2;
        push @result, &amp;$code();
    }
    return @result;
}
</pre>

  <p>You might worry about another problem: Suppose you had
  <tt>strict 'vars'</tt> in force. Shouldn't <tt>listjoin { $a + $b
  }</tt> be illegal? It should be, because <tt>$a</tt> and
  <tt>$b</tt> are global variables, and the purpose of <tt>strict
  'vars'</tt> is to forbid the use of unqualified global
  variables.</p>

  <p>But actually, there's no problem here, because <tt>strict
  'vars'</tt> makes a special exception for <tt>$a</tt> and
  <tt>$b</tt>. These two names, and no others, are exempt from
  <tt>strict 'vars'</tt>, because if they weren't, <tt>sort</tt>
  wouldn't work either, for exactly the same reason. We're taking
  advantage of that here by giving <tt>listjoin</tt> the same kind
  of syntax. It's a peculiar and arbitrary exception, but one that
  we're happy to take advantage of. Here's another example in the
  same vein:</p>
  <pre>
sub printhash (&amp;\%) {
    my $code = shift;
    my $hash = shift;
    local ($k, $v);
    while (($k, $v) = each %$hash) {
        print &amp;$code();
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>Now you can say</p>
  <pre>
printhash { "$k =&gt; $v\n" } %capitals;
</pre>

  <p>and you'll get something like</p>
  <pre>
Athens =&gt; Greece
Moscow =&gt; Russia
Helsinki =&gt; Finland
</pre>

  <p>or you can say</p>
  <pre>
printhash { "$k," } %capitals;
</pre>

  <p>and you'll get</p>
  <pre>
Athens,Moscow,Helsinki,
</pre>

  <p>Note that because I used <tt>$k</tt> and <tt>$v</tt> here, you
  might get into trouble with <tt>strict 'vars'</tt>. You'll either
  have to change the definition of <tt>printhash</tt> to use
  <tt>$a</tt> and <tt>$b</tt> instead, or you'll have to <tt>use
  vars qw($k $v)</tt>.</p>

  <h3>6. Dynamic Scope Revisited</h3>

  <p>Here's another possible use for dynamic scope: You have some
  subroutine whose behavior depends on the setting of a global
  variable. This is usually a result of bad design, and should be
  avoided unless the variable is large and widely used. We'll
  suppose that this is the case, and that the variable is called
  <tt>%CONFIG</tt>. You want to call the subroutine, but you want
  to change its behavior. Perhaps you want to trick it about what
  the configuration really is, or perhaps you want to see what it
  would do <i>if</i> the configuration were different, or you want
  to try out a fake configuration to see if it works. But you don't
  want to change the real global configuration, because you don't
  know what bizarre effects that will have on the rest of the
  program. So you do this:</p>
  <pre>
local %CONFIG = (new configuration here);
the_subroutine();
</pre>

  <p>The changed <tt>%CONFIG</tt> is inherited by the subroutine,
  and the original configuration is restored automatically when the
  declaration goes out of scope.</p>

  <p>Actually in this kind of circumstance you can sometimes do
  better. Here's how: Suppose that the <tt>%CONFIG</tt> hash has
  lots and lots of members, but we only want to change
  <tt>$CONFIG{VERBOSITY}</tt>. The obvious thing to do is something
  like this:</p>
  <pre>
my %new_config = %CONFIG;       # Copy configuration
$new_config{VERBOSITY} = 1000;  # Change one member
local %CONFIG = %new_config;    # Copy changed back, temporarily
the_subroutine();               # Subroutine inherits change
</pre>

  <p>But there's a better way:</p>
  <pre>
local $CONFIG{VERBOSITY} = 1000; # Temporary change!
the_subroutine();
</pre>

  <p>You can actually localize a single element of an array or a
  hash. It works just like localizing any other scalar: The old
  value is saved, and restored at the end of the enclosing
  scope.</p>

  <h3>Marginal Uses of Dynamic Scoping</h3>

  <p>Like local filehandles, I kept finding examples of dynamic
  scoping that seemed to require <tt>local</tt>, but on further
  reflection didn't. Lest you be tempted to make one of these
  mistakes, here they are. One application people sometimes have
  for dynamic scoping is like this: Suppose you have a complicated
  subroutine that does a search of some sort, returning bunch of
  items. If the search function is complicated enough, you might
  like to have it simply deposit each item into a global array
  variable when it's found, rather than returning the complete list
  from the subroutine, especially if the search subroutine is
  recursive in a complicated way:</p>
  <pre>
sub search {
    # do something very complicated here
    if ($found) {
        push @solutions, $solution;
    }
    # do more complicated things
}
</pre>

  <p>This is dangerous, because <tt>@solutions</tt> is a global
  variable, and you don't know who else might be using it.</p>

  <p>In some languages, the best answer is to add a frontend to
  <tt>search</tt> that localizes the global <tt>@solutions</tt>
  variable:</p>
  <pre>
sub search {
    local @solutions;
    realsearch(@_);
    return @solutions;
}
&#13;sub realsearch {
    # ... as before ...
}
</pre>

  <p>Now the real work is done in <tt>realsearch()</tt>, which
  still gets to store its solutions into the global variable. But
  since the user of <tt>realsearch()</tt> is calling the front-end
  <tt>search()</tt> function, any old value that
  <tt>@solutions</tt> might have had is saved beforehand and
  restored again afterwards.</p>

  <p>There are two other ways to accomplish the same thing, and
  both of them are better than this way. Here's one:</p>
  <pre>
{ my @solutions;  # Private, but available to both functions
   sub search {
      realsearch(@_);
      return @solutions;
   }
   sub realsearch {
      # ... just as before ...
      # but now it modifies a private variable not a global.
   }
}
</pre>

  <p>Here's the other:</p>
  <pre>
sub search {
    my @solutions;
    realsearch(\@solutions, @_);
    return @solutions;
}
&#13;sub realsearch {
	my $solutions_ref = shift;
	# do something very complicated here
	if ($found) {
	    push @$solutions_ref, $solution;
	}
	# do more complicated things
}
</pre>

  <p>One or the other of these strategies will solve most problems
  where you might think you would want to use a dynamic variable.
  They're both safer than the solution with <tt>local</tt> because
  you don't have to worry that the global variable will 'leak' out
  into the subroutines called by <tt>realsearch()</tt>.</p>

  <p>One final example of a marginal use of <tt>local</tt>: I can
  imagine an error-handling routine that examines the value of some
  global error message variable such as <tt>$!</tt> or
  <tt>$DBI::errstr</tt> to decide what to do. If this routine seems
  to have a more general utility, you might want to call it even
  when there wasn't an error, because you want to invoke its
  cleanup behavior, or you like the way it issues the error
  message, or whatever. It <i>should</i> accept the message as an
  argument instead of examining some fixed global variable, but it
  was badly designed and now you can't change it. If you're in this
  kind of situation, the best solution might turn out to be
  something like this:</p>
  <pre>
local $DBI::errstr = "Your shoelace is untied!";
handle_error();
</pre>

  <p>Probably a better solution is to find the person responsible
  for the routine and to sternly remind them that functions are
  more flexible and easier to reuse if they don't depend on
  hardwired global variables. But sometimes time is short and you
  have to do what you can.</p>

  <h3>7. Perl 4 and Other Relics</h3>

  <p>A lot of the useful uses for <tt>local</tt> became obsolete
  with Perl 5; local was much more useful in Perl 4. The most
  important of these was that <tt>my</tt> wasn't available, so you
  needed <tt>local</tt> for private variables.</p>

  <p>If you find yourself programming in Perl 4, expect to use a
  lot of <tt>local</tt>. <tt>my</tt> hadn't been invented yet, so
  we had to do the best we could with what we had.</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>Useful uses for <tt>local</tt> fall into two classes: First,
  places where you would like to use <tt>my</tt>, but you can't
  because of some restriction, and second, rare, peculiar, or
  contrived situations.</p>

  <p>For the vast majority of cases, you should use my, and avoid
  local whenever possible. In particular, when you want private
  variables, use my, because local variables aren't private.</p>

  <p>Even the useful uses for <tt>local</tt> are mostly not very
  useful.</p>

  <p>Revised rule of when to use <tt>my</tt> and when to use
  <tt>local</tt>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Beginners and intermediate programmers:</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    Always use <tt>my</tt>; never use <tt>local</tt> unless you get
    an error when you try to use <tt>my</tt>.
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>Experts only:</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    Experts don't need me to tell them what the real rules are.
