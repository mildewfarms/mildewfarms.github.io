  <h4>Dan Sugalski</h4>

  <p><b>Optional Packages:</b> libnet, mailtools Sooner or later,
  most Perl programmers find themselves needing to send electronic
  mail from a program. It might be for a CGI application, or
  sending out autoconfirmations, or generating monthly e-mail
  invoices, or sending reports to the payroll department. Now, the
  normal way to send e-mail from Perl looks something like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
open (SENDMAIL, "|/usr/lib/sendmail -t") or die "sendmail";
print SENDMAIL "From: (goes here)\n";
print SENDMAIL "To: (goes here)\n";
print SENDMAIL "Subject: Test mail\n\n";
print SENDMAIL "Message body goes here";
close SENDMAIL or die "Hey, sendmail failed!";
</pre>

  <p>Nice, simple, and straightforward, right?</p>

  <p>Well... no. It's not this simple if you're on a non-Unix
  machine (such as Windows, NT, VMS, OS/390, or the Mac) or, for
  whatever reason, you don't have <tt>sendmail</tt> or a reasonable
  facsimile installed. And even if you do have <tt>sendmail</tt>,
  you might not want to pay the cost to invoke it just to send a
  single mail message. It is, after all, a fairly big program, and
  the last thing you really want is for your system monitoring
  program to drop dead because it couldn't fork off
  <tt>sendmail</tt> to tell you it was out of process slots.</p>

  <p>So, what we're going to do in this article is build a
  <tt>sendmail</tt> replacement suitable both for use in place of a
  real <tt>sendmail</tt> and as donor code which you will
  undoubtedly gut for your own use. (I use the mail sending
  routines in some system monitoring programs, for example.)</p>

  <h3>Some E-Mail Background</h3>

  <p>Before we go into the code that actually sends the mail, we
  need to talk about what exactly e-mail is and how it works.</p>

  <h3>E-Mail Is A Store-And-Forward System</h3>

  <p>The single most important thing about e-mail that anyone can
  know is that e-mail is <i>not</i> a direct delivery,
  point-to-point system like, for example, the web. Instead, e-mail
  is a store-and-forward system. What this means is that when you
  send mail to someone it doesn't go directly to their computer.
  Instead, it goes to some intermediate machine, which itself might
  forward the mail to another machine before the mail gets to its
  final destination.</p>

  <p>And, in many cases, the machine you think is the final
  delivery system isn't. It's common for the machine publicly
  advertised in e-mail addressed to be just a gateway to another
  mail system. Corporate mail systems are often like this, as the
  host you think is the final destination is really a gateway
  through a firewall, a gateway to a completely different mail
  system (such as GroupWise or Lotus CC:Mail), or both.</p>

  <h3>There's More Than One Way To Deliver Mail</h3>

  <p>The standards for e-mail, like the standards for most
  everything else on the Internet, are set down in a series of
  documents called RFCs. (Short for Request for Comments, although
  the standards set down are quite a bit stronger than the name
  might imply. See <a href=
  "ftp://ftpeng.cisco.com/fred/rfc-index/rfc.html" target=
  "resource window">ftp://ftpeng.cisco.com/fred/rfc-index/rfc.html</a>
  for a comprehensive list.) The standards for SMTP, the Simple
  Mail Transport Protocol, are set down in RFC821, while the
  standards for e-mail headers are set down in RFC822.</p>

  <p>The most common way to deliver mail from one system to another
  is via SMTP, which requires a network connection. Usually that
  connection is TCP/IP, but SMTP will work over a variety of other
  network protocols. The other main delivery method is UUCP. UUCP
  is normally a dialup connection, and doesn't require constant
  connectivity between hosts. With UUCP, the client system
  occasionally polls a host system for any pending work. (UUCP is
  used to transfer more than just mail. It's designed to transfer
  arbitrary files between two systems, and is often used to move
  Usenet news in addition to mail.)</p>

  <h3>There Are Standards Governing E-mail</h3>

  <p>There are many different e-mail systems kicking around, but
  we're going to be talking about the most common type, normally
  called "Internet e-mail." It's a bit of a misnomer, though, since
  it's certainly not restricted to machines on the Internet.</p>

  <p>Since the code we're going to work with sends mail over the
  network via SMTP, we need to make sure that it follows the
  standards properly. Not to worry, though-- SMTP is simple.</p>

  <h3>The Mail Itself</h3>

  <p>Finally, let's talk a bit about the actual message. While it
  might come as something of a surprise, the message is actually
  the least interesting part of mail delivery.</p>

  <p>E-mail sent via SMTP has three parts, which is probably one
  part more than you were expecting. The contents of e-mail is also
  governed by standards, in this case RFC822 and its descendants.
  (If you're going to be building e-mail messages, you should
  definitely read this RFC. You might also want to read some of the
  follow-on RFCs that extend 822.)</p>

  <h3>The Message Body: Completely Uninteresting</h3>

  <p>The least interesting part of a mail message, at least as far
  as we're concerned, is the <i>message body.</i> While people care
  the most about this bit, the mail transport software doesn't care
  in the least about it. It's just data that needs to be sent on
  its way. The body consists of everything after the first blank
  line in the message.</p>

  <h3>The Message Headers: Only Mildly Interesting</h3>

  <p>All the lines up to the first blank line in the message are
  considered the <i>message headers.</i> In general, mail transport
  software doesn't care very much at all about the message headers.
  With one exception, the mail software isn't supposed to mess with
  the headers at all. Nor is it supposed to pay any attention to
  them.</p>

  <p>The single exception to the "leave the headers alone" rule is
  the <tt>Received:</tt> header. Each mail system that relays a
  message is supposed to add a <tt>Received:</tt> header at the top
  of each message. You can use these headers to track the systems
  that a message has passed through.</p>

  <p>RFC822 does mandate a minimum set of headers. To be fully
  compliant, all mail should have at least a <tt>From:</tt>,
  <tt>Date:</tt>, and either a <tt>To:</tt> or <tt>Bcc:</tt>
  header. There are others, of course, listed in the various RFCs.
  The standards mandate that <i>only</i> headers listed in the RFCs
  can be in a header--you can't make up your own. RFC822 grants a
  single exception--headers that begin with <tt>X-</tt> are
  allowed.</p>

  <h3>The Message Envelope: The Really Interesting Bit</h3>

  <p>When one system sends mail to another, it doesn't just open up
  a connection and start pumping data across. There's a
  conversation that takes place where the sender tells the receiver
  who it is, who the mail is for, and who the mail is from. This
  information is called the <i>envelope</i> because it acts like an
  envelope for a letter--it encloses the letter but isn't actually
  a part of it. The information in the envelope is the only
  information used by the receiving system to determine what it
  should do with the mail and who should receive it. The recipients
  listed in the mail headers don't have anything to do with who the
  mail is ultimately delivered to.</p>

  <h3>Sending Mail In Six Easy Steps</h3>

  <p>An SMTP transaction is a reasonably simple thing. Your program
  connects to the remote server, identifies itself, tells the
  remote machine who the mail is from, who it's to, and then sends
  the message. Simple, huh? All the details are specified in
  RFC821, and if you're going to be writing an SMTP client you
  should definitely read it before writing any code.</p>

  <p>There are two gotchas involved in SMTP conversations that
  might slip past a quick reading of the RFC. First, all lines end
  with a CRLF (carriage-return and linefeed) pair, <i>not</i> a
  bare linefeed. <tt>\n</tt> is not appropriate as a line ending.
  Use <tt>\cM\cJ</tt> instead. Second, RFC821 says that the SMTP
  channel is 7-bit and the high bits of all bytes should be
  cleared. This restriction is lifted in a later RFC, but it
  requires a mildly different, and somewhat more complex,
  conversation between client and server.</p>

  <p>Conversations between client and server are fairly
  straightforward. The client sends a command with an optional
  parameter and then a CRLF. The server responds with a three-digit
  status code and a one-line message describing the status. The
  first digit provides the general message class--<tt>2</tt>xx for
  OKs, <tt>3</tt>xx for start mail transmission, <tt>4</tt>xx for
  temporary errors, and <tt>5</tt>xx for permanent errors. You can
  check the first digit for the general status of the request and
  proceed accordingly. It's best to abort the transaction and try
  again later on <tt>4</tt>xx errors, but abort the transaction and
  give up on <tt>5</tt>xx errors -- except in special cases. It's
  silly to toss a whole mail message if one recipient in a list of
  a dozen fails, for example. SMTP places some limits on the
  transmission of commands and messages; they're listed in <a href=
  "tpj0402-0025.html">Table 1</a>. These numbers are what RFC821
  requires from a conformant SMTP server and client. Servers can
  (but don't have to) accept larger values.</p>

  <h3>Step One: Connecting To The Remote SMTP Server</h3>

  <p>According to the standard, SMTP servers are supposed to be
  listening on TCP port 25, so the client should open a connection
  there. When the connection is successfully made, the server will
  send out a single-line message with a status code.</p>

  <h3>Step Two: Identifying Ourselves</h3>

  <p>After connecting, the next step is to identify ourselves. This
  is done with the <tt>HELO</tt> command (no, that's not a typo).
  The full command is:</p>
  <pre>
HELO name.of.connecting.machineCRLF
</pre>

  <p>While many servers will still accept a <tt>HELO</tt> with no
  (or a bogus) name, many no longer do because of spam. (A common
  spammer trick was to leave off the name or mis-identify
  themselves to try to slip past security measures.)</p>

  <h3>Step Three: Identifying The Mail Sender</h3>

  <p>Next, your program needs to say who's sending the mail. This
  is done with the MAIL command, which looks like this:</p>

  <p><tt>MAIL FROM: &lt;user@host.com&gt;</tt> <i>CRLF</i></p>

  <p>Note that the contents of <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> are real--you need
  to store the sending e-mail address there. This is the address
  that all bounced mail will go to. If the mail being sent cannot
  be bounced (because, for example, it's a bounce notice itself and
  thus bouncing it would set up a nasty loop) the address can be an
  empty <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Step Four: Identifying The Mail Recipients</h3>

  <p>After telling the remote system who the mail is from, you need
  to tell it who the mail is going to. This is done with the RCPT
  command. Your program sends out one or more RCPTs, which look
  like this:</p>

  <p><tt>RCPT TO: &lt;user@host.com&gt;</tt><i>CRLF</i></p>

  <p>Once again, the addresses must be enclosed in angle brackets.
  You may send up to 100 RCPTs per mail message, and the server
  will send back a status on each one. It's not uncommon to have a
  message with multiple recipients bounce one or two.</p>

  <h3>Step Five: Sending The Mail</h3>

  <p>Once you've identified the sender and recipients, it's time to
  send out the mail itself. The <tt>DATA</tt> command marks the
  start of the message itself, which continues until you send a
  line with just a period. If you need to send a line with just a
  period on it for some reason, the protocol allows for sending a
  doubled period, which the server converts to a single period.
  When you do send out the line with a single period to end the
  mail message, the server will respond with a status message that
  tells you what it thinks of your mail.</p>

  <h3>Step Six: Closing Down The Connection</h3>

  <p>Finally, you need to close down the connection by sending the
  <tt>QUIT</tt> command. While it's not uncommon to see programs
  send a <tt>QUIT</tt> and drop the connection, you should wait for
  the final status to make sure that things went properly.</p>

  <h3>And now we do what, exactly?</h3>

  <p>So, we now know how to send mail in general. The next step is
  sending mail in specific. How do we send mail in Perl? Well,
  we're going to show you.</p>

  <p>There are three common ways to send mail directly from Perl:
  Net::SMTP, Mail::Mailer, and talking directly to the mail host.
  We'll go over each of these methods in turn. We'll present an
  example of sending mail with each of the three different
  methods.</p>

  <h3>Sending with Mail::Mailer</h3>

  <p>Mail::Mailer, included as part of the MailTools module, sits
  on top of Net::SMTP, so it requires the libnet bundle to run.
  Both modules are well worth the time, so install (or get your
  sysadmin to install) them into your production tree. They're
  worth it. Anyway, as you can see from the <a href=
  "tpj0402-0026.html">sample program</a>, sending mail with
  Mail::Mailer's pretty straightforward. The whole thing's only 14
  lines, and that's including comments.</p>

  <p>The one thing to keep in mind with Mail::Mailer is that it
  figures out the sender and recipients from the headers of the
  mail message, so you lose the separation of the envelope and
  headers. That's not necessarily bad, just something to
  remember.</p>

  <h3>Sending with Net::SMTP</h3>

  <p>Net::SMTP, which is included as part of the libnet bundle,
  puts a fairly thin wrapper around the SMTP conversation, just
  barely encapsulating it. There's one function call for each step
  of the SMTP conversation, with just enough code wrapped around
  things to perform tasks like error checking.</p>

  <p>As you can see from the <a href=
  "tpj0402-0027.html">example</a>, it's a bit more verbose than
  using Mail::Mailer, though not by much. You've got full control
  over the SMTP conversation this way, although you don't get
  fine-grained response codes.</p>

  <h3>Sending things by hand</h3>

  <p>Finally, there's the fully manual way. It's significantly
  longer than any of our other methods -- too long for this
  magazine, but you can find my <tt>smailer.pl</tt> program on the
  TPJ web site. The reason it's so long is that we include the code
  that actually sends the mail out. In the other examples that code
  is encapsulated in other modules.</p>

  <p>We're not going to spend too much time going over this code,
  because you can't see it here. However, we'll touch on a few high
  points. You'll notice, for example, that we use <tt>syswrite</tt>
  to write the data out, while we use <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> to read it
  in, and on two different filehandles to boot. Why?</p>

  <p>Well, the big reason is to compensate for a variety of odd
  socket and <tt>stdio</tt> implementations on the platforms that
  Perl runs on. <tt>syswrite</tt> is guaranteed to work for
  writing, and <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> works okay for reading. They each
  use a separate filehandle to make sure there aren't any
  underlying <tt>stdio</tt> buffer collisions.</p>

  <p>You'll also note that the code doesn't really care much which
  non-<tt>2</tt>xx response code it gets--it considers them all
  errors and returns the status to the caller of the subroutine,
  who can hopefully do something reasonable with the return
  values.</p>

  <p>Other than that, the code is pretty straightforward. The
  <tt>smailer()</tt> subroutine is written such that you ought to
  be able to just cut and paste it into your own code and have it
  run. (You can, for example, fill in some of the empty variables
  at the top of the subroutine if you want to avoid the overhead of
  computing them on every invocation.)</p>

  <h3>So which do you choose?</h3>

  <p>Now that we've covered the three different methods, the next
  question is--which one is the right one? The answer, of course,
  is "it depends."</p>

  <p>The hand-rolled method is the lightest of the three methods:
  It's snappy and takes up very little memory, although it does
  sacrifice some flexibility. For instance, it doesn't handle
  ESMTP, the extension to SMTP that allows for delivery
  notifications and 8-bit characters in mail messages.</p>

  <p>Net::SMTP is more flexible than the hand-rolled way of doing
  things, but you pay for that increased flexibility in several
  ways. It's fully object-oriented, which means that it incurs
  Perl's not insubstantial method call overhead. It's also layered
  on top of the IO modules, which are themselves quite large. (This
  is only a consideration if you're not already using them, of
  course.) On the other hand, it does talk ESMTP, and exposes SMTP
  in easy-to-use pieces.</p>

  <p>Mail::Mailer is the most flexible of the three methods. In
  addition to connecting via SMTP, it can also send mail by
  invoking <tt>sendmail</tt>, or by firing off <tt>mail</tt> or an
  equivalent. It's also got the highest overhead in terms of both
  speed and memory usage. It's layered on top of Net::SMTP, and so
  inherits the Net::SMTP overhead as well as generating some of its
  own.</p>

  <p>In general, I'd recommend using Mail::Mailer for
  general-purpose mailing work. While it's got some overhead, the
  delays you might incur will be far less than typical network
  latency. The extra flexibility and robustness are worth it.</p>

  <p>If you find the overhead of Mail::Mailer is a bit much,
  especially if your need to send mail using minimal computational
  resources, go for the hand-rolled approach. Also, if you're not
  using any of the IO modules, and you're not sending mail that's
  got 8-bit characters in it, the hand-rolled method should work
  well.</p>

  <p>Finally, for the very curious, it is possible to write a
  reasonable emulation of sendmail with Perl and these mail
  routines, at least enough to send mail with it. I have an
  implementation that I mess with on and off. Versions occasionally
  make it to my CPAN directory, so you can always check there to
  see how it's going.</p>
