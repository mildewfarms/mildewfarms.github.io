  <p>With all the excitement over the things that we can make Perl
  do, we sometimes lose sight of the fact that Perl's greatest
  strength is the ease with which you can use it to glue
  independent programs together into a single powerful application.
  This toolkit philosophy, in which large applications are built
  from many small command-line tools, is the great simplifying
  principle of the Unix operating system, and one that Perl readily
  takes advantage of.</p>

  <p>This column addresses a case in point. Say you are interested
  in seeing the hourly breakdown of accesses to your Web site in
  order to do capacity planning. When does traffic peak and when is
  it at a minimum? Say that you want to be able to view this data
  graphically as a bar chart, and that you'd like the chart to be
  generated on the fly from a CGI script. How would you go about
  doing this?</p>

  <p>One approach would be to do all the work in Perl. Running as a
  CGI script, Perl can parse the server's access log file, tally up
  the hourly hits, generate the bar chart using the graphics
  primitives in the GD or Image::Magick modules, and output the
  plot as a GIF image. The script would be responsible for drawing
  the plot axes, calculating the width and position of the bars,
  creating the X and Y tics, and drawing the labels. Although the
  job is relatively straightforward, the program would likely take
  at least half a day to write and debug, and would certainly be
  several pages of code by the time you were finished.</p>

  <p>But why reinvent the wheel? There are many plotting packages
  available for Unix and Windows systems, and most of these can be
  called as subprocesses from within Perl. One of the more
  ubiquitous plotting packages is Gnuplot, an open source package
  that comes preinstalled on many Linux systems, and is available
  as source and precompiled binaries for a variety of Unix and
  Microsoft Windows architectures. By taking advantage of this
  existing tool, we can write this CGI script in just a few
  minutes. The complete application comes to just 46 lines of
  code.</p>

  <h3>Using Gnuplot</h3>

  <p>Before we dive into the log-processing application itself,
  let's look at a simple use of Gnuplot from within Perl. Gnuplot
  was designed to draw complex mathematical functions and plot
  scientific data. It can be run interactively under the X Windows
  and Microsoft Windows systems, in which case plots are displayed
  in a graphics window, or run in batch mode from the command line,
  in which case the output graphics are written to standard output
  or a file. Gnuplot is able to generate a large variety of
  graphics file formats, including GIF and Postscript.</p>

  <p>Gnuplot has a command language that can be used to control the
  graphs it generates. In interactive mode you can type in commands
  and watch them take effect immediately. In batch mode, you feed
  Gnuplot commands from a file or standard input.</p>

  <p>Let's look at an example. From the Gnuplot command line,
  here's how to graph the equation
  <i>y</i>=sin(<i>x</i>)/cos(<i>x</i>):</p>
  <pre>
gnuplot&gt; plot sin(x)/cos(x)
</pre>

  <p>In a fraction of a second, Gnuplot displays the graph shown in
  <a href="images/stein-1.gif">Figure 1</a>. It's almost as easy to
  call Gnuplot as a subprocess from within Perl. Just open up a
  pipe to Gnuplot, and send it the commands. For example, <a href=
  "tpj0402-0006.html">Listing 1</a> shows a 6-line program to plot
  sin(<i>x</i>)/cos(<i>x</i>) from within Perl and output the
  result in GIF format. The script begins by defining a GNUPLOT
  constant indicating the path to the Gnuplot executable. It then
  opens up a pipe to Gnuplot by calling Perl's <tt>open()</tt>
  function with a pipe symbol as the first character in the
  command's name. The program next sends two commands to Gnuplot.
  The first (line 4) changes the default terminal type to
  <tt>gif</tt>, telling Gnuplot to output the graph as a GIF format
  image. Next, the script sends the <tt>plot</tt> command as
  before. The pipe is now closed and the program exits. Note that
  you'll need Gnuplot version 3.7 or higher to get GIF support,
  plus Tom Boutell's <tt>libgd</tt> graphics library. See the
  Packages Described box to obtain the most up-to-date
  versions.</p>

  <p>Gnuplot can graph experimental data as well as equations. The
  simplest format it accepts consists of a two-column table
  indicating the X and Y values of a data series. Comment lines
  beginning with the <tt>#</tt> symbol are ignored. <a href=
  "tpj0402-0007.html">Listing 2</a> shows a data table containing
  one day's worth of hourly tallies on my laboratory Web site. The
  first column is the hour (using the 24-hour clock), and the
  second column is the total number of hits. Plotting this data as
  a bar chart is a matter of setting the chart type by providing
  the <tt>set data style</tt> command with <tt>boxes</tt>, and then
  issuing the <tt>plot</tt> command with the data file name as its
  argument:</p>
  <pre>
gnuplot&gt; set data style boxes
gnuplot&gt; plot 'hours.dat'
</pre>

  <p>By fussing with various <tt>set</tt> commands, you can adjust
  many aspects of Gnuplot's display, including the graph and axis
  labels, the position of the key, the positioning and frequency of
  tics, and so forth. However, Gnuplot is oriented towards
  scientific rather than business applications, so the number of
  plot types is limited. For example, piecharts are not
  supported.</p>

  <p>What if you want the data table to be computed dynamically by
  an external program? Gnuplot provides the equivalent of Perl's
  open pipe syntax. By prepending the <tt>&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; symbol to
  the filename passed to the</tt> plot command, Gnuplot treats the
  filename as a command to execute. For example, if we had a Perl
  script named <tt>tally_log.pl</tt> whose job was to parse a Web
  access log and produce a tabular list similar to that in <a href=
  "tpj0402-0007.html">Listing 2</a>, we could plot its output
  dynamically with this command:</p>
  <pre>
gnuplot&gt; plot '&lt; tally_log.pl 
              ~www/logs/access_log'
</pre>

  <h3>Parsing Log Files</h3>

  <p>Running Gnuplot is half of our CGI script. The other half is
  the part that parses the Web server's log file.</p>

  <p>The standard or common log file format used by most Web
  servers was established years ago by the NCSA <i>httpd</i> and
  CERN servers. Each line of the access log records a single hit on
  your site and is subdivided into the seven fields described in
  <a href="tpj0402-0009.html">Table 1</a>. A typical entry looks
  like this one:</p>
  <pre>
phage.cshl.org - - [07/May/1999:01:17:19 -0400] 
                    GET / HTTP/1.0 200 6118
</pre>

  <p>To parse the various fields from within Perl, just match each
  line against the following regular expression:</p>
  <pre>
REGEX=/^(\S+) (\S+) (\S+) \[([^]]+)\] 
              (\w+) (\S+).* (\d+) (\S+)/;
while (&lt;&gt;) {
   ($host,$rfc931,$user,$date,$request,$URL,$status,$size)
              =m/$REGEX/o;
}
</pre>

  <p>You can then tally or otherwise manipulate the fields in any
  way you choose.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/stein-2.gif"><img src=
  "images/stein-2_small.gif" align="center" alt="stein-2" border=
  "2" width="100" height="110"></a><br></p>

  <p title="" align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2:</b> A
  barchart produced by <tt>tally_hourly.pl.</tt></font></p>

  <h3>Putting it All Together</h3>

  <p>The <tt>tally_hourly.pl</tt> script parses the Web server's
  access log, tallies the hourly hits, and passes the result to
  Gnuplot. It's intended to be called from an inline
  <tt>&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag like this:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;img src=/cgi-bin/tally_hourly.pl?file=access_log.1&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The script expects a single CGI parameter named <tt>file</tt>,
  which tells the script what access log file to open and parse. On
  my Web site, log files are rotated once a day,
  <tt>access_log</tt> becoming <tt>access_log.1</tt>,
  <tt>access_log.1</tt> becoming <tt>access_log.2,</tt> and so
  forth. So <tt>access_log.1</tt> always holds the complete record
  of yesterday's activities. You can put multiple days' graphs on
  the same page just by repeating the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag with
  different <tt>file</tt> parameters.</p>

  <p>A page created by <tt>tally_hourly.pl</tt> is shown in
  <a href="images/stein-2.gif">Figure 2</a> on the previous page.
  For the day plotted, accesses peaked at 11:00 in the morning, and
  then peaked again at about 5:00 in the afternoon. This pattern is
  typical of scientific sites which are most heavily accessed
  during the work day. Recreational sites are more heavily used in
  the evenings. <a href="tpj0402-0008.html">Listing 3</a> shows the
  code for <tt>tally_hourly.pl</tt>. The main trick used here is
  that the script is actually two programs which execute
  independently of one another (see the diagram in <a href=
  "images/stein-3.gif">Figure 3</a> on the next page). The first
  program is a CGI script that processes the CGI <tt>file</tt>
  parameter and invokes Gnuplot. The second program is the log file
  parser. It is invoked <i>by</i> Gnuplot when Gnuplot runs its
  <tt>plot</tt> command. The script determines which context it's
  running in by looking at the <tt>@ARGV</tt> array. If
  <tt>@ARGV</tt> is not set, then the script is running in the CGI
  context. Otherwise, it's been invoked by Gnuplot in order to
  process the log file given by the first <tt>@ARGV</tt>
  argument.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/stein-3.gif"><img src=
  "images/stein-3_small.gif" align="center" alt="stein-3" border=
  "2" width="100" height="125"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 3:</b>
  <tt>tally_hourly.pl</tt> is actually two programs:<br>
  a <tt>CGI</tt> script that calls <tt>Gnuplot</tt>, and a log file
  parser that is called by <tt>Gnuplot</tt>.</font></p>

  <p>Turning to the listing, the script begins by activating Perl's
  taint check features with the <tt>-T</tt> switch. This is
  particularly important to do in this script because it will be
  shelling out to a subprocess using untrusted user-provided data
  (the value of the <tt>file</tt> parameter). The script then turns
  on strict syntax checking and imports various functions from the
  CGI and CGI::Carp libraries. Among the functions imported from
  CGI is the <tt>-no_debug</tt> pragma, which disables CGI.pm's
  command-line debugging features. This is important to do;
  otherwise CGI.pm might enter command-line debugging mode when it
  was invoked by Gnuplot. We bring in the
  <tt>fatalsToBrowser()</tt> function from CGI::Carp, which
  automatically redirects fatal errors to the browser, helping
  track down any script failures.</p>

  <p>Line 4 hard-codes the <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable. This
  is necessary in order for the script to pass Perl's taint
  checks.</p>

  <p>Lines 5-6 define file paths for Gnuplot and the directory that
  contains the server's log files. These constants will need to be
  adjusted for your system. Line 7 puts standard output into
  unbuffered (autoflush) mode. This is necessary when calling out
  to subprocesses to ensure that the output produced by the script
  and the subprocess appear in the order you intend rather than the
  order determined by incompatible I/O buffering schemes.</p>

  <p>Line 11 examines the <tt>@ARGV</tt> array. If it is not set,
  then the script is running in the CGI environment. Otherwise, the
  script is running under Gnuplot. In the former case, the script
  recovers the log file name from the <tt>file</tt> parameter,
  untaints it using a pattern match, and prepends the log directory
  path to the untainted file name. The pattern match is set up to
  match any file name beginning with an alphabetic character and
  followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters, the hyphen, or
  the dot. This specifically excludes filenames containing shell
  metacharacters such as <tt>&gt;</tt>, and relative path names
  like <tt>..</tt>. The script tests that the file exists and is
  readable. If so, it calls a function named
  <tt>generate_gif()</tt> to create the barchart (line 17).</p>

  <p>If there is a command-line argument in the <tt>@ARGV</tt>
  array, then the script knows it has been invoked by Gnuplot. The
  command-line argument contains the full path to the log file to
  process. The script calls <tt>generate_data()</tt> to tally the
  indicated log file and produce the tabular summary for Gnuplot's
  use (line 22). Lines 24-34 contain the definition of
  <tt>generate_gif()</tt>. It emits an HTTP header with a content
  type field of <tt>image/gif</tt>. It then opens up a pipe to
  Gnuplot and sends it graphing commands. Most of the commands are
  constant boilerplate read from the script's <tt>--DATA--</tt>
  section. I arrived at this set of commands by playing with
  Gnuplot interactively until the graph looked the way I wanted it.
  Then the subroutine sends Gnuplot the <tt>plot</tt> command,
  telling it to run a pipe constructed from the <tt>$0</tt>
  variable, which holds the name of the currently running script,
  and the value of the <tt>file</tt> parameter. The plot command
  ends up looking something like this:</p>
  <pre>
plot '&lt; /www/cgi-bin/tally_hourly.pl/www/logs/access_log.1'
</pre>

  <p>The subroutine closes the Gnuplot pipe and exits. Gnuplot
  sends its output to standard output, which then forwarded to the
  waiting browser.</p>

  <p>Lines 35-46 define <tt>generate_data()</tt>, which is called
  on to process the log file and produce a summary in Gnuplot data
  format. It reads through the log file line by line using the
  <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> operator and parses out the hour part of the
  request time. In this case, we don't need any of the other
  fields, so the more general regular expression that we looked at
  previously isn't needed. The parsed hour is added to a hash named
  <tt>%HITS</tt>, which keeps track of how many hits we've seen in
  each interval. When the subroutine reaches the end of the log
  file, it sorts the keys of <tt>%HITS</tt> numerically and prints
  out a two column table in Gnuplot format.</p>

  <h3>Simple Things Made Easy</h3>

  <p>The <tt>tally_hourly.pl</tt> script is another example of how
  Perl makes simple things easy, and hard things possible. By using
  a preexisting tool rather than rolling our own, a script that
  might have been a bear to write became almost trivial.</p>

  <p>With a little more work, you could adapt this script for other
  sorts of log processing tasks, such as plotting hits by day of
  the week, summing over domain names, or tallying up the bandwidth
  used by the Web server. By replacing Gnuplot with a charting
  package oriented towards business graphics, you can produce pie
  charts, stacked column charts and other displays with little
  additional effort.</p>
