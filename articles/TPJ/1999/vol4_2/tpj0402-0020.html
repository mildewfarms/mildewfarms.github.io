  <h2 align="center">Building a Better Hash or how to Pretend to be
  a Perl Wizard</h2>

  <h4>Dan Schmidt</h4>

  <p>One of the nice things about Perl is its support for reuse. I
  can solve a problem once, and then generalize it so that everyone
  else with the same problem can use my solution. In this article,
  I'll examine a simple problem and take it through the steps
  required to turn it to a reusable module. Along the way, we'll
  visit the topics of data structures, ties, optimization, and
  testing.</p>

  <h3>The problem</h3>

  <p>Someone on the Boston Perl Mongers mailing list asked how to
  efficiently manage a collection of items such that you can insert
  and delete values quickly, but also choose random values
  quickly.</p>

  <p>In a hash, it's easy to insert and delete values:</p>
  <pre>
$hash{$key} = $value;
delete $hash{$key};
</pre>

  <p>But accessing random values is inefficient:</p>
  <pre>
my @k = keys %hash;
$rand = $k[rand @k];
</pre>

  <p>You can access random values quickly in an array, but you
  can't insert and delete values quickly.</p>

  <p>I might run into this problem if I were a soft-hearted person
  running an ongoing raffle. I'd keep track of the tickets people
  buy, and choose one randomly whenever it's time to select a
  winner. Because I'm a nice guy, I'd let people drop out of the
  raffle whenever they want and get their money back. If someone
  wanted to drop out of the raffle like that, I'd need a way to
  find his or her ticket quickly.</p>

  <h3>Discussion of the problem</h3>

  <p>To restate the problem a little more formally, we want some
  sort of lookup table in which <i>insertion</i>, <i>lookup</i>,
  <i>deletion</i>, and <i>random selection</i> are all fast.</p>

  <p>Do any of Perl's built-in data types do the trick? Let's
  compare the various naive data structures one could use for this
  problem:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>

      <td><b><tt>array</tt></b></td>

      <td><b><tt>hash</tt></b></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><b><tt>insertion</tt></b></td>

      <td><tt>O(1)</tt></td>

      <td><tt>O(1)</tt></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><b><tt>lookup</tt></b></td>

      <td><tt>O(n)</tt></td>

      <td><tt>O(1)</tt></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><b><tt>deletion</tt></b></td>

      <td><tt>O(n)</tt></td>

      <td><tt>O(1)</tt></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><b><tt>random key</tt></b></td>

      <td><tt>O(1)</tt></td>

      <td><tt>O(n)</tt></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p><tt>O(n)</tt> (pronounced "order n") is <i>linear time</i>:
  When there are <i>n</i> elements in the data structure, the
  operation takes time proportional to <i>n</i>. If an operation is
  <tt>O(1)</tt>, it takes time proportional to 1; that is, it runs
  in constant time.</p>

  <p>Arrays are great for selecting a random key, since it's easy
  to choose a random index, and then our random key is just the
  element at that index. But arrays are lousy for looking up keys,
  since we have to look through all the elements until we find the
  key we're looking for. When Bartholomew asks for his ticket back,
  I'll have to look through all of the tickets one at a time until
  I find the one with his name on it.</p>

  <p>Hashes were invented specifically to perform fast lookup, but
  there's no quick way of indexing all the entries of a hash. We
  can easily obtain a list of the keys with <tt>keys %hash</tt>,
  but that requires a pass through the whole hash to find all the
  keys, which takes too much time for this problem. When it's time
  to choose a raffle winner, I don't want to have to take time out
  and count through every single ticket.</p>

  <p>It's important to note that if I don't have to select a random
  key very often, hashes are fine. If I only have to select a
  raffle winner once, it's not a big deal to spend a long time
  doing it. Similarly, if I never need to lookup or delete
  elements, arrays work great.</p>

  <p>(Hash behavior is a little more complicated than I'm
  pretending here, but element access is effectively
  <tt>O(1)</tt>.)</p>

  <h3>Attempted solutions</h3>

  <p>So how are we going to construct a new column in that table in
  which every operation is <tt>O(1)</tt>?</p>

  <p>It seems clear that we need a hash of some sort; it's just too
  hard to get fast lookup otherwise. How can we add a fast random
  key selection operation to a hash?</p>

  <h3>Check for built-in support</h3>

  <p>The first thing to do is to see if the solution is already
  built into Perl. Maybe the internal representation of a hash
  includes an array of keys, and <tt>keys %hash</tt> simply returns
  an alias to it. Perl does enough smart things under the hood that
  it's worth checking that it isn't already doing our work for
  us.</p>

  <p>Let's do a little timing test to see if selecting a random key
  of a hash gets slower as the hash gets bigger:</p>
  <pre>
use Benchmark;
&#13;for $i (1..10)    {$little_hash{$i} = $i}
for $i (1..100)   {$big_hash{$i} = $i}
timethese (10000,  {
           little =&gt; sub {$foo = (keys %little_hash)[rand keys
                     %little_hash]}, 
           big    =&gt; sub {$foo = 
                     (keys %big_hash)[rand keys %big_hash]},
           });
</pre>

  <p><tt>Benchmark::timethese</tt> is the standard way to compare
  the speed of code fragments. The first argument is the number of
  trials to run; the second argument is a reference to a hash that
  maps names to code fragments.</p>

  <p>I should explain those code fragments. <tt>keys %hash</tt>
  returns an array of the keys of the hash; the tricky thing is
  that inside the square brackets, that return value is put in a
  scalar context to provide an argument for <tt>rand</tt>, turning
  it into the length of the array, which is the number of keys.</p>

  <p>Anyway, here's the output I got:</p>
  <pre>
Benchmark:  timing 10000 iterations of big, little...
      big:  5.43 CPU secs ( 5.43 usr +  0.00 sys)
   little:  0.70 CPU secs ( 0.70 usr +  0.00 sys)
</pre>

  <p>Here we can see that when we made the hash ten times as big,
  it took eight times as long to select a random key. So Perl
  hasn't already solved the problem for us.</p>

  <h3>See if a solution already exists</h3>

  <p>Next (actually, we probably should have done this first!), we
  should check if someone else has already solved the problem. The
  Perl FAQ and the <i>Perl Cookbook</i> are good first places to
  look.</p>

  <p>I didn't find any solutions there, but the Cookbook did point
  me to <tt>Tie::IxHash</tt>, which implements an indexed hash, a
  data structure that combines many of the features of hashes and
  arrays. In fact, selecting a random key from a
  <tt>Tie::IxHash</tt> is <tt>O(1)</tt>, but because it must do
  work to preserve the order of the keys, deletion is
  <tt>O(n)</tt>.</p>

  <h3>A working data structure</h3>

  <p>It looks like we'll have to find a solution ourselves. Can we
  get the best of both worlds by using both a hash and an array?
  The array just holds a list of keys, so that we can do our random
  key selection quickly. We do have to do some extra work on
  operations that modify the table (like insertion) to keep both of
  our data structures in sync, but that's still constant time; it's
  just a bigger constant. If <i>n</i> is big enough, the extra time
  we spend keeping the data structures in sync will pale next to
  the time we save on random key selection.</p>

  <p>Let's see how complicated the operations actually are.
  Insertion is already <tt>O(1)</tt> for both cases. We get
  <tt>O(1)</tt> lookup by using the hash instead of the array, and
  <tt>O(1)</tt> random key selection by using the array instead of
  the hash.</p>

  <p>The only tricky case is deletion. First of all, we need to
  actually find the key in the array so we can delete it (we didn't
  need to do that during lookup). To do that, for each key we'll
  have to store the corresponding array index in the hash, as well
  as the value, so that we can get at the correct array element.
  Secondly, we need to delete that key in constant time. We could
  splice it out by moving all the elements above it down one slot
  (and that's basically what <tt>Tie::IxHash</tt> does, since it
  has to preserve key order), but that takes linear time. The fast
  way to delete an element from an array is just to move the last
  element of the array into that slot. Since we don't have to
  preserve order, that works great; we just have to make sure the
  hash gets updated along with it. Way up above in my original
  table, I claimed that deleting an element from an array is O(n).
  Was I lying? Well, sort of. Actually deleting the element, once
  you've found it, is an <tt>O(1)</tt> operation using the trick I
  just mentioned; it's finding that element in the first place
  that's the painful part. By using the hash, we're able to find
  the element quickly, and the rest is gravy.</p>

  <h3>Implementation</h3>

  <p>Okay, let's implement it.</p>
  <pre>
package RndHash1;
&#13;sub new {
  bless { arr =&gt; (), hash =&gt; {} }, $_[0];
}
&#13;sub insert {
  my ($self, $key, $val) = @_;
  push @{$self-&gt;{arr}}, $key;        # update array
  # update hash
  $self-&gt;{hash}{$key} = [$val, $     #{$self-&gt;{arr}}];
}
&#13;sub get {
  my ($self, $key) = @_;
  $self-&gt;{hash}{$key}[0];             # look up in hash
}
&#13;sub delete {
  my ($self, $key) = @_;
  # index in array to delete
  my $idx = $self-&gt;{hash}{$key}[1];
  # get last element
  my $moved_key = $self-&gt;{arr}[-1]; 
  $self-&gt;{arr}[$idx] = $moved_key;     # and move it here  
  $self-&gt;{hash}{$moved_key}[1] = $idx; # update hash
  # shorten array
  --$#{$self-&gt;{arr}};          
  # remove key from hash
  delete $self-&gt;{hash}{$key};     
}
&#13;sub rnd_key {
  my ($self) = @_;
  $self-&gt;{arr}[rand @{$self-&gt;{arr}}];
}
1;
</pre>

  <p>If you've been scared away in the past from creating classes,
  cower no more. The only tricky part of writing a class is the
  <tt>new()</tt> subroutine, which gets passed the class as the
  first argument. <tt>bless()</tt> just takes the little hash
  reference we made and turns it into a reference that knows it's a
  RndHash1. Then each method of the class gets passed the object
  it's being called on as its first argument.</p>

  <p>The hash that we create has only two elements. <tt>arr</tt> is
  an array containing all the keys, and <tt>hash</tt> is the actual
  hash with the key-value mapping. Actually, as we noted above, the
  hash also needs to associate an array index with each key. So the
  value it associates with each key is a tiny two-element array;
  element 0 is the real value, and element 1 is the index of that
  key in <tt>arr</tt>. Once you've gotten past that,
  <tt>delete</tt> is really the only interesting function here. We
  do have to catch a boundary case; what happens when the element
  we're deleting is the last element of the array? The code here
  happens to work in that case too, though it does do a little
  unnecessary work.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0402-0021.html">Listing 1</a> shows another little
  benchmarking program, and <a href="tpj0402-0022.html">Listing
  2</a> shows the results; yep, we speeded things up a lot! This
  benchmark tries to emulate typical use of the package; each time
  through the (implicit) loop, we add a new element and randomly
  delete one of the existing ones.</p>

  <p>It's important to actually perform this timing comparison. It
  was possible that our new implementation had enough overhead that
  it didn't actually perform better than built-in hashes on
  normal-sized data sets. By timing it, we see that in fact, it is
  definitely worthwhile to use RndHash.</p>

  <h3>Implementing a tied hash</h3>

  <p>We still have a few problems, though. For one thing, the
  implementation isn't robust at all. <tt>insert</tt> doesn't check
  to see if the key already exists; <tt>delete</tt> doesn't check
  to make sure that the key does exist.</p>

  <p>Also, the syntax used to access the object isn't very
  idiomatic. It would be nice if we could use a RndHash in the same
  way that we use a normal hash.</p>

  <p>In fact, we can, using Perl's <tt>tie</tt> feature.
  <tt>tie</tt> allows us to override Perl's built-in implementation
  of a variable. For example, if we <tt>tie</tt> a variable to an
  object we've created, then every time Perl would normally set the
  variable, it will instead call the <tt>STORE()</tt> method. A
  standard example is a database on disk; by using <tt>tie</tt>, we
  can make retrieving and updating values in the database look just
  like using a hash. Once the <tt>tie</tt> is set up, the
  programmer needn't even know that it exists.</p>

  <p>A complete hash implementation needs to support eight
  fundamental operations, most of which we've already written in
  some form or another.</p>
  <pre>
package RndHash2;
&#13;sub TIEHASH {
  bless { hash =&gt; {}, arr =&gt; (), iter =&gt; 0 }, $_[0];
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>TIEHASH</tt> is exactly analogous to <tt>new()</tt> for a
  regular class. We'll be using <tt>iter</tt> to implement the code
  that is called when people write code like <tt>while (($key,
  $value) = each %hash)</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
sub STORE {
  my ($self, $key, $val) = @_;
  if (exists $self-&gt;{hash}{$key}) {
     $self-&gt;{hash}{$key}[0] = $val;
  } else {
     push @{$self-&gt;{arr}}, $key;
     $self-&gt;{hash}{$key} = [$val, $#{$self-&gt;{arr}}];
  }
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>STORE()</tt> is called for any attempt to set an element
  in the hash, such as <tt>$hash{$key} = $value</tt>. That element
  might already exist in the hash, and if so, we only want to
  update the value, not push a new key onto our array.</p>
  <pre>
sub FETCH {
  my ($self, $key) = @_;
  return $self-&gt;{hash}{$key}[0];
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>FETCH()</tt> is called in response to code that reads
  elements from the hash. We kind of have two cases, since the
  element may or may not exist, but it turns out that one piece of
  code handles both cases; if the key isn't in the hash, it returns
  <tt>undef</tt>, which is what we want.</p>
  <pre>
sub DELETE {
  my ($self, $key) = @_;
  my $idx = $self-&gt;{hash}{$key}[1];
  if (defined $idx) {
     my $moved_key                = $self-&gt;{arr}[-1];
     $self-&gt;{arr}[$idx]           = $moved_key;
     $self-&gt;{hash}{$moved_key}[1] = $idx;
     --$#{$self-&gt;{arr}};
     delete $self-&gt;{hash}{$key};
  } else {
     return undef;
  }
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>DELETE()</tt> now has to check whether the key that's
  passed already exists in our hash. If not, we return
  <tt>undef</tt>, since that's how built-in hashes operate.</p>
  <pre>
sub EXISTS {
  exists $_[0]-&gt;{hash}{$_[1]};
}
&#13;sub CLEAR {
  %{$_[0]-&gt;{hash}} = ();
  @{$_[0]-&gt;{arr}}  = ();
  $_[0]-&gt;{iter}    = 0;
}
</pre>

  <p>Here are a couple of methods needed for completeness which we
  hadn't bothered with before. The <tt>EXISTS()</tt> subroutine
  implements Perl's <tt>exists</tt> function; we just pass the
  arguments on to the underlying hash we're using. <tt>CLEAR()</tt>
  destroys the hash; we just set our underlying data structures to
  be empty.</p>
  <pre>
sub FIRSTKEY {
  $_[0]-&gt;{iter} = 0;
  return $_[0]-&gt;NEXTKEY();
}
&#13;sub NEXTKEY {
  my ($self) = @_;
  if ($self-&gt;{iter} &lt;= $#{$self-&gt;{arr}}) {
     return $self-&gt;{arr}[$self-&gt;{iter}++];
  } else {
     return undef;
  }
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>FIRSTKEY()</tt> and <tt>NEXTKEY()</tt> are used to
  implement <tt>each</tt>. They are also used to implement
  <tt>keys</tt> and <tt>values</tt>, since Perl has no other way to
  find out the contents of a RndHash. Calling
  <b><small><tt>FIRSTKEY()</tt></small></b> once, and then
  <tt>NEXTKEY()</tt> until <tt>undef</tt> is returned, provides the
  complete list of keys. We don't have to return them in any
  particular order, but we'd be fools not to use the order we're
  already using internally.</p>

  <p>To keep state, we use an object variable <tt>iter</tt>, which
  is the index of the next key to provide. Then all
  <tt>FIRSTKEY()</tt> has to do is prime the index and hand off to
  <tt>NEXTKEY()</tt>.</p>

  <p>It does seem rather silly that when someone calls <tt>keys
  %hash</tt>, Perl calls <tt>NEXTKEY()</tt> a gazillion times. We
  already have that list lying around; wouldn't it be easier and
  more efficient for us to just be able to return
  <tt>@{$self-&gt;{arr}}</tt> directly? Yeah, it would, but we have
  no way of telling Perl that it's able to do that. The above eight
  methods constitute the only interface we need to fake built-in
  hash functionality. However, we can make our own interface
  analogous to <tt>keys</tt>, so that someone who knows about the
  fast access can do it:</p>
  <pre>
sub get_keys {
  @{$_[0]-&gt;{arr}}; 
}
&#13;sub get_values {
  my ($self) = @_;
  map {$self-&gt;{hash}{$_}[0]} @{$self-&gt;{arr}};
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>get_keys()</tt> returns the list of keys that we have
  lying around. If called in a scalar context, the
  <tt>@</tt>-expression automatically evaluates to the number of
  elements in the list, rather than the list itself. You might
  wonder why we're passing back the entire array, rather than a
  reference to it. For one thing, we're trying to emulate the
  behavior of <tt>keys</tt>, which returns an array rather than a
  reference. Also, if we passed back a reference, people would then
  have a handle into our internal data structure, and could modify
  it at will. Maybe you trust them not to do that. I don't.</p>

  <p>Moving on, <tt>get_values()</tt> takes that same list of keys,
  and uses <tt>map</tt> to replace each key with the value
  corresponding to it. If you're more comfortable with looping by
  hand than with using <tt>map</tt>, take a minute to see what's
  going on here; it's a perfect example of when <tt>map</tt> is
  much easier to use than an explicit loop.</p>

  <p>Finally, here's the reason we wrote this class in the first
  place:</p>
  <pre>
sub rnd_key {
  $_[0]-&gt;{arr}[rand @{$_[0]-&gt;{arr}}]; 
}
1;
</pre>

  <h3>Using a tied hash</h3>

  <p>Great, we've implemented it. Now, how are we going to use it?
  Like this:</p>
  <pre>
use RndHash2;
$fruit_handle = tie %fruit, 'RndHash2';
</pre>

  <p>Now we can use <tt>%fruit</tt> exactly like a normal hash, but
  under the hood, it's a RndHash2.</p>
  <pre>
  
$fruit{'a'} = 'apple';
$fruit{'b'} = 'banana';
$fruit{'c'} = 'cantaloupe';
delete $fruit{'b'};
</pre>

  <p>But how do we call <tt>rnd_key()</tt>? There's no standard
  hash interface for that. Conveniently, <tt>tie</tt> returns the
  actual object created by <tt>TIEHASH()</tt>, so we can call
  methods on that just as on any other object.</p>
  <pre>
print "My favorite fruit is a ", 
          $fruit_handle-&gt;rnd_key(), "\n";
</pre>

  <p>I actually like to use <tt>$fruit</tt> instead of
  <tt>$fruit_handle</tt>; because of the way Perl handles names,
  the scalar <tt>$fruit</tt> exists independently of the hash
  <tt>%fruit</tt>. But that's potentially confusing, and I probably
  shouldn't encourage it.</p>

  <p>Super! Let's benchmark again, just for fun:</p>

  <h3>Listing 3:</h3>
  <pre>
use RndHash1;
use RndHash2;
use Benchmark;
&#13;$rndhash1 = new RndHash1;
$rndhash2_handle = tie %rndhash2, 'RndHash2';
for $i (1..500) {$hash{$i} = $i}
for $i (1..500) {$rndhash1-&gt;insert($i, $i)}
for $i (1..500) {$rndhash2{$i} = $i}
$i = 1000;
timethese (5000, {
hash =&gt; sub { $hash{$i++}='a';
              @keys = keys %hash;
              delete $hash{$keys[rand @keys]}; },
RndHash1 =&gt; sub { $rndhash1-&gt;insert ($i++, 'a');
            $rndhash1-&gt;delete ($rndhash1-&gt;rnd_key()); },
RndHash2 =&gt; sub { $rndhash2{$i++}='a';
            delete $rndhash2{$rndhash2_handle-&gt;rnd_key()}; }
});
</pre>

  <h3>Listing 4:</h3>
  <pre>
Benchmark: timing 5000 iterations of RndHash1, RndHash2, 
                                     hash...
 RndHash1:  1.07 CPU secs ( 1.02 usr +  0.05 sys)
 RndHash2:  1.47 CPU secs ( 1.38 usr +  0.09 sys)
     hash: 22.09 CPU secs (22.08 usr +  0.01 sys)
</pre>

  <p>Ugh, we've slowed things down by almost 40%. Why is that?
  We've changed two things since RndHash1: we made the
  implementation more robust by doing things such as checking if a
  key already exists, and we tied it to a class. Let's try to
  isolate the two effects by timing what happens when we call the
  methods explicitly, rather than through the <tt>tie</tt>
  functionality:</p>

  <h3>Listing 5:</h3>
  <pre>
use RndHash1;
use RndHash2;
use Benchmark;
&#13;$rndhash1 = new RndHash1;
$rndhash2_handle = tie %rndhash2, 'RndHash2';
$rh3 = tie %rndhash3, 'RndHash2';
&#13;for $i (1..500) {$rndhash1-&gt;insert($i, $i)}
for $i (1..500) {$rndhash2{$i} = $i}
for $i (1..500) {$rndhash3{$i} = $i}
&#13;$i = 1000;
&#13;timethese (25000, {
  RndHash1 =&gt; sub { $rndhash1-&gt;insert ($i++, 'a');
           $rndhash1-&gt;delete ($rndhash1-&gt;rnd_key()); },
  RndHash2 =&gt; sub { $rndhash2{$i++}='a';
           delete $rndhash2{$rndhash2_handle-&gt;rnd_key()}; },  
  RndHash3 =&gt; sub { $rh3-&gt;STORE($i++, 'a');
           $rh3-&gt;DELETE($rh3-&gt;rnd_key()); }
});
</pre>

  <h3>Listing 6:</h3>
  <pre>
RndHash1:  5.58 CPU secs ( 5.40 usr +  0.18 sys)
RndHash2:  7.64 CPU secs ( 7.23 usr +  0.41 sys)
RndHash3:  5.61 CPU secs ( 5.34 usr +  0.27 sys)
</pre>

  <p>Hmm -- when we didn't go through the indirection of
  <tt>tie</tt>, our new code was just as fast as before. So it
  looks like the slowdown is due almost entirely due to
  <tt>tie</tt>. Every time we do a hash access, Perl has to go see
  what it's tied to and then call a method on that object.</p>

  <p>It looks like that's the price we'll have to pay for the
  convenience of using <tt>tie</tt>. Even the new, slower code is a
  lot faster than using a regular hash, so it's not too
  worrisome.</p>

  <h3>Testing</h3>

  <p>Great, we're done! Well, we're done with the first draft. Now
  we have to make sure that it works. It's easy to eyeball the
  code, decide it looks reasonable, try it on a few test cases, and
  ship it out, but there are often bugs lurking about. In fact, I
  made a few stupid mistakes when I first coded this up. Here's how
  I caught them.</p>

  <p>The easiest way to check whether a class is working is to
  figure out how you could tell if an object of that class were
  broken. For example, if some key is in
  <tt>@{$self-&gt;{arr}}</tt> but not in
  <tt>%{$self-&gt;{hash}}</tt>, that's obviously a problem. We can
  write a little method to check for this kind of obvious
  brokenness, and see if it ever squawks. I'm going to call this
  "verification"; you may know it as "sanity checking". If you see
  a discussion of "representation invariants" in some
  object-oriented textbook, this is what they're talking about.</p>
  <pre>
sub verify {
  my ($self) = @_;
  my $arr_size  = @{$self-&gt;{arr}};
  my $hash_size = keys %{$self-&gt;{hash}};
  if ($arr_size != $hash_size) {
     die "RndHash: sizes of 'arr' and 
               'hash' don't match!\n" . 
               "$arr_size vs $hash_size\n";
  }
  for (my $key_idx = 0, my $key = $self-&gt;{arr}[0]; 
              $key_idx &lt;= $#{$self-&gt;{arr}}; 
              ++$key_idx, $key = $self-&gt;{arr}[$key_idx]) { 
     if (!exists $self-&gt;{hash}{$key}) { 
        die "RndHash: $key is in 'arr' but not 
                   'hash'!\n";
     } 
     if ($self-&gt;{hash}{$key}-&gt;[1] != $key_idx) {
        die "RndHash: index for $key in 'hash' is 
               incorrect!\n" . "Should be $key_idx 
               but is $self-&gt;{hash}{$key}-&gt;[1]\n"; 
     } 
  }
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>verify()</tt> confirms that our data structure is
  self-consistent. First we check that the array and the hash are
  the same size. Then we make sure that each element in the array
  also exists in the hash, and that the array index stored in the
  hash is correct.</p>

  <p>We don't have to check that the array is missing any elements,
  since each element in the array checked out, and we already
  confirmed that the number of array elements is the same as the
  number of hash elements.</p>

  <p>Here's a start at a little testing program:</p>
  <pre>
use RndHash2;
&#13;$rndhash2_handle = tie %rndhash2, 'RndHash2';
&#13;for $i (1..500) {$rndhash2{$i} = $i}
&#13;for $i (450..600) {
  print "insert $i / 'a'\n"; 
  $rndhash2{$i} = 'a'; 
  $rndhash2_handle-&gt;verify(); 
  $rnd_key = $rndhash2_handle-&gt;rnd_key(); 
  print "delete $rnd_key\n"; 
  delete $rndhash2{$rnd_key}; 
  $rndhash2_handle-&gt;verify(); 
}
</pre>

  <p>I made <tt>$i</tt> go from 450 to 600 to exercise the
  <tt>STORE()</tt> code that updates already-existing keys. After
  each RndHash operation, we call <tt>verify()</tt> to see if the
  object still makes sense.</p>

  <p>A complete test suite for RndHash would also need to check
  that each operation does what it's supposed to. For example, the
  list of keys after doing a <tt>STORE()</tt> of a new element
  should be the same as the old list, but with that element added.
  We would also check to make sure that the package functions in
  degenerate cases, such as when there's only one element.</p>

  <p>Lest you think I'm just recommending testing to be politically
  correct, I actually caught a couple of embarrassing bugs this
  way. One was that in <tt>DELETE()</tt>, I was forgetting to
  actually remove the element from the hash. Also, in one place I
  forgot that <tt>%{$self-&gt;{hash}}</tt> stores [value, index]
  pairs, not just values.</p>

  <h3>Optimizations</h3>

  <p><font size="+1">&bull;</font> <b>Time</b> Great, we're done!
  Well, there are still some improvements we could make. For one
  thing, it seems kind of slow to be constantly performing hash
  lookups on the strings "hash" and "arr" every time we want any
  information from our class. We could just use an array instead of
  a hash, and then index by 0, 1, and 2, instead of by "hash",
  "arr", and "iter". I'll just include a couple of methods here, so
  you get the idea:</p>
  <pre>
sub TIEHASH {
  bless [
            {},   # 0: hash
            [],   # 1: arr
            0     # 2: iter
        ], $_[0];
}
&#13;sub STORE {
  my ($self, $key, $val) = @_;
  if (exists $self-&gt;[0]{$key}) {
     $self-&gt;[0]{$key}[0] = $val;
  } else {
     push @{$self-&gt;[1]}, $key;
     $self-&gt;[0]{$key} = [$val, $#{$self-&gt;[1]}];
  }
}
</pre>

  <p>Eh, not very readable. It would be handy if Perl could do this
  kind of thing for us, turning hash accesses into array accesses
  automatically in the appropriate places. Well, it turns out that
  it can, in Perl 5.005, using the <tt>use fields</tt> directive. I
  want this code to work in earlier versions, so I'm not going to
  use it, but once 5.005 becomes common, that'll be the preferred
  solution.</p>

  <p>Anyway, we should make sure that we're actually getting some
  speed increase out of this. I'll spare you the benchmarking
  program and just show the results:</p>
  <pre>
Benchmark: timing 25000 iterations of RndHash1, RndHash2, 
                                      RndHash4...
 RndHash1:  6.35 CPU secs ( 6.35 usr +  0.00 sys)
 RndHash2: 10.50 CPU secs (10.50 usr +  0.00 sys)
 RndHash4:  9.81 CPU secs ( 9.81 usr +  0.00 sys)
</pre>

  <p>Not earth-shattering, but definitely an improvement. Whether
  to sacrifice readability is a judgment call; I decided to go for
  it.</p>

  <p><font size="+1">&bull;</font> <b>Space</b> There's another
  kind of waste going on. Every element of the hash part contains a
  reference to a two-element array. Perl's arrays are really
  flexible; unfortunately, one of the prices we pay for the
  flexibility is that they take a lot of space. For one thing, Perl
  doesn't know that we have an array with exactly two elements that
  will never have to grow, so it starts out by allocating some
  extra space for it. That's not a big deal if we have a few arrays
  around, but with one for each key, it can add up.</p>

  <p>There's a way we could save some of that space. Instead of
  keeping both an array index and a value in the hash element, we
  just store the array index. Then we can have an array of values,
  parallel to the array of keys, so that the value of
  <tt>$self-&gt;{key_arr}[$i]</tt> is
  <tt>$self-&gt;{val_arr}[$i]</tt>.</p>

  <p>Here's a new constructor and a couple of methods with this new
  structure:</p>
  <pre>
sub TIEHASH {
  bless [
             {},  # 0: hash mapping keys to indices
             [],  # 1: array of keys
             [],  # 2: array of values
             0,   # 3: iterator index 
        ],
  $_[0];
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>STORE()</tt> now puts the value in the array
  <tt>@{$self-[2]}&gt;</tt>, not the hash
  <tt>%{$self-[0]}&gt;</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
sub STORE {
  my ($self, $key, $val) = @_;
  if (exists $self-&gt;[0]{$key}) {
     # update
     $self-&gt;[2][$self-&gt;[0]{$key}] = $val;
  } else {
     # new key
     push @{$self-&gt;[1]}, $key;
     push @{$self-&gt;[2]}, $val;
     $self-&gt;[0]{$key} = $#{$self-&gt;[1]};
  }
}
</pre>

  <p>And <tt>FETCH()</tt> has to go through one more level of
  indirection; it finds the array index through the hash, and then
  looks up the value at that array index.</p>
  <pre>
sub FETCH {
  my ($self, $key) = @_;
  if (exists $self-&gt;[0]{$key}) {
     return $self-&gt;[2][$self-&gt;[0]{$key}];
  } else {
     return undef;
  }
}
</pre>

  <p>We can see how much space this saves by writing a program that
  makes a hash with lots of keys and then hangs out. The program
  <tt>ps</tt> (on Unix) tells us how much space is being used.</p>
  <pre>
use RndHash4;
tie %rndhash4, 'RndHash4';
for $i (1..5000) {$rndhash4{$i} = $i};
print "OK\n";
$wait = &lt;&gt;;
</pre>

  <p>I ran the above test once with RndHash4 and once with RndHash5
  (the double-array implementation). Here are the results:</p>
  <pre>
~/Doc/TPJ $ ps aux | grep [p]erl
dfan 2949  6.8  5.5  3416  2628 p0 S  
              22:50 0:00 perl sizetest.pl
~/Doc/TPJ $ ps aux | grep [p]erl
dfan 2953 16.6  5.1  3164  2400  p0 S  22:51  
              0:00 perl sizetest.pl
</pre>

  <p>The fourth column tells us how much space the program is
  taking up, in kilobytes. The difference in memory, per hash
  element, comes out to be (3416 - 3164) * 1024 / 5000 = 52 bytes.
  That's not particularly exact, but it gives us some idea of how
  much memory is being saved. It did slow things down by around
  14%, though:</p>
  <pre>
Benchmark: timing 15000 iterations of RndHash4, RndHash5...
 RndHash4:  5.71 CPU secs ( 5.71 usr +  0.00 sys)
 RndHash5:  6.49 CPU secs ( 6.49 usr +  0.00 sys)
</pre>

  <p>So, as usual, it's a tradeoff: in this case, space versus
  speed. I decided that 50 bytes per element is peanuts compared to
  the 3+ megabytes that Perl is already taking up, so I kept the
  fast one.</p>

  <h3>Making it a module</h3>

  <p>Great, we're done! Well, now that we've solved this
  earth-shattering problem, maybe we should make it available for
  everyone else to use. The next step is to put it on CPAN, the
  Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.</p>

  <p>The entire step-by-step procedure for making a module and
  submitting it to CPAN is outside the scope of this article, but
  I'll outline a couple of steps here. There are really only two
  main things we have to do to make it a well-behaved module. One
  is to make a <tt>$VERSION</tt> variable, which can be accessed by
  the CPAN software and which we'll use to keep track of public
  releases. The other is to write some documentation so that anyone
  can use it. The documentation is written in pod format (see the
  <i>perlpod</i> documentation bundled with Perl). I won't include
  the finished documentation here, but you can see it by looking up
  the module on CPAN.</p>

  <h3>Summing up</h3>

  <p>Well, that's been quite a journey. Hopefully you're now more
  comfortable with some of the issues involved in making a module,
  and will consider going the extra mile the next time you come up
  with a generalizable solution to a problem you encounter.</p>

  <p>The final (for now) version of RndHash can be found on CPAN,
  with the name Tie::RndHash. Already I'm thinking of further
  extensions. How about letting the user assign weights to each
  element, so he can change the selection probability associated
  with each key? Hmm...</p>

  <p>Thanks to Tuomas J. Lukka for the original problem statement,
  and for coming up with the idea for the space optimization.</p>

  <h3>Bibliography</h3>

  <p><b>Data Structures and Algorithms:</b> You can't go wrong with
  [Sedgewick, <i>Algorithms in C</i>, Third Edition,
  Addison-Wesley, 1998] (there are also C++ and Java versions).
  This book just keeps on getting better each time he revises it.
  If you want a more rigorous approach, I recommend [Cormen,
  Leiserson, and Rivest, <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>, MIT
  Press / McGraw Hill, 1990]. Of course, [Knuth, <i>The Art of
  Computer Programming</i>, Addison-Wesley, 1998] is known as the
  bible of data structures and algorithms, because it's old and
  hard to read. Actually, it's not that bad if you don't try to
  read it straight through, and Chapter 2 (found in Volume I) is
  essential reading (and quite understandable). I'd also like to
  mention [Skiena, <i>The Algorithm Design Manual</i>,
  Springer-Verlag, 1997], since it is excellent and not well known;
  it has many case studies and a great gazetteer of algorithmic
  topics. It's a good first place to look. [Orwant, Hietaniemi, and
  Macdonald, <i>Mastering Algorithms with Perl</i>, O'Reilly, 1999]
  will be published shortly and focuses on algorithms from a Perl
  viewpoint.</p>

  <p><b>Optimization:</b> The best optimization book I know of is
  [Bentley, <i>Writing Efficient Programs</i>, Prentice-Hall,
  1982], a slim, clear, information-packed book that is,
  incredibly, out of print. Snatch it up if you ever find it.
  Bentley's other books, <i>Programming Pearls</i> and <i>More
  Programming Pearls</i>, are fine collections of case studies.</p>

  <p><b>Ties:</b> The <tt>perltie</tt> documentation is obviously
  the definitive reference. [Srinivasan, <i>Advanced Perl
  Programming</i>, O'Reilly, 1997] has a fine chapter on
  <tt>tie</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Internals:</b> If you want to see why arrays are big,
  <i>Advanced Perl Programming</i> has a good overview chapter on
  the Perl implementation.</p>

  <p><b>Modules:</b> The "Guidelines for Module Creation" section
  in <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/00modlist.long.html"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/00modlist.long.html</a>
  is the best documentation for what you need to do to submit a
  module.</p>
