  <p>In our top news story tonight, <b>The Perl Institute</b> voted
  to dissolve March 1 due primarily to the inefficiency of the
  organization. Following the dissolution, former Institute board
  member (and ex-publisher of The Perl Journal) Jon Orwant said,
  "Perl was built on the backs of volunteers, and we've been
  blessed with hundreds of people who have offered their time,
  money, expertise, and computational resources. But TPI was so
  feeble that it couldn't even say 'Thanks for your offer, here's
  what to do' to the volunteers. An organization so lame needs to
  be put down, and that's exactly what we've done." Larry Wall,
  also a former board member, discussed at the March 1 meeting the
  differences between "top-down" and "bottom-up" development, and
  he cited the Institute as an attempt at a "top-down" approach,
  while Perl culture mandates a "bottom-up" approach. The meetings
  of the final two board meetings of the Institute have been posted
  online.</p>

  <p>Assets from the Institute, which include about $3000, some
  computer equipment, and the perl.org domain name, have all been
  gifted to <b>Perl Mongers</b> (<a href="http://www.pm.org/"
  target="resource window">http://www.pm.org/</a>), and plans to
  move services to the Perl Mongers servers have already begun.
  Head Monger <tt>brian d foy</tt> said that anyone concerned about
  the state of their TPI project should contact him directly, at
  <a href="mailto:brian@pm.org">brian@pm.org</a>.</p>

  <p>On the topic of changing hands: <b>EarthWeb</b> acquired
  <b>The Perl Journal</b> in March, and has taken over
  responsibility for production, advertising, marketing,
  distribution, order fulfillment, subscription services, design,
  and the TPJ web site. The new web site features access to TPJ
  articles with username and password authentication.</p>

  <p>On to more practical matters: Two new Perl releases are out,
  5.005_03 and 5.004_05. 5.004 is still being maintained for those
  that aren't upgrading to 5.005 for some reason or another.</p>

  <p>Larry Wall was recently featured on the cover of Issue 61 of
  the Linux Journal. Wall also spoke at LinuxWorld, and his talk
  <i>Perl, the first postmodern computer language</i> is on his
  site at <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html" target=

  <p>The first <b>yapc (Yet Another Perl Conference)</b> is kicking
  off right about now: June 24 and 25 at Carnegie Mellon
  University, featuring a very low cost and lots of good speakers
  and sessions. Find out more at <a href="http://www.yapc.org/"
  target="resource window">http://www.yapc.org/</a>. Paul Hoffman's
  <b>Perl for Dummies</b> has been updated to a second edition

  <p><b>Assurdo</b>, the entity that brought us "the one true
  programming language" <b><tt>dd-sh</tt></b>, and <b>The Perl
  Filesystem</b> now bring forth <b>CLC-INTERCAL</b>, an INTERCAL
  interpreter implemented entirely in Perl. Released on April 1,
  more information on CLC-INTERCAL can be found at <a href=
  "http://www.assurdo.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.assurdo.com/</a>.</p>

  <p>Wolf Busch released <b>Lisp</b> 1.1, his version of Scheme in
  Perl. The web page and docs at <a href=
  "http://welcome.to/Wolf.Busch/" target=
  "resource window">http://welcome.to/Wolf.Busch/</a> are in
  German.</p>

  <p>Tom Christiansen started <b>Perl Power Tools: The Unix
  Reconstruction Project</b>, at http://language.perl.com/ppt/. The
  goal is quite simple: to reimplement the classic Unix command set
  in pure Perl, and to have as much fun as possible doing so. Over
  100 commands have at least some stab at them so far, and many of
  the commands have fairly complete implementations.</p>

  <p>Gareth Rees wrote <b>HTML::FromText</b>, which marks up plain
  text as HTML, converting some characters to HTML entities, and
  finding URLs and converting them to links. <b>HTML::Summary</b>
  from Ave Wrigley extracts a summary from an HTML page.</p>

  <p><b>HTML::Validator</b>, by Sami Itkonen, is a Perl module for
  validating HTML (or SGML/XML) documents. It does this by using
  <tt>nsgmls</tt>, which is the core of every validator engine on
  the web. Documents on the web can also be checked with the help
  of LWP.<b>CGI::Formalware</b> from Pen and Ron Savage converts an
  XML file into a suite of CGI forms.</p>

  <p>Jochen Wiedman's <b>HTML::EP</b> is another embedded Perl
  system, similar to <b>ePerl</b>, <b>HTML::Embperl</b>,
  <b>HTML::Mason</b>, <b>Apache::ASP</b>, and <b>Apache::SSI</b>
  (did we miss any?). These systems allow embedding of Perl in HTML
  pages, which are parsed on the server side before sending the
  pages to the client. HTML::EP emphasizes OO design and code
  reusability.</p>

  <p><b>CIPP</b> (the CgI Perl Preprocessor), from Joern Reder,
  provides another HTML embedding language for Perl, and translates
  CIPP sources to pure Perl. His <b>Apache::CIPP_Handler</b> module
  registers CIPP sources to Apache and lets Apache execute the CIPP
  sources on the fly.</p>

  <p>Cameron Kaiser's <b>HTTPi</b> is a fast, miniaturized
  HTTP/0.9, /1.0, and /1.1-compliant web server written in pure
  Perl and requiring no modules, just the Perl executable, and
  takes up just 6K. It is in the CPAN authors/id/C/CK/CKAISER/
  directory.</p>

  <p><b>DBIx::HTMLView</b>, by Hakan Ardo, is a set of modules to
  handle relational SQL databases through a DBI interface and
  create web user interfaces to them. Craig Spannring released
  <b>DBD::FreeTDS</b>, which talks to SQLServer and Sybase
  databases directly using the raw TDS protocol, obviating the need
  for third-party libraries. More information on TDS is available
  from <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/freetds/" target=
  "resource window">http://sunsite.unc.edu/freetds/</a>.</p>

  <p><b>SecurID::ACEdb</b> from Dave Carrigan is a Perl interface
  to Security Dynamics' SecurID ACE Administration Toolkit API to
  access the token, user and group databases on an ACE server.</p>

  <p>Tim Potter has released the <b>NetPacket</b> group of modules,
  which define a framework for decoding and encoding network
  packets in pure Perl. It requires external methods, like Potter's
  <b>Net::Pcap</b>, to generate the packet data. Ethernet (802.3
  and 802.2), ARP, ICMP, IGMP, IP, UDP, and TCP have been
  implemented.</p>

  <p>Fabien Tassin released <b>Data::Compare</b>, which compares
  Perl data structures, and <b>Chart::ThreeD::Pie</b> for creating
  3D pie charts. Piotr Klaban's <b>Graphics::Plotter</b> is an
  interface to libplotter, from the GNU plotutils distribution.</p>

  <p>Alistair Cunningham's <b>Gtk::Dialog</b> is a simple and easy
  to use Perl interface to create dialog boxes using the Gtk
  toolkit for X. It requires no knowledge of Gtk or advanced Perl
  features. Complex dialog boxes can be created in just a few lines
  of code. Gtk::Dialog has built in features for validation of user
  input.</p>

  <p>Tuomas J. Lukka has been working on Graphics::Simple, a basic,
  device-independent drawing API.</p>

  <p><b>Document::Info</b> from Martin Schwartz determines the file
  type of Microsoft Office documents. It requires OLE::Storage.
  Andrew Langmead's <b>Data::MacResFile</b> aids in reading
  resource fork data from Mac OS files on non-Mac platforms, and is
  available at http://world.std.com/~aml/perl/macresfile/.
  <b>Backwards</b>, from Uri Guttman, efficiently reads files
  backwards. It's at <a href="http://sysarch.com/perl/Backwards.pm"
  target=
  "resource window">http://sysarch.com/perl/Backwards.pm</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Mac::OSA::Simple</b>, from yours truly, can now get the
  compiled form of an OSA script, get the source of a compiled
  script, or save or load a compiled script.</p>

  <p>William R. Ward's <b>Barcode::Code128</b> is available for
  working with the CODE 128 encoding scheme.</p>

  <p>Paul Sharpe wrote <b>Text::Structured</b>, a class for
  manipulating fixed-format pages of text.</p>

  <p><b>Devel::Modlist</b>, by Randy J. Ray, lists, after
  execution, the modules that a program used.</p>

  <p>Russ Allbery's <b>PGP::Sign</b> has been updated to support
  PGP 5.0 and GnuPG (a PGP replacement covered by the GNU GPL).
  PGP::Sign only creates and checks detached PGP signatures; it
  does not do general PGP work. Allbery also released
  <b>Tie::Shadowhash</b>, which creates a "shadow hash" that looks
  like a regular Perl hash, but behind the scenes queries a whole
  list of data sources.</p>

  <p><b>Yag</b> (Yet another <i>getopts</i>) from Bob Camp is
  another module for parsing command-line options. It's highly
  configurable, and available at <a href=
  "http://www.hadron.demon.co.uk" target=
  "resource window">http://www.hadron.demon.co.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Jeff Pinyan released <b>File::chmod</b>, allowing you to
  change file permissions with letters instead of numbers (e.g.,
  <tt>a+rwx</tt> instead of <tt>0777</tt>.)</p>

  <p>Michal Wallace's <b>GVM</b> (Generic Virtual Machine) lets
  programmers play with virtual machines. It's in the very early
  pre-beta maybe-you-can-play-with-it stage, at <a href=
  "http://www.sabren.com/code/gvm/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.sabren.com/code/gvm/</a>.</p>

  <p>Robert Inder announced <b>CAPE</b> (Clips And Perl with
  Extensions). Clips is a forward-chaining rule-based system which
  was originally developed by NASA. CAPE combines the full language
  environments of both Clips and Perl, including the ability to run
  programs or libraries written in either, or both, within a single
  application. See <a href="http://www.etl.go.jp/~inder/CAPE/"
  target="resource window">http://www.etl.go.jp/~inder/ CAPE/</a>
  for more information.</p>

  <p>Steffen Beyer has made some changes to <b>Data::Locations</b>,
  including a move to XS code. Data::Locations allows "magic
  insertion points" in data.</p>

  <p>Earl Hood's <b>Text::Bind</b> binds Perl structures (scalars,
  functions, filehandles, objects, and arrays) to specific
  locations (called "data sites") in text files.</p>

  <p><b>POP</b> (Perl Object Persistence) from Benjamin Holzman
  stores Perl objects in Sybase databases. Kim Ryan's
  <b>Lingua::EN::NameParse</b> attempts to break a person's name
  into meaningful parts (first name, middle name, last name,
  title).</p>

  <p>Dan Urist wrote <b>WWW::Babelfish</b>, an interface to
  AltaVista's Babelfish translation service at <a href=
  "http://babelfish.altavista.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://babelfish.altavista.com/</a> . Urist
  notes that it is more fun than useful. We believe him, and we
  like it for that reason. _ _END_ _</p>
