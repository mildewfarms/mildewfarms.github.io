  <p>In TPJ #13 ("Five Quick Hacks: Downloading Web Pages"), Jon
  Orwant and Dan Gruhl presented five simple but elegant programs
  that download information from various web services: stock
  quotes, weather predictions, currency information, U.S. postal
  address correction, and CNN headline news. If you're like me,
  your company uses a firewall to repel wily hackers, which means
  that we have to use a proxy server to access most URLs. A proxy
  server (sometimes called a "gateway") is simply an intermediary
  computer that sends your request to a server and returns its
  response to you. The bad news: If you try to use the LWP::Simple
  <tt>get()</tt> function without first letting it know about your
  proxy server, it returns nothing at all.</p>

  <p>The good news: There's a simple way around this. The
  LWP::Simple module checks an environment variable called
  <tt>http_proxy</tt>. If <tt>$ENV{http_proxy}</tt> contains the
  name of a computer, your calls to <tt>get()</tt> use it as a
  proxy server. You can set envrionment variables in two ways:
  either by assigning a value to <tt>$ENV{http_proxy}</tt>, or by
  using whatever mechanism your shell or operating system provides.
  For instance, you can define your proxy server under the Unix
  bash shell as follows:</p>
  <pre>
% export http_proxy=http://proxy.mycompany.com:1080
</pre>

  <p>This makes LWP::Simple route requests through port 1080 of the
  proxy server <tt>proxy.mycompany.com</tt>. You may need to use
  the <tt>set</tt> or <tt>setenv</tt> command, depending upon what
  shell you're using. There are also related environment variables
  for non-http services: <tt>ftp_proxy</tt>, <tt>gopher_proxy</tt>,
  and <tt>wais_proxy</tt>. There's also a <tt>no_proxy</tt>
  variable, but we'll talk about that in a bit. Since we are using
  Perl, There's More Than One Way To Do It. We can still access
  URLs via a proxy without mucking with environment variables if we
  replace LWP::Simple with LWP::UserAgent and HTTP:Request::Common.
  Let's look at a version of the currency converter (the first
  example from TPJ #13) that uses LWP::UserAgent:</p>

  <p>The line beginning <tt>$ua-&gt;proxy</tt> defines our proxy
  server. This routes the user agent's HTTP requests through
  proxy.mycompany.com. To use a proxy server for multiple
  protocols, specify them in a list as below:</p>
  <pre>
$ua-&gt;proxy(['http','ftp','wais'] =&gt;
            'http://proxy.mycompany.com:1080');
</pre>

  <p>The programs that download the weather report and the CNN top
  story (the second and third examples from TPJ #13) are equally
  simple to convert: replace LWP::Simple with LWP::UserAgent and
  HTTP:Request::Common, and the calls to <tt>get()</tt> with the
  user agent code as described above. The U.S. Postal Address
  program, <tt>zip4</tt>, already has the UserAgent code -- all we
  need to do is add the single line of code after the UserAgent has
  been created:</p>
  <pre>
$ua = new LWP::UserAgent();
$ua-&gt;proxy('http','http://proxy.mycompany.com:1080');
</pre>

  <p>Or, if you're into brevity, create the user agent and set its
  proxy server in one line:</p>
  <pre>
($ua=(new LWP::UserAgent))-&gt;proxy('http',
          'http://proxy.mycompany.com:1080');
</pre>

  <p>Most proxy servers will not let you access URLs within your
  own domain. That's why you often need to use your browser's
  Preferences menu to identify exceptions, telling your browser
  which domains to access without using the proxy. Fortunately, we
  can do that in our programs as well. If you prefer using
  environment variables:</p>
  <pre>
export no_proxy="mycompany.com"
</pre>

  <p>This will bypass the proxy server for URLs ending in
  "mycompany.com" (including URLs like www.itsmycompany.com). As
  you might expect, this can be done in the program instead:</p>
  <pre>
$ua-&gt;no_proxy('mycompany.com');
</pre>

  <p>If your program only needed to access web sites inside your
  firewall, you wouldn't need to declare the proxy server in the
  first place, so the <tt>no_proxy</tt> would be
  superfluous.<br></p>
