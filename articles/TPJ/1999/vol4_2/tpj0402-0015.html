  <h4>Dan Schmidt</h4>

  <p>I wish <i>Perl: The Programmer's Companion</i> had been around
  when I learned Perl. Chapman assumes that you are already a
  programmer, and he presents Perl as a language that helps you,
  the programmer, get things done. (The title confused me for
  months, because I thought it referred to the book, not the
  language.) The language is presented one feature at a time, but
  after reading five pages, one doesn't say "Now I know about
  hashes," but rather "Now I know how to solve more real-world
  problems."</p>

  <p>The order of presentation is interesting: for example, we're
  thirty pages into the book (during which time we've already seen
  some useful programs) before we're introduced to variables. But
  he's found an effective linear path through the maze of Perl; you
  don't get the feeling, as with some books, that you'll have to
  read a hundred more pages before you can actually <i>do</i>
  anything. Every chapter contains numerous useful well-commented
  programs that show how Perl is actually used to solve small but
  potentially annoying problems.</p>

  <p>The exposition is exceptionally clear. Chapman knows his
  audience, and writes directly for it. One problem that I have
  with O'Reilly's <i>Programming Perl</i> is that the authors often
  don't seem to be sure whether they are writing for novices or
  experts (the glossary is the worst offender in this regard). This
  book doesn't suffer from that problem at all. It is an
  introduction to the language, not a reference, so everyone who
  reads it will probably want to pick up <i>Programming Perl</i>
  eventually -- although this book and the Perl documentation will
  make a fine combination.</p>

  <p>I do have two quibbles, one minor and major. The minor one is
  that the <tt>use English</tt> statements everywhere are laudable,
  but have the drawback that readers may be confused by seeing
  <tt>$_</tt> everywhere in other people's code when they're used
  to <tt>$ARG</tt> in the book. More importantly, the discussion on
  references does not live up to the standards of clarity of the
  rest of the book; the author gets bogged down right at the start
  in details such as the way symbol tables work and the difference
  between lvalues and rvalues. The clear one-sentence explanation
  (you can use a reference wherever you'd normally use a name) is
  relegated to a footnote eleven pages into the chapter. Please,
  everyone, make the first couple of thousand words you read about
  references be the <tt>perlreftut</tt> documentation.</p>

  <p>Overall, though, this is the best introduction to Perl for
  programmers that I've seen. When someone at my workplace asks
  about Perl, this is the book I give them. I can't think of a
  higher recommendation than that. Rating: 5 out of 5.</p>

  <h3>Vicki Brown</h3>

  <p>If you know (or are!) an experienced programmer seeking to
  learn Perl, you may want to skip the other introductory books on
  the market and start with <i>Perl: The Programmer's
  Companion</i>. Nigel Chapman makes several assumptions about his
  audience, not the least of which is that the reader is already an
  experienced programmer, quite possibly in several other
  languages.</p>

  <p>Where other books assume a passing familiarity with C, this
  one goes farther, comparing Perl's language elements variously to
  C, C++, FORTRAN, Algol68, Pascal, Awk, and Snobol. Mr. Chapman
  does not spend much time explaining concepts. If you don't
  already know about variables, data types, arrays, exception
  handling, and other programming basics, this is not the book for
  you.</p>

  <p>Unlike many books on Perl, however, this one does not assume
  familiarity with Unix. In fact, the book was written on a
  Macintosh using OzTex (a Mac port of LaTeX) and the examples were
  tested with MacPerl. Perl elements and philosophies inherited
  from Unix are called out and explained, often with a wry comment
  or two.</p>

  <p>Aside from the obvious assumptions about audience, this is
  still an introductory book on Perl. It advances from background
  through variables, flow of control, lists and hashes, ultimately
  covering references, objects, modules, and Perl's use with the
  Web, but never going into deep detail on any one subject. This
  book won't tell you everything, but it will give you a solid
  grounding in Perl.</p>

  <p>The book makes good use of examples, as well as syntax
  diagrams, to avoid the need for extraneous explanation. Again, if
  you don't have some previous programming experience, or you
  aren't good at making deductions from examples, you may find this
  confusing. I found it refreshing.</p>

  <p>One final assumption Mr. Chapman makes is that his audience is
  composed of native English speakers, with a high level of
  literacy. The sentences are complex; the vocabulary is not always
  for the timid. I enjoyed this immensely but some readers may find
  it difficult going, especially in the more verbose sections.</p>

  <p>Tom Christiansen, in his Camel Critiques, awarded this book 5
  camels (one of few books so honored). This is not surprising, as
  Tom has a keen eye for craftsmanship. Jon Orwant hasn't told me
  what units I'm working with -- camels or jelly beans -- but I
  give this book 5 of them.</p>

  <p>Utility: High (for the right audience) Value: Excellent.</p>

  <h3>Joe Johnston</h3>

  <p>For Perlers who bristle at the all too frequent comment "Perl?
  CGI? Same thing," Nigel Chapman's <i>Perl: The Programmer's
  Companion</i> will be an absolute delight. Aimed not at the
  seemingly bottomless pit of "Idiot to Internet in 7 days"
  consumers, PPC instead appeals to the latent computer science
  major in all of us -- at times a bit too much. After reading
  O'Reilly's <i>Learning Perl</i>, <i>Programming Perl</i>, and
  <i>Perl Cookbook</i>, this book thoughtfully and playfully
  spotlights Perl's fundamentals in a fresh way, explaining
  concepts like regular expressions, built-in datatypes, and
  references more clearly for novices and journeymen alike. This
  book a must for everyone who uses Perl as a one-job tool and is
  ready to take their skills to the next level.</p>

  <p>Where a more traditional book might begin by listing Perl's
  supported data types, PPC opens with a simple introduction to
  regular expressions that eases the uninitiated programmer into
  the strange world of Perl syntax. Although certainly not as
  extensive as O'Reilly's <i>Mastering Regular Expressions</i>,
  Chapman introduces enough regex vocabulary so that the reader can
  tackle the <tt>perlre</tt> documentation more effectively.</p>

  <p>Chapman moves on to outline scalars and common operators. Ever
  wonder how Perl ended up with magic variables like <tt>$^W</tt>
  or <tt>$^I</tt> where most of the other bedweomered scalars are
  one character? See page 33. (Here's a hint: think control
  characters.)</p>

  <p>Before discussing hashes or subroutine argument passing,
  Chapman highlights his discussion of flow control mechanisms with
  a small "single pass recursive descent compiler," which suggests
  the potency of this language. It also demonstrates that his
  intended audience is expected to have danced with these problems
  before. This is just a warmup exercise to the topological sort
  outlined in the chapter on hashes. Later on, Chapman defines
  lvalues and rvalues, which help you understand references, and
  ultimately objects, better. If you have deep regrets about
  sleeping through your data structures and algorithms classes,
  Chapman serves up a penance that should clear your conscience (I
  still grin mischievously knowing that Perl gives me a dictionary
  type for free).</p>

  <p>As great, useful, and important as this book is, it is not
  faultless. Although chock-full of diagrams, not all of them make
  sense at first. Even when you fully grok them, you may not find
  that you spent your time wisely. One diagram that tweaks me is on
  page 150 (Figure 7.5), which describes an array reference.
  Although there is nothing semantically wrong with this graphic,
  it bothers me that it shows a <tt>$</tt> coming before a
  <tt>@</tt> in an effort to show a reference to an array. It
  bothers me that a Perl neophyte might mistake the diagram for
  legal syntax. Chapman also favors the <tt>use English</tt> module
  names for special variables. While Perl virgins won't be fazed by
  this, more experienced hackers might find code like <tt>open OUT,
  "Results" or die "couldn't open Results file ($OS_ERROR)</tt>
  (Page 118) distracting. Chapman's book ends with a fictional cafe
  dialog in which three programmers mix it up about Perl. Frankly,
  I think this scene was stolen from the IRC #perl channel.</p>

  <p>This is one Perl book that I go back to repeatedly. I have
  based Perl lectures on it and keep it at work for easy access.
  This book will put you on the road to Perl mastery. Rating: 4 out
  of 5. Utility: While it is no <i>Perl Cookbook</i> or
  <i>Effective Perl Programming,</i> PPC will solidify your
  comprehension of Perl fundamentals. Value: Absolutely worth the
  cover price for people who learned their Perl "on the
  street."</p>

  <h3>Mike Stok</h3>

  <p>The book is a slim volume whose modest cover suggests that
  it's not just another book on Perl. I enjoyed reading the book
  because it didn't preach. It presented one person's thoughts on
  how Perl idioms and features can help a programmer use the
  language effectively. It is not a comprehensive guide to Perl,
  but contains enough pointers to let a reader find one. If you
  read the introduction in a bookstore and like it, buy the book --
  it delivers on its promises.</p>

  <p>Nigel Chapman writes lucidly and gives the reader a clear idea
  of his intentions early in the book. He introduces the views of
  Perl as either a souped up Unix scripting language or a "real"
  programming language, and he chooses to treat is as the latter.
  This, along with the author's stated assumption that the reader
  already knows how to program, allows the book to illuminate
  Perl's features with non-trivial examples. I find these more
  convincing than lots of tiny code snippets.</p>

  <p>I was refreshed to find a book that contrasted Perl with other
  languages to show Perl's strengths and weaknesses. The ordering
  of the subjects is a natural way to introduce Perl to a
  programmer. I particularly liked Nigel Chapman's use of wry
  humor. Examples of both good and bad code, and "bad" code where
  Perl didn't behave as Chapman might have expected are
  illuminating. I find this much more edifying than good examples
  by themselves.</p>

  <p>The basics of Perl and a little history are covered quickly
  and accurately, without reproducing material from other tutorials
  or reference material. The main meat of the next chunk of the
  book covers data structures, object-oriented programming, and
  modules. Here, some of the idioms seem a little stilted, but the
  treatment has enough detail, illustrations, and comparisons for
  sufficient understanding.</p>

  <p>The examples include extending a distributed module and then
  using that extended module in a practical way. To me, that's
  worth much more than a dry exposition on how I ought to do
  it.</p>

  <p>There is a chapter on web programming that spends as much time
  putting programs in context as with examples. The final chapter
  wraps things up by giving the reader pointers to other
  information about Perl, and yet more context by mentioning its
  influences. <!-- end of file --></p>
