  <h2 align="center">The Fourth Annual Obfuscated Perl Contest</h2>

  <h4>Felix Gallo</h4><img src="images/thug.gif" border="0" align=

  <p>You were born into this. From the first day they swaddled you
  in scarlet silk blankets, put one of their own into the crib and
  stole you crying away into the black stillness of the forest, you
  have been in a school of previously unknown purpose.</p>

  <p>Your eyes, once childish and full of wonder, have matured all
  too quickly. They've roamed books not written to be read, murals
  not drawn to be viewed; they've watched macabre puppet theatres
  that portray the studied arts of deception.</p>

  <p>Your fingers, thick and clumsy compared to theirs, have been
  trained to work the skeins of falsehood and lies made fabric. In
  the glow of the phosphorescent toadstool circle the needles
  flicker and glitter like shooting stars.</p>

  <p>Poison has become your tongue. As their emissary you walk the
  daylight world, chatting and laughing in streetside cafes or
  talking to colleagues in your office; but inside the guileweave
  hides a venomous calculus. Every night you lay out the candles
  and the breadcrumbs and wait.</p>

  <p>Today the air is different. The sun still shines, but you feel
  the chill of invisible clouds passing over its face. And the
  smell is sharper, like the taste of the dark earth at the foot of
  a graveyard. Today you know your decades of secret schooling draw
  to a close, and as the power wells up inside you, you hope that
  you are ready.</p>

  <p>There are four circles of judgement in which you may prove
  your worth as a master of deception.</p>

  <p>The first circle is judged upon the ability to craft a lie
  which commands an infernal computing engine to print the words
  "The Perl Journal" in human-recognizable form. You may only use
  one thousand glyphs, including the invisible ones, or fewer in
  the completion of this screed.</p>

  <p>The second circle is judged upon the ability to forge a
  deviousness which commands an infernal computing engine to
  perform some task of extreme might and puissance. Your limit is
  six hundred glyphs, whether visible or no. The third circle is
  judged upon the ability to create a monstrosity which exhibits
  artistic cunning and creative guile in its dread formulation. The
  limit is one thousand glyphs, including those which cannot be
  discerned by the naked eye.</p>

  <p>The fourth circle is judged upon the ability to cause your
  fell creation to appear as a chameleon or doppelg&auml;nger does:
  as a deceptive imitation of another tongue. You must pick a
  different language and endeavor to make your handiwork fool the
  eye into believing that it was written in that language. For this
  purpose you may select up to two thousand visible or invisible
  sigils.</p>

  <p>The laws of the circles are few but severe.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>All dweomers must be penned in the language of the fifth
    camel.</li>

    <li>While you may use the hide, the hair, the nails, and the
    teeth of the pure camel, your spell may not be able to rely
    upon the existence of any other animal, neither ibex, vampire
    bat, rhinocerous nor warthog; nor the vile children of the
    palaces of Berkeley, Redmond, Finland or New Jersey.</li>

    <li>Your incantations will be pronounced within the confines of
    a memory cage capable of holding four million things; attempts
    to use more may succeed, or may shatter the cage and release
    your bound spirits into the air with the crashing of glass and
    the tinkling of tiny bells.</li>

    <li>Your writings belong to you; but you provide the judges and
    the Perl Journal with the right to duplicate, quote, edit for
    style, and disseminate them freely upon an unsuspecting
    world.</li>

    <li>Your works must be sent to the Stronghold by the first day
    of the eighth month. You must use the anonymous Foetid
    Transference Petals to connect to ftp.tpj.com and place your
    entry in /pub/orwant/obfuscated. The tar or zip archive must
    include:<br>
    &bull; The incantation.<br>
    &bull; A README file providing attribution (including e-mail
    addresses) and information about which circle of judgement the
    spell is for.<br>
    &bull; A SOLUTION file explaining the magics and powers you
    have woven into your script.<br>
    The archive must be named
    <tt>YOURNAME.CATEGORYNUMBER.SUBMISSIONNUMBER.tar</tt> or
    <tt>YOURNAME.CATEGORYNUMBER.SUBMISSIONNUMBER.zip</tt>. Entries
    not conforming to this rule may be given as a ritual plaything
    to the void faerie. Entries may not be submitted by any other
    method than that described above.</li>

    <li>The champions and their monstrosities will be announced in
    comp.lang.perl.moderated, in the magazine, and on tpj.com. By
    this iteration of the nightbird's cycle you may be familiar
    with the methods of judgement. But as there are newborns
    amongst us fresh from the amniotic dew, I relate them
    here.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>First, the committee examines the work. If we can determine
  its nature visually, then we disqualify it as being too
  human.</p>

  <p>Second, the committee hands the work to an infernal computing
  engine and examines the results.</p>

  <p>If after this act we still can't unravel the tortuous webs of
  your thinking, we examine the SOLUTION text you have helpfully
  provided.</p>

  <p>Most victors attain that rarefied third strata.</p>

  <p>In addition to the quality of being merely impossible to
  understand, much of the judgement relies on aesthetics,
  cleverness, newness, humor, and interest, especially manifold and
  in combination. As an example, many entries in the last circle
  relied on using a plethora of invisible glyphs -- which was
  mirthful, but too obvious. Obvious means failure.</p>

  <p>The void faerie hungers for new toys.</p>

  <p>Remember, you were born into this. In the underworld the
  leaves rustle as an unseen crowd gathers closer to the camel
  stone. Make your masters proud.</p>
