  <p><i>"Perl/Tk's thickest man page"</i></p>

  <p>Nancy Walsh's cumbersome man page <i>Learning Perl/Tk</i>
  brings order to an unruly niche in Perl pedagogy. For some time,
  Perl's Tk modules have been taught to the world by sporadic
  postings of pedantic newsgroup contributors who could interpret
  John Osterhout's treatise on Tcl/Tk through a Perlesque filter to
  less prescient hackers. Walsh's feature-by-feature translation of
  Tk's numerous options into the Perl syntax is a valuable
  contribution to the training archive. Its strongest technical
  point is the conscientious treatment of both WinNT/95 and Unix
  versions. All Perl modules should be so thoroughly
  investigated.</p>

  <p>Nick Ing-Simmon's accolades on the cover notwithstanding,
  Walsh has chosen her readership to be newbie technicians.
  Although her game plan is a rigorous adherence to the command
  set, her writing is so informal that it never really gets out of
  bed. Confusing the cardinal Perl virtue of laziness with
  sloppiness, she uses a vague-and-friendly hand-holding style, and
  consequently, she compromises brevity and clarity. On Perl's
  origin: "Originally, Perl was written as a 'quick fix' to a
  problem Larry Wall was having with his job." Did Larry Wall
  really have a problem with his job that could be solved better by
  writing a scripting language than by retaining an employment
  lawyer? That's only the first page. She and her editors challenge
  the literal-minded reader on every one of the remaining 339 text
  pages.</p>

  <p>By whittling her subject matter to its core command set, Walsh
  attaches the book directly to the Perl/Tk module itself. Her book
  will remain relevant as long as Tk is relevant in the Perl
  community. But how long will that be? She doesn't even begin to
  speculate. She omits historical and philosophical issues. Tk's
  author John Osterhout is never mentioned. Neither is the Tk
  module's contribution in the debate between Perl and Java.
  Partisan Perlism aside, Tk continues to be a big, slow-loading
  module that makes for an embarrassing pause at the beginning of
  every demo. (The <tt>basic_demo</tt> itself requires 10 seconds
  to load on my 90 MHz Pentium.) Is the static Perl/Tk executable
  any faster? Or a stripped down miniperl/Tk? Or is Tcl/Tk really
  the optimal way to use Tk? Walsh never comes close to these
  questions. Fortunately, there will always be newsgroups, and at
  least after Walsh, they won't be filled with quite so many novice
  questions.</p>

  <p>With the past, the present, and the future off her plate,
  Walsh concentrates on the meat: listboxes, canvas widgets,
  sliders versus scroll bars, dynamic font selection, and so on.
  Priced at $33, it may be above the pain-point for the average
  hobbyist. Stephen Lidie's 98-page <i>Perl/Tk Pocket Reference</i>
  (also an O'Reilly book) is just as encyclopedic and far less
  verbose at only $10. Still, Walsh's work is well within the
  expense report limit for professional users, where it will most
  likely find its home. But will the book satisfy a professional
  readership? Experts need hand holding, too. Value: 3 out of 5.
  Utility: 4 out of 5. Overall: 3 out of 5.</p>

  <h3>Chris Nandor</h3>

  <p>As someone who knows Perl pretty well by now, has some
  experience using the MacPerl Toolbox modules to create GUIs, and
  has never used used Tk before, I wanted to be first in line to
  check out the new offering from O'Reilly. The bottom line is that
  whereas before I knew almost nothing about Tk, I now know enough
  to put together a fairly complex Perl/Tk application thanks to
  this book.</p>

  <p>However, it could have been a better book, and I fear those
  not as knowledgeable about Perl as myself might have some
  trouble. The worst problem is the technical errors. They are not
  pervasive, but they are prevalent enough that I was no longer
  surprised by the end of the book when I saw them. Several times I
  saw the digraph operator (<tt>=&gt;</tt>) used in place of the
  arrow operator (<tt>-&gt;</tt>). One regex switches the starting
  anchor (<tt>^</tt>) with another character. The
  <tt>Mainloop()</tt> function is called <tt>Mainloop</tt> in the
  text. Occasionally something little, that beginners won't notice,
  crops up in the text, and as much as I liked much of the book,
  there's no way around it: This kind of thing is Bad.</p>

  <p>One unfortunate side effect of this is that when I saw
  something that I wasn't sure of -- such as a statement that a
  method returns an empty string in certain cases, when it seems to
  me that maybe it should return an empty list instead -- I don't
  know whether or not to trust the text.</p>

  <p>On the less technical side of things, some of the sections
  seemed to be unable to decide if they wanted a tutorial or a
  reference. This is a fine line many tutorials are forced to walk.
  But the reference text sometimes broke up the flow of the
  tutorial and made it more difficult to read, especially knowing
  that I could just be looking at online documentation instead. The
  book seems geared toward those who might not know Perl very well,
  which is probably a good design decision, but it made the reading
  drag in spots; I tried to compensate by skipping ahead a
  paragraph or two, which sometimes led me to miss something
  important. I probably just need to get better at skipping
  ahead.</p>

  <p>But despite all this, I think the book is a worthy candidate
  for someone needing to learn Perl/Tk, if they can tolerate a book
  that needs more editing. The book mostly flows well, the topics
  are introduced in a logical progression, and I seemed to learn
  what I needed to learn. Overall: 3 out of 5.</p>

  <p>Utility: Aside from the reference table in the back, I
  probably won't refer to it much, but it did serve its purpose
  well. Value: I'd prefer the book to be priced a bit lower. It's
  listed at only $7 less than <i>Perl Cookbook,</i> which is twice
  the size and at least twice as useful. As a consumer, I think a
  price of $25 to $28 would be more reasonable.</p>

  <h3>Ken Bandes</h3>

  <p>I was a very good test subject for <i>Learning Perl/Tk</i>;
  I'm a tolerable Perl programmer with no knowledge of Tk. Even
  better, I was, like most Windows programmers, largely unfamiliar
  with the whole notion of geometry managers and other X-ish
  idioms.</p>

  <p>This book can indeed teach such a person how to create a user
  interface with Perl/Tk, and is, as far as I know, the best way to
  learn this. The style is clear and readable, avoiding the twin
  hazards of being too dry and being too saucy, and most concepts
  are illustrated with concise, well-chosen examples. However, it
  is not without annoyances.</p>

  <p>First of all, I amassed a fair-sized list of errors that have
  not appeared in the errata. Many of these are typos where the
  original intent is easy to divine, but some are very confusing
  content errors. There is a recurring problem with references to
  subjects not yet covered -- we should at least learn where they
  will be discussed. In some cases, they're never discussed at
  all.</p>

  <p>But besides that, I wish the book had been organized
  differently. It attempts to be both a tutorial and a reference.
  Early chapters cover a series of widgets in great detail. I'd
  have preferred a tutorial that showed how to perform common tasks
  with them, without describing every option. The reference
  chapters could come later. As it is, I was often tempted to do a
  lot of skimming (and would have if I were not reviewing it),
  which is fine for a reference but not for a tutorial.</p>

  <p>Even so, the book has much to recommend. The discussion of
  geometry management was exceptionally well presented and, given
  the importance of the topic, very welcome and helpful. The book
  does an excellent job of navigating the cross-platform issues,
  something often omitted from Perl books. If you want to learn
  Perl/Tk, this is the place to go.</p>

  <h3>Kevin Lenzo</h3>

  <p>Perl/Tk is a great addition to the Perl modules list, and a
  rather involved one -- providing the full functionality of Tk
  with Perl bindings is no mean feat, and Nick Ing-Simmons and his
  helpers are to be lauded for their great work. Tk800.014.tar.gz
  weighs in at 3,206 KB on CPAN in compressed form, and is one of
  the more complex Perl modules in existence.</p>

  <p>That being said, let's turn to <i>Learning Perl/Tk</i> by
  Nancy Walsh. The author is faced with a formidable task -- make
  one of Perl's biggest and most complicated tools accessible to a
  reader who knows little about it, but may be versed in Perl. When
  I saw that this book was forthcoming, I had to sit on my hands in
  anticipation.</p>

  <p>The documentation bundled with Perl/Tk itself is useful if you
  already know Tk, or if you know what you're looking for. But it
  can be a twisty maze of method calls, all different, if you don't
  know where to start. The thought of a solid tutorial through the
  forbidding topics of Tk seemed quite attractive -- even given the
  widget demo, with its live code and examples, and the Perl/Tk
  documentation. When the book finally came, I was excited. The
  author has a clear voice and a gentle touch, and the first
  chapters were a good read. However, as I got into it farther, I
  started to get the feeling that this book didn't know what it
  wanted to be -- a tutorial or a reference. As a reference, it is
  not easy to get to where you want to be right away -- it's not a
  nutshell book, and it's not the <i>Perl/Tk Reference</i> (also
  from O'Reilly).</p>

  <p>This book does play better as a tutorial (thus the title
  "Learning Perl/Tk") but it could benefit from a more coherent set
  of examples. The examples given were helpful, and I did learn a
  good bit from them, but after I had finished the book and
  attempted a nontrivial programming task, I found there were basic
  holes in my knowledge -- partly because I failed to catch
  important points, and partly because some things were not covered
  (for instance, when and why do you use <tt>@</tt> at the
  beginning of a path?). I would like to have seen an application
  built throughout the entire book, where each chapter adds to the
  application, and as a coherent set of examples that could be
  viewed in context. Something like that would be nice, so you can
  see how each part fits into the whole large application, and
  fiddle with parts of a working app.</p>

  <p>In summary, I found this book to be good and useful. There was
  some clunkiness that goes along with being a first edition
  (several things are used before before they are explained, and
  there are some typos and layout blips). But all in all, this book
  was a much better introduction than struggling through the manual
  pages. I do recommend it, and I expect to see it polished over
  future editions. <!-- end of file --></p>
