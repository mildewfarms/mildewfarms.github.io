  <p>In my first semester of Spanish class in high school, I went
  to look up an unfamiliar word, "chaleco", in a Spanish-English
  dictionary. I looked under "C", and found that the dictionary
  went right from "cetro" to "c&iacute;a". Someone had expurgated
  all the "ch" words! I had a brief nightmarish vision of a world
  without chorizo, chimichangas, chicharrones, or churros. After
  some frantic page-turning, I discovered that the "ch" words were
  in a separate section, "Ch", between "C" and "D". I asked the
  teacher about this, and he explained that it was normal practice
  for Spanish alphabetical order to consider "Ch" a letter after
  "C". But it seemed ludicrous to me -- two letters that counted as
  one. <i>"How pointlessly complicated!"</i> I thought. <i>"Why not
  just keep it simple, A to Z, like normal? Like English."</i></p>

  <p>I later learned that <i>every</i> language has its own
  particular idea of what "alphabetical order" means; the fact that
  English's conception of it seems so "normal" is partly because
  English doesn't use any accents and partly because of accidents
  of history.</p>

  <p>But many other languages use accented characters that have to
  be sorted with the 26 letters of the "normal" A-through-Z
  alphabet. And with other languages, some combinations of
  characters like the "ch" in Spanish, count as letters on their
  own. But in almost every case, if you want to sort according to
  the conventions of a particular language, the default behavior of
  Perl's <tt>sort</tt> won't sort that way. This article is about
  how to get Perl to sort according to the conventions of whatever
  language you have in mind -- even if it's English!</p>

  <h3>Default sort Versus "Normal" English Sorting</h3>

  <p>Let's say you want to sort a list of words (or phrases) in
  what you think of as normal English alphabetical order. So you
  try using normal <tt>sort</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
@stuff = ("canine", "cantaloupe",
          "cant",                  # as in an underworld jargon
          "Canberra", "can't", 
          "Cantonese", "cannery",
          "Cannery Row", "canonicity",
          "Ca&ntilde;on de Chelly"  # In north-eastern Arizona,
          # also spelled "Canyon de Chelly" and
          # "Ca&ntilde;on de Chelle"
          );
&#13;@sorted = sort @stuff;              # the sorting happens here
&#13;print map "[$_] ", @sorted;
</pre>

  <p>That prints:</p>
  <pre>
[Canberra] [Cannery Row] [Cantonese] [Ca&ntilde;on de Chelly] 
[can't] [canine] [cannery] [canonicity] [cant] [cantaloupe]
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>Whoa. All the capitals are sorting first. That's because
  <tt>sort</tt>'s default behavior (what you get without a "sort
  criterion" or without <tt>use locale</tt>, both of which we'll
  discuss later) is ASCIIbetical sorting -- where the sorting is
  based on ASCII order. Since "C" comes before "c" in ASCII, all
  the "C" items in <tt>@stuff</tt> (like "Cantonese") get sorted
  before all the "c" items (like "cantaloupe").</p>

  <p>So you happen to remember an idiom for case-insensitive
  sorting, and you change the line that sets <tt>@sorted</tt>
  to:</p>
  <pre>
 @sorted = sort { lc($a) cmp lc($b) } @stuff;
</pre>

  <p>and then you rerun the code. It prints:</p>
  <pre>
&#13;[can't] [Canberra] [canine] [cannery] [Cannery Row]
[canonicity] [cant] [cantaloupe] [Cantonese] [Ca&ntilde;on de Chelly]
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>Closer. What you actually consider proper sorting looks like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
&#13;[Canberra] [canine] [cannery] [Cannery Row] [Ca&ntilde;on de Chelly] 
[canonicity] [cant] [can't] [cantaloupe] [Cantonese]
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>The phrases "can't" and "Ca&ntilde;on de Chelly" are out of
  place. "can't" is out of place because <tt>{ lc($a) cmp lc($b)
  }</tt> treats "can't" as a five character string that sorts
  before anything else in <tt>@stuff</tt>. Consider this code:</p>
  <pre>
print ( "can't" cmp "canal" );
</pre>

  <p>That prints <tt>-1</tt>, meaning that "can't" comes before
  "canal". This is because <tt>cmp</tt> is doing simple
  ASCIIbetical comparison, and when it compares "can't" to "canal"
  it gets as far as comparing "can'" to "cana". At that point it
  sees that the apostrophe character comes before a, because the
  apostrophe is ASCII 39, and "a" is ASCII 97.</p>

  <p>Now, this is also why "Ca&ntilde;on de Chelly" is coming last:
  because "&ntilde;" is a character after "n". For sake of
  argument, I'll assume that you are, like me, using Latin-1 as
  opposed to UTF8, so I can say that "&ntilde;" is a single byte:
  byte 241, in particular. (If you're using MacPerl and therefore
  probably using MacASCII, it's a different code, but it's still
  one byte with a value over 127, so my point stands. If you don't
  know what encoding you're using, you're probably using
  Latin-1.)</p>

  <p>So what you want is to sort this list according to your idea
  of English alphabetical order -- ignoring apostrophes, treating
  "&ntilde;" and "n" as the same letter, and of course ignoring
  case.</p>

  <p>What you need is a subroutine we can call like this:</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = sort { normalize($a) cmp normalize($b) } @stuff;
</pre>

  <p>where your <tt>normalize()</tt> subroutine <tt>lc</tt>s
  things, turns "&ntilde;"s to "n"s, and removes apostrophes (in no
  particular order). That function could consist of:</p>
  <pre>
sub normalize {
    my $in = $_[0];
    $in =~ tr/&Ntilde;&ntilde;/Nn/;
    $in =~ tr/'//d; # d for delete
    return lc($in);
}
</pre>

  <p>Paste that into our original code, and run it, and it'll
  display this (lined up vertically just for better perusal):</p>
  <pre>
    [Canberra]
    [canine] 
    [cannery] 
    [Cannery Row] 
    [Ca&ntilde;on de Chelly] 
    [canonicity] 
    [can't] 
    [cant] 
    [cantaloupe] 
    [Cantonese] 
</pre>

  <p>And that's basically right. Now, the only peculiarity there is
  "cant" versus "can't". It so happens that when you feed both into
  your <tt>normalize()</tt> subroutine, you get "cant". So when
  your sort criterion compares them using <tt>{ normalize($a) cmp
  normalize($b) }</tt>, it's performing <tt>"cant" cmp "cant"</tt>,
  which returns 0, meaning that these two sort identically. But
  since your use of <tt>sort</tt> produces a list were "can't"
  either comes before or after "cant", having your sort criterion
  return a <tt>0</tt> means that you <i>don't care</i> which of the
  two items comes first in the output, which effectively means that
  you can't predict which will end up first. Personally, I don't
  want my sort criterion to ever be unpredictable, so I add
  something that kicks in to avoid returning 0 when comparing
  different strings:</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = sort { normalize($a) cmp normalize($b)
                 or $a cmp $b
               } @stuff;
</pre>

  <p>In other words, when <tt>normalize($a) cmp normalize($b)</tt>
  evaluates to 0, the routine falls through to returning the value
  of <tt>$a cmp $b</tt>. That makes this a completely predictable
  sort criterion, since <tt>$a cmp $b</tt> never returns 0 for
  different strings.</p>

  <p>However, if you wanted something smarter than just <tt>$a cmp
  $b</tt>, you could use some second subroutine,
  <tt>normalize2()</tt>, that could be a bit more fine-grained than
  <tt>normalize()</tt>. Maybe it would implement the idea that, in
  case of a tie in <tt>normalize()</tt>, words with apostrophes
  (like "can't") should always come after words without them (like
  "cant"), or that "Chile" (the country) should always be always
  after "chile" (the hot sauce), and so on. You'd call that second
  part of your sort criterion as:</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = sort { normalize($a) cmp normalize($b)
                 or normalize2($a) cmp normalize2($b)
               } @stuff;
</pre>

  <p>To be really thorough, you could add in a <tt>cmp</tt> at the
  end:</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = sort { normalize($a) cmp normalize($b)
                 or normalize2($a) cmp normalize2($b)
                 or $a cmp $b
                } @stuff;
</pre>

  <p>Incidentally, falling back on a second comparison as a sort of
  "tie-breaker" in a sort criterion is basically what people mean
  when they refer to "bi-level sorting". We'll return to this idea
  later.</p>

  <h3>Locale-based Sorting</h3>

  <p>The idea of being able to sort things according to the
  conventions of other languages is not a new one. The
  <i>perllocale</i> documentation bundled with Perl describes how
  to take advantage of locales built into many OSes. Ideally, you'd
  set the locale to the language that sorts the way you want to
  sort, and then your calls to <tt>sort</tt> or <tt>cmp</tt> do the
  right thing. So if I set my locale to <tt>fr_CA.ISO8859-1</tt>
  (meaning "French Canadian, using Latin-1"), "&eacute;tude" will
  sort (correctly) with the "e"'s, instead of after the "z"'s,
  which is how it'd be sorted ASCIIbetically.</p>

  <p>But locales might not be available on all computers. As
  <i>perllocale</i> points out: "The available locales, the
  location in which they are kept, and the manner in which they are
  installed, vary from system to system. Some systems provide only
  a few, hard-wired, locales, and do not allow more to be added;
  others allow you to add 'canned' locales provided by the system
  supplier; still others allow you or the system administrator to
  define and add arbitrary locales."</p>

  <p>In other words, if you want to sort a list of French words
  according to French sorting conventions, even if you can get a
  French locale to work on one system, and even if that locale's
  idea of French sort order is the same as <i>your</i> idea of
  French sort order, there's still no guarantee that your
  locale-based sorting will be able to use the same locale on
  someone else's system. Because of these basic problems with
  locales, I consider locale-based sorting (even where available)
  to be fine for one-shot programs, but these portability problems
  make it unacceptable for use in code that I'd actually want to
  distribute.</p>

  <p>So, in short, much of the code in this article basically
  duplicates the functionality of some of the sorting you
  <i>might</i> be able to get from locales, but in a more portable
  and flexible way.</p>

  <h3>Spanish: Cana y Ca&ntilde;a</h3>

  <p>Earlier, we saw how to treat "&ntilde;" as just an alternate
  form for "n", which is appropriate for English. But suppose you
  actually wanted to sort a list of Spanish words according to
  Spanish sorting conventions. In that case, you want to treat
  "&ntilde;" not as an alternate form for "n", but instead as a
  letter between "n" and "o". In that case, you'd develop a sort
  criterion, as above, based on a normalize() subroutine, wherein
  you'd have to move the letters of the alphabet around like
  so:</p>
  <pre>
tr&lt;abcdefghijklmn&ntilde;opqrstuvwxyz&gt;  # map from this ...
  &lt;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz[&gt;; #    ...to this
</pre>

  <p>In other words, you want to keep "a" thru "n" as they are, and
  then have "&ntilde;" -- and this means bumping "o" thru "z" down
  by one character code to make way for the "&ntilde;". That "[" is
  there just because it's the character after "z" in ASCII.</p>

  <p>That's one way to do it. However, I find it a bit confusing,
  since that way makes the Spanish alphabet look like a strange
  decoder-ring substitution cypher. What I prefer is this:</p>
  <pre>
tr&lt;abcdefghijklmn&ntilde;opqrstuvwxyz&gt;
  &lt;\x01-\x1B&gt;; 
  # 1B is hex for decimal 27, for the 27 letters
</pre>

  <p>If I add or remove characters from the alphabet on that first
  line, all I have to remember to do is change the <tt>1B</tt>
  there to reflect however many characters are in the alphabet of
  characters that I'm starting with. (Since I'm just going to end
  up feeding the output of this <tt>normalize</tt> subroutine to
  <tt>cmp</tt>, it doesn't matter whether I'm mapping the alphabet
  to the range <tt>a-[</tt> or to the range
  <tt>\x01-\x1B</tt>.)</p>

  <p>Here's how you'd work this into your <tt>normalize</tt>
  subroutine:</p>
  <pre>
sub normalize {
   my $in = $_[0];
   $in = lc($in);
   $in =~ tr/&Ntilde;/&ntilde;/; # lc probably didn't catch this
   $in =~ tr&lt;abcdefghijklmn&ntilde;opqrstuvwxyz&gt;
   &lt;\x01-\x1B&gt;; # 1B = 27
   return $in;
}
</pre>

  <p>Then you can test it with this:</p>
  <pre>
[...the code for normalize(), above...]
&#13;@stuff = ("cana", "Cantata", "ca&ntilde;a", "cantina", 
                 "canoso", "ca&ntilde;onero", "capa");
@sorted = sort { normalize($a) cmp normalize($b)
                 or $a cmp $b
} @stuff;
print map "[$_] ", @sorted;
</pre>

  <p>When run, this program returns:</p>
  <pre>
[cana] [canoso] [Cantata] [cantina] [ca&ntilde;a] 
[ca&ntilde;onero] [capa]
</pre>

  <p>...which is right! But change <tt>@stuff</tt> to these:</p>
  <pre>
@stuff = ("cana", "ca&ntilde;a", "c&aacute;nula", "cantina", 
          "cant&oacute;", "canto", "cantor");
</pre>

  <p>and you (re)discover a problem:</p>
  <pre>
[cana] [cantina] [canto] [cantor] [cant&oacute;] [ca&ntilde;a] [c&aacute;nula]
</pre>

  <p>And that's quite wrong. Spanish, you see, uses acute accents
  (like over the "o" in "cant&oacute;") -- but "&oacute;" isn't
  considered a separate letter from "o". This is the same problem
  you faced in the English data set from the start of the article,
  except that here it's not "n" and "&ntilde;" we want to treat as
  alternates, but "o" and "&oacute;" -- and, while we're at it,
  "&aacute;/a", "&eacute;/e", "&iacute;/i", "&uacute;/u", and the
  somewhat rare "&uuml;". So you change the <tt>normalize</tt>
  subroutine:</p>
  <pre>
sub normalize {
  my $in = $_[0]; 
  
  $in = lc($in);
  # lc probably didn't catch this
  $in =~ tr/&Ntilde;/&ntilde;/; 
  # lc probably failed to turn &Eacute; to &eacute;, etc 
  $in =~ tr&lt;&aacute;&eacute;&iacute;&oacute;&uacute;&uuml;&Aacute;&Eacute;&Iacute;&Oacute;&Uacute;&Uuml;&gt;  
              &lt;aeiouuaeiouu&gt;;
&#13;  $in =~ tr&lt;abcdefghijklmn&ntilde;opqrstuvwxyz&gt;
              &lt;\x01-\x1B&gt;; # 1B = 27
&#13;  return $in;
}
</pre>

  <p>Run this code, and you get:</p>
  <pre>
[cana] [cantina] [canto] [cant&oacute;] [cantor] [c&aacute;nula] [ca&ntilde;a]
</pre>

  <p>Which (ta-daa!) is The Right Thing.</p>

  <h3>Spanish: Chorizo, Chimichangas, Chicharrones y Churros</h3>

  <p>So you've now got a sort criterion and an associated
  subroutine (<tt>normalize</tt>) that together implement Spanish
  sorting conventions as far as treatment of &ntilde;, &Ntilde;,
  and the accented vowels. But recall from the start of this
  article that Spanish has a letter "ch" between "c" and "d".</p>

  <p>So far we've been massaging all the data using
  character-to-character substitution (using the <tt>tr</tt>
  operator), so that <tt>cmp</tt>'s ASCIIbetical
  character-by-character comparison would do what we want. However,
  that all assumes that sorting is about <i>single</i> characters.
  But since "ch" consists of two ASCII characters, it won't fit
  well into our plan of using normal <tt>cmp</tt>. And "ch" is not
  alone: Spanish has one other two-character letter, the double-ell
  "ll", as in "llama", "quesadilla", and so on. Now, you could
  break down and write a subroutine that basically does the same
  work as Perl's builtin <tt>cmp</tt>, but considers
  character-clusters like "ch" that you want to treat as single
  elements. However, that would be <i>very</i> inefficient compared
  to the speed of Perl's builtin <tt>cmp</tt>. A more efficient way
  of doing it consists of simply turning the clusters into single
  characters, so that <tt>cmp</tt> can be made to work right on
  them. So if you simply turn all occurrences of "ch" to, say,
  "&cent;" (which is presumably not to be found in any of the items
  we're sorting), you can pretend that "chimichanga" is really
  "&cent;imi&cent;anga" -- then you can treat "&cent;" as just
  another strange letter, like "&ntilde;" is. Similarly you could
  turn "ll" to "&pound;", say.</p>

  <p>This would look like:</p>
  <pre>
sub normalize {
  my $in = $_[0];
  $in = lc($in);
  $in =~ s/ch/&cent;/g;   # chimichanga =&gt; &cent;imi&cent;anga
  $in =~ s/ll/&pound;/g;   # llama =&gt; &pound;ama
  $in =~ tr/&Ntilde;/&ntilde;/;
  $in =~ tr&lt;&aacute;&eacute;&iacute;&oacute;&uacute;&uuml;&Aacute;&Eacute;&Iacute;&Oacute;&Uacute;&Uuml;&gt;
               &lt;aeiouuaeiouu&gt;;
&#13;  $in =~ tr&lt;abc&cent;defghijkl&pound;mn&ntilde;opqrstuvwxyz&gt;
               &lt;\x01-\x1D&gt;;
&#13;  # 1D = 29, for the 29 letters we now have
  
  return $in;
}
</pre>

  <p>And then you can test it with:</p>
  <pre>
[...the code for normalize() above...]
&#13;@stuff = ("enchufe", "Enciclopedia de M&eacute;xico", "endibia",
          "enchilada",  "encogido", "encanto");
@sorted = sort { normalize($a) cmp normalize($b)
          or $a cmp $b
          } @stuff;
print map "[$_] ", @sorted;
</pre>

  <p>The output, which is correct:</p>
  <pre>
[encanto] [Enciclopedia de M&eacute;xico] [encogido] 
[enchilada] [enchufe] [endibia]
</pre>

  <p>Your <tt>normalize()</tt> subroutine now correctly implements
  Spanish-style sorting.</p>

  <h3>Bi-Level Sorting to the Rescue</h3>

  <p>There is a problem with our approach so far -- and it might
  not even be a real problem for you, depending on why you're
  sorting your data. Earlier, I talked about what happens when a
  sorting subroutine returns the same value for a pair of items,
  like "cant" and "can't" for an English <tt>normalize()</tt>, or
  "canto" and "cant&oacute;" for a Spanish <tt>normalize()</tt>, or
  "Chile" and "chile" with either. So far we've been sort of
  cheating, with criteria like these:</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = sort { normalize($a) cmp normalize($b)
          or $a cmp $b
          } @stuff;
</pre>

  <p>This worked because the last expression, <tt>$a cmp $b</tt>,
  just happens to have correctly resolved ties that arise with
  <tt>normalize($a) cmp normalize($b)</tt>. That was just dumb
  luck. And if, like many dictionaries, you want "Chile" to come
  after "chile", then plain old <tt>cmp</tt> as a tiebreaker does
  the wrong thing. So we need bi-level sorting with a
  <tt>normalize2()</tt> function as a better tiebreaker:</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = sort { normalize($a) cmp normalize($b)
          or normalize2($a) cmp normalize2($b)
          or $a cmp $b 
          } @stuff;
</pre>

  <p>So let's implement a <tt>normalize2()</tt> subroutine that
  correctly breaks <tt>normalize()</tt> ties. Let's continue with
  Spanish, and let's suppose that given a tie between variants of
  the letter "e", the order they should come out in is:</p>
  <pre>
e E &eacute; &Eacute;
</pre>

  <p>Now, you could use the same sort of code as in
  <tt>normalize()</tt>, this time implementing an alphabet
  consisting of</p>
  <pre>
a A &aacute; &Aacute; b B c C ch Ch CH d D e E &eacute; &Eacute; ...
</pre>

  <p>However, consider that <tt>normalize2()</tt> is <i>just</i> a
  tie-breaker -- it doesn't need to distinguish "a" from "b" --
  it'd never be called in a case where an "a" in one position would
  need to be compared to a "b" in another, since that would
  <i>not</i> have resulted in a tie between normalized strings. In
  other words, all <tt>normalize2()</tt> needs to do is distinguish
  letters that <tt>normalize()</tt> obliterated the difference
  between -- letters in the same "family". In other words (grouping
  these letters into families) you need only map from these:</p>
  <pre>
a A &aacute; &Aacute;    b B    c C    ch Ch CH    d D    e E &eacute; &Eacute;  ...
</pre>

  <p>Onto these:</p>
  <pre>
1 2 3 4    1 2    1 2    1  2  3     1 2    1 2 3 4  ...
</pre>

  <p>And you can implement that this way:</p>
  <pre>
sub normalize2 {
  my $in = $_[0];
&#13;  # digraph things...
  $in =~ s/ch/&cent;/g;   # chimichanga =&gt; &cent;imi&cent;anga
  $in =~ s/Ch/*/g;   # Chimichanga =&gt; *imi&cent;anga
  $in =~ s/CH/*/g;   # CHIMICHANGA =&gt; *IMI*ANGA
  $in =~ s/ll/&pound;/g;   # llama =&gt; &pound;ama
  $in =~ s/Ll/&sect;/g;   # Llama =&gt; &sect;ama
  $in =~ s/LL/&para;/g;   # LLAMA =&gt; &para;AMA
&#13;  # now the big whammy...
  $in =~tr&lt;aAbBcC&cent;**dDeE&eacute;&Eacute;fFgGhHiI&iacute;&Iacute;jJkK
              lL&pound;&sect;&para;mMnNoO&oacute;&Oacute;pPqQrRsStTuU&uacute;&Uacute;&uuml;&Uuml;vVwWxXyYzZ&gt;
              &lt;121212123121234121212123412121
              21231212123412121212121234561212121212&gt;;
&#13;  return $in;
}
</pre>

  <p>To get a better feeling for the output of this function,
  consider:</p>
  <pre>
normalize2("chile")             is "1111" 
normalize2("Chile")             is "2111"
&#13;normalize2("CHILES RELLENOS!")  is "32222 2232222!"
&#13;normalize2("cant&oacute;")      is "11113"
normalize2("Canto")             is "21111"
normalize2("CANT&Oacute;")      is "22224"
</pre>

  <p>So consider what happens when sorting "chile" and "Chile"; the
  sort criterion considers the expression</p>
  <pre>
normalize("chile") cmp normalize("Chile")
or normalize2("chile") cmp normalize2("Chile")
or "chile" cmp "Chile"
</pre>

  <p>This simplifies to:</p>
  <pre>
"chile" cmp "chile"     # first subexpression
or "1111" cmp "2111"    # second subexpression
or "chile" cmp "Chile"  # last subexpression
</pre>

  <p>The first <tt>cmp</tt> subexpression evaluates to 0, falling
  through to the expression consisting of the two values from
  <tt>normalize2</tt>. Between them, "1111" (from "chile") comes
  first ASCIIbetically, so <tt>"1111" cmp "2111"</tt> returns
  &shy;1, to signal that "chile" should come before "Chile". (Perl
  never gets as far as evaluating the last subexpression,
  <tt>"chile" cmp "Chile"</tt>.)</p>

  <h3>English: R&eacute;sum&eacute; and Resume</h3>

  <p>Now, this whole business of bi-level sorting may all seem very
  abstract and, well, foreign, if the only thing you've ever sorted
  is English. But consider if you're sorting this list of
  <i>English</i> words:</p>
  <pre>
rot    r&eacute;sum&eacute;    resume    rabble    return
</pre>

  <p>and you want it to sort correctly:</p>
  <pre>
rabble    resume    r&eacute;sum&eacute;    return    rot
</pre>

  <p>In other words, you want "resume" to always sort before
  "r&eacute;sum&eacute;". If you use a one-level sort like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = sort { normalize($a) cmp normalize($b)
          } @stuff;
</pre>

  <p>You have a choice. Either treat "e" and "&eacute;" as the same
  letter (as with "&ntilde;" and "n" in our Canberra/canine/cannery
  example), or treat "&eacute;" as a letter after "e". If you treat
  "e" and "&eacute;" as the same letter, then the ordering of
  "resume" and "r&eacute;sum&eacute;" would be unpredictable, since
  your <tt>normalize()</tt> will return the same value for
  both.</p>

  <p>But if you treat "&eacute;" as a letter after "e" (and that
  seems to be many people's first guess at a solution, I've found),
  that means that "&eacute;" will be a letter between "e" and "f",
  and all the "r&eacute;-" words will come after all the "re-"
  words -- so that your list will sort as:</p>
  <pre>
rabble    resume    return    r&eacute;sum&eacute;    rot
</pre>

  <p>That's wrong. So if you want this to sort right, you need at
  least two levels in your sorting. And since I've yet to see a
  case where <i>more</i> than two levels of sorting were needed,
  that pretty much leaves you with bi-level sorting.</p>

  <p>So, like it or not, the only way to get really correct sorting
  in English is to use bi-level sorting. And this is not just a
  problem with English having foreign words like
  "r&eacute;sum&eacute;" -- the same problem arises with wanting to
  sort "Bath" and "bath", say.</p>

  <h3>Optimizing with Memoization</h3>

  <p>As Perl evaluates a sort criterion while sorting a list, it
  will ask that criterion to compare several of the items against
  each other. To see it at work, you can run:</p>
  <pre>
@stuff = sort { print "$a &amp; $b ; "; $a cmp $b } qw(A B C D E F);
</pre>

  <p>and you'll see something along the lines of:</p>
  <pre>
A &amp; D ; B &amp; D ; C &amp; D ; D &amp; F ; D &amp; E ; E &amp; F ; A &amp; B ; B &amp; C ;
</pre>

  <p>If your criterion, like most of the ones in this article, will
  have to call <tt>normalize()</tt> (and maybe
  <tt>normalize2()</tt>) for whatever items they're asked to
  compare, then you can see that you're going to be calling
  <tt>normalize("D")</tt> several times. There's no point in
  <i>re</i>-computing it, since <tt>normalize("D")</tt> always
  gives the same answer, so all the calls after the first is just
  wasted effort. To make your sort criterion more efficient, you
  can cache the results of the function calls. Caching the results
  of a function like this is commonly called "memoization". In
  other words, instead of evaluating the expression
  <tt>normalize($a)</tt>, you look to see if you computed it
  earlier and saved the result. otherwise, you compute the value
  and stow it in the cache for next time. So wherever you have:</p>
  <pre>
function($INPUT)
</pre>

  <p>you would use</p>
  <pre>
exists($cache{$INPUT}) ? $cache{$INPUT}
                            : ($cache{$INPUT} = 
            function($INPUT))
</pre>

  <p>Worked into our bi-level sort criterion, this would look
  like:</p>
  <pre>
{
  my(%cache, %cache2);
  @sorted = sort {
     ( exists($cache{$a}) ? $cache{$a}
         : ($cache{$a} = normalize($a)) )
  cmp
     ( exists($cache{$b}) ? $cache{$b}
         : ($cache{$b} = normalize($b)) )
  or
     ( exists($cache2{$a}) ? $cache2{$a}
         : ($cache2{$a} = normalize2($a)) )
  cmp
     ( exists($cache2{$b}) ? $cache2{$b}
         : ($cache2{$b} = normalize2($b)) )
  or
  $a cmp $b
     } @stuff;
}
</pre>

  <p>It's not pretty, but it does avoid having to needlessly
  recompute <tt>normalize(ITEM)</tt> several times for each item
  being sorted. And the only thing better than correct sorting is
  <i>faster</i> correct sorting.</p>

  <p>(Note: I've presented memoization only in the context of
  sorting. For more general applications, see Mark-Jason Dominus's
  article on the topic in TPJ #13, or the Memoize module in
  CPAN.)</p>

  <h3>Sorting it All Out</h3>

  <p>Now, I've heard that in the years since I took my last Spanish
  class, the Spanish Academy has decided to stop giving "ch"
  special treatment, so that "churro" will be, they decree, under
  "C", somewhere between "cesto" and "cicatriz". However, I don't
  know to what degree this has been accepted by the average Spanish
  speaker, much less the people who make the phone books and
  dictionaries in all the Spanish-speaking countries.</p>

  <p>But even if everyone's idea of Spanish sorting conventions
  suddenly gets simpler (by doing away with those "ch" and "ll"
  digraphs), it'll still need bi-level sorting, just like
  English.</p>

  <p>In fact, because implementing the bi-level sorting presented
  in this article is so common, I've written a module that does it
  for you. <a href="tpj0402-0030.html">Sort::ArbBiLex</a> (for
  "arbitrary bi-level lexicographic" sorting) allows you to specify
  a sort order (possibly including multi-character letters like
  Spanish "ch") for which it will build a subroutine that sorts
  that way. The internals of Sort::ArbBiLex (available in CPAN) are
  frightening, but they're just an elaborate version of the
  techniques discussed in this article, adapted to the kinds of
  sorting found in most languages.</p>
