  <h4>Nathan Torkington</h4>

  <p>Some programming languages give you a single TRUE and a single
  FALSE. Others make you represent each with integers (typically 1
  and 0). But not Perl. Truth plays a larger role in Perl than most
  other languages, and its subtleties often confuse beginners. In
  Perl, truthfulness is determined from a few simple rules. To
  understand one of those rules, though, we need to first learn
  about good programming practice, warnings, laziness, and
  <tt>undef</tt>. Then we can learn the true nature of truth and
  see how to apply it in our own programs.</p>

  <h3><tt>undef</tt></h3>

  <p>Perl was designed for system administrators who want to
  automate the automatable tasks of their jobs. Such people
  typically produce small programs, and don't need to worry about
  formally verifiable correctness, corporate coding standards, and
  other such things. They just want to get the job done. For this
  reason, Perl's default behavior allows the programmer to be lazy
  and leave off parentheses around function arguments, to use
  subroutines before they're defined, and to use variables without
  initializations or even definitions. However, these very same
  practices that enable small programs to be written quickly can
  bog down larger programs by permitting subtle errors. By assuming
  that the programmer is all-knowing and perfect, Perl fails to
  notice things that smart and lazy programmers do deliberately but
  are mistakes for the rest of us. That's what Perl's <tt>-w</tt>
  flag is for. The <tt>-w</tt> flag turns on warnings for ambiguous
  or possibly erroneous practices. One of the things it catches is
  the use of a variable before it has a value. Here's the simplest
  possible demonstration of that:</p>
  <pre>
 
#!/usr/bin/perl -w  
print $x;
</pre>

  <p>This actually generates two warnings: <tt>main::x</tt> only
  used once and <tt>use of uninitialized value</tt> The first
  warning comes after Perl has finished compiling our program and
  realizes "hey, I only saw that variable once. That's probably a
  mistake." The second warning comes at runtime, when we attempt to
  print out <tt>$x</tt> without having given it a value. In cases
  like these, <tt>$x</tt> contains "the undefined value" or "the
  uninitialized value" and is written as <tt>undef</tt> This value
  is completely separate from any other Perl value: it isn't the
  empty string, nor is it zero. It's almost like <tt>NULL</tt> in
  C. <tt>undef</tt> is a special value used whenever a variable
  hasn't yet been assigned a value. We can test for <tt>undef</tt>
  with the <tt>defined</tt> function:</p>
  <pre>
if (defined $x) {
    print "x has value $x\n";
} else {
    print "x is undefined\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>Any attempt to use <tt>$x</tt> as though it were a real value
  (by treating it like a string or a number, for instance)
  generates a warning at runtime if you're using <tt>-w</tt>. This
  means we can't use <tt>==</tt> or <tt>eq</tt> with <tt>$x</tt>
  since those are number and string comparison operators and we'll
  get a warning for trying to use <tt>undef</tt> as a number or
  string. If we <i>do</i> try, Perl will emit its warning if we
  used <tt>-w</tt> but keep on going whether or not we used
  <tt>-w</tt> This is how the lazy programmers were able to leave
  warnings off and have their code still work: Perl treats
  <tt>undef</tt> as either zero or the empty string. That's why we
  don't see anything when we try to print an undefined variable.
  Similarly:</p>
  <pre>
  
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
$y = $x + 3;       # $y = 3, warning emitted
$y = length $x;    # $y = 0, warning emitted
</pre>

  <p>We can return a scalar variable to its initial pristine
  undefined state by using <tt>undef</tt> as either a function or a
  value:</p>
  <pre>
undef $x;
$x = undef;
</pre>

  <p><tt>defined</tt> and <tt>undef</tt> are good for testing and
  setting scalars. Don't try them with arrays, though. Presently,
  <tt>defined(@array)</tt> returns true if Perl has allocated
  storage for array something that is weird and not useful to the
  average programmer. To return an array to its initial state, we
  say:</p>
  <pre>
 
@array = ();        # good
</pre>

  <p>To say <tt>@array = undef</tt> is to make <tt>@array</tt>
  contain a one-element list, with the single element being the
  scalar value <tt>undef</tt>. This is hardly ever what we
  want.</p>

  <h3>Back to truth</h3>

  <p>So how does this fit into truth in Perl? Perl has some simple
  rules for determining whether something is true or false. One of
  those rules involves <tt>undef</tt>. Here are the rules:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>true/false are scalar concepts</li>

    <li><tt>undef</tt> is false</li>

    <li>"" is false</li>

    <li>0 is false</li>

    <li>0.0 is false</li>

    <li><tt>"0"</tt> is false</li>

    <li>all else is true</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Rule 1 is important: only scalars can be tested for true and
  false. We'll see why this is important after examining the rest
  of the rules. Rule 2 says that any uninitialized value is false.
  Because <tt>undef</tt> behaves as 0 and "", it's easy to see why
  rules 3 and 4 are there. Rule 5 is a weird one: internally, Perl
  can store numbers either as integers or as floating point numbers
  (that is, numbers with a decimal point), and converts between the
  two as needed. Because 0 (an integer) is false, it would be
  inconsistent to have the floating point version of 0 (0.0) be
  anything other than false. Rule 6 is similar to Rule 5: because
  Perl converts between strings and numbers on demand, the string
  <tt>"0"</tt> must be false as well. Not <tt>"0.0"</tt>, though,
  nor <tt>"0.00"</tt>.</p>

  <p>Rule 7 simply says that if it's not one of those five false
  values, it's true. This means that references are true, positive
  numbers are true, negative numbers are true (this surprised one
  of my students, and immediately identified the bug he'd been
  working for hours to fix), and every string is true with the
  exception of the empty string and <tt>"0"</tt>. Truth in Perl is
  really used to test for <i>interesting</i> values: if we've got a
  variable <tt>$name</tt> that might hold someone's name, it'll
  either be true (if we have a valid name) or it'll be false (if
  it's undefined, an empty string, or a form of 0). Either way,
  true means we want to work on it and false means we don't:</p>
  <pre>
if ($name) {
   print "Hello, $name!\n";
} else {
print "You didn't enter your name. 
       What do you have to hide?\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>Similarly, if we've asked for someone's age:</p>
  <pre>
if ($age) {
   $average = $total / $age;
} else {
   print "You didn't give me an age value.\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>The 0 age is almost always wrong. For cases when we do want to
  permit an age of 0, we have to drop back and test with
  <tt>defined</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
if (defined $age) { 
   if ($age) {
       $average = $total / $age; 
   } else { 
       print "Can't average a 0 age.\n"; 
       $average = 0; 
   } 
} else { 
   print "You really didn't give me an age value.\n"; 
} 
</pre>

  <p>It's worth emphasizing: Truth and definedness are different.
  There are four false values that are defined: <tt>0</tt>,
  <tt>"0"</tt>, <tt>0.0</tt>, and <tt>""</tt>. If you're in doubt,
  you can write a small program to test this:</p>
  <pre>
 
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
$x = 0; 
print "$x is defined\n" if defined $x; 
$x = 0.0; 
print "$x is defined\n" if defined $x; 
# ... 
</pre>

  <h3>Truth in Context</h3>

  <p>Every Perl expression is used in a particular <i>context</i>.
  At its most basic level, context is the answer to the question,
  "Am I producing a single value, or am I producing many values?"
  If the expression is meant to produce a single value, it's in
  scalar context. If the expression is to produce many values, it's
  in list context. Scalar context is most often seen in assignments
  to scalar variables, boolean testing, and scalar subscripts:</p>
  <pre>
  
$x = EXPR;      # EXPR in scalar context
if (EXPR)       # EXPR in scalar context
$foo[EXPR]      # EXPR in scalar context
</pre>

  <p>List context is most often seen in assignments to array
  variables, arguments to an unprototyped function (or a function
  prototyped to take a list), and slices:</p>
  <pre>
@x = EXPR;      # EXPR in list context
foo(EXPR);      # EXPR in list context
@foo[EXPR]      # EXPR in list context
</pre>

  <p>Context is used by Perl programmers a lot. When we say this,
  we're forcing <tt>@array</tt> into scalar context:</p>
  <pre>
  
$count = @array;       
# number of elements in @array
</pre>

  <p>Perl has rules for evaluating lists, arrays, and hashes in
  scalar context. An array in scalar context behaves like the
  number of things in the array, so <tt>$count</tt> gets set to the
  number of elements in <tt>@array</tt>. Because boolean tests also
  provide scalar context, we can say:</p>
  <pre>
if (@array) {
    print "There are values in @array\n";
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>@array</tt> in scalar context is 0 (false) if the array is
  empty, and some non-zero number (true) if the array has values in
  it. However, it's not just <tt>if</tt> that provides scalar
  context. Any boolean operator forces its arguments into scalar
  context:</p>
  <pre>
if ($must_process_array &amp;&amp; @array) {
# process the array
}
</pre>

  <h3>Applications</h3>

  <p>Here's the meaty part. Perl programmers use true and false all
  the time. If you've used Perl for any length of time, you'll have
  seen something like this:</p>
  <pre>
open(FH, "&lt; $filename") || 
         die "Couldn't open $filename: $!\n";
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>open</tt> function returns true if it succeeds, false
  if it doesn't. If it returns false, the <tt>||</tt> operator
  evaluates its right-hand side and calls <tt>die</tt>. This relies
  on the short-circuit property of Perl's boolean operators: if
  we're testing logical OR, and the left-hand side of the
  <tt>||</tt> or <tt>or</tt> is true, we know that the OR will be
  true and so we don't have to test the right-hand side. Similarly,
  AND can return false if the left-hand side returns false, because
  there's no way the AND can ever be true. Perl programmers also
  use logical OR to supply variables with default values. Here's an
  excerpt from one of my programs:</p>
  <pre>
$Data_File = $opt_t || "/tmp/web.data";
</pre>

  <p>If <tt>$opt_t</tt> was given a value (say, from the
  command-line option parsing module Getopt::Std), that value will
  be assigned to <tt>$Data_File</tt>. If <tt>$opt_t</tt> wasn't
  given a value (because the user didn't supply a <tt>-t</tt>
  command line option) then <tt>$Data_File</tt> gets set to
  <tt>"/tmp/web.data"</tt>. This single expression replaces a more
  verbose <tt>if</tt> statement:</p>
  <pre>
if ($opt_t) {
   $Data_File = $opt_t;
} else {
   $Data_File = "/tmp/web.data";
}
</pre>

  <p>Finally, let's end with a more involved example: sorting on
  two criteria. We already know that the <tt>sort</tt> function
  sorts a list of values in ASCII order:</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = sort @unsorted;
</pre>

  <p>If we want to sort by some other means, for instance
  numerically, we have to give <tt>sort</tt> a code block (or a
  subroutine name) that compares two elements and returns -1, 0, or
  +1 to indicate how they should be sorted. This example uses the
  Perl operator &lt;=&gt; to sort an array of numbers from smallest
  to largest:</p>
  <pre>
# sort numerically
@sorted = sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } @unsorted;  
</pre>

  <p>Because 0 is used to tell <tt>sort</tt> "these two elements
  sort to the same position", we can use the <tt>||</tt> operator
  to connect two sorts:</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = sort { -s $a &lt;=&gt; -s $b 
        || $a cmp $b } @filenames;
</pre>

  <p>Here we're sorting filenames, so the block of code gets called
  with <tt>$a</tt> and <tt>$b</tt> as the two filenames to compare.
  We first use the <tt>-s</tt> operator to fetch the size of the
  files and compare those file sizes numerically. If they're the
  same size, &lt;=&gt; will return 0, and the <tt>||</tt> will
  instead use the value of the right-hand side, a string comparison
  of the filenames. We can write that more prettily as follows:</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = sort { -s $a &lt;=&gt; -s $b
       || $a cmp $b } @filenames;
</pre>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>And on that elegant note I leave you. We've seen inside Perl's
  notions of true and false, and found some common applications.
  Hopefully now when you see a <tt>||</tt> or a <tt>if
  (@array)</tt> you'll know what's going on. Here are some things I
  didn't discuss, and which you might try reading the online
  documentation or O'Reilly's Programming Perl to learn about:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>how lists and hashes behave in scalar context</li>

    <li>the <i>important</i> difference between <tt>or</tt> and
    <tt>||</tt></li>

    <li>how subroutines can learn their context with
    <tt>wantarray</tt></li>

    <li>how context propagates through subroutine calls to the
    <tt>return</tt> statement.</li>
