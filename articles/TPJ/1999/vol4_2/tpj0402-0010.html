  <p>You know the drill. Someone in accounting has asked that daily
  reports get e-mailed to him, or your manager has decided that
  your sales e-mail autoresponder needs to be sending off Microsoft
  Word documents, or marketing has this great idea for an e-mail
  newsletter <i>just</i> like the one that Amazon sends out, HTML
  and all. To do that, of course, you need to send out MIME-encoded
  mail. But MIME is a dark and mysterious thing, almost impossible
  to do properly, right?</p>

  <p>Well, no. It's pretty easy to MIME-encode mail, far simpler
  than you'd think given how many programmers get it wrong. What
  we're going to do in this article is cover the basics of MIME and
  show you how to build and send your own MIME mail.</p>

  <p>One thing this article <i>isn't</i> going to do is show you
  how to build a MIME mail body by hand. While building MIME mail
  isn't enormously tough, there are a couple of modules available
  on CPAN that'll do it for you. Since there's no pressing reason
  to rewrite one, we won't. Instead, we'll use <tt>MIME::Lite</tt>,
  available from CPAN. If you need heavier-duty tools, or need to
  decode MIME messages, check out <tt>MIME::Tools</tt> instead.</p>

  <h3>What is MIME, and why do we care?</h3>

  <p>MIME is short for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, It's
  an Internet standard, currently documented in RFCs 2045 through
  2048. If you want to read them yourself, and you probably should
  if you're going to do a lot of work with MIME, the RFCs are
  available on the web at <a href=
  "http://www.rfc-editor.org"><nobr>http://www.rfc-editor.org</nobr></a>,
  or via FTP at <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes" target=
  "resource window"><nobr>ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes</nobr></a>.</p>

  <p>Put simply, MIME is a way of imposing structure and encoding
  data in the body of a mail message. When mail was standardized
  way back in 1982 with RFC822, most of the attention was focused
  on the mail headers. The body of a mail message was very
  intentionally left alone. The only limits placed on the body were
  the character set (7-bit ASCII) and the maximum line length (1000
  characters).</p>

  <p>The MIME standard covers both the encoding and the structure
  of a mail message. There are two times when you'd want to use
  MIME mail -- when your message isn't entirely plain 7-bit
  US-ASCII or when you need to attach files to a mail message.
  We'll show you how to do both.</p>

  <h3>How does <tt>MIME</tt> encode data?</h3>

  <p><a href="tpj0402-0011.html">Table 1: Sending with
  <tt>Mail::Mailer</tt></a></p>

  <p>Since normal mail is restricted to the 7-bit US-ASCII
  character set, there's obviously a lot of data that can't go into
  a mail message. To get around this problem, MIME encodes the data
  to make it safe to use in mail. There are three different MIME
  encodings: None, quoted-printable, and base 64. These are called
  <i>content transfer encodings</i>.</p>

  <p>The "no encoding" type is the simplest encoding method--it's
  not really an encoding method at all. It's used for multi-part
  messages that have a text component, or for folks willing to take
  the chance that their mail server handles 8-bit data. It's also
  used by webservers when they transfer data to clients. (HTTP
  transfers use MIME encoded data.) There are three different
  keywords: <tt>7bit</tt>, <tt>8bit</tt>, and <tt>binary</tt>, that
  tell the recipient program how to interpret the message at its
  lowest level: byte-by-byte.</p>

  <p><tt>Quoted-printable</tt> encoding hex-escapes illegal bytes.
  Any byte outside the printable 7-bit US-ASCII set is replaced by
  an equals sign and a two-digit hex value. Space, for example, can
  be encoded as <tt>=20</tt>, and an equals sign as <tt>=3D</tt>.
  Data that's been encoded as quoted-printable must have lines no
  longer than 76 characters.</p>

  <p>Finally, <tt>base64</tt> encoding takes arbitrary data and
  encodes it using a set of 65 characters. The encoded data ends up
  being one-third larger, and unlike quoted-printable encodings is
  unreadable by humans. The encoded data is guaranteed to go
  through gateways unmangled, and will even travel unscathed
  through EBCDIC systems.</p>

  <p>In addition to encoding data, MIME tags it with a <i>media
  type</i> that indicates exactly what has been encoded. You've
  probably seen these in mail, or as messages from your web
  broswer--things like <tt>application/x-zip</tt> or
  <tt>image/jpeg</tt>. It's the first part of the
  <tt>Content-type</tt> header.</p>

  <p>MIME marks data with both a media type and subtype. There's a
  full list of types in <a href="tpj0402-0012.html">Table
  2.</a></p>

  <p>Each of those typescan have list of different sub-types. The
  full list can be found at <a href=
  "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes-iana/assignments/media-types/media-types"
  target=
  "resource window">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes-iana/assignments/media-types/media-types</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0402-0013.html">Table 3</a> lists the most common
  type/subtype combinations.</p>

  <p>It's important that you use the right MIME media type when
  you're building a MIME message. A good, standards-conforming MIME
  decoder will use this information to determine how it should
  handle each chunk of a MIME message. Unfortunately, there are a
  depressingly large number of non-compliant MIME decoders, and on
  most systems the media type information is lost as soon as the
  file is saved, so it's a good idea to also tag individual pieces
  with filenames that have standard extensions.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>
Content-type: text/plain
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit
&#13;This is just a plain old piece of text
</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1</b> shows a
  symbolic representation of a one-part MIME message.</font></p>

  <p>A subtype of <tt>octet-stream</tt> indicates that this part of
  the MIME message is filled with data of some sort, and that any
  MIME application that deals with it should treat it like a raw
  stream of bytes with no intrinsic meaning. A good MIME
  application is also supposed to treat any subtype that it doesn't
  understand as if it were <tt>octet-stream</tt>.</p>

  <p>If you find that you need a media subtype not on the standard
  list, it's perfectly acceptable to roll your own. All subtypes
  beginning with <tt>x-</tt> are reserved for general use, much
  like the <tt>X-</tt> mail headers. So if, for example, you were
  MIME-encoding a tar file, it'd be reasonable to tag it as
  <tt>application/x-tar</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Multiple pieces of <tt>MIME</tt></h3>

  <p>Encoding and media typing is useful, and is one of the
  underpinnings of the web, but one of the main uses for MIME in
  mail is to send attachments. There are two media types,
  <tt>multipart/mixed</tt> and <tt>multipart/alternative</tt>. Both
  indicate that the MIME message has multiple parts.</p>

  <p>With <tt>multipart/mixed</tt>, the parts are all considered
  separate--this is the media type used for mail messages with
  attachments. A section in a <tt>multipart/mixed</tt> message can
  itself be <tt>multipart/mixed</tt>, which means you can nest
  them. Many mail clients don't handle this all that well, so it's
  probably best not to do this unless you know the receiver can
  handle it.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>
Content-type: multipart/alternative
</pre>

          <table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0"
          cellpadding="5">
            <tr>
              <td>
                <pre>
Content-type: text/plain
&#13;My home page
This is what my home page looks like!
</pre>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0"
          cellpadding="5">
            <tr>
              <td>
                <pre>
Content-type: text/html
&#13;&lt;HEAD&gt;My home page&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
This is what &lt;B&gt;my&lt;/B&gt; home page looks like!
&lt;/BODY&gt;
</pre>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 3</b> shows what you
  might get if you pasted a very simple HTML document into a
  MIME-aware mail client.</font></p>

  <p>If you do nest them, each <tt>multipart/mixed</tt> section
  (not the pieces inside, mind you, but the thing as a whole) can't
  be encoded with <tt>quoted-printable</tt> or <tt>base64</tt>.
  That'd require the MIME client to decode the
  <tt>multipart/mixed</tt> section and then handle each individual
  piece inside, which might themselves be <tt>multipart/mixed</tt>.
  The folks that wrote the standards decided that this was an awful
  lot to expect of a client, so it's explicitly forbidden.</p>

  <p><tt>multipart/alternative</tt> lets you attach multiple
  versions of the same thing. You might, for example, have one part
  of a <tt>multipart/alternative</tt> be <tt>text/plain</tt> and
  another be <tt>audio/basic</tt> with a spoken version of the
  message if you were sending it to someone who had impaired
  vision.</p>

  <h3>So, how do I create a MIME message?</h3>

  <p>Creating a MIME message is pretty simple with
  <tt>MIME::Lite</tt>. In fact, it can be as simple as three Perl
  statements:</p>
  <pre>
# Build the message
$message = MIME::Lite-&gt;new(
        From     =&gt; 'me@here.org',
        To       =&gt; 'you@there.com',
        Subject  =&gt; "A test",
        Type     =&gt; "text/plain",
        Encoding =&gt; '7bit',
        Data     =&gt; "Just a test message");
# Tell MIME::Lite to use Net::SMTP instead of sendmail
MIME::Lite-&gt;send('smtp', 'localhost', Timeout =&gt; 20);
# Send the message
$message-&gt;send;
</pre>

  <p>That code builds and sends a mail message via Net::SMTP. If
  you prefer to use <tt>sendmail</tt>, you can omit the second line
  of code. It's okay to have multiple folks in the <tt>To</tt>
  list--just pass them in an anonymous array.
  <tt>MIME::Lite::new</tt> takes the standard RFC822 headers, so if
  you want to specify a <tt>Cc</tt> or <tt>Bcc</tt> list, or set
  the <tt>Sender</tt> field, you can.</p>

  <p>In that last example, the message we were sending was
  specified explicitly with <tt>Data</tt>. If you'd like to get
  fancier, you can try something like this:</p>
  <pre>
# Build the message
$message = MIME::Lite-&gt;new(
         From     =&gt; 'me@here.org',
         To       =&gt; 'you@there.com',
         Subject  =&gt; "The Net::SMTP docs"
         Type     =&gt; "text/plain",
         Encoding =&gt; '7bit',
         Filename =&gt; 'Net_SMTP.txt'
         Path     =&gt; 'perldoc Net::SMTP |');
# Tell MIME::Lite to use Net::SMTP instead of sendmail
MIME::Lite-&gt;send('smtp', 'localhost', Timeout =&gt; 20);
# Send the message
$message-&gt;send;
</pre>

  <p>In this example, we've substituted <tt>Path</tt> for
  <tt>Data</tt>. <tt>Path</tt> specifies the full path to be passed
  to <tt>open()</tt>. It can be a plain file but, as the example
  shows, doesn't have to be. In this case, we're using some of
  <tt>open()</tt>'s magic to spawn off <tt>perldoc</tt> to get the
  plain text version of the Net::SMTP docs. The <tt>Filename</tt>
  option above provides the MIME section that's created with a
  filename of <tt>Net_SMTP.txt</tt>. While this doesn't affect
  where the data comes from, MIME clients will often use it as a
  default filename for extracting the data.</p>

  <p>There's no real reason that the message you build needs to be
  text, of course. You could, for example, use a JPEG image or PDF
  file instead. Normally, though, you'll start with plain text and,
  if you need to send non-text stuff, attach other things to the
  end.</p>

  <p>Building a mail message with attachments is nearly as simple
  as building a single-part mail message. For example, take this
  chunk of code from a mythical tech support autoresponder:</p>
  <pre>
# Build the message
$message = MIME::Lite-&gt;new(
           From     =&gt; 'me@here.org',
           To       =&gt; 'you@there.com',
           Subject  =&gt; "Technote PDF Autoresponder",
           Type     =&gt; "text/plain",
           Encoding =&gt; '7bit',
           Data     =&gt; "This is the technote you requested");
# Add the attachment
$message-&gt;attach(
           Type     =&gt; "application/pdf",
           Encoding =&gt; "base64",
           Path     =&gt; $technote_requested,
           Filename =&gt; "Technote.pdf");
# Tell MIME::Lite to use Net::SMTP instead of sendmail
MIME::Lite-&gt;send('smtp', 'localhost', Timeout =&gt; 20);
# Send the message
$message-&gt;send;
</pre>

  <p>Pretty simple. You can attach as many files as you like this
  way just by adding extra calls to <tt>attach()</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Going an alternate route</h3>

  <p><tt>MIME::Lite</tt> has support built in for sending out its
  MIME messages either via <tt>sendmail</tt> or through
  <tt>Net::SMTP</tt>. That's not always what you want to do,
  though. Instead, you might want to save the resulting message for
  later use, or send it with some alternate mailer that has less
  overhead -- such as the simple SMTP subroutine that appears
  elsewhere in this issue. The easiest way to extract the message
  is with the <tt>as_string()</tt> method, like so:</p>
  <pre>
# Build the message
$message = MIME::Lite-&gt;new(
          From     =&gt; 'me@here.org',
          To       =&gt; 'you@there.com;,
          Subject  =&gt; "A test",
          Type     =&gt; "text/plain",
          Encoding =&gt; '7bit',
          Data     =&gt; "Just a test message");
$message_text = $message-&gt;as_string;
</pre>

  <p>This sticks the entire message, headers and all, into
  <tt>$message_text</tt>. From there you can do what you like with
  it. If instead you'd rather have just the headers, or just the
  body, you can use the <tt>header_as_string()</tt> or
  <tt>body_as_string()</tt> methods, respectively.</p>

  <h3>A full-blown example</h3>

  <p>Finally, let's take a look at a full program that sends MIME
  mail. The program in <a href="tpj0402-0014.html"><b>Listing
  1</b></a> is <tt>mail_attach.pl</tt>, a variation of which I've
  got in production on my VMS cluster. We use it for email delivery
  of some daily reports, but it can be easily modified to do most
  anything else you like.</p>

  <p>At the top of the program there's a hash with a set of common
  extensions and their associated media types. This list was lifted
  out of the config files for the webserver I run on my cluster and
  works well for me, but you might want to tweak it for the sorts
  of files you're sending. Having the list embedded in the program
  saves us from having to educate every analyst on which MIME types
  go with which files.</p>

  <p>Next it takes the parameters off the command line. It could
  (and probably should) use switches rather than positional
  parameters, but this way works out okay for us, and the folks I
  work with consider positional parameters the norm.</p>

  <p>We then read in the file with the body text of the message
  we're sending and create the <tt>MIME::Lite</tt> object. This
  text doesn't need to be anything fancy, but it's a good idea to
  give the recipient at least some idea of what the attachments
  are. This is especially useful for things that get mailed out
  less than once a week.</p>

  <p>Then the program runs through all the files that need to be
  attached. A regex extracts the extension and we run it through
  the extension hash to see if we've got an entry. If so, we use
  the media type and encoding that goes with it. Otherwise, we
  default to <tt>text/plain</tt> and <tt>8bit</tt>. A different
  default, such as <tt>application/octet-stream</tt> and
  <tt>base64</tt>, might be desirable depending on what you're
  mailing out.</p>

  <p>Finally we send the message. This version uses Net::SMTP to do
  the sending. You might prefer to use <tt>sendmail</tt> if you're
  on a Unix box, or another mail routine entirely, depending on
  your setup. My production copy uses a variation on the standalone
  mail subroutine (appearing elsewhere in this issue) to avoid
  loading in <tt>Net::SMTP</tt> and the entire IO family of
  modules. While they're quite nice, the overhead really isn't
  justified for a simple mailing program like this.</p>

  <h3>And in conclusion...</h3>

  <p>Well, that's it. Sending MIME mail is pretty straightforward,
  but if you peek under the hood of <tt>Lite.pm</tt> you'll see the
  details are tricky enough to justify not rolling your own.</p>
