  <font size="+2">A</font>s this issue goes to press, I'm just
  returning from the O'Reilly Perl Conference, held in San Jose
  from August 19 through 21. There's never been such a large
  gathering of Perl programmers (1047) in one place. Nor has there
  been such a large gathering of core Perl developers - about fifty
  attended a party Larry Wall hosted at his home nearby. By nearly
  any standard (except perhaps Internet access), the conference was
  a success, and O'Reilly will be hosting another one (time and
  place to be determined).

  <p>The conference began with two all-day tutorials: Randal
  Schwartz taught Learning Perl, and Tom Christiansen taught CGI
  and Web Programming in Perl. The following two days sported three
  simultaneous tracks: Programming in Perl, Perl for Win32, and
  Perl and the Web. There were five or six talks in each track.</p>

  <p>There were also a few special talks: Larry Wall opened
  Wednesday with The Culture of Perl, interleaving theology and
  sound effects (<a href=
  "http://conference.perl.com/pub/talks/wall/keynote.html" target=
  "resource window">http://conference.perl.com/pub/talks/wall/keynote.html</a>).
  I ended the day with a talk about how Perl is used at the MIT
  Media Lab.</p>

  <p>Thursday began with a talk by Andrew Schulman entitled The Web
  is the API: The New Programming Paradigm (<a href=
  "http://www.sonic.net/~undoc/perl/talk/webapi1.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.sonic.net/~undoc/perl/talk/webapi1.html</a>)
  and ended with Eric Raymond's talk about freeware entitled "The
  Cathedral and the Bazaar," (<a href=
  "http://www.ccil.org/~esr/writings/cathedral.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.ccil.org/~esr/writings/cathedral.html</a>)
  followed by a panel on freeware.</p>

  <p>Lots happened at the conference; too much to summarize here.
  The three most important announcements were:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Larry Wall is developing a utility that lets you create
    Java bytecode with Perl. This will allow specially-prepared
    Perl programs to run on Java-enabled browsers.</li>

    <li>Dick Hardt will be working with Gurusamy Sarathy, Malcolm
    Beattie, Nick Ing-Simmons, and Tim Bunce to merge the
    ActiveState Win32 Perl with the core Perl distribution for Perl
    5.005. MacPerl integration may follow. The collaboration took
    place thanks to a breakfast hosted by Gina Blaber, software
    director for O'Reilly.</li>

    <li>Songline Studios, an affiliate of O'Reilly &amp;
    Associates, now hosts perl.com on a T3 - a considerable upgrade
    from Tom Christiansen's poor 28.8K modem.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Attendees received free goodie bags with the usual swag - plus
  a free copy of Sriram Srinivasan's new O'Reilly book, Advanced
  Perl Programming. The goodie bag soon became my most treasured
  possession once my luggage was stolen from the conference hotel.
  I had a good time anyway.</p>

  <h3>New Modules</h3>

  <p>Version 1.1 of <b>SWIG</b> has been released. SWIG (Simplified
  Wrapper and Interface Generator) is a programming tool developed
  by Dave Beazley to simplify the integration of C, C++, and
  Objective C with scripting languages including Perl, Python, and
  Tcl. SWIG is a compiler that turns ANSI C/C++ declarations into
  the bindings needed to access them from the scripting languages.
  See http://www.cs.utah.edu/~beazley/SWIG.</p>

  <p><b>ApacheDBI</b> 0.74, a module by Edmund Mergl that provides
  authentication, authorization, and persistent database
  connections for your Apache web server, is now available.</p>

  <p>Randy Kobes put together an HTML collection of most of the
  <b>CPAN</b> modules. Visit it at <a href=
  "http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/" target=
  "resource window">http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/</a>.</p>

  <p>Calle Dybedahl's <b>Archive::Tar</b> module lets you create
  and manipulate tar files from Perl. If Paul Marquess'
  <b>Compress::Zlib</b> is available, Archive::Tar will use it to
  read and write gzipped tar files.</p>

  <p>There are several new modules available for the X11 Window
  System, all in Stephen McCamant's <b>X11-Protocol</b> bundle:
  X11::Protocol, a raw interface to X servers, <b>X11::Keysyms</b>,
  a listing of X11 key symbols, and <b>X11::Auth</b>, an interface
  to .Xauthority files.</p>

  <p>Stephen also contributed <b>B::Graph</b>, a layer between the
  Perl-internals-examining portion of Malcolm Beattie's Perl
  compiler (the <b>B</b> module) and particular graph layout tools
  (currently Dot and VGC). It examines the internal structures that
  Perl builds to represent your code (OPs and SVs) and generates
  specifications for multicolored boxes and arrows to represent
  them.</p>

  <p>David Bonner's <b>Chart</b> is a graphics module that, like
  GIFgraph, lets you create line, bar, and pie charts as .gif
  images. Unlike GIFgraph, it lets you add legends to the charts.
  It requires Lincoln Stein's GD module.</p>

  <p>Tyrell Software's <b>PowerPerl</b> is a Perl module that
  allows HTML pages to include Perl code with an eye toward
  security. This commercial product (not available on the CPAN)
  comes with a set of modules called PowerPaks that allow users to
  create CGI scripts without knowing any Perl.</p>

  <p>The <b>Data::Locations</b> module, by Steffen Beyer, lets you
  insert placeholders into a collection of data (such as a file) so
  that you can read or write the data in any order you choose.</p>

  <p>Steffen also uploaded version 3.0 of <b>Tie::Handle</b>, which
  lets you associate objects with filehandles.</p>

  <p>Ben Sugars' <b>IPC::Shareable</b> module lets you tie a a
  variable to shared memory, making it easy to share the contents
  of that variable with other Perl processes. Currently either
  scalars or hashes can be tied; tying of arrays remains a work in
  progress. However, the variable being tied may contain
  arbitrarily complex data structures - including references to
  arrays, hashes of hashes, and so on. As this issue goes to press,
  a slight name change is being debated; whatever it is, it'll be
  in the IPC directory on the CPAN.</p>

  <p>The <b>Net::Pcap</b> module, by Peter Lister, is a
  SWIG-generated interface to Van Jacobson's libpcap packet capture
  library. It lets a subroutine process packets on a network with
  Perl's regular expressions.</p>

  <p>John Tobey's <b>ExtUtils::DynaLib</b> module lets you call C
  functions from dynamic libraries.</p>

  <p>The <b>IO::Tee</b> module, by Chung-chieh Shan, takes a bunch
  of output handles and returns a pseudo-handle. Whenever you write
  something to that pseudo-handle, it's automatically written to
  all of the original handles. The <b>RenderMan</b> module, by
  Glenn Lewis, is an interface to the Blue Moon Rendering Tools by
  Larry Gritz. RenderMan lets you create realistic 3D objects.</p>

  <p>LDAP, the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, can be
  accessed from Perl programs via Clayton Donley's
  <b>Net::LDAPapi</b> module.</p>

  <p>Paul Henson's <b>File::lockf</b> module is a wrapper around
  the lockf system call. Of course, Perl already has
  <tt>flock()</tt> and <tt>fcntl(</tt>), but <i>lockf</i> has some
  advantages over both: it handles network locks (unlike
  <tt>flock()</tt>) and has sensible arguments (unlike
  <tt>fcntl()</tt>).</p>

  <p>RADIUS is a protocol used by terminal servers (e.g. Cisco,
  Ascend, Livingston, USR) for network authentication and
  accounting. Christopher Masto's <b>RADIUS::Dictionary</b> and
  <b>RADIUS::Packet</b> modules let you create servers and clients
  that speak the protocol (RFCs 2138 and 2139).</p>

  <p>Russ Allbery's <b>PGP::Sign</b> lets you create and check PGP
  (Pretty Good Privacy) signatures. It's not an all-encompassing
  interface to PGP; for that, use Gerard Hickey's <b>PGP</b>
  module.<br></p>

  <p><b>RPC::Simple</b>, by Dominique Dumont, lets you make Remote
  Procedure Calls from Perl.<br></p>

  <p>Chris Nandor released <b>Mac::Apps::PBar</b>, an AppleEvent
  module for the Macintosh progress bar.</p>

  <p><b>Devel::SmallProf</b> is a small profiler by Ted Ashton that
  lets you determine how much time is used by each line of your
  program. "Small" is in comparison to Dean Roehrich's
  <b>Devel::DProf</b>.</p>

  <p>You can analyze and synthesize a string of comma-separated
  values with Alan Citterman's <b>Text::CSV</b> module.</p>

  <p>The <b>Parse::RecDescent</b> module, by Damian Conway,
  generates top-down recursive-descent parsers from simple
  yacc-like grammar specifications. (<i>yacc</i> converts rules for
  parsing a language into a program that follows those rules.)</p>

  <p>ObjectStore is a fast object-oriented database management
  system; Joshua Pritikin's <b>ObjStore</b> module provides a Perl
  interface to it.</p>

  <p>You can now create SVR4-style pkgadd Perl distributions with
  Alan Burlison's <b>mkpkg</b> utility.</p>

  <p>Michael Piotrowski's <b>Locale::Iconv</b> module provides a
  Perl interface to the <tt>iconv()</tt> character set conversion
  function, as defined by the X/Open Single UNIX Specification
  (XPG4).</p>

  <p>You'll also find <b>Locale::Msgcat</b> in the Locale category
  set. This module, by Christophe Wolfhugel, provides access to
  XPG4 message catalog functions.</p>

  <p>Nick Ing-Simmons' <b>Sys::Sysconf</b> module generates all of
  the constants that might be passed to
  <tt>POSIX::sysconf()</tt>.</p>

  <p>New modules should be cleared with the <b>modules@perl.org</b>
  mailing list before uploading to the CPAN. We don't review the
  code so much as ensure that new modules have appropriate names.
  Information about other Perl news should be sent to
  <b>submissions@tpj.com</b>.</p>
