  Regardless of how I feel about Microsoft Windows, they're here to
  stay and I have to administer a WAN of them. I've gotten used to
  them in spite of their limitations, but there's one burning issue
  that I can't get over: the lack of a decent scripting shell. The
  DOS-like command line isn't helpful for anything more than the
  most simple of automation. That's where Win32 Perl comes in.

  <p>The Win32 port of Perl works on both Windows NT and Windows
  95, thanks to the folks from ActiveState (<a href=
  "http://www.activestate.com" target=
  "resource window">http://www.activestate.com</a>). Dick Hardt and
  his team have done a remarkable job at developing the port and
  implementing useful features that make administering Win32
  networks a breeze.</p>

  <p>Win32 Perl is a Win32 native application that, for the most
  part, works just like its UNIX brethren and can handle almost
  anything that you can throw at it (with a few exceptions
  discussed later). If you subscribe to this magazine, you'll be
  right at home with it. Well, almost right at home, as you'll
  see.</p>

  <h3>Obtaining and Installing Win32 Perl</h3>

  <p>There are currently two major versions of Win32 Perl: the
  ActiveState version and the core distribution version. The
  O'Reilly Perl Conference initiated an ongoing effort to merge
  them.</p>

  <p><b>The core distribution version.</b> The Official Perl
  distribution available from the <a href=
  "../vol2_3/tpj0203-0007a.html" target="resource window">CPAN</a>
  has rolled in Win32 support. Nick Ing-Simmons and Gurusamy
  Sarathy have done a great job with this port, which contains both
  source and binaries. Just make sure that you read the
  documentation, because you might need to jump through a few hoops
  if you compile the source code yourself. The Win32 specific
  extensions found in the ActiveState version are available, but
  come in a separate package called libwin32, which you can
  download from <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/GSAR/"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/GSAR/</a>.
  So far all of my scripts originally written for ActiveState have
  worked perfectly with the core.</p>

  <p><b>The ActiveState version.</b> This is the version most users
  have because it's been around for a while. ActiveState
  distributes the source and binaries (for both x86 and Alpha
  chips). The binaries come with everything you need to get
  started. You just download it (check out their home page for the
  latest build), run the self-extracting archive, and everything
  snaps into place. Or, if you have a C compiler (Microsoft Visual
  C++ is preferred) then you can download the source code and
  compile the beast. The ActiveState port comes in three flavors;
  it's important that you know the differences between them: the
  regular Perl executable, PerlIS, and PerlScript.</p>

  <p><b>The Perl executable.</b> The ActiveState Perl executable
  (derived from Perl 5.003) is a Win32 console application. It runs
  as you would expect Perl to run, on a console-based command
  line.</p>

  <p><b>PerlIS.</b> PerlIS.DLL is an Internet Server API (ISAPI)
  extension designed to work with Microsoft's Internet Information
  Server (IIS). It works just like the Perl executable, but since
  it's a .DLL file ( A .DLL file is a Dynamic Linked Library, a
  library of functions loaded during run time and dynamically
  linked to by the calling application. It is similar in function
  to the ELF library format in the UNIX world. ) it is loaded only
  once during the life of the web server, remaining in memory until
  the server process has completed. You might want to use this for
  CGI scripts; the DLL links Perl into the web server, so there's
  no overhead for starting a new Perl process. This is faster than
  starting a script with <tt>perl.exe</tt>, but of course there's
  no speed gain for script execution.</p>

  <p><b>PerlScript.</b> Then there's PerlScript, similar in
  function to JavaScript and VBScript. It's an interface between
  Win32 Perl and Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) that allow
  you to embed Perl code in HTML pages for processing by either web
  server or browser. [See PerlScript]</p>

  <p>For the rest of this article, I'll concentrate on the
  ActiveState port of the Perl executable since it has the largest
  user base.</p>

  <h3>Gotchas &amp; Dilemmas with the Win32 Port</h3>

  <p>I've used Win32 Perl for CGI scripting, database maintenance,
  and system administration, and in the process compiled a list of
  gotchas and dilemmas. Gotchas are little issues that I try to
  remember when coding; dilemmas are larger problems that I've had
  to write code to work around.</p>

  <p><b>Gotchas.</b> Most of these are annoyances that can be
  resolved easily. Novices spend most of their time grappling with
  these issues when experimenting with code from Perl books.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>File Permissions. Using correct file permissions may be
    obvious to most but I've received so much email about them that
    I want to mention it here. If your Perl script performs
    flawlessly when you run it but fails when invoked as a CGI
    script, permissions are likely the problem. Perl users need
    permission to read the Perl executable, DLL file, packages, and
    extensions. Keep in mind that when you run a script it runs
    under <i>your</i> account with permissions granted to
    <i>you</i>. But when you run the same code under another
    account (such as the scheduler service, or as a CGI script from
    your web server) it runs under whatever account the service
    uses. Make sure your service account has the proper read
    permissions on the Perl tree.</li>

    <li>Parse Exceptions. ActiveState has released many Win32 Perl
    builds, and occasionally a new build redefines the extension
    API, making it necessary to recompile your extensions. If you
    don't, you might receive a "parse exception" as your program
    runs. ActiveState has done a good job at making these changes
    invisible from the coder's perspective; the changes are
    reflected in the XS macros. Generally all you need to do is
    replace the Perl header files from the Perl source and
    recompile the extension, or download an updated build.</li>

    <li>Paths. For sake of compatibility Win32 Perl recognizes
    UNIX-like paths that use slashes to delimit directories, e.g.
    <tt>/usr/lib</tt>. Win32 Perl translates the paths to the
    Microsoft dialect: <tt>\usr\lib</tt>. This even works when you
    want to open a UNC (A Universal Naming Convention (UNC) is
    Microsoft's way of specifying a path to a file or directory
    over a network. For example a file may be accessed as<br>
    <tt>\\ServerName\SharedDir\perl\test\test.pl.</tt>)<br>
    such as:<br>
    <tt>//servername/sharename/directory/file.txt</tt><br>
    which is translated by Win32 Perl to:<br>
    <tt>\\servername\sharename\directory\file.txt</tt>.<br>
    It's inviting to use the slash instead of backslash in a path
    because a backslash needs to be escaped with another backslash.
    So the path:<br>
    <tt>\\server\share\perl\bin\perl.exe</tt><br>
    when used as a string becomes:<br>
    <tt>$path = "\\\\server\\share\\perl\\bin\\perl.exe</tt>"<br>
    which is annoying. So the ability to use slashes is quite
    tempting. Yet this is another gotcha, because when you use
    system commands you have to revert to backslashes.<br>
    <tt>@dir = 'dir //server/share/directory/*.*';</tt><br>
    This causes an error because Windows does not recognize the
    slash as a delimiter - even though Perl does.</li>

    <li>Documentation. If you are fairly new to Perl and don't have
    a background in coding and/or a background in the Win32 API,
    you're in for quite a ride. The documentation is woefully
    incomplete and in some cases vague or even incorrect. I find
    that the best way to learn the syntax for a Win32 specific
    function is to look at the source code and reference the Win32
    API manuals. You may, instead, want to consult some of the
    Win32 Perl FAQs and web pages available on the net.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="tpj0203-0003a.html">In Search of the Win32
  Guru</a></p>

  <p><b>Dilemmas.</b> Dilemmas are issues that aren't so easy to
  work around. These dilemmas pose a problem with porting scripts
  from other platforms such as UNIX. To ActiveState's credit, most
  of these dilemmas are either technical restrictions due to the
  Win32 platform, or exist simply because they haven't had time to
  address them yet.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0203-0003b.html">What about DOS?</a></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Win32's lack of <tt>fork()</tt>: One of the most obvious
    dilemmas with the Win32 port has to do with Win32 and not the
    port itself: <tt>fork()</tt> doesn't exist. This poses some
    serious problems for porting UNIX scripts to Windows NT or
    Windows 95. The closest thing that Microsoft has to a forked
    process is a thread - but Perl won't support multithreading
    until 5.005. If you can neither <tt>fork()</tt> nor thread, how
    can you port your scripts that need to spawn a child process?
    You can use the <tt>CreateProcess()</tt> method from the
    Win32::Process extension, but when you create a new process you
    are starting a process from scratch - there's no transfer of
    data from parent to child. This means that your new child
    process has no idea that it is a child. To top it off, the
    child is created without any variables set or pipes open.
    However, the new child process can inherit Win32 filehandles,
    so you could open a pipe in the parent process, spawn the
    child, and then transfer important data from the parent to the
    child, right? Almost. The new child process can indeed inherit
    the filehandles, but there's no way for Perl to access them
    since they're 32-bit Win32 filehandles and not the 16-bit
    ANSI-compliant C filehandles that Perl prefers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When a new console processes is started, it begins with three
  open filehandles: STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR. Each of these Win32
  filehandles are mapped to C runtime filehandles with file
  descriptors of 0, 1, and 2 respectively. Let's say that your
  parent process opens an anonymous pipe:<br>
  <tt>pipe(READ, WRITE);</tt><br>
  and then redirects STDIN to the READ filehandle:<br>
  <tt>open(STDIN, "&lt; &amp;READ");</tt><br>
  When the child is created it can inherit this pipe as its STDIN.
  If the parent process then writes data to the pipe, the child can
  read it. It's also possible to use a socket instead of the pipe.
  This process works so long as you don't use the
  <tt>CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE</tt> flag for the new process, which
  creates a new console window and resets STDIN, STDOUT, and
  STDERR. This is obviously a poor replacement for <tt>fork()</tt>
  but with a bit of tweaking you can convince Win32 Perl to act as
  a server spawning children. The following two scripts show this
  process. The scripts are assumed to be in <tt>c:\perl\test</tt>,
  the Perl executable in <tt>c:\perl\bin</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Server Script</h3>
  <pre>
use Win32::Process; 
%Data = (       one =&gt; 1,    two =&gt; 2,    three =&gt; 3 ); 
pipe(READ, WRITE); 
select(WRITE); 
$| = 1; 
select(STDOUT); 
open(SAVEIN, "&lt;&amp;STDIN") || die "Can't save STDIN\n"; 
open(STDIN, "&lt;&amp;READ") || die "Can't redirect STDIN\n"; 
select(STDIN); 
$| = 1; 
select(STDOUT); 
Win32::Process::Create($Process, 
                      " c:\\perl\\bin\\perl.exe", 
                      "c:\\perl\\bin\\perl.exe", 
                      "c:\\perl\\test\\client.pl", 
                        1, NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS,
                      "c:\\perl\\test"); 
open(STDIN, "&lt;&amp;SAVEIN"); 
close(SAVEIN); 
close(READ); 
print "$0: Sending variables to child...\n"; 
foreach $Temp (keys(%Data)){ 
    print "$0:\t$Temp=$Data{$Temp}\n"; 
        print WRITE "\$Data{$Temp}=$Data{$Temp};\n"; 
} 
print "$0: Finished sending variables.\n"; 
close(WRITE); 
print "$0: About to terminate. Waiting for &lt;RETURN&gt;...\n"; 
&lt;STDIN&gt;; 
print "$0: End.\n";
</pre>

  <h3>Client Script</h3>
  <pre>
print "$0: Starting.\n"; 
print "$0: Reading in variables...\n"; 
while(&lt;STDIN&gt;) { 
    eval($_); 
    print "$0: \t$_"; 
} 
print "$0: Finished reading variables.\n"; 
print "$0: Dumping variables...\n"; 
foreach $Temp (keys(%Data)){ 
    print "$0:\t$Temp=$Data{$Temp}\n"; 
} 
print "$0: End.\n";
</pre>

  <ul>
    <li>Named Pipes. Win32 Perl does not yet support named pipes.
    This was the motivation for my Win32::Pipe extension, which
    makes it easy to create a named pipe. The server script creates
    a new Win32::Pipe object, waits for a connection from a client,
    and then reads from or writes to the pipe. The client opens a
    filehandle to the server's named pipe using either the standard
    <tt>open()</tt> function or using the Win32::Pipe functions
    (which provide additional features such as peeking ahead in the
    pipe before reading from it).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Server Script</h3>
  <pre>
use Win32::Pipe;
$Pipe = new Win32::Pipe("My_Pipe"); 
$Pipe-&gt;Connect(); 
$Pipe-&gt;Write("Hello client, from $0"); 
$Pipe-&gt;Close(); 
</pre>

  <h3>Client Script</h3>
  <pre>
open(CLIENT, "&lt; //./pipe/My_Pipe") || die; 
$Data = &lt;CLIENT&gt;; 
print "$Data\n"; 
close(CLIENT);
</pre>

  <h3>Benefits of Win32 Perl</h3>

  <p>In addition to the rich features of Perl, Win32 Perl has some
  nifty extensions that make it a great tool for any administrator.
  These extensions give you the ability to remotely control,
  configure, and manage a machine from across the net. I routinely
  manage my customers' mail, web, and FTP servers in real time over
  the Internet using Win32 Perl and the Internet. I've written CGI
  scripts that allow users to change their NT domain passwords or
  modify other account information, all using the extensions
  bundled with Win32 or available on the Internet.</p>

  <p><b>Extensions.</b> Win32 Perl comes with a set of useful
  platform specific extensions that provide an interface to some of
  the Win32 API features. I've stumbled upon a few extensions that
  were missing segments of code or were miscoded. Some of these
  bugs have been corrected as new builds have been released. If
  you're not proficient at extension coding (or just have limited
  time), you should post to Usenet or send mail to the one of the
  Win32 Perl listservers; chances are someone else has experienced
  the same problem.</p>

  <p><b>Installing extensions.</b> If you look around your Perl
  directory tree you'll find that the extension packages (the .pm
  files) are in your library's Win32 subdirectory. Actual
  extensions, however, are in <tt>perl\lib\auto\win32</tt> instead.
  In fact, all extensions must go into a subdirectory of
  <tt>perl\lib\auto</tt>. For example, when I installed the GD
  extension I copied the GD.PLL file to
  <tt>c:\perl\lib\auto\gd\</tt>tt&gt;. (The extension itself uses a
  .PLL file extension even though it's a .DLL file.(When you create
  a Win32 Perl extension, the binary will be a DLL file. Win32
  Perl, however, only recognizes it if it has an extension of .PLL,
  so renaming is necessary. )) Since Win32-based extensions fall
  into the Win32 namespace they can be found in subdirectories of
  <tt>perl\lib\auto\win32\;</tt> the Win32::ODBC extension can be
  found in <tt>c:\perl\lib\auto\win32\odbc\ odbc.pll</tt> on my
  machine.</p>

  <p><b>Win32.pm.</b> The most basic Win32-specific extension is
  the Win32 module. This isn't an extension so much as a package -
  there's no WIN32.PLL file. The methods found in this package are
  already built into Perl, but need to be accessed via this
  package. (The actual source code is found in ntxs.cpp.) This
  package gives you, among other things, access to the current
  user's name, domain, and computer name:</p>
  <pre>
use Win32; 
$User   = Win32::LoginName(); 
$Domain = Win32::DomainName(); 
$Node   = Win32::NodeName(); 
</pre>

  <p>There's also a handy function that returns an error message
  from the Win32 API for any API call regardless of what extension
  called it:</p>
  <pre>
	$Error = Win32::FormatMessage(Win32::GetLastError());  
</pre>

  <p><a href="tpj0203-0003c.html">Perl and ActiveX</a></p>

  <p><b>Win32::NetAdmin.</b> The Win32::NetAdmin extension is an
  administrator's best friend, allowing you to manipulate user
  accounts and check for group membership. The following subroutine
  returns a 1 if the user in the specified domain is a member of
  the specified group:</p>
  <pre>
sub CheckMembership { 
        my($Domain, $User, $Group) = @_; 
    return Win32::NetAdmin::GroupIsMember(
                          $Domain, $Group, $User) 
        || Win32::NetAdmin::LocalGroupIsMember(
                          $Domain, $Group, $User); 
}        
</pre>

  <p>An administrator could use a tab-delimited text file or
  database to store information about users, so that if he ever had
  to reload the user database into the NT servers, it would be this
  simple:</p>
  <pre>
open(FILE, "&lt; users.txt") || die "Couldn't open ($!)"; 
@Users = &lt;FILE&gt;; 
close(FILE); 
foreach $Data (@Users){ 
        chop $Data;
        ($Domain, $User, $Password, $HomeDir, $Password,
	       $Comment) = split("\t", @Users);
	       Win32::NetAdmin::UserCreate( 
                  $Domain, 
                  $User,                        
                  $Password, 
                  $PasswordAge, 
                  USER_PRIV_USER,                          # Privileges 
                  $HomeDir,     
                  $Comment, 
                  UF_NORMAL_ACCOUNT | UF_SCRIPT,           # Flags 
                  "c:\\scripts\\$User.bat")                # Logon script
	       || print "$User was not added.\n"; 
}
</pre>

  <p>Just a few notes about the
  <tt>Win32::NetAdmin::UserCreate()</tt> function shown above:
  <tt>$Domain</tt> can be a domain name, a server or an empty
  string (the default domain); <tt>$PasswordAge</tt> is ignored and
  will not be used; the privilege must be <tt>USER_PRIV_USER</tt>
  (administrator privileges are assigned by group membership); and
  for the flags you must at specify at least these two flags ORed
  together: <tt>UF_NORMAL_ACCOUNT</tt> and <tt>UF_SCRIPT</tt>.
  Other flags that you can use are:</p>
  <pre>
        UF_ACCOUNTDISABLE        Disable the account 
	UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD        No password is required 
	UF_PASSWD_CANT_CHANGE    User can't change the password
	UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD    The password never expires 
</pre>

  <p>A relative to this extension is my Win32::AdminMisc extension,
  which provides some additional administrative methods. Among the
  additional functions are the ability to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Log on as another user (impersonate users)</li>

    <li>Create a process as another user</li>

    <li>Check user's passwords</li>

    <li>Change users passwords</li>

    <li>Get and set a wider range of information about a user than
    the NetAdmin extension allows</li>

    <li>Retrieve system information such as physical memory,
    service patch level, and physical drive information</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>The Registry</b>. Win32 platforms have a configuration
  database called the <i>registry</i>, a central repository for
  information about system, user, and application configurations.
  Nearly all operating system values are stored in this database,
  from the type of your mouse to your IP address. The
  Win32::Registry extension allows you access to registries on both
  local and remote machines. Once you know the basic nature of the
  Registry, the extension is easy to use. For instance, this code
  has Windows automatically log on the next time the log on screen
  appears:</p>
  <pre>
use Win32::Registry; 
if ($HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE-&gt;Create( 
    "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\WinLogon",
    $Key)) { 
        $Key-&gt;SetValueEx("DefaultUserName", 0, REG_SZ,
                     "picard"); 
    $Key-&gt;SetValueEx("DefaultDomainName", 0, REG_SZ, 
                     "enterprise");     
    $Key-&gt;SetValueEx("DefaultPassword", 0, REG_SZ,
                     "hair"); 
    $Key-&gt;SetValueEx("AutoAdminLogin", 0, REG_SZ, 1);
    $Key-&gt;Close(); 
}
</pre>

  <p><b>ODBC.</b> The Win32::ODBC extension has become quite
  popular for both administration and web scripting. It's an
  interface into the ODBC API that allows your script to talk to
  heterogeneous databases - provided you have ODBC drivers for
  them. The extension is easy to use: you connect to a database,
  submit a query, retrieve the results, and close the database.
  Here's a simple example that retrieves a user's name and phone
  number from a fictitious database called <i>PhoneNumbers</i>:</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0203-0003d.html">Installing the Activeware
  Port</a></p>
  <pre>
 
use Win32::ODBC; 
$O = new Win32::ODBC("PhoneNumbers") || die; 
if (!($O-&gt;Sql("select Name, Phone from List"))) { 
        while($O-&gt;FetchRow()) { 
        undef %Data; 
                        %Data = $O-&gt;DataHash(); 
        print "$Data{Name}\t$Data{Phone}\n"; 
        } 
} else { 
    print "Error: ". $O-&gt;Error(); 
}
$O-&gt;Close(); 
</pre>

  <p>You can, however, use other functions to make more
  sophisticated multi-cursor queries. The ODBC extension assumes
  that you have at least a rudimentary understanding of SQL.
  Information can be found on my web site: <a href=

  <p><b>Other Extensions.</b> Some other popular extensions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>ChangeNotification. Detects changes in files and
    directories.</li>

    <li>EventLog. Gives read and write access to the event
    logs.</li>

    <li>Semaphore. An interface into the Win32 IPC API: semaphores,
    mutexes, and the like.</li>

    <li>NetResource. Manipulate shared network resources such as
    directories and printers.

      <p>The following six extensions are available from Aldo

  programming in Perl should be.</p>
