  Nowhere is the Perl adage, "there's more than one way to do it"
  more applicable than in the different ways one can implement the
  conditionals, loops and other compound statements. If you always
  use if/then/else whenever you have a decision to make, consider
  using some of the other schemes I'll discuss in this column.

  <h3>Zap along with the short circuit operators</h3>

  <p>To demonstrate, let's create a hypothetical emergency.(No
  people, animals, or electrons were harmed in the production of
  this article.) You have an appointment at The Perl Clinic but you
  arrive early and are directed to the waiting room. Four other
  people are waiting, and as you are sitting down one of them
  collapses to the floor. "I know First Aid!" you cry, and jump up
  only to realize that the shock has precipitated an attack of your
  rare medical condition leaving you not only unable to move, but
  unable to communicate in anything but Perl. Surprisingly the
  other people in the room (let's call them Tom, Dick, and Harry)
  do not seem fazed by this, and appear prepared to follow your
  lead, as long as you talk to them through the appropriate
  filehandle.</p>

  <p>Few victims have walked away from CPR; all you can do as a
  bystander is keep them alive until the real professionals get
  there with drugs and machines that go ping.</p>
  <pre>
print "Have you got a cellphone? ";
chomp ($answer = &lt;STDIN&gt;);
($answer eq "y") &amp;&amp; (print "Ring 911!\n");
</pre>

  <p>This last line is probably my favorite Perl construct, and I
  frequently overuse it. Perl has two logical operators, &amp;&amp;
  ("and") and || ("or"), that <i>short-circuit</i>: when evaluating
  their first operand, they can sometimes deduce enough to avoid
  evaluating their second operand. This is called <i>lazy
  evaluation</i>. When you say X &amp;&amp; Y, Y is only evaluated
  if X is true. Conversely, with X || Y, Y is only evaluated if X
  is false. This isn't specific to Perl. It's just simple logic: X
  &amp;&amp; Y is true only if both X and Y are true; X || Y is
  true if either X or Y is true.</p>

  <p>In the example above, if Tom answers in the affirmative, then
  <tt>($answer eq "y")</tt> is true, so the next expression
  <tt>(print "Ring 911!\n")</tt> is evaluated. Were $answer
  anything but <tt>y</tt>, the <tt>print()</tt> wouldn't be
  evaluated, since whether it's true or false, the entire statement
  must be false because of the first expression. The parentheses
  aren't necessary, but as with all operators it's best to play it
  safe unless you can keep the precedence and associativity of all
  the operators in your head. See the <i>perlop</i> documentation
  for more detail.</p>

  <p>You could as well have said</p>
  <pre>
if ($answer eq "y") { print "Ring 911!\n" }
</pre>

  <p>which would have yielded the same result. Not only is it
  longer but, in some ways, not as straightforward. After all, you
  are perfectly used to using the word "and" for the same purpose
  in natural language. "Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours"
  sounds so much better than "If you scratch my back then I'll
  scratch yours," doesn't it?</p>

  <h3>A motherboard of short circuits</h3>

  <p>Adding an || lets us upgrade from an if/then to an
  if/then/else:</p>
  <pre>
($answer eq "y") &amp;&amp; (print "Ring 911!\n") || (print "Get one!\n");
</pre>

  <p>Remember that Perl evaluates as few expressions as necessary.
  If Tom answers <tt>y</tt>, Perl knows that it is faced with a
  statement of the form "(true <i>and</i> Y) or Z". Provided Y is
  true (which it is, since print() returns 1 on success, and it's
  usually successful), there's no need to evaluate Z since the
  entire statement must be true anyway.</p>

  <p>What if Tom doesn't have a phone? Put yourself in the
  interpreter's shoes:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>I have an "(X and Y) or Z" construction so ...</li>

    <li>... I must evaluate X.</li>

    <li>(<tt>$answer eq "y"</tt>) is false.</li>

    <li>I have a "(false <i>and</i> Y) or Z" construction so
    ...</li>

    <li>I have a "false <i>or</i> Z" construction so...</li>

    <li>... I must evaluate Z.</li>

    <li><tt>(print "Go find one!\n")</tt> is true, but all we care
    about is the side effect: displaying the text to standard
    output.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This is why these operators are so useful. Take the
  ubiquitous</p>
  <pre>
open(FILE,"myfile.log") || die "Can't open file !\n";
</pre>

  <p>You should now realize why this works. If the <tt>open()</tt>
  statement is successful (that is, myfile.log is found and is
  readable), Perl doesn't need to evaluate the <tt>die()</tt>,
  because "true or anything" is true. The last evaluated statement
  is <tt>open()</tt>, the file is opened and away we go. If the
  <tt>open()</tt> fails, that's no longer the case and the script
  dies.</p>

  <p>Some of the most powerful one-liners use these operators. Some
  examples:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>$argument = shift || "default_value";</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This sets <tt>$argument</tt> to the next command-line (or
  subroutine argument) if there is one, and "default_value"
  otherwise. It should be read as <tt>$argument = (shift ||
  "default_value")</tt>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>print "It's a text file" if -f $file &amp;&amp; -T
    _;</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This succeeds if <tt>$file</tt> is a plain file (<tt>-f</tt>)
  and a text file to boot (<tt>-T</tt>). The symbol <tt>_</tt>
  refers to the last filehandle used for a file test or
  <tt>stat()</tt>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>$version &amp;&amp; (print "Version 1.42\n");</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <p>When Perl is invoked with the <tt>-s</tt> option, command-line
  arguments implicitly define variables of the same name. So if our
  program is called with a <tt>-version</tt> argument,
  <tt>$version</tt> will be defined and the <tt>print()</tt>
  statement will execute. If <tt>$version</tt> is undefined, it's
  necessarily false and so the statement fails before the
  <tt>print()</tt> statement is reached.</p>

  <h3>Off With Its Tail - An Aside</h3>

  <p>At the risk of our patient expiring from lack of attention,
  let me talk about the statement that grabs the input:
  <tt>chomp($answer = &lt;STDIN&gt;)</tt>. The <tt>chomp()</tt>
  function lops off the line terminator from the end of the string
  - the \n resulting from Tom hitting the RETURN key.
  <tt>chomp()</tt> returns the number of characters that were
  lopped off (usually 1). So if Tom's answer to the prompt printed
  by our example is:</p>
  <pre>
y&lt;RETURN&gt;
</pre>

  <p>then the incorrect <tt>$answer = chomp(&lt;STDIN&gt;)</tt>
  sets <tt>$answer</tt> to 1 (on UNIX, DOS, and Windows) rather
  than <tt>y</tt>. <tt>chop()</tt>, which you'll still see in Perl
  4 programs, has a similar potential for disaster. <tt>chop()</tt>
  removes the last character whether it's a line terminator or not.
  The proper idiom is <tt>chomp($answer = &lt;STDIN&gt;)</tt> (or
  <tt>chop($answer = &lt;STDIN&gt;)</tt>) which both set
  <tt>$answer</tt> to <tt>y</tt>. If you want to chop more than one
  character, use <tt>substr()</tt>, described later.</p>

  <h3>An Operator By Any Other Name</h3>

  <p>Perl 5 provides the and and or operators which work just like
  <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> and <tt>||</tt>, but with lower precedence
  (and in fact the lowest precedence of all Perl operators). If
  you're one of those people who object to code that looks like
  line noise, go ahead and use them - in fact, their low precedence
  often saves on parentheses:</p>
  <pre>
open FILE, "foo" or die "Can't open file\n";
</pre>

  <p>in contrast to</p>
  <pre>
open (FILE, "foo") || die "Can't open file\n";
</pre>

  <p>But be careful! <tt>$argument = shift || "some_value"</tt>
  does the right thing, but <tt>$argument = shift or
  "some_value"</tt> doesn't. The first is equivalent to
  <tt>$argument = (shift || "some_value")</tt> and the second is
  equivalent to <tt>($argument = shift) or "some_value")</tt>. When
  in doubt, parenthesize.</p>

  <h3>Loop The Loop</h3>

  <p>While Tom is off contacting the ladies and gentlemen of the
  ambulance service, Dick and Harry have established that the
  patient is in arrest (no pulse) and is apnic (not breathing). As
  it is unlikely that our unfortunate victim choked or drowned to
  death, there is only one course of action - CPR. Harry seems to
  knows how to perform rescue breathing, but Dick is looking a bit
  uncertain.</p>
  <pre>
while ($pulse ne "y") { 
    print "Do 3 sets of 5 chest compressions\n"; 
    print "Any sign of a pulse? ";
    chomp($pulse = &lt;STDIN&gt;); 
} 
print "Yippee!\n";
</pre>

  <p>We've set up a <i>while</i> loop with an exit condition ("is
  there a pulse?"). This is a simple construct with one downside -
  if our prostrate friend is on the way to her next incarnation,
  Dick will be left doing chest compressions until his batteries
  run down, and for no good reason. In fact exhaustion is one of
  the four sanctioned reasons for ceasing CPR.**</p>

  <p>The others being:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the patient revives</li>

    <li>the patient dies</li>

    <li>you are relieved by qualified personnel</li>
  </ul>

  <p>What we really want to do is keep going until Dick is tired,
  but to stop as soon as we get a pulse. The usual way of exiting a
  loop is via last:</p>
  <pre>
while ($pulse ne "y") { 
    print "Do 3 sets of 5 chest compressions\n";
    print "Any sign of a pulse? ";
    chomp($pulse = &lt;STDIN&gt;);
   <b> last if $compressions++ &gt; 500;</b>
}
</pre>

  <p>As you can see, <i>last</i> terminates a loop immediately.
  Other loop control statements are <i>next</i> (which skips the
  rest of the block - the statements inside the curly braces) and
  begins the next execution), <i>redo</i> (which restarts the loop
  without testing the conditional) and <i>continue</i> (which
  identifies a block to be executed before the loop is
  re-entered).</p>

  <p>Labels make it possible to move around between loops:</p>
  <pre>
<b>CPR:</b> while ($tired ne "y") {  # outer loop
  print "Do 3 sets of 5 chest compressions\n";
  foreach (1..3) {            # inner loop
    print "Any sign of a pulse? "; 
    chomp($pulse = &lt;STDIN&gt;);
    <b>last CPR</b> if $pulse eq "y";
    print "Are you too tired? "; 
    chomp($tired = &lt;STDIN&gt;); 
  }
}
</pre>

  <h3>One Statement To Rule Them All</h3>

  <p>Finally let's not forget our final</p>
  <pre>
print "Yippee!\n"
</pre>

  <p>If we've exited the loop because poor Dick has collapsed with
  exhaustion next to a corpse, crowing with triumph might be
  considered tactless. But we can discern <i>how</i> we exited the
  loop - if it was because of fatigue, we know that <tt>$tired</tt>
  must be <tt>y</tt>. Let's make our conclusion more
  appropriate:</p>
  <pre>
$message = (($tired eq "y") ? "Too bad\n" : "Yippee!\n");

print $message, "\n";
</pre>

  <p>or even better</p>
  <pre>
print (($tired eq "y") ? "Too bad\n" : "Yippee!\n");
</pre>

  <p>This construct, which we visited briefly last issue, is the
  conditional operator <tt>?:</tt> which is trinary (takes three
  operators) and behaves identically to:</p>
  <pre>
if ($tired eq "y") { 
    print "Too bad\n"; 
} else { 
    print "Yippee!\n"; 
}
</pre>

  <p>A particularly yummy (or maybe perverse) use of this operator
  arises from the fact that you can actually assign to it. Consider
  this code:</p>
  <pre>
$we = $undertaker = 'sad'; 
print "How is the patient? "; 
chomp($patient = &lt;STDIN&gt;); 
($patient eq "ok" ? $we : $morgue) = 'happy';
print "Patient is $patient, we are $we, undertaker is $morgue\n";
</pre>

  <p>where we assign happy to either <tt>$we</tt> or
  <tt>$morgue</tt> depending on whether the patient is okay.
  Running it yields:</p>
  <pre>
How is the patient? ok 
Patient is ok, we are happy, undertaker is sad
</pre>

  <p>or, if we're unlucky:</p>
  <pre>
How is the patient? dead 
Patient is dead, we are sad, undertaker is happy
</pre>

  <h3>Great Value, Low Prices</h3>

  <p>This works because you can assign to <tt>?:</tt> when both the
  second and third arguments are <i>lvalues</i>. The term "lvalue"
  sounds technical, but it's just a fancy word for "Something you
  can assign a value to." The "l" derives from the fact that
  lvalues usually appear on the left hand of an equals sign; the
  opposite of an lvalue is an rvalue. Nearly all variables are
  lvalues, but this is Perl, where the obvious is never enough:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Assignment, under some circumstances, can be thought of as
    an lvalue. When you say <tt>chomp($answer =
    &lt;STDIN&gt;)</tt>, the assignment <tt>$answer =
    &lt;STDIN&gt;</tt> is an lvalue that can be chomped just like a
    variable.</li>

    <li>Various functions are lvaluable. For example, you can use
    <tt>substr()</tt> in an assignment if its first argument is an
    lvalue:</li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
$exclaim = "No way!\n"; 
print $exclaim; 
substr($exclaim,0,2) = "Yes"; 
print $exclaim;
</pre>

  <p>displays</p>
  <pre>
No way! 
Yes way!
</pre>because we assigned <tt>Yes</tt> to the first two characters
of <tt>$exclaim</tt>, which previously held <tt>No</tt>. Note that
<tt>$exclaim</tt> stretched itself to accommodate a longer string
without fuss.

  <h3>Nothing Like A Happy Ending</h3>

  <p>Needless to say, Tom arrived with the cavalry and our patient
  is in safe hands, while everybody celebrates Perl's medicinal
  qualities. Incidentally, <i>never</i> perform CPR on a victim if
  they are breathing, since that means they have a pulse and their
  heart is beating. If you do, you can cause cardiac arrest.</p>

  <p>See http://www.catt.citri.edu.au/emergency/docs/jokes.html for
  the story of the ambulance driver who arrived to find a bystander
  performing CPR on a woman with a broken ankle who yelled "Ow!" at
  each compression.</p>
