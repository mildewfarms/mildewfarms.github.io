  <font size="+2">U</font>nderstanding bindings can be a bear. You
  can wrestle with them time and again and still end up a loser.
  Nevertheless, I hope to provide enough insight in this article
  that with sufficient patience and frequent forays into the
  documentation, bindings will become, if not second nature, at
  least palatable.

  <p>Perl/Tk programs are event driven, meaning they are designed
  to respond, via <i>callbacks</i>, to various stimuli, called
  <i>events</i>. A callback is simply a hunk of code, often a Perl
  subroutine, that is automatically called when an event, like a
  button click, occurs. Perl/Tk defines default behaviors for most
  of its widgets, which you can modify by deleting, adding, or
  supplementing <i>bindings</i>. Simply put, a binding tells your
  Perl/Tk application what to do when something of interest
  happens.</p>

  <p>For instance, I can create and display a Quit button like
  so:</p>
  <pre>
my $b = $mw-&gt;Button(qw/-text Quit -command/ =&gt; \&amp;exit)-&gt;grid;
</pre>

  <p>Clicking mouse button 1 (typically the left button) while the
  cursor is over the button would then invoke the Perl
  <tt>exit()</tt> function. The Perl code is invoked because it's
  associated with the X event &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt; (you don't
  know this yet), and this association of a callback with an X
  event is known as a binding. Bindings are managed with the
  <tt>bind()</tt> and <tt>bindtags()</tt> commands, the topic of
  this column.</p>

  <p>The literal string "&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;" is known as an
  <i>event descriptor</i>, and it has two fields enclosed in angle
  brackets: an event <i>type</i> and an event <i>detail</i>. For
  &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt; to invoke our button's callback, mouse
  button 1 must be released when the cursor is over the widget.
  Here are some of the more common event types:</p>
  <pre>
<tt>Button or ButtonPress</tt>  A mouse button was pressed 
<tt>ButtonRelease</tt>          A mouse button was released 
<tt>Key or KeyPress</tt>         A key was pressed 
<tt>KeyRelease</tt>              A key was released 
<tt>Enter</tt>                   The cursor moved into a widget
<tt>Leave</tt>                   The cursor moved out of a widget
</pre>

  <p>We'll see more of these events shortly, but for now note that
  button and keyboard event types usually require a detail field
  that specifies the particular button or keyboard character of
  interest.</p>

  <h3>Button Class Bindings</h3>

  <p>Like most widgets, a button's default behavior is defined by
  bindings supplied by Perl/Tk; in fact, that's why we didn't have
  to create the Quit button's &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt; binding
  explicitly. These default bindings, called <i>class bindings</i>,
  are shared by all buttons. Using <tt>bind()</tt> it's possible to
  see the default class bindings (or more precisely, the default
  event descriptors), for our button. There are at least six
  different formats of <tt>bind()</tt>, but this one performs the
  simple query we want:</p>
  <pre>
$b-&gt;bind(tag);
</pre>

  <p><i>tag</i> can take one of several forms as we'll see later -
  for now it's a Perl/Tk class name. In the butclass program
  (which, like all the programs mentioned in this article, can be
  found on the TPJ web site), the Perl <tt>ref()</tt> function
  returns the button's class name, so the <tt>bind()</tt> message
  replies with the bindings for the class: Tk::Button.</p>
  <pre>
my $class = ref $b; 
print "Button \$b is an instance of class $class.\n".
    "This class has bindings for these events:\n\n";
print<b> $b-&gt;bind($class)</b>, "\n";
</pre>

  <p>Here's the output:</p>
  <pre>
Button $b is an instance of class Tk::Button.
This class has bindings for these events:       
        
&lt;Key-space&gt;&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;&lt;Button-1&gt;&lt;Leave&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;
</pre>

  <p>which includes the &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt; event descriptor
  that we bound to <tt>exit()</tt> previously.</p>

  <p>But what do these other bindings do? What default behaviors do
  they give their buttons? As usual, the answer can be found in the
  online Perl/Tk documentation. The documentation for every Perl/Tk
  widget contains a section titled "Default Bindings." Here's what
  it tells us about buttons:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A button activates whenever the mouse passes over it and
    deactivates whenever the mouse leaves the button.</li>

    <li>A button's relief is changed to sunken whenever mouse
    button 1 is pressed over the button, and the relief is restored
    to its original value when button 1 is later released.</li>

    <li>If mouse button 1 is pressed over a button and later
    released over the button, the button is invoked. However, if
    the mouse is not over the button when button 1 is released,
    then no invocation occurs.</li>

    <li>When a button has the input focus, the space key causes the
    button to be invoked.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>All these behaviors are elicited by event bindings that
  someone other than you created: #1 by &lt;Enter&gt; and
  &lt;Leave&gt;, #2 by &lt;Button-1&gt;, #3 by
  &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt; and #4 by &lt;Key-space&gt;. (&lt;Key&gt;
  events require a detail field called a keysym to specify the
  keyboard character of interest - in this case a space. More about
  <i>keysyms</i> in a bit.)</p>

  <h3>Button Instance Bindings</h3>

  <p>Suppose you require a specialized button that responds to
  &lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt; and &lt;ButtonRelease-3&gt; events. Since
  those event descriptors are not part of the default class
  bindings, you need to create them yourself with another form of
  the <tt>bind()</tt> command:</p>
  <pre>
$noisy_button-&gt;bind('&lt;event_descriptor&gt;' =&gt; \&amp;callback);
</pre>

  <p>This statement creates a new binding for
  <tt>$noisy_button</tt> only. The <i>butinst</i> program, like
  <i>butclass</i>, displays the new instance bindings using the
  query form of <tt>bind()</tt>, but substitutes the button
  reference for the class name string:</p>
  <pre>
my $noisy_button = $mw-&gt;Button(qw/-text NoisyButton -command/ =&gt;
  sub {print "&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt; callback invoked!\n"})-&gt;grid;

<b>$noisy_button-&gt;bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;' =&gt; [\&amp;beep, 2]);
$noisy_button-&gt;bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-3&gt;' =&gt; [\&amp;beep, 3]);</b>

my $class = ref $noisy_button; 

print "Button \$noisy_button is an instance of class $class.\n".
  "This button has class bindings identical to our button\n".
  "\$b, plus additional instance bindings for these events:\n\n";

print <b>$noisy_button-&gt;bind($noisy_button)</b>, "\n"; 

MainLoop;

sub beep { 
    my($button, $count) = @ARG; 
    while ($count-- &gt; 0) {   
        $button-&gt;bell;                # ring the bell
                $button-&gt;after(250); 
    } 
}
</pre>

  <p>Here is the code's output:</p>
  <pre>
Button $noisy_button is an instance of class Tk::Button.        
This button has class bindings identical to our button  
$b, plus additional instance bindings for these events:

&lt;ButtonRelease-3&gt;&lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;
</pre>

  <p>If you press button 2 you'll hear two bells, and if you press
  button 3 three bells sound, while pressing button 1 prints a line
  of text. Notice how the first <tt>bind()</tt> call glues the
  event descriptor to its associated callback. This callback, a
  reference to an anonymous array, expects a code reference to the
  actual callback as the first element, and any parameters as
  additional elements. <tt>bind()</tt>'s object,
  <tt>$noisy_button</tt>, is implicitly passed to the subroutine as
  the first parameter, as cursory inspection of <tt>beep()</tt>
  will confirm.</p>

  <p><tt>$noisy_button</tt>'s <tt>bind()</tt> query is pretty noisy
  itself. Since <tt>bind()</tt> knows its object we could have
  omitted the argument and just written: print
  $noisy_button-&gt;bind, "\n";</p>

  <h3>Bind Summary</h3>

  <p>There are six ways to call <tt>bind()</tt>:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><tt>$w-&gt;bind</tt>; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
    query descriptors for $w</li>

    <li><tt>$w-&gt;bind</tt>(tag);
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# query descriptors for
    tag</li>

    <li><tt>$w-&gt;bind</tt>(event_descriptor);
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# query callbacks for
    $w</li>

    <li><tt>$w-&gt;bind</tt>(tag, event_descriptor);
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# query callbacks for
    tag</li>

    <li><tt>$w-&gt;bind</tt>(event_descriptor =&gt; callback);
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# set callback for $w</li>

    <li><tt>$w-&gt;bind</tt>(tag, event_descriptor =&gt; callback);
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# set callback for tag</li>
  </ol>

  <p>We've already discussed flavors 1, 2 and 5. Flavors 3 and 4
  aren't particularly interesting or even useful - they return the
  actual callback bound to an event descriptor, which in Perl/Tk is
  an opaque CODE reference (in Tcl/Tk, callbacks are readable
  strings). On the other hand, <tt>bind()</tt> flavor 6 is often
  used to add bindings to an entire widget class. If we wanted to
  make lots of noisy buttons we could use this technique to create
  one class binding instead of many instance bindings:</p>
  <pre>
my $class = ref $b; 
$b-&gt;bind($class, '&lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;' =&gt; [\&amp;beep, 2]);
$b-&gt;bind($class, '&lt;ButtonRelease-3&gt;' =&gt; [\&amp;beep, 2]);
</pre>

  <p>Now all buttons, old and new, demonstrate the noisy
  behavior.</p>

  <h3>Bindtags</h3>

  <p><tt>$noisy_button</tt> reacts to three button release events:
  Release of button 1 (handled by the class binding) and releases
  of buttons 2 or 3 (handled by instance bindings). What do you
  suppose happens if an instance binding for
  &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt; is created? Is it executed in deference
  to the class binding, or is the class binding executed in place
  of the instance binding? Or are <i>both</i> bindings executed,
  and, if so, which binding is executed first?</p>

  <p>Unless you specify otherwise, the class binding is executed
  first, followed by the instance binding, with the order of
  execution dependent on the order of the binding tags associated
  with <tt>$noisy_button</tt>. Whenever a binding is created using
  <tt>bind()</tt> it's always associated with a particular
  identifying tag.</p>

  <p>We've already seen two kinds of binding tags: class names like
  Tk::Button, and widget references like <tt>$b</tt> and
  <tt>$noisy_button</tt>. When an event occurs it's compared
  against all the bindings for every tag that a widget owns, and if
  the event matches one of the tag's list of bindings the
  associated callback is executed.</p>

  <p>By default <tt>$noisy_button</tt>, like most Perl/Tk widgets,
  has four binding tags: the widget's class name, the widget
  instance itself, the widget's closest Toplevel, and the string
  "all", in that order. (A Toplevel widget only has three binding
  tags.) To prove this, program <i>buttags1</i> prints out the
  binding tags for <tt>$noisy_button</tt>, using the
  <tt>bindtags()</tt> method:</p>
  <pre>
my $noisy_button = $mw-&gt;Button(qw/-text NoisyButton/); 
print "Default list of binding tags:\n\n"; 
my(@bindtags) = <b>$noisy_button-&gt;bindtags;</b>

foreach my $tag (@bindtags) { 
    print "binding tag = '$tag'\n"; 
}
</pre>

  <p>And here's the output:</p>
  <pre>
Default list of binding tags:

binding tag = 'Tk::Button' 
binding tag = '.button1'        
binding tag = '.'       
binding tag = 'all'
</pre>

  <p>Ignoring the fact that <tt>$noisy_button</tt> is represented
  by a string (a vestige of Perl/Tk's origins in Tcl), the tag list
  order is: class, instance, toplevel, and "all".(You should never
  refer to a widget using the internal string name. Always use the
  Perl/Tk widget reference.)</p>

  <p>Let's add two features to program <i>butinst</i> - an instance
  binding for &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;, and some additional print
  statements to list the bindings associated with each binding tag.
  Program <i>buttags2</i> follows:</p>
  <pre>
my $noisy_button = 
  $mw-&gt;Button(qw/-text NoisyButton -command/ =&gt;
   sub {
     print "You invoked two &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt; callbacks!\n"
   })
  -&gt;grid; 

$noisy_button-&gt;bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;' =&gt; [\&amp;beep, 1]);
$noisy_button-&gt;bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;' =&gt; [\&amp;beep, 2]);
$noisy_button-&gt;bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-3&gt;' =&gt; [\&amp;beep, 3]);

my $class = ref $noisy_button; 

print "\$noisy_button is an instance of class $class.\n" .
"This button has class bindings identical to our button\n" .
"\$b, plus instance bindings for these events:\n\n"; 

print $noisy_button-&gt;bind, "\n";

print "\n\$noisy_button's tags, and their bindings:\n\n"; 

foreach my $tag ($noisy_button-&gt;bindtags) { 
    print "  bindtag tag '$tag' has these bindings:\n"; 
    print " ", $noisy_button-&gt;bind($tag), "\n"; 
}
</pre>

  <p>Here's the output:</p>
  <pre>
$noisy_button is an instance of class Tk::Button.
This button has class bindings identical to our button $b, 
plus instance bindings for these events:

&lt;ButtonRelease-3&gt;&lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;

$noisy_button's tags, and their bindings:

  bindtag tag 'Tk::Button' has these bindings: 
    &lt;Key-space&gt;&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;&lt;Button-1&gt;&lt;Leave&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; 
  bindtag tag '.button1' has these bindings: 
    &lt;ButtonRelease-3&gt;&lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt; 
  bindtag tag '.' has these bindings: 

  bindtag tag 'all' has these bindings: 
    &lt;Key-F10&gt;&lt;Alt-Key&gt;&lt;Shift-Key-Tab&gt;&lt;Key-Tab&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Now we can see exactly what happens when button 1 is released:
  first the class binding is executed and a line of text is
  printed. Perl/Tk then looks at the next tag in the binding tag
  list, finds a matching binding, and executes its callback, which
  in this case beeps. The search continues through the toplevel and
  "all" bindings, but no other matching event descriptor is
  found.</p>

  <p>Another use of <tt>bindtags()</tt> might be to remove every
  binding tag belonging to a widget. So you want a "view only" text
  widget that displays some fancy instructions? And the widget
  can't interact with the user at all? Check out <i>votext</i>:</p>
  <pre>
my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
my $b = $mw-&gt;Button(qw/-text =&gt; Quit
                   -command/ =&gt; \&amp;exit)-&gt;grid;

my $t =$mw-&gt;Text-&gt;grid; 
$t-&gt;insert(qw/end HelloWorld/); 
$t-&gt;bindtags(undef);
</pre>

  <p>Now <tt>$t</tt> has an empty binding tag list, and thus cannot
  react to any external event whatsoever.</p>

  <p>In addition to listing, adding, and subtracting binding tags,
  <tt>bindtags()</tt> can reorder them too, as we'll see.</p>

  <h3>The <tt>BREAK()</tt> command</h3>

  <p>The <tt>break()</tt> command short-circuits Perl/Tk's search
  through the binding tag list. Suppose we want
  <tt>$noisy_button</tt> to invoke only its instance binding for a
  button 1 release. We can use <tt>bindtags()</tt> to reorder the
  binding tag list so the instance tag is first and the class tag
  is second, and then use <tt>break()</tt> in our callback code to
  exit the binding tag search early. Here's an excerpt from the
  <i>butbreak</i> program:</p>
  <pre>
my $noisy_button = 
  $mw-&gt;Button(qw/-text NoisyButton -command/ =&gt; 
    sub {
     print "You invoked the &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt; callback!\n"})
  -&gt;grid; 

$noisy_button-&gt;bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;' =&gt; [\&amp;beep, 1]);
$noisy_button-&gt;bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;' =&gt; [\&amp;beep, 2]);
$noisy_button-&gt;bind('&lt;ButtonRelease-3&gt;' =&gt; [\&amp;beep, 3]);


<b>my(@tags) = $noisy_button-&gt;bindtags; </b>

<b>$noisy_button-&gt;bindtags([@tags[1, 0, 2, 3]]);</b> # reorder tags

MainLoop;

sub beep { 
    my($button, $count) = @ARG; 
    while ($count-- &gt; 0) { 
        $button-&gt;bell; # ring the bell 
        $button-&gt;after(250); 
    } 
    <b>$button-&gt;break;</b> # short circuit tag search 
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>bindtags()</tt> expects a reference to a list of binding
  tags, and the slightly tricky array slice simply reverses tags 0
  and 1. (Once done, the <tt>-command</tt> callback will never be
  executed.)</p>

  <p>This code merely demonstrates <tt>break()</tt>; it's not the
  proper way to sound the bell on a button 1 release. As this
  picture shows, the button is left in the sunken state:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/tk-fig1.gif" width="186" height="161" border=
    "0" alt="button left in sunken state">
  </div>

  <p>Since we've overridden the class bindings there's no longer
  any code to restore the button's relief after the callback
  executes. Anyway, it's easier to have the <tt>-command</tt>
  option invoke <tt>beep()</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Event Descriptor Syntax</h3>

  <p>A binding definition is slightly more complicated than we've
  seen - it may contain one or more modifiers to further qualify
  the binding. The full specification is
  <i>&lt;modifier[s]-type-detail&gt;</i>.</p>

  <p>"Double" and "Triple" modifiers repeat events, so we often see
  event descriptors like &lt;Double-Button-1&gt;. Common keyboard
  modifiers include Alt, Control, Meta, Mod, and Shift; thus,
  &lt;Control-Key-c&gt; traps a Control-c. Since we've seen only a
  handful of the possible event modifiers and event types, you'll
  want to read the Perl/Tk <i>bind</i> and <i>bindtags</i>
  documentation. Several times.</p>

  <h3>The Event Structure</h3>

  <p>When an event is dispatched, its X11 event structure is
  available to the callback. The event structure contains various
  useful fields, like the screen coordinates of the cursor or
  perhaps a keyboard character. To access components of the
  structure we first need to get a reference to structure itself,
  via <tt>XEvent()</tt>, then using the reference we can read
  whatever event component is relevant to our callback. The
  <i>keysym</i> program samples several event fields:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w 

use English; 
use Tk; 
use strict;

my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
$mw-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; 
       'Type a character to see its keysym.')-&gt;grid;
$mw-&gt;Button(qw/-text Quit -command/ =&gt; \&amp;exit)-&gt;grid;

<b>$mw-&gt;bind('&lt;Key&gt;' =&gt; \&amp;print_keysym);</b>

MainLoop;

sub print_keysym {
   my($widget) = @ARG; 

   # get reference to X11 event structure
   my $e = $widget-&gt;XEvent;
   my($keysym_text, $keysym_decimal) = ($e-&gt;K, $e-&gt;N);
   my($X, $Y, $x, $y) = ($e-&gt;X, $e-&gt;Y, $e-&gt;x, $e-&gt;y);
   print "Character = $keysym_decimal, keysym = $keysym_text".
        " at abs=($X,$Y), rel=($x,$y).\n";

} # end print_keysym
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>bind()</tt> call binds all keypresses to
  <tt>print_keysym()</tt>. Again, this callback is supplied one
  implicit parameter, the widget instance <tt>$mw</tt>, which we
  use to fetch the X11 event structure and read the character's
  keysym and numeric value, as well as the cursor's screen-absolute
  and widget-relative Cartesian coordinates.</p>

  <h3>Canvas Bindings</h3>

  <p>Some final notes - every canvas widget has its own
  <tt>bind()</tt> method that binds callbacks to individual canvas
  items rather than the canvas as a whole. Unsurprisingly, the
  syntax parallels the normal <tt>bind()</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
$canvas-&gt;bind(<i><b>tagorid</b></i>, '&lt;event_descriptor&gt;' =&gt; \&amp;callback);
</pre>

  <p>where <i>tagorid</i> identifies the particular canvas item.
  But to create a binding for the canvas instance we need to use
  this special method:</p>
  <pre>
$canvas-&gt;CanvasBind('&lt;B2-Motion&gt;' =&gt; \&amp;callback);
</pre>

  <p>If <tt>CanvasBind()</tt> isn't available with your version of
  Perl/Tk you can always fall back to the old syntax:</p>
  <pre>
$canvas-&gt;Tk::bind('&lt;B2-Motion&gt;' =&gt; \&amp;callback);
</pre>
