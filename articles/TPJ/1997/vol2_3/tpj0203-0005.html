  <h4><i>Mark-Jason Dominus</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  Many of the objects we deal with in programming are at least
  conceptually infinite - the text of the Associated Press
  newswire, the log output from a web server, or the digits of
  <i>pi</i>. There's a general principle in programming that you
  should model things as simply and as straightforwardly as
  possible, so that if an object is infinite, you should model it
  as being infinite. That means an infinite data structure.

  <p>Of course, you can't have an infinite data structure, can you?
  After all, the computer only has a finite amount of memory. But
  that doesn't matter. We're all mortal and so we, and our
  programs, wouldn't really know an infinite data structure if we
  saw one. All that's really necessary is a data structure that
  behaves as <i>if</i> it were infinite.</p>

  <p>A UNIX pipe is a great example of such an object - think of a
  pipe that happens to be connected to the standard output of the
  yes program. From the manual page:</p>
  <pre>
<b>yes</b> prints the command line arguments, separated
by spaces and followed by a newline, forever
until it is killed.
</pre>

  <p>The output of yes might not be infinite, but it's a credible
  imitation. So is the output <tt>tail -f</tt> when applied to your
  web access log.</p>

  <p>In this article I'll demonstrate how to implement a data
  structure called a <i>stream</i> that behaves as if it were
  infinite. You can keep pulling data out of this data structure,
  and it never runs out. Streams can be filtered, just like UNIX
  data streams can be filtered with <i>grep</i>, and they can be
  transformed and merged, just like UNIX streams. Programming with
  streams is a lot like programming with pipelines in the shell -
  you can construct a simple stream, then transform and filter it
  to get the stream you really want. If you're used to programming
  with pipelines, programming with streams will feel very
  familiar.</p>

  <p>As an example of a problem that's easy to solve with streams,
  we'll look at a classic algorithms problem.</p>

  <h3>Hamming's Problem</h3>

  <p>Hamming wanted an efficient algorithm that generates the list
  of all numbers of the form
  2<sup>i</sup>3<sup>j</sup>5<sup>k</sup> for i, j, k at least 0,
  in ascending order. This list is called the <i>Hamming
  sequence</i>, and begins like this:</p>
  <pre>
1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 12 15 16 18 ...
</pre>

  <p>Let's say we want compute the first three thousand of these.
  This problem was popularized by Edsger Dijkstra.</p>

  <p>There's an obvious brute force technique: Take the first
  number you haven't checked yet, divide it by 2's, 3's, and 5's
  until you can't do that any more, and if you're left with 1, then
  the number should go on the list. Otherwise throw it away and try
  the next number. So:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Is 19 on the list? No, because it's not divisible by 2, 3,
    or 5.</li>

    <li>Is 20 on the list? Yes, because after we divide it by 2, 2,
    and 5, we're left with 1.</li>

    <li>Is 21 on the list? No, because after we divide it by 3,
    we're left with 7, which isn't divisible by 2, 3, or 5.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This obvious technique has one problem: it's mind-bogglingly
  slow. The problem is that most numbers aren't on the list, and
  you waste an immense amount of time discovering that. Although
  the numbers at the beginning of the list are pretty close
  together, the 2,999<sup>th</sup> number in the list is
  278,628,139,008. Even if you had enough time to wait for the
  brute-force algorithm to check all the numbers up to
  278,628,139,008, think how much longer you'd have to wait for it
  to find the next number in the sequence, which is
  278,942,752,080.</p>

  <p>It can be surprisingly difficult to solve this problem
  efficiently with conventional programming techniques. But it
  turns out to be easy with the techniques we'll explore in this
  article.</p>

  <h3>Streams</h3>

  <p>A stream is like the stream that comes out of a garden hose,
  except that what emerges isn't water but data. Whenever you need
  another data item, you pull one out of the stream, which produces
  data on demand forever. The key point is that, unlike a regular
  array which has all the data items stored away somewhere, the
  stream computes the data just as they're needed, at the moment
  your program asks for them. The data never takes any more space
  or time than necessary. You can't have an array of all the odd
  integers, because it would have to be infinitely long and consume
  an infinite amount of memory. But you can have a stream of all
  the odd integers, and pull as many odd integers out of it as you
  need, because it only computes the odd numbers one at a time as
  you ask for them.</p>

  <p>We'll return to Hamming's problem a little later, after we've
  seen streams in more detail.</p>

  <p>Unlike a Perl array, a stream can be modeled with a linked
  list made of <i>nodes</i>. Each node has two parts: The
  <i>head</i>, which contains a data item, and the <i>tail</i>,
  which points to the next node in the stream. In Perl, we'll
  implement this as a hash with two members. If <tt>%node</tt> is
  such a hash, then <tt>$node{h}</tt> will be the head, and
  <tt>$node{t}</tt> the tail. The tail will usually be a reference
  to another such node. A stream will be a linked list of these
  nodes:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/stream1.gif" align="center"
  alt="The stream ('foo', 3, 'bar', ...)" border="0" width="323"
  height="76"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>The stream</b> <tt>('foo',
  3, 'bar', ...)</tt></font></p>

  <p>We'll be able to assign values to our stream as follows:</p>
  <pre>
   $stream-&gt;{h} = 'foo';
   $stream-&gt;{t}{h} = 3;
   $stream-&gt;{t}{t}{h} = 'bar';
   $stream-&gt;{t}{t}{t}{h} = ... ;
</pre>

  <p>We still have the problem of how to create an infinite stream,
  because clearly we can't construct an infinite number of these
  nodes. But here's the secret: a stream node might not have a tail
  - that is, it might not have been computed yet. If a stream
  doesn't have a tail, it has a <i>promise</i> instead. Our stream
  promises to compute the next node if you ever need the data item
  that would be in its head:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/stream2.gif" align="center"
  alt="The 'complete' stream('foo', 3, 'bar', ...)" border="0"
  width="369" height="121"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>The "complete" stream</b>
  <tt>('foo', 3, 'bar', ...)</tt></font></p>

  <p>How can we program a promise? Perl doesn't have promises,
  right? Here's what a promise to compute an expression looks
  like:</p>
  <pre>
        $promise = sub { <i>EXPRESSION</i> };
</pre>

  <p>Perl doesn't compute the value of the expression right away;
  instead, it constructs an anonymous function that computes the
  expression and returns the value when you call it:</p>
  <pre>
        $value = &amp;$promise;           # Evaluate expression
</pre>

  <p>That's just what we want. When we want to promise something
  without actually computing it, we'll just wrap it up in an
  anonymous function, and then when we want to collect on the
  promise, we'll call the function.</p>

  <p>How can we tell when a value is a promise? In our simple
  examples, we'll just look to see if it's a reference to a
  function:</p>
  <pre>
if (ref $something eq CODE) { # It's a promise... }
</pre>

  <p>In a real project, we might do something a little more
  elaborate, like inventing a Promise package with Promise objects,
  but in this article, we'll just stick with plain vanilla CODE
  refs.</p>

  <p>Here's a simple function that constructs a stream node. It
  expects two arguments, a head and a tail. The tail should either
  be either another stream, or a promise to compute one. It then
  takes the head and the tail, puts them into an anonymous hash
  with h and t members, and blesses the hash into the Stream
  package.</p>
  <pre>
package Stream; 
sub new {        
    my ($package, $head, $tail) = @_;    
    bless { h =&gt; $head, t =&gt; $tail } =&gt; $package; 
	}
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>head()</tt> method, which returns the head of a
  stream, is now easy to implement. We simply return the h member
  of the hash:</p>
  <pre>
sub head { $_[0]{h} }
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>tail()</tt> method is a little more complicated
  because it must cope with two possibilities: If the tail of the
  stream is another node, <tt>tail()</tt> can return it right away.
  But if the tail is a promise, then <tt>tail()</tt> must collect
  on the promise and compute the real tail to return.</p>
  <pre>
sub tail {       
    my $tail = $_[0]{t}; 
    if (ref $tail eq CODE) {    
        # Collect on the promise
        $_[0]{t} = &amp;$tail(); 
    } 
    $_[0]{t}; 
}
</pre>

  <p>We also want a notation for an empty stream, or for a stream
  that has run out of data, in case we want finite streams as well
  as infinite ones. If a stream is empty, we'll represent it with a
  node that is missing the usual <tt>h</tt> and <tt>t</tt> members,
  and instead has an e member to show that it's empty. Here's a
  function to construct an empty stream:</p>
  <pre>
sub empty {      
    my $pack = shift;
    $pack = ref($pack) || $pack || Stream;
    bless {e =&gt; 'I am empty.'} =&gt; $pack; 
	}
</pre>

  <p>And here's a function that tells you whether a stream is empty
  or not:</p>
  <pre>
 
sub is_empty { exists $_[0]{e} }
</pre>

  <p>These functions, and all the other functions in this article,
  are available at <a href=
  "http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/Stream.pm" target=
  "resource window">http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/Stream.pm</a>
  and on the web site.</p>

  <p>Let's see an example of how to use this. Here is a function
  that constructs an interesting stream: You give it a reference to
  a function <tt>$f</tt>, and a number <tt>$n</tt>, and it
  constructs the stream of all numbers of the form <i>f(n), f(n+1),
  f(n+2), ...</i></p>
  <pre>
sub tabulate {   
    my $f = shift;       
    my $n = shift;      
    Stream-&gt;new(&amp;$f($n), sub { &amp;tabulate($f, $n+1) }) 
}
</pre>

  <p>How does it work? The first element of the stream is just
  <i>f(n)</i>, which in Perl notation is <tt>&amp;$f($n)</tt>.</p>

  <p>Rather than computing all the rest of the elements of the
  table (there are an infinite number of them, after all) this
  function promises to compute more if we want them. The promise
  is:</p>
  <pre>
sub { &amp;tabulate($f, $n+1) }
</pre>

  <p>When invoked, this calls tabulate() again, to compute all the
  values from <tt>$n+1</tt> on up. Of course, it won't really
  compute all the values from <tt>$n+1</tt> on up; it'll just
  compute <tt>f(n+1)</tt>, and give back a promise to compute
  <tt>f(n+2)</tt> and the rest if they're needed.</p>

  <p>Here's an example:</p>
  <pre>
sub square { $_[0] * ${0] }     
$squares = &amp;tabulate( \&amp;square, 1);
</pre>

  <p>The <i>show</i> utility, supplied in Stream.pm, prints out the
  first few elements of a stream - the first ten, if you don't say
  otherwise. <tt>$squares-&gt;show</tt> prints 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64
  81 100.</p>

  <p>Let's add a little debugging to <tt>tabulate()</tt> so we can
  see better what's going on. This version of <tt>tabulate()</tt>
  is the same as the one above, except that it prints an extra line
  of output just before it calls the function <tt>f()</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
sub tabulate {   
    my $f = shift;       
    my $n = shift; 
    print STDERR "-- Computing f($n)\n"; # For debugging
    Stream-&gt;new(&amp;$f($n),          
                sub { &amp;tabulate($f, $n+1) } 
               ) 
}
<b>$squares = &amp;tabulate( \&amp;square, 1);</b>      
        -- Computing f(1) 
<b>$squares-&gt;show(5);</b> 
        1 -- Computing f(2) 
        4 -- Computing f(3) 
        9 -- Computing f(4) 
        16 -- Computing f(5) 
        25 -- Computing f(6) 
<b>$squares-&gt;show(6);</b>            
        1 4 9 16 25 36 -- Computing f(7) 
<b>$squares-&gt;show(5);</b>            
        1 4 9 16 25 
</pre>

  <p>Something interesting happened with show(6) up there - the
  stream object called the <tt>tabulate()</tt> function only once,
  to compute the square of 7. The other 6 elements had already been
  computed and saved, so it didn't need to compute them again.
  Similarly, the second time we executed <tt>show(5)</tt>, the
  program didn't need to call <tt>tabulate()</tt> at all; it had
  already computed and saved the first five squares, so it just
  printed them out. Saving computed function values in this way is
  called memoization.</p>
  <pre>
Someday, we could come along and try
	$squares-&gt;show(1_000_000_000);
</pre>

  <p>and the stream would compute 999,999,993 squares for us, but
  until we ask for them, it won't. That saves space and time, and
  is called <i>lazy evaluation</i>.</p>

  <p>To solve Hamming's problem, we need only one more tool, called
  <tt>merge()</tt>, a function that takes two streams of numbers in
  ascending order and merges them together into one stream of
  numbers in ascending order, eliminating duplicates. For example,
  merging</p>
  <pre>
    1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 ... 
</pre>

  <p>with</p>
  <pre>
   1 4 9 16 25 36 ... 
</pre>

  <p>yields</p>
  <pre>
   1 3 4 5 7 9 11 13 15 16 17 19 ...
	       
sub merge {      
    my $s1 = shift;      
    my $s2 = shift;      
    return $s2 if $s1-&gt;is_empty;      
    return $s1 if $s2-&gt;is_empty;      
    my $h1 = $s1-&gt;head;       
    my $h2 = $s2-&gt;head;       
    if ($h1 &gt; $h2) {          
       Stream-&gt;new($h2, sub { &amp;merge($s1, $s2-&gt;tail) })        
    } elsif ($h1 &lt; $h2) {     
       Stream-&gt;new($h1, sub { &amp;merge($s1-&gt;tail, $s2) })        
    } else {                            # heads are equal        
       Stream-&gt;new($h1, sub { &amp;merge($s1-&gt;tail, $s2-&gt;tail) })        
    }
}
</pre>

  <h3>Hamming's Problem Revisited</h3>

  <p>Now we have enough tools to solve Hamming's problem.We know
  that the first element of the Hamming sequence is 1. That's easy.
  The rest of the sequence is made up of multiples of 2, multiples
  of 3, and multiples of 5.</p>

  <p>Let's think about the multiples of 2 for a minute. Here's the
  Hamming sequence, with multiples of 2 in bold:</p>
  <pre>
  1  <b>2</b>  3  <b>4</b>  5  <b>6</b>  <b>8</b>  9 <b>10 12</b> 15 <b>16 18</b> ...
</pre>

  <p>Now here's the Hamming sequence again, with every element
  multiplied by 2:</p>
  <pre>
 2  4  6  8 10 12 16 18 20 24 30 32 36 ...
</pre>

  <p>Notice how the second row of numbers contains all of the bold
  numbers from the first row - If a number is even, and it's a
  Hamming number, then it's two times some other Hamming number.
  That means that if we had the Hamming sequence hanging around, we
  could multiply every number in it by 2, and that would give us
  all the even Hamming numbers. We could do the same thing with 3
  and 5 instead of 2. By multiplying the Hamming sequence by 2, by
  3, and by 5, and merging those three sequences together, we'd get
  a sequence that contained all the Hamming numbers that were
  multiples of 2, 3, and 5. That's all of them, except for 1, which
  we could just tack on the front. This is how we'll solve our
  problem.</p>

  <p>Let's build a function that takes a stream and multiplies
  every element in it by a constant:</p>
  <pre>
# Multiply every number in a stream $self 
# by a constant factor $n 
sub scale {     
    my $self = shift;    
    my $n = shift;       
    return &amp;empty if $self-&gt;is_empty;     
    Stream-&gt;new($self-&gt;head * $n,          
                sub { $self-&gt;tail-&gt;scale($n) });  
}       
</pre>

  <p>Here's the solution to the Hamming sequence problem: We use
  <tt>scale()</tt> to scale the Hamming sequence by 2, by 3, and by
  5, merge those three streams together, and finally tack a 1 on
  the front.</p>
  <pre>
# Construct the stream of Hamming's numbers.    
1  sub hamming { 
2      my $href = \1; # Dummy reference 
3      my $hamming = Stream-&gt;new( 
4          1, 
5          sub { &amp;merge($$href-&gt;scale(2), 
6                &amp;merge($$href-&gt;scale(3), 
7                       $$href-&gt;scale(5))) }); 
8      $href = \$hamming; # No longer dummy
9      $hamming; 
10 }
</pre>

  <p>Line 2 creates <tt>$href</tt>, a reference to the scalar
  <tt>1</tt>. We're not interested in the 1, but we need a
  reference around to refer to <tt>$hamming</tt> so that we can
  include it in the calls to <tt>merge()</tt>. After we've defined
  the anonymous subroutine (lines 5-7) which uses <tt>$href</tt>,
  we pull a switcheroo and make <tt>$href</tt> refer to our stream
  <tt>$hamming</tt> (line 8) instead of the irrelevant <tt>1</tt>.
  <tt>hamming()</tt> works, and it's efficient:</p>
  <pre>
<b>&amp;hamming()-&gt;show(20);</b>     
1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 12 15 16 18 20 24 25 30 32 36 40
</pre>

  <p>It only takes a few minutes to compute three thousand Hamming
  numbers, even on my dinky 75 megahertz Pentium.</p>

  <p>We could make this more efficient by fixing up
  <tt>merge()</tt> to merge three streams instead of two, but
  that's left as an exercise for Our Most Assiduous Reader.</p>

  <h3>Dataflow Programming</h3>

  <p>The great thing about streams is that you can treat them as
  sources of data, and you can compute with these sources by
  merging and filtering data streams. This is called a dataflow
  paradigm. If you're a UNIX programmer, you're probably already
  familiar with dataflow, because programming with pipelines in the
  shell is similar.</p>

  <p>Here's an example of a function, <tt>filter()</tt>, that
  accepts one stream as an argument, filters out all the elements
  from it that we don't want, and returns a stream of the elements
  we do want - it does for streams what the UNIX grep program does
  for pipes, or what the Perl <tt>grep()</tt> function does for
  lists.</p>

  <p><tt>filter()</tt>'s second argument is a <tt>predicate()</tt>
  function that is applied to each element of the stream, returning
  true if that element should be left in the stream or false if it
  is to be discarded.</p>
  <pre>
# Return a stream on only the interesting elements of $arg.
sub filter {     
   my $stream = shift;           
   # Second argument is a predicate function that returns
   # true       only when passed an interesting element of $stream. 
   my $predicate = shift; 
   # Look for next interesting element   
   until ($stream-&gt;is_empty || &amp;$predicate($stream-&gt;head)) {
	       $stream = $stream-&gt;tail;      
   }
   # If we ran out of stream, return the empty stream. 
   return &amp;empty if $stream-&gt;is_empty;
   # Construct new stream with the interesting element at 
   # its head and the rest of the stream, appropriately
   # filtered, at its tail.     
   Stream-&gt;new($stream-&gt;head,      
               sub { $stream-&gt;tail-&gt;filter($predicate) }
              ); 
	}
</pre>

  <p>Let's find perfect squares that are multiples of 5:</p>
  <pre>
<b>sub is_multiple_of_5 { $_[0] % 5 == 0 } 
$squares-&gt;filter(\&amp;is_multiple_of_5)-&gt;show(6);</b> 
&#13;               25 100 225 400 625 900
</pre>

  <p>You could do all sorts of clever things with this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If <tt>$input</tt> were a stream whose elements were the
    lines of your input, you could construct
    <tt>$input-&gt;filter(sub {$_[0] =~ /PATTERN/})</tt> to return
    the stream of input lines that matched a certain pattern.</li>

    <li>If <tt>$queens</tt> were a stream that produced
    arrangements of eight queens on a chessboard, you could build a
    filter that checked each arrangement to see if any queens
    attacked one another, and then you'd have a stream of solutions
    to the famous eight-queens problem [See <a href=
    "../vol1_4/tpj0104-0001.html">TPJ #4</a>. -ed]. If you wanted
    only one solution, you could ask for -&gt;show(1), and your
    program would stop as soon as it found a single solution; if
    you wanted all the solutions, you could ask for
    -&gt;show(ALL).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here's a particularly clever application - using filtering to
  compute a stream of prime numbers.</p>
  <pre>
sub prime_filter {       
    my $s = shift;       
    my $h = $s-&gt;head;         
    Stream-&gt;new($h, sub { $s-&gt;tail         
                            -&gt;filter(sub { $_[0] % $h })      
                            -&gt;prime_filter()  
                        }); 
}
</pre>

  <p>To use this, you apply it to the stream of integers starting
  at 2:</p>
  <pre>
   
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...
</pre>

  <p>The first thing it does is to pull the 2 off the front and
  return it. It then filters the tail of the stream and throws away
  all the elements that are divisible by 2. It gets the next
  available element, 3, and returns that, filtering the rest of the
  stream (which was already missing the even numbers) to throw away
  the elements that are divisible by 3. Then it pulls the next
  element, 5, off the front...and so on.</p>

  <p>If we're going to have fun with this, we need to start it off
  with the integers beginning at 2:</p>
  <pre>
<b>$iota2 = &amp;tabulate(sub {$_[0]}, 2);      
$iota2-&gt;show; </b>   
                2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 
<b>$primes = $iota2-&gt;prime_filter    
$primes-&gt;show; </b>  
                2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29
</pre>

  <p>This is the Sieve of Eratosthenes. It's not the best algorithm
  for computing primes, but at 2300 years of age it's the
  oldest.</p>

  <p>There are a very few basic tools that we need to make good use
  of streams. <tt>filter()</tt> was one; it filters uninteresting
  elements out of a stream. Similarly, <tt>transform()</tt> takes
  one stream and turns it into another. If you think of
  <tt>filter()</tt> as a stream version of Perl's <tt>grep()</tt>
  function, you should think of <tt>transform()</tt> as the stream
  version of Perl's <tt>map()</tt> function:</p>
  <pre>
sub transform {          
    my $self = shift;    
    return &amp;empty if $self-&gt;is_empty;
    my $map_function = shift;    
    Stream-&gt;new(&amp;$map_function($self-&gt;head),   
                sub { $self-&gt;tail-&gt;transform($map_function) } 
                 ); 
}
</pre>

  <p>If we'd known about <tt>transform()</tt> when we wrote
  <tt>hamming()</tt> above, we would never have built a separate
  <tt>scale()</tt> function; instead of <tt>$s-&gt;scale(2)</tt> we
  might have written <tt>$s-&gt;transform(sub { $_[0] * 2
  })</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
<b>$squares-&gt;transform(sub { $_[0] * 2 })-&gt;show(5)</b>
    2 8 18 32 50
</pre>

  <p>We'll see a better use of this a little further down.</p>

  <p>Here are a couple of very Perlish streams:</p>
  <pre>
# Stream of key-value pairs in a hash   
sub eachpair {   
    my $hr = shift;      
    my @pair = each %$hr;        
    if (@pair) {         
        Stream-&gt;new([@pair], sub {&amp;eachpair($hr)});           
    } else { # There aren't any more     
        &amp;empty; 
    } 
}
# Stream of input lines from a filehandle       
sub input {      
    my $fh = shift;      
    my $line = &lt;$fh&gt;;      
    if ($line eq '') {   
        &amp;empty;      
    } else {     
        Stream-&gt;new($line, sub {&amp;input($fh)});    
    } 
}
# Get first 3 lines of standard input that contain 'hello' 
@hellos = &amp;input(STDIN)-&gt;filter(sub {$_[0] =~ /hello/i})-&gt;take(3);
</pre>

  <p><tt>iterate()</tt> takes a function and applies it to an
  argument, then applies the function to the result, then the new
  result, and so on:</p>
  <pre>
# compute n, f(n), f(f(n)), f(f(f(n))), ... 
sub iterate {    
    my $f = shift;       
    my $n = shift;
    Stream-&gt;new($n, sub { &amp;iterate($f, &amp;$f($n)) }); 
}               
</pre>

  <p>One use for <tt>iterate()</tt> is to build a stream of
  pseudo-random numbers:</p>
  <pre>
# This is the RNG from the ANSI C standard      
sub next_rand { 
    int(($_[0] * 1103515245 + 12345) / 65536) % 32768 
} 
sub rand {       
    my $seed = shift;    
    &amp;iterate(\&amp;next_rand, &amp;next_rand($seed));       
} 
<b>&amp;rand(1)-&gt;show;</b>   
        16838 14666 10953 11665 7451 26316 27974 27550 31532 5572 
<b>&amp;rand(1)-&gt;show;</b>           
        16838 14666 10953 11665 7451 26316 27974 27550 31532 5572 
<b>&amp;rand(time)-&gt;show</b>         
        28034 22040 18672 28664 13341 15205 10064 17387 18320 32588 
<b>&amp;rand(time)-&gt;show</b>                 
        13922 629 7230 7835 4162 23047 1022 5549 14194 25896 
</pre>

  <p>Some people in comp.lang.perl.misc have pointed out that
  Perl's built-in random number generator doesn't have a good
  interface - it's supposed to be seeded only once, but there's no
  way for two modules written by different authors to agree on
  which one should provide the seed. Also, two or more independent
  modules drawing random numbers from the same source may reduce
  the randomness of the numbers that each of them gets. But with
  random numbers from streams, you can manufacture as many
  independent random number generators as you want, and each part
  of your program can have its own supply, and use it without
  interfering with the random numbers generated by other parts of
  your program. Suppose you want random numbers between 1 and 10
  only. Just use <tt>transform()</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
$rand = &amp;rand(time)-&gt;transform(sub {$_[0] % 10 + 1});
<b>$rand-&gt;show(20);</b> 
     1 5 8 2 8 10 4 7 3 10 3 6 3 8 8 9 7 7 8 8 
</pre>

  <p>Of course, if we <tt>$rand-&gt;show(20)</tt> again, we'll get
  exactly the same numbers. There are an infinite number of random
  numbers in <tt>$rand</tt>, but the first 20 are always the same.
  We can get to some fresh elements with <tt>drop(): $rand =
  $rand-&gt;drop(10)</tt>; This is such a common operation that we
  have a shorthand for it: <tt>$rand-&gt;discard(10)</tt>.</p>

  <p>We can also use <tt>iterate()</tt> to investigate the
  hailstone numbers, which star in a famous unsolved mathematical
  problem called the Collatz conjecture. Start with any integer. If
  it's odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1; if it's even, divide it by
  2. Repeat forever. Depending on where you start, one of three
  things will happen:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>You will eventually fall into the loop 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1,
    ...</li>

    <li>You will eventually fall into some other loop.</li>

    <li>The numbers will never loop; they will increase without
    bound forever.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The unsolved question is: Are there any numbers that don't
  fall into the 4-2-1 loop?</p>
  <pre>
# Next number in hailstone sequence     
sub next_hail {          
    my $n = shift;       
   ($n % 2 == 0) ? $n/2 : 3*$n + 1;     
} 
# Hailstone sequence starting with $n   
sub hailstones {         
    my $n = shift;       
    &amp;iterate(\&amp;next_hail, $n);  
}
&#13;<b>&amp;hailstones(15)-&gt;show(23);</b>               
15 46 23 70 35 106 53 160 80 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 4 2 1 4 2
</pre>

  <p><tt>iterate_chop()</tt> takes the infinite stream produced by
  <tt>iterate()</tt> and chops off the tail before the sequence
  starts to repeat.</p>
  <pre>
<b>&amp;hailstones(15)-&gt;iterate_chop-&gt;show(ALL); </b>
	       15 46 23 70 35 106 53 160 80 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 
</pre>

  <p>By counting the length of the resulting stream, we can see how
  long it took the hailstone sequence to start repeating:</p>
  <pre>
 
<b>print &amp;hailstones(15)-&gt;iterate_chop-&gt;length; </b>          
17
</pre>

  <p>Of course, you need to be careful not to ask for the length of
  an infinite stream!</p>

  <h3>Other Directions</h3>

  <p>You could have solved all of the problems in this article
  without streams, but it was simpler to express them in terms of
  filtering and merging. Streams provide a convenient notation for
  powerful dataflow ideas, and you can apply your experience to
  programming UNIX shell pipelines.</p>

  <p>These techniques of memoization and lazy evaluation can be
  applied to almost any problem or data structure. For example, if
  you were writing a chess program, you could build a lazy move
  tree structure (the first row contains all of your possible
  moves, the second row contains all of your opponent's responses
  to each of those moves, the third row contains your
  counterresponses, and so on) analogous to the lazy lists in this
  article, and expand the tree only when necessary.</p>

  <p>The implementation of streams in Stream.pm is wasteful of
  space and time because it uses an entire two-element hash to
  store each element of the stream, and because finding the nth
  element of a stream requires following a chain of n references. A
  better implementation would cache all the memoized stream
  elements in a single array where they could be accessed
  conveniently. Our Most Assiduous Reader might like to construct
  such an implementation.</p>

  <p>A better programming interface for streams would be to
  <tt>tie()</tt> the Stream package to an array so that the stream
  would seem like a normal Perl array. Unfortunately, as the
  perltie documentation says, "WARNING: Tied arrays are
  incomplete."</p>
