  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  <b>Perl 5.004</b> and a heavily revised <b>FAQ</b> should be out
  by the time you read this.

  <p>In case you haven't heard, there's a new way to grapple with
  input and output in Perl: Graham Barr's <b>IO</b> module set,
  which provides an object-oriented interface for files, pipes, and
  sockets. Graham also has a new version of the <b>libnet</b>
  bundle, which includes the <b>Net::FTP</b>, <b>Net::NNTP</b>, and
  <b>Net::SMTP</b> modules, among others.</p>

  <p>Graham has also released a new version of his <b>MailTools</b>
  distribution, a set of modules that let your Perl programs read,
  create, sort, parse, and manipulate e-mail. Along the same lines,
  Kevin Johnson has released a new version of his
  <b>Mail::Folder</b> module.</p>

  <p>The <b>CDB_File</b> module is Tim Goodwin's interface to Dan
  Bernstein's <i>cdb</i> package. <i>cdb</i> is yet another DBM in
  the spirit of the SDBM, GDBM, and Berkeley DB database managers -
  except that once you create your database, you can't modify it.
  The resulting "constant database" yields savings in both space
  and time. See <a href=
  "http://pobox.com/~djb/cdb.html">http://pobox.com/~djb/cdb.html</a>
  and CDB_File on the CPAN.</p>

  <p>There are three new ways to find modules on the CPAN. The
  first, for browsing, is my <b>CPAN/CPAN.html</b>, which has brief
  descriptions of all the modules, some of them copied liberally
  from this column. The second, for searching, is Norbert
  G&ouml;vert and Ulrich Pfeifer's <b>WAIT</b> system at
  http://ls6-www.informatik.uni-dortmund.de/CPAN.html, which uses
  approximate matching to search module documentation. Finally,
  there's Randy Kobes' <b>CPAN Search Engine</b> at
  http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/search/cpan-search.html, which lets
  you throw boolean queries against CPAN module names, files and
  directories, author names, and the Perl documentation.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0201-0006a.html">The Comprehensive Perl Archive
  Network (CPAN)</a></p>

  <p>Whatever Apple does with NeXT, <b>MacPerl</b> will continue to
  be useful. Matthias Neeracher, who wrote about MacPerl in
  <a href="../vol1_2/tpj0102-0005.html">TPJ #2</a>, distinguished
  between the new part of the Apple OS - the "yellow box", and the
  familiar MacOS part - the "blue box." Since Perl compiles just
  fine on NeXTSTEP, it will run as-is on the yellow box. On the
  blue box, MacPerl will continue to thrive.</p>

  <p>Nick Ing-Simmons has released the beginnings of two promising
  modules: <b>Regexp</b>, an XS wrapper on Perl's internal regex
  code that allows an OO interface (e.g. <tt>$re = new Regexp
  q/\w+/; $v = $re-&gt;match($line);</tt>) and <b>Audio</b>, a
  module for manipulating audio files.</p>

  <p>Jason Smith has released a new version of <b>ptkmines</b>, a
  Perl/Tk version of Minesweeper. Available at
  http://hadron4.phys.rpi.edu/~smithj4/software/ptkmines.</p>

  <p>Johan Vromans has released a new version of his
  <b>Getopt::Long</b> module, which provides sophisticated @ARGV
  processing.</p>

  <p>The GNU Readline library, which supports command-line features
  such as line editing, history management, and word completion has
  been interfaced to Perl via Hiroo Hayashi's
  <b>Term::ReadLine::Gnu</b> module.<br></p>

  <p>Thomas Boutell's shareware <b>PerlMUD</b> (Multi-User Dungeon)
  is available at <a href=
  "http://www.boutell.com/perlmud/">http://www.boutell.com/perlmud/</a>,
  or try it out at http://boutell.com:4197 or by telnetting to
  boutell.com, port 4097.</p>

  <p>Steffen Beyer released a new version of his
  <b>Set::IntegerFast</b> module, which lets you perform efficient
  operations on sets of integers. Steffen also released
  <b>Math::MatrixReal</b>, which provides a slew of matrix
  operations. Then he released version 3.0 of his
  <b>Date::DateCalc</b> module, which offers a wide range of date
  calculations based on an ISO spec for the Gregorian calendar.</p>

  <p>The Multi-Router Traffic Grapher (<b>MRTG</b>) is a tool
  written by Tobias Oetiker that monitors the traffic load on a
  network, generating HTML pages with GIF images. See
  http://www.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg.</p>

  <p><b>PERCEPS</b> is Mark Peskin's documentation generator for
  C++ header files. Let Perl read C++ so you won't have to. Mark's
  program can be found on the web at
  http://friga.mer.utexas.edu/mark/perl/perceps.html.<br></p>

  <p>The <b>Netscape::History</b> module, by Neil Bowers and
  Richard Taylor, parses the history format of Netscape
  browsers.<br></p>

  <p>Michael Fuhr's <b>Net::DNS</b> module is an interface to DNS
  (Domain Name System) resolvers. You perform any type of DNS query
  with the module.</p>

  <p>Also in the Net:: category - <b>Net::Ident</b>, by Jan-Pieter
  Cornet. Net::Ident lets you extract the user name from the other
  end of a TCP/IP connection. (This only works if the remote site
  is running IDENTD.)</p>

  <p>Gurusamy Sarathy has released a new version of
  <b>Data::Dumper</b>, which stringifies data structures. It's
  quite helpful for displaying nested data structures, or writing
  them to disk in a machine-independent format. There's also a new
  release of Gurusamy's <b>Alias</b> module, which lets you create
  short synonyms for variables no matter how many <tt>$, -&gt;</tt>
  and <tt>{}</tt> symbols are in its name. Also check out his
  <b>Tie::IxHash</b>, which lets you pretend your hashes are
  ordered.</p>

  <p>Version 0.4 of the <b>Storable</b> module, by Rapha&euml;l
  Manfredi, has been uploaded to the CPAN. It provides persistency
  for basic data structures (scalars, arrays, hashes, and
  references to them).</p>

  <p>The Unix <i>df</i> command tells you how full your disks are.
  Should your Perl programs need to know, they can use Fabien
  Tassin's <b>File::Df</b> module.<br></p>

  <p>Also in File:: is Carey Evans' <b>File::Sync</b>, which
  implements <tt>fsync()</tt> and <tt>sync()</tt>. These functions
  make sure that your computer and your disk are...in sync.</p>

  <p>Fabrizio Pivari has created <b>Graph Maker</b>, which is a
  simple script that uses the <b>GD</b> module to generate GIFs.
  See the CPAN for CD and
  http://www.agip.it/~pivari/graphmaker.html for Graph Maker.</p>

  <p>If you're into the other sort of graphs - the branch of
  mathematics called graph theory - try out Neil Bowers'
  <b>graph-modules</b> bundle, which contains modules for
  constructing directed graphs.</p>

  <p>The <b>Term::ANSIColor</b> module, by Russ Allbery, will prove
  handy if you're always forgetting the escape codes for ANSI text
  attributes.</p>

  <p>If you have a GIF, or most any other image, and you wished you
  knew how big it was, use Randy Ray's <b>Image::Size</b> module,
  which has a raft of new features in version 2.0.</p>

  <p>Ilya Zakharevich's <b>Text::TeX</b> module enables parsing of
  TeX documents.</p>

  <p>The <b>PerlMenu</b> package, by Steven Kunz, facilitates the
  creation of ASCII menus with William Setzer's <b>Curses</b>
  (character graphics) module.</p>

  <p>Yet another Time module has been released. Patrick Ryan's
  <b>Time::Period</b> provides one function, inPeriod(), which
  determines whether a certain point in time falls within a given
  period.</p>

  <p><b>Randal Schwartz</b>, author of the O'Reilly Perl books,
  father of the JAPH, and triple felon (due to a tragic collision
  between computer law and common sense), has finished the 240
  hours of community service imposed by the State of Oregon. 90
  days jail time and $35,000 restitution remain as part of his
  sentence. See <a href=
  "http://www.lightlink.com/fors/intro.html">http://www.lightlink.com/fors/intro.html</a>
  for details.</p>

  <p>Advance notice: The <b>1st Annual Obfuscated Perl Contest</b>,
  successor to last year's 0th Annual Contest,</p>

  <p>If your module is of general interest to Perl programmers and
  is on the CPAN, let me know! Send a brief description to
  <b>submissions@tpj.com</b> for inclusion in this column.
