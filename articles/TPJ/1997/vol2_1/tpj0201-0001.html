  <font size="+2">I</font>nitially, I groaned inwardly when I saw
  the word 'Patterns' festooning the covers of all of the C++
  magazines. C++ programmers, stuck with a language that
  simultaneously demands rigor and encourages Byzantine diversity,
  are always coming up with overengineered High Concepts and
  Methodologies that rationalize their burden. But it turns out
  that the 'Patterns' idea, begun in the world of architecture and
  spread into the land of computers, is a very powerful way of
  adding discipline and science to the art of programming.

  <p>Programs and buildings are very similar. Both are structural
  creations composed of smaller elements working in concert to
  achieve a goal; both are produced in tiny and magnificent scales.
  Both have spectacular failure modes (the nuclear missile misses
  its target, the skyscraper collapses into rubble), and both have
  more subtle failure modes (the program becomes unmaintainable,
  the condos become a slum).</p>

  <p>If you think of architecture as a language, then the
  attention-getting failure modes are usually errors in the syntax
  of that language. Perhaps the programmer put a comma in for a
  period, or the builders misjudged the strength of their concrete
  beams. The program or building failed not because the overall
  design was broken, but because of a catastrophic failure in a
  single element. The story expressed by the structure has an error
  undermining the whole. The occurrence of this kind of mistake can
  be minimized by patient, reasoned engineering and lots of CPU
  time.</p>

  <p>Subtle failure modes are much more intriguing, because they're
  largely immune to presently available math. We can know that a
  certain wall will hold up a particular load, but once we make it
  part of a complex system, we become less sure of ourselves. What
  if the floor underneath undergoes torsion in an earthquake? What
  if water fills the room, drastically altering the pressure on all
  surfaces? In general, architects and programmers have sorted out
  these problems with their gut feelings. Unfortunately, the gut
  turns out to be highly illogical, based as much on ego and
  emotion as calculating intellect. As we architect
  ever-more-critical systems, it becomes increasingly important to
  move the architecture process from a pure art form to a science
  based on engineering principles.</p>

  <p>The first thing a science needs is a language expressing the
  concepts of that science. This is the concept of 'patterns'-an
  explicitly shared language that codifies the basis of our
  understanding of architecture. By forming a unified, coherent
  language with which to express our structures, we gain the
  ability to think rationally about them instead of wishfully
  attributing the process to art.</p>

  <p>For another example, in object-oriented programming, a
  particularly important pattern is "Loose Coupling," the design
  goal of ensuring that objects rely upon each other as little as
  possible. The rationale of Loose Coupling is that if the
  program's objects must ever be changed or extended or put to
  other uses, it would be burdensome and inelegant to have to
  change any other objects. Worse, in a tightly coupled system, you
  could suffer domino effects, in which change to one object
  eventually mandates change to all objects.</p>

  <p>In architecting homes, a similar, if inverted, pattern
  applies; humans feel more comfortable in the company of other
  humans, so the building plan must be designed to accommodate
  interactions. The ceiling, for instance, might be lower in
  intimate locations than in passageways; the living room might be
  designed to put the occupants at ease. Homes without a tight
  coupling between their spaces and their occupants tend to be
  distant and unpleasant, like high school cafeterias.</p>

  <p>These concepts are undoubtedly simple; the importance of
  patterns is not that they are individually amazing or insightful,
  but rather that by setting one down and giving it a name, you
  gain the ability to mull it over and communicate it to others in
  a simple and direct way. If everyone working on a program
  completely understands what the words "loose coupling" mean, then
  discussions of an object's role can take place entirely in the
  directness of a pattern language rather than in loose metaphor.
  This is a big win.</p>

  <p>However, in order to be able to use them effectively, it's
  important to understand that patterns are not dogma. Good pattern
  languages are like English, or Perl-there's more than one way to
  express a given thought; and although pattern languages are meant
  to establish rigor, one eye must also be kept on reality. If you
  blindly obey every principle of a pattern language, then your
  words will be awkward, your building will be soulless, and your
  program will be unimaginative. Each of these consequences can
  kill just as surely as designing-by-gut; you have to strike a
  balance between artistry and science.</p>

  <p>Pattern languages are excellent for communicating design
  thoughts to others in an abbreviated, precise way, but much of
  their strength emerges from the fact that humans can internally
  use language elements to apprehend complex concepts. This is
  perhaps the most important aspect of the relationship between
  pattern languages and Perl. Perl is so permissive that it
  provides few hints about which approach is optimal, but at the
  same time, it's rich enough that it invites the programmer to get
  into extremely complicated situations. As a result, the benefits
  of using a pattern language to establish a basic way of thinking
  are many.</p>

  <p>Consider, as an example, a project I've been hacking on-simple
  handwriting recognition using a graphics tablet in Perl. Pen
  locations stream into the serial port whenever the pen touches
  the tablet. I would like to be able to write characters on the
  tablet and have them directed into a window on my screen.</p>

  <p>It's especially easy in Perl to get bogged down in the
  solution to this problem. Machine vision, neural techniques,
  fuzzy logic, and Hough's transform all loom on the horizon,
  beckoning the unwitting programmer to her doom. And it's awfully
  easy to start writing ten-page regular expressions.</p>

  <p>But if approached logically, by examining all of the patterns
  in the programmer's toolbox for suitability, a clear and
  comprehensible solution falls out.</p>

  <p>The approach I took was to use the "Decompose and Parse
  Elements" pattern. In this pattern, often used by compilers, I
  broke down all of the elements of the writing action into
  discrete tokens. So, the action of writing the letter 'A' becomes
  the following sequence of seven tokens:</p>
  <pre>

token 1: PEN-NOT-ON-PAPER
token 2: PEN-DOWN
token 3: PEN-MOVING-UP AND PEN-
                        MOVING-RIGHT 
token 4: PEN-LOCAL-CUSP
token 5: PEN-MOVING-DOWN AND PEN-
                        MOVING-RIGHT 
token 6: PEN-UP
token 7: PEN-NOT-ON-PAPER

</pre>

  <p>These tokens can then be made building blocks of a manageable
  regular expression. The idea that a stream of data can be broken
  down into a more manageable set of chunks of data and then handed
  to a parser is a useful pattern, and happens to be an extremely
  successful strategy in Perl.</p>

  <p>To make the process of parsing easier on the eyes, I redefined
  the name of the tokens (e.g., <tt>'PEN-MOVING-DOWN'</tt>) to be
  individual alphabetic characters. You could say that it became
  "bytecode." Hence, <tt>'PEN-LOCAL-CUSP'</tt>, which means that
  the pen made an abrupt change of direction, was changed to 'C'.
  From this, the token stream for the letter A became</p>
  <pre>

token 1: 0     # PEN-NOT-ON-PAPER 

token 2: D     # PEN-DOWN 

token 3: u &amp; r # PEN-MOVING-UP 
                AND PEN-MOVING-RIGHT 

token 4: C     # PEN-LOCAL-CUSP 

token 5: d &amp; r # PEN-MOVING-DOWN
                AND PEN-MOVING-RIGHT 

token 6: U     # PEN-UP 

token 7: 0

</pre>

  <p>...which is starting to look like a regular expression. In
  fact, to detect an 'A' symbol written on the tablet, I say:</p>
  <pre>

$tokenstream =~ /D-ur-C-dr-U/;

# PENDOWN, RIGHT&amp;AMP;UP, CUSP, RIGHT&amp;AMP;DOWN,PENUP

</pre>

  <p>Anything delimited by minus signs happens simultaneously, i.e.
  -ur- means up and right at the same time. ur would mean an up
  stroke followed by a right stroke. For performance reasons, the
  actual parser is a little more complicated than what's described
  above, but the program can still be described as following the
  pattern. When thinking about the rest of the program, I can
  mentally close the door on that part of the code, knowing that it
  has an assigned job. Further, I can communicate the concept to
  others with a simple phrase, and the code itself, imbued with the
  purpose of 'Decomposing and Parsing Elements', becomes
  clearer.</p>

  <p>The one shortcoming of the pattern language paradigm is that,
  apart from this pleasantly inexpensive magazine, there are few
  sources of knowledge about pattern languages that aren't
  stratospheric in price. The seminal texts, <i>Building in the
  Timeless Way</i> and <i>Pattern Language</i> (Alexander et al.)
  are must-reads for anyone interested in the philosophy of
  structure. Several computer-science-specific books have emerged
  recently, of which <i>Design Patterns</i> (Vlissides et al.)
  appears to be the strongest. Most of the computer science books
  tackle the hard problem first, namely Object Oriented Programming
  Methodologies, but are readable and entertaining nonetheless.</p>

  <p>The naming and categorization of idioms is a natural fit with
  Perl. I strongly recommend that programmers interested in
  enhancing their structural understanding explore the subject both
  academically and internally.</p>
