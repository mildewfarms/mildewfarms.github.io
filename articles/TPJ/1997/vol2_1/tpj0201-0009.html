  <font size="+2">P</font>erhaps you've received a flyer in the
  mail promising great riches for only a small investment of time
  and money in futures. Or maybe you've heard a radio commercial
  for heating oil options or seen a late-night infomercial on the
  subject. The question I set out to answer three years ago: Just
  how realistic are these expectations? Can anyone literally start
  with a few thousand dollars and build a large fortune as a
  trader? Well, I don't claim to have found all the answers, but
  I've certainly enjoyed the search. Perl has been an important
  tool, and I'd like to share some of the scripts I've used along
  the way.

  <p>The futures markets operate similarly to the New York Stock
  Exchange. In most cases, there is a trading floor, usually called
  a pit, where traders buy and sell among themselves. Futures
  markets differ from stock markets in some important ways.</p>

  <p>First, what is traded is not stocks - shares in a company -
  but <i>futures contracts</i>. These are contracts to deliver a
  fixed amount of a commodity (or foreign currency, bonds, or a
  cash multiple of some financial index) at a particular time. For
  example, a September 1997 wheat contract on the Chicago Board of
  Trade is a promise to deliver 5000 bushels of wheat to a Chicago
  warehouse in September 1997. The price is fixed when the contract
  is traded.</p>

  <p>Futures contracts are <i>derivative</i> securities; their
  price depends on the price of something else called the
  <i>underlying</i>. For example, a wheat contract price depends on
  the price of wheat, and a Deutschemark contract depends on the
  dollar-to-Deutschemark exchange rate. Everything else about a
  futures contract is standardized: the amount of the underlying to
  be delivered, the place of delivery, and the month in which
  delivery is to take place.</p>

  <p>At any given time, a number of different delivery months for
  the same commodity will be available. The contract with the most
  immediate delivery is called the front month. For a number of
  reasons, speculators trade mostly in the <i>front month</i>
  contract and switch to the next available contract some time
  before the delivery deadline. This switching process is known as
  <i>rollover</i>, and accounting for it is an important part of
  futures trading system analysis.</p>

  <p>The second difference between futures and stocks is the
  symmetry of expectations. When you buy a stock, you expect it to
  rise in price, often called going long or being <i>bullish</i>.
  Going short, or being <i>bearish</i>, is a complicated process
  involving borrowing shares of the stock from another investor,
  paying any dividends accrued to that investor and then buying the
  stock back later at a (hopefully) lower price. But with futures,
  trading is symmetric - it is as easy to go short as it is to go
  long and there are no dividends to worry about. Owning shares of
  stock often gives the owner a proportional vote in some of the
  company's business decisions, but holding a futures contract only
  gives one the obligation to accept or make delivery at the
  specified date, place and price.</p>

  <p>Third, when you buy stock on <i>margin</i>, you must put up at
  least half of the stock price in cash, and the rest of the money
  is borrowed. You pay interest on this loan. Margin on futures
  contracts is different. You must deposit a certain percentage of
  the contract value as a good faith deposit, but in many cases you
  actually earn interest on this money. The minimum required margin
  varies with the market and the type of account. Determining how
  much margin to use over the required minimum is an important part
  of the trading strategy, but I won't talk about that here.</p>

  <p>Who are the participants in the futures markets? First of all,
  there are the <i>hedgers</i>. These are the farmers, mining
  companies, bakeries, textile mills, banks, manufacturers and so
  on that produce or consume commodities, operate in nations with
  different currencies or hold large portfolios of stocks and
  bonds. What separates hedgers from the other participants is that
  futures markets are not their primary business. Hedgers use
  futures contracts to lower their business risk due to changes in
  prices of commodities, interest rates, foreign exchange rates or
  portfolio values. For example, suppose a farmer knows he will
  harvest 5000 bushels of wheat in September. He has no way of
  knowing what the price of wheat will be in September; if it is
  too low he will not recover his investment in time, fertilizer,
  seed, and labor. Suppose, though, that it is now March and a
  contract for 5000 bushels of September wheat is trading at $5.
  The farmer can hedge by going short one of these contracts. He
  has promised to deliver his wheat in September for $5 a bushel
  and someone unknown has promised to accept it at that price. Now
  suppose there is a surplus of wheat come September; wheat is
  selling for $4 a bushel. Our farmer has locked in a price of
  $5!</p>

  <p>Similarly, a flour mill might know it will need 5000 bushels
  of wheat in September. Like the farmer, the flour mill has no way
  of knowing what the price of wheat will be in September. The
  flour mill can hedge by going long one September wheat contract,
  locking in the $5 per bushel cost. If there is a shortage of
  wheat come September and wheat is $6 a bushel, the flour mill
  accepts delivery and gets the wheat for $5 a bushel!</p>

  <p>The other major class of futures markets participants is
  <i>speculators</i>, or <i>traders</i>. Rather than use the
  futures markets to lower risk, they actually bear the risk the
  hedgers wish to avoid. In the above example, suppose a speculator
  believed in March that the weather during the growing season was
  going to be hot and dry, thus causing a shortage of wheat. He
  would go long - buy a contract at $5. Now suppose the weather is
  indeed hot and dry. Come mid-August, the September wheat contract
  is trading at $6 a bushel. The speculator doesn't want the 5000
  bushels of wheat, so he will sell the contract and pocket the
  $5000 profit! If he still believes wheat is going to increase in
  price, he will roll over his position. After selling the
  September contract, he will buy a December contract. Rollover is
  an important fact of futures trading and I'll describe it in more
  detail later.</p>

  <p>Conversely, if our speculator expected a bumper crop of wheat
  and lower prices come September, he would go short in March and
  plan to buy back the contract at a lower price in mid-August. In
  short, unlike the hedgers - the farmer and the flour mill - the
  speculator has no inherent preference for long or short
  positions. He simply picks whichever he believes will be
  profitable.</p>

  <p>It should be noted at this point that the floor traders who
  buy and sell the contracts in the pit are speculators: they go
  long expecting to sell a contract to another floor trader at a
  higher price and they go short expecting to buy a contract back
  from another floor trader at a lower price. Like other
  speculators and unlike hedgers, futures trading is their primary
  business.</p>

  <p>The really important participants in the futures markets are
  the hedgers and speculators. The rest of the participants in the
  futures markets are auxiliary: brokers, clearing houses,
  newsletter writers, trading seminar teachers, government
  regulators and so on. For more information on the futures
  markets, the best reference is Teweles; beginners might want to
  browse the Mid-America Commodity Exchange at

  <h3>Requirements for Successful Trading</h3>

  <p>There are three main requirements for successful trading (cf.
  both Schwager references).</p>

  <ol>
    <li>You need a mathematical edge - some kind of long/short
    decision system based on real-world information that on the
    average wins more money than it loses.</li>

    <li>You need a certain minimum amount of capital to trade the
    system, and you need a money management plan for optimum use of
    that capital. The mathematics of such plans is the most
    interesting part of trading (at least to me) and there are a
    number of books on the subject. The works of Ralph Vince are a
    good place to start. The plan depends critically on the
    statistical properties of the trading system and on the
    financial status of the trader.</li>

    <li>You need the <i>psychological discipline</i> to stick with
    the system and with the plan, given that the mathematical
    analysis that went into the system and plan are valid. Many
    traders believe that psychological factors are what separates
    the great traders from the adequate ones and the losers, so
    much so that they invest great amounts of time on hypnosis,
    neuro-linguistic programming and other techniques in attempts
    to become better traders. While I don't deny that there are
    great traders who operate purely by intuition, and that
    attitudes and discipline are important for success in many
    endeavors, the fact remains that hypnotizing a trader to
    exactly follow a losing system will not turn the trader into a
    winner.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Within these constraints, there are a wide variety of possible
  approaches to trading, ranging from sophisticated econometric
  analyses of hundreds of variables to simply looking at chart
  patterns and using your intuition to guess the future direction
  of prices. For the remainder of this article, I'm going to focus
  exclusively on mechanical trading systems based on past prices,
  known as technical trading systems.</p>

  <h3>Mechanical Trading Systems</h3><br>

  <table border="0" align="center">

      <td align="center"><font size="1"><b>Weekly Japanese Yen
      Exchange Rate</b></font></td>

      <td><a href="images/yen-graph.gif"><img src=

      "Weekly Japanese Yen Exchange Rate" border="0"></a></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Mechanical trading systems are sets of rules for when to go
  long, when to go short and when to remain neutral. As I noted
  above, there is a great wealth of information available on supply
  and demand of commodities, economic data affecting interest
  rates, stock prices, and foreign exchange rates. There are even
  records of the futures positions of large-volume hedgers and
  speculators. Systems based on such information are generally
  called <i>fundamental</i> systems. See chapter 6 of Teweles for a
  good overview.</p>

  <p>There is also the information generated by the hedgers and
  speculators themselves - the prices of the futures contracts from
  trade to trade, minute to minute, day to day and so on. Systems
  based on these price movements alone are called technical
  systems. (Chapter 7 in Teweles.)</p>

  <p>Technical systems can be further subdivided into a number of
  classes. I won't go into much detail; the best textbook on the
  subject is LeBeau and Lucas. The most popular class of systems
  uses <i>daily</i> data samples and is known as <i>trend
  following</i>. Most of these systems are simple enough that they
  can be operated in a few minutes a day with pencil and paper,
  although computers make things much easier.</p>

  <p>How do trend-following systems work? Take a look at the figure
  on the previous page, a weekly chart of Japanese Yen exchange
  rates from January 1989 to December 1995. There are periods of
  strong up or down trends, such as 921231 to 930702 and 950630 to
  951231.(Please note that throughout this article, I use the date
  convention most common among traders. A date is a six-digit
  number of the form <tt>yymmdd</tt>. For example, January 5, 1996
  is <tt>960105</tt>. Clearly there is a Year 2000 issue with this
  convention, so be warned! ) And there are periods of more or less
  sideways movement, called a trading range, such as
  <tt>940701</tt> to <tt>941230</tt>. It's easy to see that if you
  went long on <tt>921231</tt> and closed out the position on
  <tt>930702</tt>, you would have made money. In fact, you would
  have made about $15,000 per contract.</p>

  <p>The problem, of course, is that you cannot trade the past! On
  <tt>921231</tt>, the long uptrend had not yet happened. So the
  way a trend-following system works is this: it waits for a
  certain length of time, say 20 days, into what looks like an up
  or down trend, then takes a position in the direction of the
  trend. If the trend continues, you hold the position until it
  reverses, at which time you close out the position, usually with
  a profit. If the trend does not continue, you will lose money. A
  good trend-following system will minimize the size of these
  losses, known as whipsaws.</p>

  <p>Over a long period of time, the winning trades from
  trend-following should add up to more money than the losing
  trades. A system is said to have a winning edge if the average
  trade is a winning trade, regardless of the other statistical
  properties of the distribution of trade profits and losses. The
  other properties are important for money and portfolio
  management; see Vince's book for details.</p>

  <h3>The Donchian N-day Channel System</h3>

  <p>In 1990, Lukac, Brorsen and Irwin analyzed twelve technical
  trading systems in common use by traders. Of the twelve, only
  four turned out to be profitable. Of these four, the best on a
  risk-adjusted basis was a rule credited to Richard Donchian
  called the <i>N-day channel</i> rule.</p>

  <p>The original Donchian rule was as follows: go long if the
  price rises above the highest price of the last four weeks, and
  go short if the price falls below the low of the last four weeks.
  This has evolved into what is called a <i>stop and reverse</i>
  system: once you are holding long, you close the long and open a
  short position on a stop order whenever the price falls below the
  four week low. You hold this short position until the price rises
  above the four-week high; then you close the short and open a new
  long. This system is always in the market, either long or short.
  If the market enters a sideways period, hold the current long or
  short position as long as the stop isn't triggered.</p>

  <p>The constant four weeks in the original Donchian rule has
  evolved into a variable: the number of days in the channel,
  called N. The high of the past N days is called the <i>buy
  stop</i> and the low of the past N days is called the <i>sell
  stop</i>. The actual rule tested in my script is:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>If the price opens above the buy stop</b>, close any
    open short position and open a long position. Both trades are
    assumed to have taken place at the day's opening price.</li>

    <li><b>If the price opens below the sell stop</b>, close any
    open long position and open a short position. Both trades are
    assumed to have taken place at the day's opening price.</li>

    <li><b>If the price touches the buy stop</b> during the day,
    close any open short position and open a long position. Both
    trades are assumed to have taken place at the buy stop.</li>

    <li><b>If the price touches the sell stop</b> during the day,
    close any open long position and open a short position. Both
    trades are assumed to have taken place at the sell stop.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Rollover days are handled specially. If there is a
  <i>signal</i> - a change from long to short or short to long -
  the old position will be closed in the old front contract and the
  new one opened in the new front contract. If there is no signal,
  the position in the old front contract will be closed and a
  position in the same direction will be opened in the new front
  contract. This trade is assumed to take place at the rollover
  day's closing price.</p>

  <h3>'channel.pl' - a Script to Simulate the Donchian N-day
  Channel</h3>

  <p>There are several possible uses for Perl in futures trading.
  You could use it to acquire free contract price data from
  <a href="http://www.cbot.com">http://www.cbot.com</a> and
  structure it as a database. Or you could implement a trading
  system. I've done both of these, but what I'm using Perl for in
  this case is evaluating the Donchian system.</p>

  <p>Now that we've chosen a trading system, how do we test it? The
  standard procedure is to select some futures contracts, procure
  some data for the past prices of these contracts and simulate the
  trading system on the data for various values of the system
  parameters. For this test, I selected the period from
  <tt>890101</tt> to <tt>951231</tt> and N for 20, 40, 60 and 80
  days. The contracts I selected for testing were the following
  ten:</p>
  <pre>

Contract                      Code



Corn                          c_

Deutschemark                  dm

Eurodollars                   ed

Five-year Treasury Notes      fb

COMEX gold                    gc

Japanese Yen                  jy

Soybeans                      s_

COMEX silver                  si

Ten-year Treasury Notes       ty

30-year Treasury Bonds        us

</pre>

  <p>On the right is Perl code that simulates the Donchian system
  for one value of N and one contract data file. The code is fairly
  straightforward once you know what the inputs and outputs
  are.</p>

  <p>The input data files come from the Pinnacle Data Corporation,
  and the format is known as <i>continuous linked contract</i>.
  Each record has eight fields. The first field is this date in the
  above-described format. The second field is the opening price of
  the day, the third field the day's high, the fourth field the
  day's low and the fifth field the closing price of the day. The
  last three fields give volume and open interest data; they aren't
  used in this system.</p>

  <p>The actual file is composed of sequential records for each day
  of trading. Rollover days are preceded by a special record: the
  open price is actually the closing price of the next day's old
  front contract and the close price is the closing price of the
  next day's new front contract. The rest of the fields in this
  flag record are zero. The records before this rollover flag are
  data for the old front contract and the records after the flag
  record are data for the new front contract.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0201-0009a.html" target=
  "resource window"><i>channel.pl</i></a></p>

  <p>Most trading system testers work with <i>adjusted</i> files,
  which are produced by software supplied with the data files. The
  adjustment program reads the raw data file as described above and
  adds offsets to the data so there are no gaps on rollover days.
  The graph shown earlier was produced this way. This is usually
  acceptable when comparing trading systems, since all trading
  systems are using the same data. But for my purpose - evaluating
  a specific trading system - using adjusted contracts is
  misleading, because in the real world the rollover trades must be
  made whether they are winners or losers.</p>

  <p>So the basic flow of the script is as follows: each record of
  the file is read and the trading system's actions on that day are
  simulated. When a rollover flag record is encountered, the script
  computes the offset and sets a flag, warning that the next day is
  a rollover day. On the rollover day, the buffers of past data
  (high and low prices that define the channel) are adjusted by the
  offset. This converts the saved prices from the old front
  contract to the new front contract. As noted above, if no signal
  occurs on a rollover day, a rollover trade is made at the close.
  Otherwise, rollover day processing is the same as a regular
  day.</p>

  <p>The output of the script is a <i>trade</i> log. Each line of
  the log represents a closed trade. The first field is the
  contract code, the second field is the channel length in days,
  and the third field is "1" for a long position or "-1" for a
  short position. The fourth and fifth fields are the opening date
  and price. Field six is the closing date, and field seven is the
  price at which it closed. The eighth and final field is the
  number of days the position was held; it's easier to have the
  script count them than to do the calendar arithmetic.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0201-0009b.html"><i>How much money do we need to
  invest</i></a></p>

  <h3>Basic Statistics of Trading Systems</h3>

  <p>Now that we have trade logs, we need to perform some
  statistical analysis. The fundamental question we need to answer
  is "Does the system have a positive expectation?" That is, is the
  average trade over all contracts and all channel lengths a winner
  or a loser? Other interesting things we might ask are whether
  some channel lengths are better than others over all contracts
  and for individual contracts. The script that does this analysis
  is called <i>stats.pl</i>, which you can find on the TPJ web site
  (http://tpj.com).</p>

  <p><i>stats.pl</i> simply reads through all the trade logs and
  computes the profit or loss for each trade, accumulating counts,
  sums and sums of squares for these figures. The statistics are
  accumulated over all trades, over all contracts for each channel
  length, over all channel lengths for each contract and for each
  channel length/contract combination. As you'll see from the code,
  hashes make this easy!</p>

  <p>Once the trade logs are all read in, the statistics are
  computed and printed. We're mostly interested in the average
  trade, but the standard deviation and standard error of the mean
  are also meaningful.</p>

  <p>The only tricky part to this script is calculating the profit
  or loss for each trade. We know the price difference and whether
  the trade was long or short. This is translated to dollars by
  multiplying by a dollar factor from a table in the script. For
  example, for corn, the dollar factor is 50. So a long trade
  opened at 264.75 and closed at 273.25 would make a profit of $425
  and a short trade at the same prices would lose $425.</p>

  <p>There are two more factors we need to take into account.
  First, we can't trade for free - we must pay a commission for
  each trade. Second, there is <i>slippage</i> - a trade does not
  always take place at exactly the price we simulated. The standard
  practice in trading system simulation is to deduct a constant
  amount from each trade for combined commissions and slippage; I
  used $100.</p>

  <p>On the TPJ web site, you'll also find stats.out, the output of
  stats.pl. As we had hoped, our trading system is profitable, with
  an average profit of $134.03 per trade over the 2221 trades made
  in the seven year test period. The total profit was $297,691.</p>

  <p>Looking at the results for the various channel lengths over
  all contracts, all four tested lengths were profitable, with 80
  days being the best. For the individual contracts across all
  channel lengths, five were profitable and five - corn,
  Deutschemarks, gold, soybeans and silver - were not. This doesn't
  mean that these contracts won't be profitable in the future -
  only that for the test period, the money lost in the trading
  ranges exceeded the profits from the trends. There is one more
  computation we need to make. We know how much profit we made -
  $297,691, but how much money would we have needed to invest
  initially? This is a very complicated question, but a simple way
  to approach it is to pick a conservative margin percentage, say
  10%. In other words, we deposit 10% of the total contract value
  as margin. The table at the bottom of shows this computation.</p>

  <p>The initial price is the price on the first day of trading for
  the test period, <tt>890103</tt>. Since we are trading all four
  channel lengths, the required capital is four times the required
  capital for a single contract. The grand total is $320,696. Given
  the total profit of $297,691, the total return over the seven
  year test period is 92.8%, which works out to 9.9% per year.</p>

  <p>So, in terms of the initial goal of building a large fortune
  from a few thousand dollars, this system does not appear to be
  suitable. However, it is profitable. Moreover, as I noted
  earlier, in many cases you would earn interest on your margin
  investment; typically this would add another 3% or 4% to the
  annual return. When you consider the trivial amount of effort
  required to trade this system, this is a fairly encouraging
  result. While it is clearly not suitable for beginners, it
  appears to be a valid basis for a professional trading
  enterprise.</p>
