  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  I'm relatively new to the Unix world; it wasn't until 1991 that
  our monolithic mainframe was replaced by several large Unix
  servers. When meeting these new beasts, I was surprised to find
  that the things known as "filesystems" had a maximum size of two
  gigabytes - I was used to 64 bit words and maximum filesystem
  sizes measured in terabytes. These days two gigs can be gobbled
  up quite easily; for instance, a high quality color scan of a
  photograph might produce a 42 megabyte file. A finite element
  analysis might require several hundred megabytes of scratch space
  and an hour of digital video hogs 20 gigabytes of disk. Wow.

  <p>In short order I grew tired of manually monitoring these
  newfangled workstations and their filesystems, so I threw
  together a Perl TCP/IP client-server to do the dirty work. Once a
  minute the client connected to a server (often called a
  <i>daemon</i>) running on a monitored machine, and the server
  executed a Unix <i>df</i> command and returned the output. The
  client took this data, reformatted it, and wrote it to a log file
  which could be dynamically viewed with <tt>tail -f</tt>. This
  scheme sufficed for several years since it provided ample
  lead-time to take corrective action before a filesystem became
  critically low on space.</p>

  <p>When Tk for Perl arrived I immediately dreamt of colored bars
  on a X display that expanded and contracted as disk usage varied
  over time. Blending Tk with the original code resulted in a
  package collectively known as <i>monds</i>, short for "monitor
  disk space." The issues involved have more to do with signals,
  sockets, and pipes than regular Perl/Tk, so my column will be a
  little different this time. Anyway, here's what <i>monds</i>
  looks like:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/lidie-fig1.gif" width="372" height="150"
    border="0" alt="">
  </div>

  <p>The conversion was slightly painful because, as we saw in
  <a href="../vol1_3/tpj0103-0006.html">TPJ #3</a>, mixing socket
  events with Perl/Tk X events can make the application hang.
  That's why the simple-minded client was completely redesigned to
  separate the Tk code from the network code. The solution: spawn a
  child process to perform the client socket duties, and use a pipe
  to pass information between the client and the Tk parent. The Tk
  code never blocks when reading the pipe because it uses Perl's
  <tt>select()</tt> function to ensure that df data is
  available.</p>

  <p>The Tk parent and child client employ a simple communications
  protocol that describes how the processes exchange information.
  This means that the monds system requires bi-directional pipes.
  One direction is used when the parent speaks to a child; the
  other is used when the child speaks to its parent.</p>

  <p>When the child client is activated it immediately requests df
  data from its associated server, writes the filesystem data to
  its output pipe, and then waits for an ACK (acknowledge) by
  attempting to read from its input pipe. Meanwhile, the Tk parent
  periodically polls its input pipes (there's one for each
  monitored machine), reads the filesystem data, and acknowledges a
  child's response by sending a newline. When the child receives
  that ACK, the cycle repeats. This simple scheme synchronizes the
  entire application while still allowing X events to flow.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/disk_space.gif" width="170" height="217" alt=
    "monitor disk space">
  </div>

  <p>The <i>monds</i> protocol also provides for rudimentary error
  reporting. If there are network problems, or a child client
  cannot connect to its server, the child sends one of several
  canned messages to the parent, who then posts the alert message
  on the X display.</p>

  <h3>The Monitor Disk Space TCP Daemon</h3>The simplest part of
  <i>monds</i> is the remote server. No doubt many of you have
  already written your own client-server pairs, based on examples
  from Perl books, but this server is even more concise because
  <i>inetd</i>, the Unix Internet daemon, does all the work.* Here
  is a good example of my inherent laziness:
  <pre>
&#13;#!/usr/bin/perl -w 
&#13;# 
&#13;# monitor_disk_space_daemon - transmit 'df' 
&#13;# output to the asynchronous TCP/IP task 
&#13;# spun-off by monitor_disk_space.
&#13;
&#13;print '/bin/df 2&gt;&amp;1'; 
&#13;print "END_OF_DF\n";
&#13;
</pre><br>

  <p>A single backticked <i>df</i> written to STDOUT, followed by a
  marker line, and that's it - <i>inetd</i> automatically connects
  Perl's filehandles to the network sockets! Filesystem data is now
  outward bound for the client who initiated this connection.</p>

  <h3>The Monitor Disk Space TCP Client</h3>

  <p>Although <i>monds</i> comes with its own client, Unix already
  provides us with an alternative: <i>telnet</i>. All we need to do
  is specify the <i>monds</i> TCP port number on the command line.
  Typing this:</p>
  <pre>
&#13;%      telnet Turkey.CC.Lehigh.EDU 10346
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>produces output similar to this:</p>
  <pre>
&#13;Trying... 
&#13;Connected to turkey.CC.Lehigh.EDU.     
&#13;Escape character is '^]'. 
&#13;Filesystem Total KB     free %used iused %iused Mounted on 
&#13;       /dev/hd4      12288     8052 34%     785  25%  / 
&#13;       /dev/hd9var   12288     7620 37%     144   3%  /var     
&#13;/dev/hd2     303104     1612 99%   18496  24%  /usr    
&#13;/dev/hd3      12288     1336 89%     412  10%  /tmp    
&#13;/dev/lv00     20180     2808 86%    1718  27%  /vice/cache     
&#13;AFS        72000000 72000000  0%       0   0%  /afs    
&#13;END_OF_DF
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>That df output comes from a SYSV-like Unix machine. Here's
  output from a BSD-like server:</p>
  <pre>
&#13;Trying... 
&#13;Connected to turkey.CC.Lehigh.EDU. 
&#13;Escape character is '^]'. 
&#13;Filesystem  1024-blocks  Used  Available  Capacity  Mounted on         
&#13;/dev/hda4     247871  171858  63212     90%   / 
&#13;       /dev/hda1     523968  389952  134016    74%   /dosc 
&#13;       /dev/hda2     189300  112014  77256     94%   /dosd     
&#13;END_OF_DF
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>The representations differ, but monds normalizes them into a
  common format as the data arrives.</p>

  <p>The <i>monds</i> client is similar to the <i>telnet</i> client
  in that it expects an IP address and port number and writes the
  incoming <i>df</i> data to STDOUT, but there the similarity ends.
  Instead of exiting, the client then issues a read on STDIN,
  waiting for the go-ahead to re-connect to the server for its next
  <i>df</i> sample. Just like <i>telnet</i>, the <i>monds</i>
  client can be run interactively; later we'll see how the Perl/Tk
  parent creates the bi-directional pipes and attaches them to the
  client.</p>

  <p>Here is the entire client, compact enough that we can see at a
  glance how it implements its half of the <i>monds</i>
  protocol.</p>
  <pre>
&#13;#!/usr/bin/perl -w 
&#13;# 
&#13;# monitor_disk_space_client - request 'df' data from
&#13;# monitor_disk_space_daemon and feed to 
&#13;# monitor_disk_space.
&#13;
&#13;require 5.002; 
&#13;use English; 
&#13;use IO; 
&#13;use strict;
&#13;
&#13;do {print "Usage: monds_client host port\n"; exit} 
&#13;  if scalar @ARGV != 2; 
&#13;
&#13;STDOUT-&gt;autoflush(1); # always flush output buffer
&#13;
&#13;sub timeout {
&#13;    $SIG{ALRM} = \&amp;timeout; 
&#13;    print "Socket Timeout\n";
&#13;}
&#13;
&#13;# Read socket data into a list until END_OF_DF detected; only
&#13;# then output to our parent's pipe. This ensures that the
&#13;# parent never blocks reading input data, since select()
&#13;# won't know we have data for our parent until we actually do.
&#13;# Cycle after we receive the ACK from monds.
&#13;
&#13;while (1) { 
&#13;  my $sock = IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new(PeerAddr =&gt; $ARGV[0],
&#13;                                   Proto    =&gt; 'tcp',
&#13;                             PeerPort =&gt; "monds($ARGV[1])");
&#13;   if ($sock) { 
&#13;               my(@sd) = (); 
&#13;        # prevent infamous "Alarm clock" problem 
&#13;               $SIG{ALRM} = \&amp;timeout; 
&#13;               alarm 60;       
&#13;        while(&lt;$sock&gt;) {         
&#13;            push @sd, $ARG; 
&#13;            last if /^END_OF_DF$/;     
&#13;        }      
&#13;        alarm 0; 
&#13;               print ((/^END_OF_DF$/ and $#sd &gt; 0) ? @sd 
&#13;          : "Daemon Failure\n"); 
&#13;    } else { 
&#13;               print "Cannot Connect\n"; 
&#13;    } 
&#13;    $_ = &lt;STDIN&gt;;                # wait for go-ahead from monitor_disk_space 
&#13;}
&#13;
</pre><br>

  <p>At the top of the loop IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new() attempts to
  connect to the client's peer daemon using the IP address and port
  number specified on the command line. Assuming the connect
  succeeds and the <tt>END_OF_DF</tt> marker is detected, the data
  is printed. It might go to a pipe connected to the Perl/Tk
  parent, or simply STDOUT if the client is executed
  interactively.</p>

  <p>The client also reports error conditions like "Cannot
  Connect", "Socket Timeout" or "Daemon Failure". In particular,
  it's free to use Unix signals like SIGALRM to timeout socket
  reads; if the Perl/Tk parent were to attempt this, it would
  surely crash the application.</p>

  <h3>Connecting the TCP Client to the Perl/Tk Parent</h3>

  <p>The next hurdle is to propagate the filesystem data to the
  Perl/Tk program <i>monds</i>; the basic mechanism is taken
  directly from O'Reilly's <i>Programming Perl</i> and relies on
  <tt>pipe()</tt>, <tt>fork()</tt>, and <tt>exec()</tt> system
  calls. <i>monds</i> uses the global hash <tt>%CHILD</tt> to
  manage its multiple client connections and bi-directional pipes.
  Each <tt>%CHILD</tt> key is the hostname of a monitored machine,
  and the key's value is a reference to another hash with three
  keys, so <tt>%CHILD</tt> is a hash of a hash with three elements.
  Thus for a machine named 'dandy' we have this structure:</p>
  <pre>
{'dandy'}-&gt;{pid} child process ID (for KILLing)
{'dandy'}-&gt;{pr}  filehandle of parent read pipe
{'dandy'}-&gt;{pw}  filehandle of parent write pipe
</pre>

  <p>With all that in mind (put on your thinking caps please),
  here's the code that fires off the clients:</p>
  <pre>
$READ_BITS = '';                     # "bitlist" of parent filehandles
my($fh) = ('fh0000');   # indirect filehandle names
my($cr, $cw);                   # child read and write filehandles
foreach (@{$OPT{hosts}}) {
	$cr = $fh++;
	$CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pw} = $fh++;
	pipe($cr, $CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pw}) or abort 'cr/pw pipe';
	$CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pr} = $fh++;
	$cw = $fh++;
	pipe($CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pr}, $cw) or abort 'pr/cw pipe';
	if ($CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pid} = fork) { # parent
	       close $cr;
	       close $cw;
	       $CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pw}-&gt;autoflush(1);
	       vec($READ_BITS, fileno($CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pr}), 1) = 1;
	} elsif (defined($CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pid})) { # child
	       close $CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pr};
	       close $CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pw};
	       open(STDIN,  "&lt;&amp;$cr") or abort 'STDIN open';
	       open(STDOUT, "&gt;&amp;$cw") or abort 'STDOUT open';
	       open(STDERR, "&gt;&amp;$cw") or abort 'STDERR open';
	       STDOUT-&gt;autoflush(1);
	       STDERR-&gt;autoflush(1);
	       exec("$LIBDIR/monds_client",$ARG,$PORT)
	               or abort 'exec';
	} else {
	       abort 'fork';
	} # if fork
} # for each monitored machine
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>First, the global <tt>$READ_BITS</tt> is cleared. This
  variable represents a bit list of the Unix file descriptors (not
  filehandles) available for reading. You'll learn more about
  <tt>$READ_BITS</tt> as we proceed.</p>

  <p>Then the variable <tt>$fh</tt> is initialized with an
  <i>indirect file handle</i> template; that is, the value of
  <tt>$fh</tt> is the <i>name</i> of the file handle in question,
  rather than a plain Perl filehandle bareword like STDOUT. We do
  this for simplicity, so filehandles can be generated dynamically
  without regard to the number of clients.( Within reason, of
  course. The code depends upon Perl's ability to increment a
  string, and as long as we don&rsquo;t try to create more
  filehandles than more than your supports, space-time behaves
  normally.)</p>

  <p>For each host, inbound and outbound pipes are created, a
  requirement for the two-way protocol. The <tt>fork()</tt> call
  creates a clone subprocess of the Perl/Tk parent, and the flow of
  the code splits, like a fork in a road, depending upon whether
  the parent or child is executing it. If <tt>fork()</tt> succeeds
  it returns the Unix process ID of the child to the Perl/Tk
  parent, and zero to the child. Later we'll see why it's important
  for the parent to record the PID of all its children.</p>

  <p>The parent cares nothing about the child's filehandles so it
  immediately closes them. Then it unbuffers its write filehandle,
  builds up the <tt>select()</tt> bit list, and goes about its
  way.</p>

  <p>To understand exactly what vec() is doing, examine this
  statement (executed within the Perl debugger):</p>
  <pre>
DB&lt;1&gt; @f = (fileno STDIN, fileno STDOUT, fileno STDERR))
DB&lt;2&gt; print "@f"
0 1 2
</pre>

  <p>We see that <tt>fileno()</tt> maps a Perl filehandle to a
  small integer - the Unix file descriptor of the filehandle. Each
  file descriptor represents an index in the select() bit list. So
  each assignment to vec(<tt>$READ_BITS, ...</tt>) flips on a
  particular bit, building it up so that eventually there is one
  bit set for every parent read pipe.</p>

  <p>Like its Perl/Tk parent, the child closes filehandles it
  doesn't need. It then prepares to invoke the TCP client in the
  standard Unix way: by connecting its read and write pipe
  filehandles to STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR, and calling
  <tt>exec()</tt> (with three arguments: the client's path name, an
  IP address, and port number) to overlay the client upon
  itself.</p>

  <h3>The Perl/Tk Parent's Secondary Main Loop</h3>

  <p>Once all the clients are running, <i>monds</i> enters its main
  loop, which coexists with, but is independent of, the ubiquitous
  Perl/Tk <tt>MainLoop()</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
<tt>
$MW-&gt;repeat($poll_interval, \&amp;poll_clients);
</tt>
</pre>

  <p>Subroutine <tt>poll_clients()</tt> is nominally called every
  minute, at which time it collects and processes all available df
  data, and then sends acknowledgements as required.</p>
  <pre>
&#13;sub poll_clients {
&#13;  my($rbits, $nfound); 
&#13;  $nfound = select($rbits = $READ_BITS,undef,undef,undef); 
&#13;  return if $nfound == 0;
&#13;  my(@go_ahead) = ();            # ACK hosts for another 'df' 
&#13;  my(@host_list) = @{$OPT{hosts}};
&#13;  PROCESS_ALL_HOSTS: while ($nfound &gt; 0) {  
&#13;      my $them = shift(@host_list);    
&#13;      if (vec($rbits, fileno($CHILD{$them}-&gt;{pr}),1) == 0){ 
&#13;          # if no incoming data from this client
&#13;                 next PROCESS_ALL_HOSTS; 
&#13;      } 
&#13;      $nfound--;       
&#13;      push @go_ahead, $them;    # give a "go-ahead" signal
&#13;      # parent's (monds') read filehandle
&#13;      my $fh = $CHILD{$them}-&gt;{pr}; 
&#13;
&#13;    PROCESS_HOST_FILESYSTEMS:  while (&amp;lgt;$fh&gt;) {   
&#13;         last PROCESS_HOST_FILESYSTEMS if /^END_OF_DF$/;
&#13;         # Process file system data here ...
&#13;       }
&#13;  } # whilend PROCESS_ALL_HOSTS
&#13;  foreach (@go_ahead) {        
&#13;      print {$CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pw}} "\n";     
&#13;  }     
&#13;  display_poll_results;
&#13;} 
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>Here's our friend <tt>$READ_BITS</tt> again, that bit list of
  all possible input file descriptors. We copy it into
  <tt>$rbits</tt>. <tt>select()</tt> then checks the specified file
  descriptors, and for file descriptors with no input data, it
  clears the corresponding bits in <tt>$rbits</tt>. When
  <tt>select()</tt> returns, <tt>$rbits</tt> now has bits set only
  for those file descriptors have input data, and $nfound tells us
  how many there are.</p>

  <p>Using <tt>vec()</tt>, the data collection loop finds a viable
  client, pushes its name on the acknowledgement list, and proceeds
  to read and process the client's df data. Once all the df data
  has been read, each client is given its ACK, the poll results are
  displayed, and the cycle repeats.</p>

  <h3>Further Considerations</h3>

  <p><b>Termination.</b> Unix etiquette dictates that the Perl/Tk
  parent properly terminate its children, so this code is bound to
  the application's Quit button:</p>
  <pre>
&#13;foreach (@{$OPT{hosts}}) { 
&#13;       kill 'SIGTERM', $CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pid} 
&#13;      if defined $CHILD{$ARG}-&gt;{pid}; 
&#13;}
&#13;
</pre>

  <p><b>Efficiency.</b> As usual, the marginal utility of an
  optimiziation isn't always worth the time and effort needed to
  create, implement, and test the change. However, the <i>monds</i>
  daemon is loaded, compiled, and executed 1440 times per day, and
  so it's worth looking at. One possibility is to translate the
  Perl code to C, resulting in a compact, lightweight process that
  would load very fast. Another approach is to do away with
  <i>inetd</i> altogether and write a true <i>monds</i> daemon that
  loads once and accepts and handles network connections itself.
  Then again, perhaps 1440 loads per day is mere noise, so the
  choice is up to you.</p>

  <p><b>Intelligence.</b> The current <i>monds</i> warning scheme
  is overly simplistic because it only notices a filesystem when
  its usage exceeds 90%. Suppose you have an empty two gigabyte
  filesystem, and a process, for whatever reason, starts writing a
  file upon it at 200,000 bytes per second. Assuming no disk
  limits, that filesystem becomes completely filled in 2e9/2e5
  seconds, or about 2.78 hours, and <i>monds</i> will post its
  first alert with 16 minutes left. But if your filesystem had only
  200 megabytes. That same process will fill the filesystem an
  order of magnitude faster, in around 16 minutes, and monds would
  only yelp with less than two minutes to go! So although the rate
  of filling is identical in each case, the percentage of disk
  usage is radically different, and that's what you care about.
  This is an interesting idea to throw into the heuristic stew -
  scale the threshold criteria so that every filesystem, regardless
  of size, is provided an identical "reaction time period."</p>

  <p><b>Action.</b> But wait, there's more! Since monds has a
  modicum of intelligence, why not let the program load-level a
  machine's filesystems? By that I mean actually move directories
  from a file system low on space to one with excess space. If
  monds was supplied with a list of filesystems among which it was
  permitted to distribute directories, we can imagine a Perl/Tk
  window like this:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/lidie-fig2.gif"><img src=
  "images/lidie-fig2_sm.gif" align="center" alt="" border="0"
  width="250" height="278"></a></p>

  <p>We can take this idea even further and envision load-leveling
  AFS volumes across the Internet, but now we need to deal with
  multiple mount points possibly spread across multiple AFS severs,
  a topic, as they say, beyond the scope of this column. 'Nuff
  said.</p>
