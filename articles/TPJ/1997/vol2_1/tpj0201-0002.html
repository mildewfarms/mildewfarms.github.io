  <h2 align="center">PDL: The Perl Data Language</h2>

  <h4><i>Karl Glazebrook and Frossie Economou</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  <font size="+2">E</font>xtolling the virtues of Perl and its many
  uses to the readers of TPJ is preaching to the converted.
  Nevertheless, there is one fundamental area in computing where
  Perl has been conspicuously absent: number crunching and data
  analysis.

  <p>Tarred by the same brush as other scripting languages, Perl
  (which in fact is semi-compiled), is perceived as too slow and
  memory-devouring for heavy numerical computations because it
  doesn't lend itself to storing and retrieving zillions of numbers
  quickly. This has been a source of great frustration to the
  authors, both enthusiastic Perl (ab)users who resent being forced
  to use more primitive environments for their astronomical data
  analysis. Perl's potential for manipulating numerical data sets
  speedily and elegantly via an extension was obvious. Hence PDL,
  the Perl Data Language, was born. PDL is a Perl extension, so you
  get the convenience of programming in Perl with the speed of
  compiled C.</p>

  <p>PDL introduces a new data structure: the "pdl numerical
  array," often referred to as a "piddle." (This unfortunate
  nickname has led to some rather dubious puns in the source code.)
  Anyway, a piddle is a special object that can contain a large
  block of efficiently-stored numbers for manipulation with normal
  mathematical expressions. For example, if $a is a piddle
  containing a 3x4x6 chunk of data, then the Perl statement <tt>$b
  = sin($a)</tt> will do exactly what you think: set <tt>$b</tt>
  equal to <tt>$a</tt> but with every value replaced its sine. Easy
  - and because each operation is implemented via compiled C code,
  it's nearly as fast as a hand-crafted C program.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0201-0002a.html">Complete Listing of PDL Functions
  (as of PDL 1.11)</a>.</p>

  <p>PDL can be used "normally" from a script - simply <tt>use
  PDL</tt>. But it also has a shell interface for interactive data
  analysis and prototyping. Here we'll play with the PDL shell,
  called <i>perldl</i>, which we'll invoke from the command line.(
  This article assumes you have PDL-1.11, PGPLOT-2.0 (which itself
  requires the <i>pgplot</i> graphics library), and Perl 5.003. If
  you also have the right versions of the Term::ReadLine and
  Term::ReadKey modules, the <i>perldl</i> shell allows interactive
  command line editing.)</p>
  <pre>

% perldl 

perlDL shell v1.11      

Loaded PDL v1.11   ReadLines enabled 

        

Reading /home/frossie/.perldlrc ... 

                  perldl&gt; 

</pre>

  <p>The <i>perldl</i> shell behaves like Perl's debugger. For
  instance, we can assign values to variables and print them with
  <tt>p:</tt></p>
  <pre>

perldl&gt; $b = 2

perldl&gt; p $b/2       

1       

perldl&gt; p $b/3 

        0.666666666666667       

perldl&gt; 

</pre>

  <p>Since PDL is really about matrices, let's create a 2x3 matrix
  and multiply it by itself:</p>
  <pre>

perldl&gt; $a = pdl [5,3,4], [6,4,3];

perldl&gt; print $a;

[

  [5 3 4]

  [6 4 3]

]

perldl&gt; $b = $a * $a;

perldl&gt; print $b;

[

  [25 9 16]

  [36 16 9]

]

</pre>

  <p>But to have true fun with PDL, we'll first need some data.
  Luckily the PDL distribution comes with a picture of the sky
  stored in FITS, the standard format for astronomical data. PDL
  also supplies <tt>rfits()</tt>, a function that reads FITS files
  and returns a piddle containing the data. So let's read in our
  image and plot it:</p>
  <pre>

perldl&gt; $a = rfits "PDL1.11/m51.fits"; 

IO loaded 

BITPIX = 16 size = 65536 pixels 

Reading  131072 bytes   

BSCALE = 1.0000000000E0 &amp;&amp; BZERO = 0.0000000000E0



perldl&gt;

</pre>

  <p>Now we have data - and we didn't have to spend three nights
  freezing up a mountain to get it. What do we know about it? That
  it is 16-bit with 65536 elements. But is it 65536x1 or 256x256 or
  even 16x16x16x16?</p>
  <pre>
   

perldl&gt; p dims $a    

256 256

perldl&gt; 

</pre>

  <p>Not surprisingly (after all, it's a picture of the sky) we
  have a two-dimensional image: 256x256. <tt>dims()</tt> is a PDL
  function that returns the dimensions of a piddle. But what about
  the data values?</p>
  <pre>

perldl&gt; p stats $a   

104.193572998047 67.4254211880158

perldl&gt;

</pre>

  <p>So there - <tt>stats()</tt> is a PDL function than returns the
  mean and standard deviation of a piddle. We can even print some
  of it now-Jon might get upset if we displayed 65536 numbers, so
  let's go for the bottom left corner instead:</p>
  <pre>

perldl&gt; p sec($a,0,3,252,255)

[

 [50 51 54 53] 

 [50 50 53 54]  

 [51 52 53 52]  

 [54 53 54 51]

]



perldl&gt;

</pre>

  <p><tt>sec()</tt> returns a section of a piddle; the above
  statement displays the rectangle between elements (0,252) and
  (3,255). Additional dimensions are handled seamlessly: just pass
  the extra coordinate values as arguments.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you're getting restless at this point. Let's abandon
  the function calls and jump to the cool stuff.</p>
  <pre>

perldl&gt; imag $a      

Loaded PGPLOT 

Displaying 256 x 256 image from 24 to 500 ... 

</pre>

  <p>which pops up a window displaying this figure:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/gal1.gif"><img src=
  "images/gal1_sm.gif" align="center" alt="Figure 1: Galaxy 1"
  border="0" width="129" height="128"></a></p>

  <p>My god Dave, it's full of stars! And so it should be - this is
  in fact an image of Messier 51, a spiral galaxy similar to our
  own but at a distance of 200,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles away,
  give or take a few billion. That's a bit too far for us to
  invade, but we can at least humiliate it:</p>
  <pre>

perldl&gt; imag sin(0.05*$a) 

Displaying 256 x 256 image from -0.999990224838257 to 0.999992072582245 ... 

</pre>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/gal2.gif"><img src=
  "images/gal2_sm.gif" align="center" alt="Figure 2: Galaxy 2"
  border="0" width="120" height="120"></a></p>

  <p>Since we're exploring cosmology, let's create something out of
  nothing:</p>
  <pre>

perldl&gt; $r = rvals zeroes 20,20

</pre>

  <p>As you can see, PDL functions can be chained together just
  like Perl functions. Two PDL functions are cascaded here:
  <tt>rvals()</tt> and <tt>zeroes()</tt>. First, <tt>zeroes()</tt>
  creates a piddle full of zeroes-in this case, a 20x20 matrix with
  every element zero. (There's also a <tt>ones()</tt>
  function.)</p>

  <p>Then <tt>rvals()</tt> fills that piddle with values
  representing the distance of each element from the center.</p>
  <pre>
 

perldl&gt; $g = exp(-($r/6)**2)/108.08  

perldl&gt; imag $g 

</pre>

  <p>...which displays the following:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/gal3.gif"><img src=
  "images/gal3_sm.gif" align="center" alt="Figure 3: Galaxy 3"
  border="0" width="142" height="141"></a></p>

  <p>Alert readers (assuming there are any left at this point) will
  note that the <tt>exp()</tt> function was used to generate a
  two-dimensional Gaussian. The less mathematically inclined will
  say it looks like a blob. Let's inflict a bit more punishment on
  Messier 51 by <i>convolving</i> it with our newly-created
  Gaussian filter. This enables us to simulate what we would see if
  we were observing through very bad viewing conditions, such as a
  (possibly drunken) haze.</p>
  <pre>

perldl&gt; $b = convolve $a,$g  

perldl&gt; imag $b      

</pre>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/gal4.gif"><img src=
  "images/gal4_sm.gif" align="center" alt="Figure 4: Galaxy 4"
  border="0" width="139" height="140"></a></p>

  <p>You might want to know that this operation takes 20-25 seconds
  on a Pentium 120 or Sparc 20 with PDL. Doing this with a 2D array
  in normal (non-PDL) Perl takes 13 minutes and uses 11 times as
  much memory. Is that cool or what?</p>
  <pre>

perldl&gt; imag $a-$b

</pre>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/gal5.gif"><img src=
  "images/gal5_sm.gif" align="center" alt="Figure 5: Galaxy 5"
  border="0" width="140" height="141"></a></p>

  <p>Ah, an unsharp masked image! This is often used in astronomy
  to emphasize sharp features against a bright background, such as
  stars in a galaxy, the giant luminous gas clouds we call HII
  ("aitch-two") regions, or foreground objects such as UFO's (err,
  weather balloons).</p>

  <p>So that's how it all works.</p>

  <h3>Where are we now?</h3>

  <p>PDL was prototyped early in 1996 and is currently in beta
  release. (One author's habit of prototyping Perl modules while on
  astronomical observing trips leaves the other author wondering
  whether this is a previously unknown symptom of altitude
  sickness.) It is functional but not yet fully featured. It is
  under vigorous development thanks to the work and enthusiasm of
  the perldl mailing list participants. The current stable version
  is 1.11.</p>

  <p>Several auxiliary modules for PDL are nearing completion: 3D
  graphic manipulation using OpenGL (Tuomas J. Lukka), an interface
  to the Meschach matrix library (Etienne Grossmann), an interface
  to the XMGR plotting tool (Tim Jenness), access to the TIFF, GIF,
  PostScript, and other formats supported by PBM+ (Christian
  Soeller), and an interface to the SLATEC numerical library
  (Tuomas J. Lukka). Other formats are under development for PDL
  2.0, which will also feature virtual slicing, easier C
  extensions, and fast implicit looping.</p>

  <p>Anyone wishing to reflect or opine on the rather technical
  issues surrounding PDL development is welcome to join the perldl
  mailing list at perldl-request@jach.hawaii.edu or the porters
  list at pdl-porters-request@jach.hawaii.edu. Send your questions
  to the former and your complaints to the latter. Finally, the
  obligatory URL: <a href=
  "http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/kgb/perldl/">http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/kgb/perldl/</a>,
  which includes Christian Soeller's PDL FAQ.</p>

  <p>Stay tuned...</p>
