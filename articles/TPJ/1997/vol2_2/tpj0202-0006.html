  <h4><i>Jon Orwant</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  <font size="+2">P</font>erl 5.004 is available at a CPAN site
  near you. I'll go out on a limb and predict that it will be one
  of the stablest releases of Perl yet, thanks to the tireless
  efforts of Chip Salzenberg. Many people have asked me to itemize
  how 5.004 differs from 5.003; I refer them to the 1092 entries in
  the 350K Changes file.

  <p>Looking ahead to Perl 5.005: Malcolm Beattie is in charge of
  the development track, and Tim Bunce is in charge of the
  maintenance track. Patches will probably be released
  intermittently over the coming months, and eventually 5.005 will
  be announced, perhaps in a year. What new features will it have?
  No one knows for sure, but out of the list below, I'd be very
  surprised if the first four didn't make it. The rest are all
  planned - but remember that the Perl developers are all
  volunteers with day jobs.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>in-core support for multithreading</li>

    <li>better support for The Perl Compiler</li>

    <li>lexically-scoped warnings</li>

    <li>in-core file globbing</li>

    <li>pseudo-hashes: <tt>$x-&gt;{key}</tt> accessing an element
    of <tt>@x</tt></li>

    <li><tt>RESTART{}</tt>, providing a queue of blocks to be run
    after compilation but before running</li>

    <li>strong (lexical) typing</li>

    <li>slab allocator for more efficient memory usage</li>

    <li>regular expressions as a basic Perl datatype</li>

    <li>in-core support for exception handling</li>

    <li>subroutines that you can assign to</li>

    <li>in-core approximate matching for regexes</li>

    <li>support for easy event loops</li>

    <li>iterators</li>

    <li>multidimensional FETCH and STORE for tied hashes</li>

    <li>A switch statement - not that we need one</li>

    <li>Restartable debugger/shell</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <b>O'Reilly &amp; Associates Perl Conference</b> will be
  held August 19-21 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, California.
  For details, see http://www.ora.com/info/perl/conference or the
  back of this magazine.</p>

  <p><b>Apache/Perl</b> answers the question of how to run Perl CGI
  programs as quickly as possible: instead of spawning a separate
  process, Apache embeds the Perl interpreter inside the server.
  See the Apache/Perl module list at
  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Apache/apache-modlist.html.</p>

  <p>Felix Gallo's One Penguin, now known as <b>Penguin 3.0</b>, is
  available. It lets your Perl programs send, receive, and safely
  execute PGP-signed Perl code over the Internet.</p>

  <p>The <b>GetWeb</b> system, by Rolf Nelson, lets you access Web
  pages via e-mail.</p>

  <p>Neil Bowers' <b>WWW::Robot</b> module provides a traversal
  engine for web robots. You describe what you want to happen when
  each page is visited, and it takes care of the rest.</p>

  <p>The <b>Set::IntSpan</b> module, by Steven McDougall, manages
  sets of integers and is optimized for ranges of integers, e.g.
  1-817,831-992. Not coincidentally, this is how .newsrc files
  store the list of newsgroup articles you've read.</p>

  <p>Tom Phoenix's <b>constant.pm</b> pragma, bundled with 5.004,
  lets you create constants at compile-time: use constant USERNAME
  =&gt; scalar getpwuid($&lt;);</p>

  <p>The <b>Date::Convert</b> module, by Mordechai Abzug, converts
  between Gregorian, Julian, Hebrew, and astronomical date
  formats.</p>

  <p>Kevin Atkinson's <b>Math::Fraction</b> module lets you
  manipulate fractions. It's meant to replace bigrat.pl.</p>

  <p><b>Netscape::Cache</b>, by Slaven Rezic, provides an OO
  interface to Netscape cache files, so you can see what's being
  stored locally on your machine.</p>

  <p>Thomas Wenrich's <b>DBD::Solid</b> module provides a
  DBI-standardized interface to Solid databases; Michael Moran's
  DBD::DB2 does the same for IBM's DB2 database engine.</p>

  <p>Ever wanted all the fun of GUI widgets like menu bars,
  pushbuttons, and scrolling lists - in ASCII? Use Ashish Gulhati's
  <b>PerlVision</b>.</p>

  <p>Or, if you're happy with widgets made out of
  honest-to-goodness pixels, but want something simpler and smaller
  than Perl/Tk, try Frederic Chauveau's <b>Sx</b>; version 2.3 was
  released recently.</p>

  <p>Yet another weapon in the Perl GUI arsenal is the
  <b>PerlQt</b> module. Qt is a cross-platform C++ graphical
  development toolkit; sixteen-year-old Ashley Winters created an
  OO interface to it.</p>

  <p>Randy Ray created <b>X11:Fvwm</b>, an interface to the Fvwm2
  (an X window manager) API.</p>

  <p>XForms is a GUI toolkit that lets you create X applications;
  there's a Perl interface to XForms called <b>Xforms4Perl</b> by
  Martin Bartlett. See <a href="http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms"
  target="resource window">http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms</a> to
  download XForms.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0202-0006a.html">The Comprehensive Perl Archive
  Network (CPAN)</a>.</p>

  <p>What's the size of the window in which your Perl script is
  running? Tim Goodwin's <b>Term::Size</b> module knows. (As does
  Perl's <tt>ioctl()</tt> function, with a little coaxing.)</p>

  <p>If you have a US Robotics Pilot and wished you could develop
  applications for it in Perl, you can use Kenneth Albanowski's
  <b>PDA::Pilot</b> module, available as part of the pilot-link
  distribution at <a href="ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/"
  target=
  "resource window">ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/</a>.</p>

  <p>Graham Barr's <b>Errno</b> module defines all of the constants
  defined in your computer's errno.h file, if there is one.<br></p>

  <p>A simple OO interface for databases, <b>DBSimple</b>, has been
  made available by Hugo van der Sanden.</p>

  <p>Evaluation copies of Trifox's VORTEXPerl, an interface to
  relational database systems via the VORTEX "database access and
  performance boosters", is available from
  http://www.trifox.com/j/vortex/vtxperl.html.</p>

  <p>Paul Henson's <b>DCE::DFS</b> module provides an API to
  manipulate DFS (Distributed File System) access control lists and
  internals.</p>

  <p><b>Getopt::Regex</b>, by John Williams, lets your programs
  parse command-line options with regular expressions.</p>

  <p>Anarchie is a Macintosh FTP client; Chris Nandor's
  <b>Mac::Apps::Anarchie</b> provides an interface to it via
  AppleEvents. Chris also released <b>Mac::Comm::OT_PPP</b>, a Mac
  interface to OpenTransport/PPP.</p>

  <p>Ralf Engelschall's <b>ePerl</b> is a C program that extracts
  and evaluates any Perl 5 code embedded in an ASCII document; it's
  available from http://www.engelschall.com/sw/eperl. Similarly,
  the <b>Text::Vpp</b> module by Dominique Dumont is a "versatile
  preprocessor" for text; it lets you embed variables and
  conditionals in your file. Finally, <b>HTML::Embperl</b> does the
  same for HTML, letting you embed Perl code in your HTML
  documents.</p>

  <p>Radius is a protocol that performs authentication and
  accounting duties on a network, and Carl Declerck has created
  <b>Authen::Radius</b> (also known as RadiusPerl) which provides
  an OO interface to it.</p>

  <p>Neil Bowers wrote <b>Locale::Language</b>, which maps the ISO
  language codes to language names (e.g. en to English). He also
  wrote <b>Locale::Country</b>, which does the same for Internet
  domain names (e.g. .no to Norway).</p>

  <p>Something I could have used when typesetting Otmar's article
  for this issue is <b>Text::BibTeX</b>, a module by Greg Ward that
  reads, parses, and writes BibTeX ".bib" files. If your
  bibliographic references are in the <i>refer</i> format, then you
  can use Eryq's <b>Text::Refer</b> module, which supercedes
  Text::Bib.</p>

  <p>Eryq also wrote <b>IO::Scalar</b>, giving you the ability to
  perform filelike operations (e.g. <tt>print()</tt> and
  <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt>) on scalars and arrays of scalars (with
  <b>IO::ScalarArray</b>). Busy Eryq then contributed the
  <b>Convert::BinHex</b> module with Paul Schinder, which extracts
  the header, data fork, and resource fork from Macintosh BinHex
  files. Finally, he uploaded <b>MIME::Lite</b>, which lets you
  send GIFs as e-mail attachments if you can't be troubled to use
  Eryq's full-blown MIME module set.</p>

  <p>If you're wondering why this line has a hyphen in an
  inco-rrect place, it's because this column wasn't formatted with
  Jan Pazdziora's <b>TeX::Hyphen</b> module. It uses TeX's
  hyphenation table, but you don't need TeX to use the module. Jan
  also released <b>Font::TFM</b> (get character dimensions,
  information about ligatures, word widths, etc.) and
  <b>TeX::DVI</b> (an interface to the DVI file format generated by
  TeX).</p>

  <p>Tired of seeing words with eight-bit ASCII characters like
  "na=EFvely"? Use Jan-Pieter Cornet's <b>Text::Striphigh</b>
  module to convert the eight bits to seven. (Eventually, you'll
  upgrade to sixteen-bit Unicode, but sometimes you have to take
  one step backward to go two steps forward. See Gisle Aas'
  <b>Unicode::UCS2</b> module for a preview.)</p>

  <p>Steffen Beyer uploaded <b>Bit::ShiftReg</b> and
  <b>Bit::Vector</b>. The former lets you rotate and
  shift-with-carry for all C integer types, and the latter does the
  same for arbitrary-length bit vectors and is actually just
  another name for Set::IntegerFast. Check out Steffen's web page
  at <a href="http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/</a>.</p>

  <p>Speaking of vectors, John Williams' <b>Math::VecStat</b> has
  just been upgraded slightly. It performs basic numeric statistics
  on vectors.</p>

  <p>Jarkko Hietaniemi, isn't just the self-appointed Master
  Librarian of CPAN, he's a contributor too: he just released the
  <b>BSD::Time module</b>, which implements the
  <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> and <tt>settimeofday()</tt>
  functions.</p>

  <p>The <b>Net::Bind</b> module, by Kevin Johnson, provides an
  interface to <i>bind</i> d&aelig;mon files. <i>bind</i> is the
  Berkeley Internet Name Domain service, which allows clients to
  look up hostnames and addresses.<br></p>

  <p>Graham Barr's <b>Net::SNPP</b> provides a Perl interface to
  SNPP, the Simple Network Pager Protocol.</p>

  <p>Joe Casadonte's <b>libHTML</b> is an alternative to Lincoln
  Stein's CGI.pm and Steven Brenner's cgi-lib.pl. Its syntax looks
  like this: <tt>$h = new libHTML("out");
  $h-&gt;HR-&gt;H3("Reviews")</tt>; and it can be retrieved from
  <a href="http://www.netaxs.com/~joc/perlwin32.html#libHTML"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www.netaxs.com/~joc/perlwin32.html#libHTML</a>.</p>

  <p><b>PCN</b> lets you manipulate Pointcast Iserver Corporate
  Channel Files and Content Group Files. Visit developer Erich
  Markert's Web site at:</p>

  <p>http://cgi.usma.edu/cgi-bin/License?swpackage=PCN.pm-1.00.</p>

  <p><b>RPC</b> (Remote Procedure Call) allows one computer to
  invoke procedures on another computer. Jake Donham's
  <b>perlrpcgen</b> generates Perl modules and server shells from
  RPC interface definitions.</p>

  <p>Roderick Schertler released <b>String::ShellQuote</b>, which
  quotes strings for safe passage through shells, IPC::Signal,
  containing some utilities for coping with operating system
  signals, and <b>Proc::WaitStat</b>, which provides functions for
  interpreting and acting on <tt>wait()</tt> status values.</p>

  <p><b>ptklpq</b> is a Perl/Tk graphical print queue viewer by
  Phiroze Parakh. It'll let you remove print jobs, too. You can
  download it from
  http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~phiroze/perl.html.</p>

  <p>James Duncan's <b>NetObj</b> module lets you create a TCP/IP
  client/server system for distributing modules. With NetObj, you
  can load modules in real time over the Internet. Requires The
  Perl Compiler, also known as the <b>B</b> module.</p>

  <p>The <b>Norge</b> module by Gisle Aas "deals with various
  matters specific for Norway." Not speaking Norwegian, I can only
  guess what those matters are.</p>

  <p>I've released <b>Image::Colorimetry</b>, which lets move
  colors from one colorspace to another, say from RGB to HSV. That
  particular transformation lets you compute how bright a color is
  - something you can't do with RGB. It also converts colors to
  HTML #RRGGBB strings and computes color differences.</p>

  <p>John Cristy's <b>Image::Magick</b> module lets you manipulate
  images via a Perl interface to John's ImageMagick system.
  ImageMagick is an excellent package for interactive manipulation
  of images under X, available from <a href=
  "ftp://ftp.wizards.dupont.com/pub/ImageMagick" target=
  "resource window">ftp://ftp.wizards.dupont.com/pub/ImageMagick</a>.</p>

  <p>There's already a bundle of Win32 modules that build under
  Perl 5.004: <b>libwin32</b>, maintained by Gurusamy Sarathy. It
  includes all of the Activeware extensions, plus five modules by
  Aldo Calpini (Clipboard, Console, Internet, Shortcut, and Sound),
  and three by Dave Roth (AdminMisc, ODBC, and Pipe). The bundle
  doesn't contain binaries; you'll need either Visual C++ 4.x+ or
  Borland C++ 5.0x+ to build these modules.</p>

  <p>The <b>SGMLS</b> module, by David Megginson, parses the output
  from James Clark's SGMLS and NSGMLS parsers. (SGML stands for
  Standard Generalized Markup Language; for more information see
  <a href="http://www.sil.org/sgml/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.sil.org/sgml/</a>.)</p>

  <p>Even before layout began for this issue, it was apparent that
  that this column was going to be substantially larger than last
  issue's. The first installment of this column was a single page;
  the next was two pages, and now I'm up to four pages. Clearly
  it's doubling every issue and will continue to do so
  indefinitely. Extrapolating, TPJ will be the size of a phone book
  in three years, the size of the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica in
  four, and in twenty years it will slow down the Earth's orbit
  enough to render John Redford's sundials useless. Help out by
  notifying me at submissions@tpj.com.</p>
