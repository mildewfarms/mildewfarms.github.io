  <h3>Comparators</h3>

  <p><i>"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more
  lovely and more temperate..."</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  William Shakespeare, Sonnet XVIII</p>

  <p><i>"'I'd like to know if I could compare you to a summer's
  day. Because well, June 12th was quite nice, and...'"</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry
  Pratchett, Wyrd Sisters</p>

  <p>Perl has two types of <i>comparators</i>, so called because
  they compare something to something else. Half of them compare
  one number to another, and the other half compare strings. Don't
  mix them! The numeric comparators are made of symbols, and the
  string comparators are made of letters:</p>
  <pre>
   <b> Number           String          Meaning</b>
        
    ==                  eq           equal
    !=                  ne           not equal
    &lt;                   lt           less than
    &gt;                   gt           greater than
    &lt;=                  le           less or equal
    &gt;=                  ge           greater or equal
    &lt;=&gt;                 cmp          compare
</pre>

  <p>Unless your eyesight is so bad that you picked the Perl
  Journal because it was shelved next to Playboy, you've seen them
  all before, with the possible exception of <tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> and
  <tt>cmp</tt>.</p>

  <p>Here's how those two work. Suppose you were interviewing a
  politician. Instead of saying:</p>

  <p>Q. Will you raise taxes? (<tt>$newtax &gt; $oldtax</tt>)<br>
  A. No.</p>

  <p>Q. So you will lower taxes? (<tt>$newtax &lt;
  $oldtax</tt>)<br>
  A. No.</p>

  <p>Q. Ah, you'll keep them the same? (<tt>$newtax ==
  $oldtax</tt>)</p>

  <p>you could have saved breath by asking</p>

  <p>Q.Will you raise/lower/maintain taxes? (<tt>$newtax &lt;=&gt;
  $oldtax</tt>)</p>

  <p>The expression <tt>$foo &lt;=&gt; $bar</tt> returns -1, 0, or
  1 depending on whether <tt>$foo</tt> is smaller, equal to, or
  greater than <tt>$bar</tt>.<br></p>

  <p>*&gt; Common pitfall: using <tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> when you mean
  <tt>cmp</tt>!</p>

  <h3>Sorting</h3>

  <p>Comparators are often used to help sort a lit of numbers or
  strings. Perl's <tt>sort()</tt> function expects its first
  parameter to be something that behaves just like
  <tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> and <tt>cmp</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
sort   <i>SUBROUTINE_OR_BLOCK    LIST</i>
</pre>

  <p><tt>sort()</tt> calls the subroutine (or invokes the block)
  repeatedly with two values that are always stored in the special
  variables <tt>$a</tt> and <tt>$b</tt>. The subroutine's job is to
  answer the question "Which is higher, or are they the same?" and
  expects an answer of 1 if <tt>$a</tt> is higher, -1 if
  <tt>$b</tt> is higher, or 0 if they're equal.</p>

  <h3>The simplest way to sort</h3>

  <p>So the simplest possible sort, ascending numerical order,
  is</p>
  <pre>
sort {$a &lt;=&gt; $b} 4,2,5
</pre>

  <p>which returns the list 2,4,5.</p>

  <p>You can get descending order by swapping <tt>$a</tt> and
  <tt>$b</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
sort {$b &lt;=&gt; $a} 4,2,5
</pre>

  <p>yielding 5,4,2. It's the same with strings - suppose you want
  to sort a list of Formula One(Like Indy Racing, only better.)
  drivers alphabetically:</p>
  <pre>
@unsorted = qw/Schumacher Hill Alesi Villeneuve Coulthard/;

@sorted = sort {$a cmp $b} @unsorted;
</pre>

  <p>Unless you've forgotten your ABCs, the result shouldn't
  surprise you: "Alesi", "Coulthard", "Hill", "Schumacher",
  "Villeneuve".</p>

  <p>We could have written that even more succinctly:</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = sort @unsorted;
</pre>

  <p>since in the absence of a subroutine, <tt>sort()</tt> defaults
  to string comparison.</p>

  <p>*&gt; Common Pitfall: Forgetting that cmp uses ASCII order,
  which ranks lowercase letters higher than uppercase letters. If
  you want true alphabetical order, use <tt>{lc($a) cmp</tt>
  lc($b)} to sort your list.(Unfortunately there aren't any F1
  drivers called van Something or d'Other this season so
  you&rsquo;ll have to visualize your own example.)</p>

  <h3>Tinkering with the sort</h3>

  <p>Let's rewrite the above example using a named subroutine:</p>
  <pre>
   @sorted = sort honestly @unsorted;

   sub honestly {
       $a cmp $b;
   }
</pre>

  <p>If you can't be honest, be creative. Suppose you want to sort
  the list in <tt>cmp</tt>'s ASCII order, but want Damon Hill to
  always come first, because let's face it, he's the best.(For
  those following the 1997 season - it's the car's fault, okay?)
  Now, <tt>sort()</tt> doesn't care what the subroutine does, so
  long as it returns -1, 0, or 1. So what we'll do is replace
  <tt>honestly()</tt> with a subroutine that checks if "Hill" is
  one of its arguments, and fudges the result if so.</p>
  <pre>
   @sorted = sort fraudulently @unsorted;

   sub fraudulently { 
       return -1 if $a eq 'Hill'; 
       return  1 if $b eq 'Hill'; 
       $a cmp $b; 
   }
</pre>

  <p>which produces the order "Hill", "Alesi", "Coulthard",
  "Schumacher", "Villeneuve".</p>

  <p>*&gt; Common Pitfall: Thinking all you need is the if
  <tt>$a</tt> case. Try the above without the if <tt>$b</tt> line
  and see what happens!</p>

  <h3>Sorting associative arrays (hashes)</h3>

  <p>You can't. Go home.</p>

  <p>Seriously, think about what you want to do. Hashes simply map
  a set of scalars (the keys) to another set of scalars (the
  values); they have no beginning and no end, so they can't be
  sorted. So you can't sort a hash - but you can certainly sort its
  keys and values.</p>

  <p>In keeping with our theme,(I promise to pick something else
  for next issue!) let's make a hash of some Formula One teams
  (keys) and the companies that provide their car engines (values).
  In Formula One parlance, these combinations of racing team and
  engine are called <i>constructors</i>, and every season there is
  a constructor championship in parallel with the driver
  championship. For example, the 1996 season was won by
  Williams-Renault because the most points were won by cars built
  by the Williams team using the Renault engine.</p>
  <pre>
   %constructors = (    
       "Williams"  =&gt; "Renault",     
       "McLaren"   =&gt; "Mercedes", 
        "Benetton" =&gt; "Renault", 
        "Ferrari"  =&gt; "Ferrari", 
        "Arrows"   =&gt; "Yamaha", 
        );
</pre>

  <p>If you haven't used hashes much, you might be wondering
  whether it makes any difference what's the key and what's the
  value. Keys <i>must</i> be unique; that's why it would have been
  dead silly to use the engines as the keys and the teams as the
  values. You can't have two racing teams of the same name any more
  than you can have two NFL teams called "Dallas Cowboys." But two
  football teams could play in the same stadium, just as two racing
  teams can and do buy engines from the same manufacturer. As you
  can see, both the Williams and the Benetton teams buy their
  engines from Renault.</p>

  <p>*&gt; Common Pitfall: Unintentionally indexing hashes by
  non-unique keys. This results in data being lost.</p>

  <p><b>Sorting a hash by key.</b> Perl, being the helpful creature
  that it is, provides you with a function called <tt>keys()</tt>
  that returns a list of hash keys. They can then be sorted with
  the techniques we discussed above.</p>

  <p>So, to produce a listing of constructors in team order:</p>
  <pre>
@teams = sort {$a cmp $b} keys %constructors;

foreach $team (@teams) { 
    print $team,"-",$constructors{$team},"\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>This displays:</p>
  <pre>
Arrows-Yamaha 
Benetton-Renault 
Ferrari-Ferrari 
McLaren-Mercedes 
Williams-Renault
</pre>

  <p>Don't be afraid to take advantage of the shortcuts Perl
  offers. You already know that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>sort()</tt> defaults to a string comparison</li>

    <li><tt>keys()</tt> returns a list</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So we can fold the above <tt>sort()</tt> statement into the
  foreach loop:</p>
  <pre>
foreach $team (sort keys %constructors) { 
    print $team,"-",$constructors{$team},"\n"; }
</pre>

  <p>It's not complicated at all - in fact it's much easier to
  verbalize ("for each $team in the list of sorted constructor
  keys") than the first, more verbose, example: ("Let @teams be the
  list sorted by string comparison of constructor keys; for each
  $team in @teams").</p>

  <p><b>Sorting a hash by value.</b> <tt>keys()</tt> has a brother,
  <tt>values()</tt>, that returns a list of all the hash values.
  Now of course you can sort the values just as you sorted the
  keys, but will that help you at all in sorting your hash? No,
  because the hash is indexed by key, not by value, so you still
  need to arrange the keys first. But you can organize those any
  way you want: by value, by size, or by phase of the moon if
  that's your pleasure.</p>

  <p>So whereas before we sorted the keys by key (that is, the
  teams by team name) with</p>
  <pre>
@teams = sort {$a cmp $b} keys %constructors;
</pre>

  <p>we now want to sort the keys by their corresponding values
  (that is, the teams by engine).</p>
  <pre>
@teams = sort 
             { $constructors{$a} cmp $constructors{$b} } 
             keys %constructors;
</pre>

  <p>which, followed again with</p>
  <pre>
foreach $team (@teams) { 
    print $team,"-",$constructors{$team},"\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>prints</p>
  <pre>
Ferrari-Ferrari 
McLaren-Mercedes 
Williams-Renault 
Benetton-Renault 
Arrows-Yamaha
</pre>

  <p>which is exactly what we wanted: A list of constructors sorted
  by engine.</p>

  <p><b>Sorting a hash by key and value.</b> If you made it to this
  point, you probably know enough to fulfill all your sorting
  needs. To demonstrate, here's a more sophisticated example that
  can be easily decomposed using what we know so far.</p>

  <p>Suppose you wanted to sort the hash (constructors) by value
  (engine) as above but, knowing that the value may not always be
  unique, want to sort by key (team) in the case of identical
  engines. In other words, we want a <i>primary sort</i> by engine
  and a <i>secondary sort</i> by team name.</p>

  <p>Here are the four steps:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We first need to get the keys (teams) sorted in the order
    we want:
      <pre>
@teams = sort myway keys %constructors;
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>We can sort them using any subroutine we like:
      <pre>
   sub myway { 
       # are the engines different? 
       if ($constructors{$a} ne $constructors{$b}) {

           # engines different - compare engines 
           $constructors{$a} cmp $constructors{$b}; 
       } else { 

           # engines same - compare teams 
           $a cmp $b; 
       } 
   }
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>We display our teams using the using the sorted keys:
      <pre>
foreach $team (@teams) { 
    print $team,"-",$constructors{$team},"\n";
}
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>We glow with satisfaction when the output arrives as
    desired:
      <pre>
Ferrari-Ferrari 
McLaren-Mercedes 
Benetton-Renault 
Williams-Renault 
Arrows-Yamaha
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Sorting and efficiency</h3>

  <p>Once you've figured out how to do something, the next step is
  often figuring out how to do it fast. If you have a complicated
  sorting operation, consider doing as much work as possible before
  the sort, rather than embedding the work in the sort subroutine
  that gets called over and over and over. This occasionally
  requires some lateral thinking, but that's where all the fun is
  anyway, right?</p>

  <p>In our first example we had these drivers:</p>
  <pre>
@unsorted = qw/Schumacher Hill Alesi Villeneuve Coulthard/;
</pre>

  <p>and we were trying to fudge the order so that Hill came
  first:</p>
  <pre>
   sub fraudulently { 
       return -1 if $a eq 'Hill'; 
       return  1 if $b eq 'Hill'; 
       $a cmp $b; 
   }
</pre>

  <p>which puts the computational burden of cheating on the
  <tt>sort()</tt> subroutine. But is there a more efficient way to
  make sure Hill stays on top? Well, since the null string ("") is
  always going to be first alphabetically, we could create another
  array that contains every driver's name - except for Hill, who'll
  have a null string in his place.</p>
  <pre>
 
# copy the array
@idx = @unsorted;   

# replace Hill with the null string in the array
foreach (@idx) { $_ = "" if $_ eq "Hill" }
</pre>

  <p>We've now created the array @idx with 5 elements whose values
  are "Schumacher", "", "Alesi", "Villeneuve", "Coulthard". So what
  we want is to</p>

  <ul>
    <li>sort this array (@idx)</li>

    <li>order the original array (@sorted) in the same order</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We can do this all in one statement, shown below.</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = @unsorted[ 
                    sort { $idx[$a] cmp $idx[$b] } 
                         0 .. $#idx 
                   ];
</pre>

  <p>Done! Missed it? Here's the slow motion replay:</p>

  <p><tt>0 .. $#idx is 0,1,2,3,4</tt> because that's how many
  elements we have. But remember</p>
  <pre>
$idx[0] is "Schumacher" 
$idx[1] is "" 
$idx[2] is "Alesi" 
$idx[3] is "Villeneuve" 
$idx[4] is "Coulthard"
</pre>

  <p>So our sort expression,</p>
  <pre>
                     sort { $idx[$a] cmp $idx[$b] } 
                          0 .. $#idx
</pre>takes 0,1,2,3,4 and returns whatever order is specified by an
alphabetical sorting of "Schumacher", "", "Alesi", "Villeneuve",
"Coulthard" - which makes "" end on top.

  <p>But this isn't quite what we want - who's this "" bloke ? We
  want the original unsorted list in the same order, which we can
  obtain via an array slice:</p>
  <pre>
@unsorted[1,2,4,0,3]. 
Got it? 
@sorted = @unsorted[1,2,4,0,3] 
i.e. 
@sorted = @unsorted[ 
                   sort { $idx[$a] cmp $idx[$b] }
                   0,1,2,3,4 
                   ]
</pre>

  <p>i.e.</p>
  <pre>
@sorted = @unsorted[ 
                    sort { $idx[$a] cmp $idx[$b] } 
                    0 .. $#idx 
                   ];
</pre>

  <p>End of replay.</p>

  <p>Although that line might look complicated on first inspection,
  all it says is,"Give me the elements of @unsorted in the order
  specified by comparing their indexed counterparts." A similar
  example can be found, not coincidentally, in the Perl FAQ. For
