  Using AutoLoader and AutoSplit</h2>

  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  <font size="+2">W</font>ould you prefer to load a library of 10,
  20 or more routines all at once, or only as needed? Perl 5
  formalizes a procedure called autoloading that specifies what
  happens when a program encounters a subroutine that is not
  currently defined. To capitalize upon this, the Perl distribution
  includes some modules to simplify use of this feature, AutoLoader
  and AutoSplit.

  <h3>Why Autoload?</h3>

  <p>I first took interest in the AutoLoader when converting a lot
  of legacy code from Perl 4 to 5. One of the libraries that
  particularly frustrated me was a front end to some RCS utilities.
  The overhead was too high; in a library of 40-50 subroutines, I
  rarely needed more than two-thirds in a given execution, and
  sometimes just a few. Not only did I want to avoid the penalty of
  loading and parsing the whole library, I wanted to keep the
  unneeded routines from ever being loaded in the first place.</p>

  <p>One of the ways in which use differs from require is that it
  loads (that is, reads and compiles) the module at compile time,
  before Perl begins running the script. In Perl 4, which doesn't
  have use, I deferred loading the RCS library as long as possible
  by performing other tasks first, such as validating command-line
  usage, and so on. But as I upgraded, I realized that to take
  advantage of Perl 5, I needed to turn libraries into modules, and
  design my modules around the tools that Perl provides. As a
  result, I turned to the AutoLoader and AutoSplit libraries.</p>

  <p>I'll use a smaller example for this article, a module I
  maintain called Image::Size (available on the CPAN). It's a
  general-purpose utility to read height and width data from image
  files, and even enables CGI scripts to generate HTML height and
  width attributes for image tags. Image::Size supports six image
  formats: GIF, JPEG, XBM, XPM, PPM, and PNG. However, few of these
  are recognized by web browsers, and the odds of having more than
  two or three in a given document are not high. This was a logical
  use of the AutoLoader and AutoSplit libraries, and the library
  was written from the start with the intent of using them.</p>

  <h3>Putting them to use</h3>

  <p>To make your module autoload, first add these two lines to the
  beginning:</p>
  <pre>
	use AutoLoader; 
	*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD;
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>use</tt> statement includes the AutoLoader module, and
  the second line aliases the <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt> subroutine from
  that package into your module's package. As its name suggests,
  <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt> handles a lot of the dirty work of
  autoloading for you. Whenever Perl can't find a subroutine, it
  looks to see if there's an <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt> subroutine, and
  uses that instead.</p>

  <p>The next step is to decide which routines should and should
  not be autoloaded. Code that initializes things, such as the
  <tt>new()</tt> method of a class, will almost certainly be called
  every time the module is loaded, so there's nothing to be gained
  from autoloading - in fact, it even slows down the first call
  slightly. Cluster the subroutines that needn't be autoloaded at
  the top of the module. In Image::Size, there are three such
  subroutines:</p>
  <pre>
        imgsize() 
        html_imgsize() 
        attr_imgsize()
</pre>

  <p><tt>imgsize()</tt> will always be called at least once, and
  the other two subroutines are just frequently invoked wrappers
  around it. In addition, Image::Size contains one subroutine for
  each of the supported image formats:</p>
  <pre>
        gifsize() 
        jpegsize() 
        xbmsize() 
        xpmsize() 
        ppmsize() 
        pngsize()
</pre>

  <p>I didn't want Image::Size to load and parse any of these
  subroutines unless the user had an image in the corresponding
  format. So the next step was to place the special Perl token
  <tt>_ _END_ _</tt> before all of those subroutines:(* Perhaps you
  are wondering why <tt>_ _END_ _</tt> and not _ _DATA_ _? After
  all, there can only be one <tt>_ _END_ _</tt> per file, but a
  file can contain several packages, each with its own <tt>_ _DATA_
  _</tt>. First, using <tt>_ _DATA_ _</tt> would deny the module
  the ability to store static data. Second, the AutoSplit module
  can&rsquo;t handle multiple packages within the same file, so
  there wouldn&rsquo;t be a benefit anyway. )</p>
  <pre>
   sub imgsize {        ... }
   sub html_imgsize { ... }
   sub attr_imgsize { ... }
&#13;       _ _END_ _
&#13;   sub gifsize { ... }         
   sub jpegsize { ... }         
   ...
</pre>

  <p>Perl stops reading whenever it encounters an <tt>_ _END_
  _</tt>. However, a program called AutoSplit (described later)
  knows to look for your module definitions there. Here's what
  Image::Size looks like after AutoSplitting:</p>

  <p><img src="images/autosplitting.gif" width="260" height="286"
  alt="autosplitting"></p>

  <p>AutoSplit "splits out " the subroutines after <tt>_ _END_
  _</tt>, each into its own <tt>.al</tt> file, as the diagram
  shows. Though the subroutines still exist in the original
  Image/Size.pm, Perl will ignore them in favor of the .al files.
  We'll come back to <tt>autosplit.ix</tt> shortly.</p>

  <p>So what happens to the subroutines following <tt>_ _END_
  _</tt>? And when exactly will they be loaded into memory and made
  accessible to your program?</p>

  <h3>Where Perl Looks</h3>

  <p>The <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt> subroutine provided by the AutoLoader
  module searches all the directories in <tt>@INC</tt> (the special
  list of directories that Perl uses to locate modules and library
  files), looking for subdirectories called auto. On the first call
  to <tt>gifsize()</tt>, this subroutine tries to find an
  <tt>auto/Image/Size</tt> directory somewhere in <tt>@INC</tt>,
  and then tries to find a file named <tt>gifsize.al</tt> in that
  directory. If found, it's read in and compiled. Presuming the
  compilation succeeds, Perl uses a special form of the goto
  statement to switch execution to the new routine without altering
  the run-time stack. (This in itself is important - if you are
  running under the debugger, or if you use the Carp module to
  handle warnings and error reports, your subroutine call stack can
  be very important for tracing execution of your program, but
  after autoloading, there will be no trace of the
  <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt> in your stack.)</p>

  <p><b>autosplit.ix.</b> The index created by AutoSplit,
  <tt>autosplit.ix</tt>, declares the package namespace
  (Image::Size, in our example) and predeclares the subroutines to
  be loaded on demand (the six subroutines following the <tt>_
  _END_ _</tt>).</p>

  <p>So if you install Image::Size and then type something like
  this from your prompt:</p>
  <pre>
% perl -e 'use Image::Size; print imgsize("TPJ.gif")'
</pre>

  <p>the <tt>imgsize()</tt> subroutine in Image::Size calls
  <tt>gifsize()</tt>. That subroutine isn't immediately available,
  so the AutoLoader loads it from
  <tt>lib/site_perl/auto/Image/Size/gifsize.al</tt>.</p>

  <p>For a more hands-on example, visit your Perl's lib directory
  and find <tt>auto/POSIX</tt>. This package is too large to use as
  an example here, but that's what makes it a prime candidate for
  autoloading. It's a hundred functions strong, but usually only a
  few will be desired at any one time.</p>

  <h3>Splitting up isn't that hard</h3>

  <p>There's one step I haven't told you about yet: how do you
  create the <tt>*.al</tt> and <tt>autosplit.ix</tt> files that
  <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt> looks for? You know that's done by the
  AutoSplitter, but how is that invoked?</p>

  <p>You could invoke it manually:</p>
  <pre>
% perl -e 'use AutoSplit; autosplit("YourModule.pm", 
                   "YourLibAutoDirectory", 0, 1, 1);
</pre>

  <p>which does five things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Checks that the module does in fact <tt>use
    AutoLoader</tt>.</li>

    <li>Extracts each subroutine after the <tt>_ _END_ _</tt> and
    place it in its own .al file.</li>

    <li>Removes any <tt>*.al</tt> files not referenced in the
    current module, presuming these to be obsolete.</li>

    <li>Creates the <tt>autosplit.ix</tt> file declaring the
    autoloadable subroutines.</li>

    <li>Splits the module only if any previously existing
    <tt>autosplit.ix</tt> file is older than the module.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Or, if you're using MakeMaker (the Perl utility that lets
  module users create makefiles for their particular platform) then
  the Makefile generated by MakeMaker's Makefile.PL will contain
  rules to invoke AutoSplit automatically. However, since MakeMaker
  isn't always available, you can embed the rules in your makefile
  yourself:</p>
  <pre>
PERL = /usr/local/bin/perl      
PERL_LIB = /usr/local/lib/perl5 
PERL_ARCHLIB = /usr/local/lib/perl5/PA-RISC1.1/5.003 
AUTOSPLITFILE = ${PERL} -MAutoSplit -I$(PERL_ARCHLIB) \
  -I$(PERL_LIB) -e 'autosplit($$ARGV[0], $$ARGV[1], 0, 1, 1)'
</pre>

  <p>That's for my HP 712 running HP/UX 9.05. Your paths and
  architecture will certainly be different; use <tt>perl -V</tt> to
  determine your settings:</p>
  <pre>
% perl -V:perlpath
&#13;% perl -V:installsitelib
&#13;% perl -V:installarchlib
</pre>

  <p>Inside your makefile, you'll need to add an "action line "
  such as this:</p>
  <pre>
$(AUTOSPLITFILE) Module.pm /my/perllib/auto
</pre>

  <p>causing Module.pm to be split into the directory
  /my/perllib/auto. That's all there is to it!</p>

  <h3>What About Scripts?</h3>

  <p>The AutoLoader/AutoSplit combination was designed to work only
  on modules, but the notion of deferring work is useful for
  scripts as well. I often combine multiple CGI scripts into a
  single self-referencing script that needs only one or two
  subroutines, depending on the CGI parameters. Why waste cycles
  parsing code that won't be executed?</p>

  <p>Enter a cousin of AutoLoader called <i>SelfLoader</i>. The
  SelfLoader module is similar to AutoLoader, pulling in and
  compiling routines on demand. But unlike AutoLoader, it's meant
  to work within an executing script, and it uses the <tt>_ _DATA_
  _</tt> token rather than <tt>_ _END_ _</tt>.</p>

  <h3>What About C Code?</h3>

  <p>Modern operating systems support the notion of <i>dynamic
  linking</i>: loading chunks of object code (usually compiled from
  C) only when needed. If you want to do this from Perl, use Perl's
  DynaLoader. However, it doesn't provide the Perl-to-C bridge
  code. For that, you need to create stub functions in a language
  called XS; see Otmar Lendl's article on Randomness).</p>

  <h3>In Summary</h3>

  <p>At this point, you now know everything you need to use
  autoloading in your modules. Take that two thousand line module,
  slice it up, improve your application's startup time, and show
  your boss that you deserve a raise. If Image::Size or POSIX don't
  slake your thirst, there are many other CPAN-retrievable packages
  that are good examples of autoloading: Tk, MailTools, and LWP, to
  name a few.</p>

  <p>There are a few other autoloading tidbits I'd like to share.
  First, a caveat: autoloading does exact a load and compile
  penalty for each subroutine loaded on demand. Second, each
  autoloaded subroutine results in an extra file containing code
  the same code that already exists in the module. Third,
  autoloading isn't the only way to dynamically load
  subroutines.</p>

  <p>Lincoln Stein's CGI.pm module uses a self-contained autoload
  scheme that is efficient, ingenious, and obfuscated all at once,
  making use of <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt> but not the AutoLoader.
  Remember that when Perl encounters a call to an undefined
  subroutine, it tries to substitute <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt>, if such a
  subroutine exists in the current package. That subroutine can do
  anything you want. When <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt> is invoked, a
  variable called <tt>$AUTOLOAD</tt> will have been set to the full
  package-qualified name of the desired subroutine (for example,
  <tt>Image::Size::gifsize()</tt>). The special array <tt>@_</tt>
  contains the arguments intended for the subroutine.
  <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt> isn't expected to return a result (except on
  error), but rather transparently pass execution to the
  newly-loaded code.</p>

  <p>Several packages (such as <tt>POSIX</tt> and <tt>DB_File</tt>
  in the core Perl distribution) use their own <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt>
  function, that itself calls the one from AutoLoader.pm. This
  allows local handling of such things as package constants or
  pseudo-routines, while still letting AutoLoader handle the more
  detailed loading tasks.</p>

  <p>Perl 5's autoloading mechanism is yet another reason to
  upgrade from Perl 4. Whether it is Perl code being loaded or
  compiled code being dynamically loaded, on-demand inclusion keeps
  your code lean by only parsing what's necessary. Put it to work
  on your larger modules, and you'll appreciate the results.</p>
