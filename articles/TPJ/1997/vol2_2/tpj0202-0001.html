  <p>The photo below shows such a dial installed outside, and Image
  #3 on shows a dial drawn for the Perl Journal offices in
  Massachusetts. Because the sun occupies any particular position
  in the sky exactly twice per year, two dials are needed: one for
  the days between the winter solstice and the summer solstice
  (December 21 to June 21), and one for the other half of the year.
  The first dial is used in the Winter and Spring, when the sun is
  descending to its lowest angle at the winter solstice. The second
  dial is used in the Summer and Fall, when the sun is rising
  toward its highest angle at the summer solstice.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/sundial2.gif" width="212" height="204" alt=

  </div>

  <p>Before describing how to generate such dials, let me provide a
  little background. Sundials are just about the oldest functioning
  machines known. Dials have been found in Egypt dating from the
  reign of Thutmose III in around 1500 BCE. Mention of them also
  appears in Chinese writings from around that time. The Greeks and
  Romans used them extensively, although their hour lines were of
  equal spacing and so do not represent intervals of equal
  time.</p>

  <p>One of the most famous dials of antiquity, the Tower of the
  Winds, still stands in Athens. It's an octagonal tower about
  fifteen meters high and five across, and was built around 100 CE.
  It has a sundial inscribed on each of its eight faces, and is
  surmounted by a frieze showing figures representing the eight
  winds. It uses iron rods for gnomons, which clearly have not been
  out in the rain for two thousand years, but the dials themselves
  could date back that far. Besides perhaps a few aqueducts, this
  is one of the only Roman devices still working.</p>

  <p>The oldest dial in the U.S. is said to be in Salem,
  Massachusetts, and dates from 1650. Massachusetts can also claim
  the favorite poet of gnomonists, John Greenleaf Whittier, who
  wrote in 1881:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>With warning hand I mark time's rapid flight,<br>
    From life's glad morning to its solemn night.<br>
    Yet through the dear God's love I also show<br>
    There's light above me by the shade below.</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This appears as a motto on nineteenth century dials all over
  the country, and manages to pack a quadruple metaphor into only
  four lines. Sundials are compared to a prophet, to the course of
  life from birth to death, to the promise of heaven, and to its
  contrast with death.</p>

  <p>Sundials are traditionally associated with mortality, of
  course, which may be why they appealed to the Puritan strain in
  New England. It may also be why they are so commonly used as
  garden ornaments; they act as a <i>memento mori</i> in the midst
  of all the greenery. This association is especially evident in a
  giant dial at a Vietnam War memorial in Kentucky. An entire plaza
  is marked off as a sundial, with a giant gnomon at one end. The
  names of all the local men who died in the war are inscribed on
  the plaza, and the tip of the gnomon's shadow brushes across each
  name on the day of the man's death.</p>

  <p>Most dials, though, are simply public sculpture. The Royal
  Observatory at Greenwich, England, has a striking dial with a
  broad cylindrical plate below two arching dolphin tails acting as
  gnomons. The Museum of Science in Worcester, Massachusetts, has a
  dial where the observer acts as the gnomon. You reach up and put
  your finger at the appropriate place on a crossbar, and your
  finger's shadow marks the time. The Mount Laguna Observatory dial
  projects a shadow on a cylindrical map of the world, which shows
  not only the time, but the place in the world where the sun is
  directly overhead. Baltimore has a dial with seventeen facets,
  showing the time in Baltimore, Tokyo, Jerusalem, Sitka, Pitcairn,
  San Francisco, Cape Cod, Rio Jancito, London, Fernando Po, Cape
  Town, and Calcutta, and built by the man who supplied the granite
  for the Library of Congress.</p>

  <h3>Building Your Own</h3>

  <p>So how can you actually draw these dials? The mathematics is
  actually quite straightforward. The key is being able to express
  the position of the sun as a function of date and time. Three
  kinds of motion have to be taken into account: the rotation of
  the earth during the day, the orbiting of the earth around the
  sun, and the slight speedup and slowdown caused by the
  eccentricity of the earth's orbit.</p>

  <p>First let's pick a coordinate system. Imagine that you are
  standing at the North Pole. Almost straight above your head is
  Polaris, the North Star. On the vernal equinox (March 21), one of
  the two days when day and night are of exactly equal length, the
  sun skims exactly along the horizon for 24 hours. Call that
  direction the Z axis, which makes the X and Y axes horizontal.
  Let the X axis point to where the sun sits on the horizon at six
  o'clock in the evening on the vernal equinox. With X and Z fixed,
  Y then points to where the sun is at noon. Our coordinate system
  is shown at the lower left.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table border="0">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="images/v2n2-p4.gif" width="356" height="236"
        alt=
        "Sun position at different times and dates at the North Pole"></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="center"><font size="1"><b>Sun position at
        different times and dates at the North Pole</b></font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>Now the position of the sun can be represented as a vector in
  X, Y, and Z. At 18:00 on the equinox, the sun is directly along
  the X axis, so the sun vector S is (1, 0, 0). In Perl we write
  this as:</p>
  <pre>
@S = (1, 0, 0);   # at 18:00 on equinox
</pre>

  <p>At 12:00, the sun is on the Y axis, so</p>
  <pre>
@S = (0, 1, 0);   # at 12:00 on equinox
</pre>

  <p>The sun vector rotates clockwise around the Z axis according
  to the time of day, going 360 degrees in 24 hours. In polar
  coordinates, the angle between the sun and the X axis is called
  the <i>right ascension</i>, and the angle between the sun and the
  horizontal plane is called the <i>declination</i>. However,
  Cartesian coordinates are easier to deal with, as we'll see later
  on.</p>

  <p>So let's define a function, <tt>RotZ()</tt>, that rotates a
  three-element vector <tt>@V</tt> by an angle <tt>$a</tt> in
  radians:</p>
  <pre>
sub RotZ { 
    local ($a, @V) = @_; 
    return ($V[0] * cos ($a) + $V[1] * sin ($a),
           -$V[0] * sin ($a) + $V[1] * cos ($a), $V[2]); 
}
</pre>

  <p>Now we can express the sun vector on the equinox as a function
  of the time in hours, $h, as</p>
  <pre>
@S = &amp;RotZ (($h - 18) * $twopi/24, (1, 0, 0)); 
</pre>

  <p>This takes a unit vector (1, 0, 0) at 18:00, and rotates it by
  the number of hours after 18:00.</p>

  <p>However, the sun is not fixed compared to the background stars
  - it moves all the way around the sky in the course of a year. Of
  course, it's the earth that's actually moving around the sun, but
  for our purposes the situation is symmetric, so we can pretend
  the sun is moving. The sun moves along a path called the
  <i>ecliptic</i>, which is tilted at an angle of about 23.5
  degrees to the horizon at the North Pole. At its highest point on
  the summer solstice (June 21), the sun will be 23.5 degrees above
  the horizon all "day" long, and at its lowest point on the winter
  solstice (December 21), it'll be 23.5 degrees below. To work this
  motion into the sun vector, an initial vector can be rotated
  around Z by a date angle, and then the result rotated by the
  ecliptic angle around X:</p>
  <pre>
sub RotX { 
    local ($a, $V) = @_; 
    return ($V[0], $V[1] * cos ($a) + $V[2] * sin ($a), 
                  -$V[1] * sin ($a) + $V[2] * cos ($a));
} 
&#13;$e_angle = 23.5 * $twopi / 360; # ecliptic angle in radians
$date_angle = ($day - $VernalEquinox) * $twopi / 365.24;
@S = &amp;RotX ($e_angle, &amp;RotZ ($date_angle, (1, 0, 0)));
</pre>

  <p>Note that the date angle will be zero on the vernal
  equinox.</p>

  <p>One other correction needs to be made. The earth does not move
  at equal speed along its orbit for the whole year. It moves
  fastest when the ellipticity of its orbit brings it closest to
  the sun, and slowest when it is farthest away. This causes the
  sun to be a few minutes ahead of or behind where it would be if
  the orbit were a perfect circle. The point of closest approach is
  called perihelion, and occurs on December 31. The most distant
  point is called aphelion and occurs on July 1. The dates of
  <i>perihelion</i> and <i>aphelion</i> change slowly over time, as
  does the eccentricity of the earth's orbit.(The combination of
  these two effects produces cycles hundreds of thousands of years
  long. These are called Milankovitch cycles, and are thought to
  have enough influence on the earth&rsquo;s climate to have been a
  cause of the Ice Ages.) To first order, the effect of the
  eccentricity can be expressed by:</p>
  <pre>
$date_angle += ((1 + $eccentricity) ** 2 - 1) *
           sin (($day - $Aphelion) * $twopi / 365.24);
</pre>

  <p>where <tt>$eccentricity</tt> is 0.0169, the ratio of the
  distance between the ellipse's foci and its major axis. Circles
  have an eccentricity of 0, and straight lines have an
  eccentricity of 1. <tt>$aphelion</tt> is the number of days from
  January 1 to July 1.</p>

  <p>The above equations can be combined to give a vector for the
  sun at any time and day at the North Pole. Since few of The Perl
  Journal's readers live there, however, we must adjust for other
  latitudes and longitudes. The latitude can be handled by another
  rotation, this time around the X axis:</p>
  <pre>
#latitude angle in radians
$l_angle = (90 - $latitude) * $twopi/360; 
&#13;@S = &amp;RotX ($l_angle, @S);
</pre>

  <p>The longitude is a little more complicated, since clock time
  matches sun time only in the center of time zones. Each time zone
  is 15 degrees of longitude wide (360 degrees of longitude divided
  by 24 time zones), and is centered on every fifteenth degree.
  Thus Greenwich Standard Time is plus or minus 7.5 degrees of
  longitude zero, Eastern Standard Time is plus or minus 7.5
  degrees of longitude 75 degrees, and so on. The initial hour time
  must therefore be corrected for the distance from the central
  longitude:</p>
  <pre>
$h_angle += ($longitude - $CentralLongitude) * 
            $twopi * 15 / 360;
</pre>

  <p>The central longitudes for Eastern, Central, Mountain, and
  Pacific Standard Time are 75, 90, 105, and 120 degrees
  respectively. For the UK the central longitude is zero (since the
  British came up with this scheme they got to put themselves in
  the center), for Japan it's -135 (longitude east of Greenwich is
  negative) and for eastern Australia it's -150. (One should also
  correct by an hour if Daylight Savings Time is in effect.
  Unfortunately, DST goes into effect on different days in
  different countries.)</p>

  <p>After all these transformations, we finally have a vector for
  the sun at a particular day, time, and place. We now need to find
  the position of the tip of the gnomon on the sundial plate. This
  is where the Cartesian representation of the vector becomes
  convenient. The figure below shows how the tip vector <i>T</i> is
  the sum of the gnomon vector <i>G</i>, minus the sun vector
  scaled by a multiplier <i>m</i>. Since the gnomon and the tip
  vectors are at right angles, their dot product is zero. In vector
  notation this can be written:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table border="0">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="images/v2n2-p5.gif" width="329" height="239"
        alt="Vector Diagram of Sun, Gnomon, and Shadow"></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="center"><font size="1"><b>Vector Diagram of Sun,
        Gnomon, and Shadow</b></font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <pre>
T = G - mS and G &bull; T = 0
</pre>

  <p>To solve for m, we can perform a dot product on both
  sides:</p>
  <pre>
       G &bull; T = G &bull; (G - mS) 
=&gt;         0 = G &bull; G - m(G &bull; S) 
=&gt;         m = |G| / Sz
</pre>

  <p>If <i>G</i> is defined to be the local unit Z axis (i.e. the
  gnomon sticks straight up and is of unit length), then G =
  (0,0,1) and in Perl we can write:</p>
  <pre>
@T = (-$S[0] / $S[2], -$S[1] / $S[2], 0);
</pre>And that's it! We can now position any kind of mark anywhere
on the dial starting with the date and time. We can mark exact
dates and times, or draw segments between points for lines of
constant time or date. The full code for finding the sun vector is
in the routine <tt>GetSunV()</tt> in the code listing, and the tip
vector is in <tt>GetTipV()</tt>.

  <p>In the output shown below, the hyperbolas are lines of
  constant date. That is, they track the gnomon shadow on the days
  of the summer solstice and winter solstice. The S-shaped lines
  are of constant time, where the thick lines mark the hours, and
  the dashed lines are at ten minute intervals. The little round
  mark shows the position of the gnomon, and the bar above it shows
  how long it should be. To use the dial, just install a gnomon of
  the correct length, lay the dial exactly horizontally in a sunny
  place, and rotate it until the time read matches a clock's time.
  The time can be matched down to the minute. The precision is
  limited by the fuzziness of the tip of the shadow. Since the sun
  isn't a point source, the shadow tip isn't perfectly sharp.</p>

    border="0" width="200" height="264" alt=
    "Summer and Winter solstice"></a>
  </div>

  <p>The above math can even be extended to handle dials that are
  not horizontal. Take the sun vector and rotate it around Z to
  handle dials that are not aligned north-south, then rotate it
  around X by whatever angle it is tilted at. This allows one to
  create dials on any kind of surfaces: cubes, icosahedrons, or
  even buckyballs.</p>

  <p>To see more examples of what people have done with sundials,
  check out the Web page of the British Sundial Society at <a href=
  "http://www.sundials.co.uk" target=
  "resource window">http://www.sundials.co.uk</a>. They have
  pointers to pictures and descriptions of dials all over the
  world. The US and Canada have the North American Sundial Society
  (NASS) at <a href="http://www.shadow.net/~bobt/nass/nass.htm"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www.shadow.net/~bobt/nass/nass.htm</a>.
  They publish a quarterly journal called <i>The Compendium</i>, a
  compendium being "a single instrument incorporating a variety of
  dial types and ancillary tools."</p>

  <p>The NASS was formed in only 1994. It's just the sort of
  organization made possible by the Web, since no one city is
  likely to have enough gnomonists to support a society. The old
  line about New York City applies even more strongly to the Web:
  "If you&rsquo;re one in a million, there are a hundred others
  like you out on the Internet."</p>

  <p>The full listing of my program can be found at TPJ&rsquo;s web
  site. The entire program is a few hundred lines long, but
  you&rsquo;ve seen the few key lines above. (Like most software,
  10% of the code does 90% of the work.) Still, those few lines are
  the distilled result of thousands of years of mathematics and
  astronomy. What used to require the career of an expert
  mathematician now takes a dozen lines of Perl. Modern techniques
  like vector algebra, and modern machinery like Perl and
  PostScript, can bring a very old instrument to life again.</p>
