  <h4><i>Felix Gallo</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  <font size="+2">S</font>ummer is in the air, and young hackers'
  thoughts turn to writing gloriously awful code. And yes, despite
  our editors' protestations, despite the restraining order,
  despite even explicit medical advice from our therapists, we're
  once again proud to bring you the infamous, world-renounced
  Obfuscated Perl Contest.

  <p>The objective: to determine who can write the most devious,
  inhuman, disgusting, amusing, amazing, and bizarre Perl code.</p>

  <p>The prizes: a lovingly manufactured trophy made of high
  durability space age materials, suitable for brazen display or
  shameful and secretive night burial. Also <tt>ord 'd'</tt>
  dollars.</p>

  <p>But wait! Before you rush to your keyboard to craft your
  outr&egrave; &aelig;uvre, here are the categories in which you
  may enter:</p>

  <h3>1. MOST POWERFUL</h3>

  <p>This award is granted to the code which does the most with the
  least. The limit on bytecount is 512 characters, not including
  whitespace.</p>

  <h3>2. MOST CREATIVE</h3>

  <p>This award goes to the most stunningly intriguing or
  ridiculously hilarious combination of obfuscation and
  functionality. The limit is 1024 bytes of Perl code, not
  including whitespace.</p>

  <h3>3. BEST 'THE PERL JOURNAL'</h3>

  <p>In the fine 'just another Perl hacker' tradition, this award
  is given to the best code which generates the text 'The Perl
  Journal'. Case and context are unimportant. The limit is 1024
  bytes of Perl code, not including whitespace.</p>

  <h3>4. BEST YEAR 2000 ERROR</h3>

  <p><i>"Marsh &amp; McLennan Inc. is offering businesses a hedge
  against Year 2000 problems. The New York insurance broker will
  sell up to $200 million worth of insurance against business
  losses caused by the policyholder's own computer system, or by
  another company's neglect to become Year 2000-compliant, or by
  data supplied by another company's computers. Before the policy
  is issued, however, Marsh &amp; McLennan will enlist experts to
  make sure that the policy-buyer is taking all possible steps to
  avoid Year 2000 problems." (Information Week 3 Feb 97, via
  EDUPAGE)</i></p>

  <p>It's hard to escape the conclusion that crafting obfuscated
  code can be not just enjoyable but profitable as well. For $200
  million, can you hide a Year 2000 bug well enough to fool some
  insurance salesmen?</p>

  <p>In addition to these four categories, the judges will award
  one applicant the coveted and yet feared 'BEST OF SHOW'
  award.</p>

  <h3>THE RULES</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>All programs must run under Perl 5.004.</li>

    <li>Programs may use only the functionality included in the
    basic Perl distribution found on CPAN. No modules, patches, or
    extensions beyond those included in the standard distribution
    are available.</li>

    <li>Programs will be run on the judges' choice of platforms.
    The only guarantees about these platforms are that their
    interpreters pass <tt>make test</tt>, they have at least 4
    megabytes of available user-space memory, and they have at
    least 1 megabyte of external storage. Programs may use whatever
    resources they find available beyond those limits,
    however.</li>

    <li>Submitted programs remain the credited property of the
    author, but may be duplicated, quoted, edited for style and
    disseminated freely by The Perl Journal and the contest judging
    committee.</li>

    <li>All programs should be uploaded by anonymous FTP to tpj.com
    in the directory pub/orwant/obfuscated by July 25, 1997. The
    tar (or zip) archive must contain the following items:</li>
  </ol>

  <ul>
    <li>The program.</li>

    <li>A README file providing attribution (including your e-mail
    address) and the category the program is for. Please provide no
    information about how the program works or what it does in the
    README file.</li>

    <li>A SOLUTION file explaining how the program works.

      <p>The archive should be named
      <tt>YOURNAME.CATEGORYNUM.ENTRYNUM.tar</tt></p>

      <p>Entries submitted in a different fashion might result in
      confusion, hassle, and entries getting lost, so please try to
      abide. If you can't, please send mail to contest@tpj.com
      explaining why. Entries will not be accepted via e-mail, HTTP
      POST, NNTP, or singing telegram.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The winners and their winning submissions will be announced
    in issue #7 of TPJ, in comp.lang.perl.announce, and on the TPJ
    Web site.</li>

    <li>The lone employee of The Perl Journal is not permitted to
    enter the contest.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>

  <p>As last time, judging will take place in three phases.</p>

  <p>In the first phase, we'll read the README and then examine the
  program carefully in order to assess its aesthetics. Any code we
  actually understand at this point is probably not obfuscated
  enough.</p>

  <p>In the second phase, we'll run the code, examine the output,
  and read the code again in light of its output.</p>

  <p>In the third phase, we will perform unnamed rituals with
  filters, pretty printers, debuggers, and whatever else we can
  think of to determine how the code works. Any code that we don't
  understand at the end of this phase is probably a winner, at
  which point we'll give up in tears and look at the SOLUTIONS
  file.</p>

  <h3>HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS</h3>

  <p>Judging obfuscation and what's 'cool', 'neat' or 'best' is a
  subjective process. However, here are some general guidelines
  which might help you design your entry.</p>

  <p>Overuse of one particular obfuscation method risks being
  tedious. Entries which demonstrate breadth, range, and knowledge
  are likely to beat entries which rely on repeated parlor
  tricks.</p>

  <p>Being clever and humorous is good. As an example, a past
  winner in the Obfuscated C contest (our pale, weaker cousin)
  formatted his code in the shape of a maze; the program read its
  own source code and implemented an ASCII 3D maze walking
  program.</p>

  <p>Being surprising and deceitful is very good. Bonus points are
  awarded for obfuscated code which is not only syntactically
  obfuscated, but semantically obfuscated - code which appears to
  do one thing but does another is deemed extremely devilish.</p>

  <p>Being poetic is also very good.</p>

  <p>Entries needn't contain a <tt>#!/usr/bin/perl</tt> (or
  equivalent), unless they use nonobvious command-line switches.
  Neither the <tt>#!/usr/bin/perl</tt> nor the command-line
  switches will count toward the character limits.</p>

  <p>Programs which purposefully crash machines or cause system
  problems tend to be unamusing, so please consider saving them for
  the Perl system destroyers' contest.</p>

  <p>The best examples of quality obfuscation are the four category
  winners from last year's 0th Annual Obfuscated Perl Contest,
  shown on the next page. (Note that the 0th Annual Contest sported
  a Best Four Line Signature category instead of the Year 2000
  category.)</p>

  <h3>SO THERE YOU HAVE IT</h3>

  <p>Please submit early and often, and encourage anyone you know
  who might be interested to do the same.</p>

  <p>Although Perl has taken some hard knocks as being a write-only
  language (and this contest could be construed as an unabashed
  celebration of that fact), the intent of this contest is to
  demonstrate Perl's tersity and power, while at the same time
  giving the creative and demented minds of the Internet's legions
  a fun, intriguing playground. So have fun!</p>

  <p>Although we do not accept any entries via e-mail (FTP only, as
  above), questions regarding this contest or its rules should be
  directed to contest@tpj.com.</p>

  <p>We look forward with some trepidation to seeing your code!</p>
