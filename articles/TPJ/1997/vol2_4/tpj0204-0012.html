  Until I became acquainted with GIMPS, the Great Internet Mersenne
  Prime Search (http://www.mersenne.org), the idle cycles on my
  workstation were spent entirely in wait states. No longer. Now my
  computer continuously runs a program that breaks new mathematical
  ground. Even as I write this, it's running in the intervals
  between my keystrokes, factoring large numbers as part of an
  Internet-wide coordinated effort to find the highest known prime
  number. In this article I'll describe how I use Perl not for
  factoring - a C program does that - but for automating
  communication with the computer (and person) in charge of GIMPS.

  <p>Recently, the world has seen two large problems successfully
  attacked with massively distributed systems, an approach
  sometimes called "metacomputing." On June 18, the DES Challenge
  (DESCHALL), which teamed up computers around the world to
  decipher a message encrypted with a 56-bit RSA secret key,
  succeeded. On August 24, the GIMPS project demonstrated that
  2<sup>2976221</sup>-1 is a prime number. Both DESCHALL and GIMPS
  are computer programs that ran with low priority on thousands of
  computers volunteered around the world.</p>

  <p>Prime numbers are integers that can be evenly divided only by
  themselves and one. They are considered by number theorists to be
  basic building blocks of arithmetic; all whole numbers have
  exactly one set of "prime factors" which multiply together to
  produce them. General truths about primes, such as that there are
  infinitely many of them, have been pursued by mathematicians
  since Euclid wrote <i>Elements</i> 2300 years ago. Computers
  provide us with powers of calculation that were impossible
  decades ago, and inconceivable centuries ago.</p>

  <p>But why search for ever-larger prime numbers? What good does
  it do? One answer is that the search for prime numbers is merely
  symbolic, like mountain climbing or space exploration. Just as
  new technologies are used to explore previously unknown places,
  new approaches to calculation further the reaches of mathematical
  knowledge. Before mechanical calculation, Edouard Lucas's
  2<sup>127</sup>-1 was the largest known prime number, even though
  people had known forever since Euclid that there was necessarily
  one greater. This record stood from 1876 to 1951, which was a
  very busy year. A larger prime was found by a man with a
  mechanical calculator. Then a team with an electrical computer
  found a dozen higher ones.</p>

  <p>So what difference can finding a new highest prime number
  make? Outside of the prestige of having your name appear in math
  almanacs, not a lot. George Woltman's GIMPS project is just for
  fun. Not that there's anything wrong with that; my personal
  daydream is a distributed computerized Go opponent. Other
  metacomputing projects, in which thousands of computers work
  independently and simultaneously on different portions of a large
  problem like weather modeling, may have bearing on less frivolous
  tasks. The DESCHALL project showed that 56-bit RSA keys are not
  secure.</p>

  <p>Mersenne numbers, named after the French monk Marin Mersenne
  (1588-1648), are numbers of the form 2<sup>p</sup>-1, where
  <i>p</i> is a prime number. Since Mersenne was born, the highest
  known prime number since Mersenne was born has always been either
  a Mersenne prime or a factor of a Mersenne composite, except for
  a brief period in 1951.</p>

  <p>It's not that Mersenne numbers tend to be prime, it's just
  vastly easier to test them. Most numbers require exhaustive
  factoring to determine primality, but it's possible to test a
  Mersenne number for primality with only bit-rotation and
  addition, using a method called the "Lucas-Lehmer test." The
  relative ease of the Lucas method of verifying primality is what
  made Lucas' prime, 2<sup>127</sup>-1, reign as the highest known
  prime number before mechanical computing devices. Since 127 is
  prime, Lucas' prime is also a Mersenne prime.</p>

  <p>Currently 35 Mersenne numbers are known to be prime, and more
  are being tested even as you are reading these words. The tool is
  a <i>mprime</i>, written by George Woltman and optimized for the
  Intel x86 architecture. <i>mprime</i> survives sudden shutdown or
  termination by keeping its state written out to a file, so not
  all work is lost if the program is interrupted. A more generic
  version of mprime suitable for other architectures is
  <i>mers</i>, distributed as C source code by Will Edgington, at
  ftp://ftp.delta.com/pub/users/mersenne.</p>

  <p>Here's how to enroll your computer in GIMPS.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Download <i>mprime</i> (the Lucas-Lehmer factoring
    software) and the database of factors.</li>

    <li>Reserve a range of numbers to factor or test, to avoid
    duplication of effort.</li>

    <li>Configure your machine to launch the software on
    reboot.</li>

    <li>Launch the software.</li>
  </ol>My <i>mprime.sh</i> and <i>NewAssignment.pl</i> scripts
  (both available from the TPJ web site) automate all but step 1.
  That requires an account named mprime on your Unix system and
  this .netrc file in its home directory:
  <pre>
machine ftp.mersenne.org 
login anonymous 
password mprimescripts_user 
macdef init 
binary get database.gz 
! gunzip --force database.gz 
quit
</pre>

  <p>You'll also need to set up a <i>cron</i> job (type <tt>man
  cron</tt> or <tt>man crontab</tt> at your Unix command line) to
  periodically FTP from ftp.mersenne.org. A crontab entry like this
  will do:</p>
  <pre>
# periodically download a new database 
51 3 25 * * ftp ftp.mersenne.org
</pre>

  <p>(The five fields at the beginning of crontab entries represent
  the minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week. The above
  entry will download a new database at 51 minutes after 3 am, on
  the 25th of the month, on every month (that's the first *) and
  regardless of the day of the week (the second *). Please choose
  different numbers to avoid a network bottleneck. Better yet,
  uncomment the <tt># ftp ftp.mersenne.org</tt> line in
  <i>mprime.sh</i> after your <i>.netrc</i> file is working. People
  installing <i>mprime</i> on machines without permanent network
  connections (like myself) will of course get errors unless their
  dialup connections are brought up before running FTP.</p>

  <p>When this <i>cron</i> job runs, it invokes the FTP program
  with one command line argument: ftp.mersenne.org. The FTP program
  then connects to ftp.mersenne.org and checks the local
  <i>.netrc</i> file for instructions pertaining to the connection.
  That <i>.netrc</i> file will make FTP log in as
  <tt>anonymous</tt>, provide a password of
  <tt>mprimescripts_user</tt>, change the mode of the FTP
  connection to binary, and download <i>database.gz</i>, the
  database of factors. After downloading, the line starting with
  the exclamation point is passed to a shell. Provided
  <i>gunzip</i> is available, the database will be uncompressed,
  overwriting the old one (that's what the <tt>--force</tt> is
  for).</p>

  <p>Although steps two, three, and four could have been included
  in a slightly more complex Perl program, the vast majority of the
  system's running time is spent waiting for <i>mprime</i> to
  complete, which means that the program will be mostly sitting
  around doing nothing. That's why we want a program that will
  consume minimal memory. The winner isn't Perl, alas, but a shell
  script: and a little used one at that: <i>ash</i>. I don't use
  Perl for everything, just what it's best suited to: practically
  extracting data from a report. That report is the "Choose a Range
  page" and the data are the range of numbers to be given to
  mprime.</p>

  <table width="260" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5"
  align="right">
    <tr>
      <td><a href="images/nicol-fig1.gif"><img src=
      "images/nicol-fig1_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
      "Figure 1: The Choose a Range Page, parsed by NewAssignment.pl"
      border="0" width="250" height="298"></a><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1"><b>Figure 1: The Choose a Range Page, parsed
      by NewAssignment.pl</b></font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The shell script <i>mprime.sh</i> invokes the <i>mprime</i>
  program with command line arguments read from a file called
  <i>assignment</i>, stands patiently by while it runs, and then
  invokes <a href="tpj0204-0012a.html"><i>NewAssignment.pl</i></a>
  once mprime completes its assignment and needs a new one. To
  preserve <i>mprime</i>'s "killability," <i>mprime.sh</i> checks
  the <i>results</i> file created by <i>mprime</i> to see if
  <i>mprime</i> actually finished its task or was terminated
  abnormally.</p>

  <p>Unless the words "Please send the results file to" appear in
  the results file, it is assumed that <i>mprime</i> was killed by
  a signal, which means that something is wrong and it's time for
  <i>mprime.sh</i> to quit. Otherwise, <i>mprime.sh</i> archives
  the results file, mails George Woltman the results file, and runs
  <a href="tpj0204-0012a.html"><i>NewAssignment.pl</i></a> to
  choose a new assignment. You'll have to edit lines 59 and 76 so
  that the mail program on your system is invoked with the correct
  options.</p>

  <p>Choosing a new assignment is too complex a task for a shell
  script; luckily, Perl's regular expression support makes it easy.
  <a href="tpj0204-0012a.html"><i>NewAssignment.pl</i></a>
  downloads the web page, chooses a range based on its contents,
  and mails George Woltman a claim to the range. This approach
  could easily be adapted to other large problems that can be
  cleanly divided into smaller problems.</p>

  <p>The first step in choosing a new GIMPS assignment is obtaining
  the list of available assignments by downloading George Woltman's
  Choose a Range page at http://www.mersenne.org/range.htm. The
  lynx text-based web browser is used; it takes a command line
  switch, <tt>-dump</tt>, that makes it print a web page to
  standard output. In Perl, external programs are launched (and
  their output retrieved) with backquotes:</p>
  <pre>
# load the "reserve a range" web page into a variable: 
$ChooseARangePage = 
           'lynx -dump http://www.mersenne.org/range.htm';
</pre>

  <p>This gives us the web page we need. We could also have used
  the LWP library from the CPAN to create a virtual web browser,
  and then we wouldn't even need <i>lynx</i>.</p>

  <p>There are three sets of ranges. Each range begins with a
  description of what the task is, followed by the words "a range
  of" and the minimum recommended range size, followed by more
  words, the last of which is "from," followed by a comma-separated
  list of pairs of the form <i>M</i> to <i>N</i>, where <i>M</i>
  and <i>N</i> are both natural numbers. A period terminates the
  range.</p>

  <p>This structure can be represented as a Perl regular
  expression:</p>
  <pre>
m/a range of (\d+) .*? from ([\s0-9to,]+)\./s
</pre>

  <p>Here's a quick review of the regular expression atoms
  used:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <tt>m</tt> (matching operator) begins the regular
    expression.</li>

    <li>The text <tt>a range of</tt> matches exactly those words,
    wherever they appear.</li>

    <li><tt>\d</tt> matches any one of the digits 0123456789.</li>

    <li><tt>+</tt> means "one or more," so <tt>\d+</tt> matches one
    or more digits.</li>

    <li>Parentheses remember their contents, in this case
    <tt>\d+</tt>. That's the first and lower of the suggested range
    sizes.</li>

    <li>Dot matches any character. (Except newline, unless the
    regex has the <tt>/s</tt> modifier. Ours will.)</li>

    <li><tt>*</tt> means "zero or more," so .<tt>*</tt> matches as
    many characters as possible. This is often called "greedy
    matching."</li>

    <li>But <tt>?</tt> after <tt>*</tt> or <tt>+</tt> means match
    as little as possible, so <tt>.*?</tt> means match a few
    characters as possible.</li>

    <li>Square brackets define a set of characters, in this case an
    <tt>\s</tt> (whitespace), a digit between <tt>0</tt> and
    <tt>9</tt>, a <tt>t</tt>, an <tt>o</tt>, or a comma.</li>

    <li>(<tt>[\s0-9to,]+</tt>) thus matches substrings like
    <tt>8</tt> to <tt>80</tt> and <tt>9to9,999</tt>.</li>

    <li>\. matches an actual period.</li>
  </ul>The part of this regex that matches the range in
  NewAssignment.pl is called <tt>$RangeMatcher</tt>:
  <pre>
$RangeMatcher = '.*a range of (\d+) .* from ([\s0-9to,]+)\.';
</pre>

  <p><tt>$RangeMatcher</tt> is defined as a single-quoted string so
  that the special regex characters aren't translated. If it were
  doublequoted, the backslashes in it would be inadvertently
  interpreted before the match took place.</p>

  <p>Coupled with another word to localize the search to a part of
  the file, this regex remembers the number of numbers we want to
  test and the comma-separated list of ranges. We can assign them
  to two variables:</p>
  <pre>
($PortionSize, $RangeListing) =
           ($ChooseARangePage =~ m/$PreText$RangeMatcher/s);
</pre>

  <p>We know what <tt>$RangeMatcher</tt> matches now; the other
  part of the regex is <tt>$PreText</tt>, the text before the
  range. There are five tasks we might want our computer to
  attempt. The first three are called B1, B2, and B3 in
  <i>NewAssignment.pl</i>, and search for increasingly larger sets
  of Mersenne primes. Task R checks "reclaimed" numbers that were
  dropped by other users, and task F factors known composites to
  speed up others' Lucas-Lehmer tests. Each task requires a
  slightly different regular expression for the Choose a Range
  page; task F in particular requires that the <tt>-f</tt>
  command-line switch be provided to mprime.</p>

  <p>Once we've decided what we want to do by randomly selecting
  B1, B2, B3, R, or F in line 22, the script invokes <i>lynx</i> to
  capture the web page. This happens inside a loop, in case the
  local network or www.mersenne.org is down. Once we have the web
  page, it's matched against <tt>/$PreText$RangeMatcher/s</tt>, and
  if all goes well it matches and sets <tt>$PortionSize</tt> and
  <tt>$RangeListing</tt> appropriately for whichever assignment
  we've chosen.</p>

  <p>Making it past the <i>until</i> loop means that
  <tt>$PortionSize</tt> and <tt>$RangeListing</tt> have been
  successfully set. The only change that might be necessary is if
  we're running <i>mprimescripts</i> on a speedy machine that can
  handle an unusually large range (line 42). Massaging
  <tt>$RangeListing</tt> takes a few steps. The script strips the
  whitespace out (line 44), splits the result on commas into
  <tt>@Ranges</tt> (line 45), chooses one of those elements at
  random (line 47), and splits on the word "to" to extract the
  lower and upper boundaries of the range (line 49). If we're
  ambitious enough to have increased <tt>$PortionSize</tt> in line
  42, it's possible that our range isn't big enough, in which case
  lines 51 through 55 redefine <tt>$High</tt> as <tt>$Low</tt> plus
  <tt>$PortionSize</tt>.</p>

  <p>All that remains is to write <tt>$Assignment</tt> into the
  assignment file, and mail mprime and George Woltman with the
  selected range. All mail sent from <i>mprimescripts</i> has
  subject lines which could be filtered by software such as
  <i>procmail</i> and directed to another Perl script for similar
  automation. Of course, to adapt this system for use in a
  different distributed idle-time project, you'll need an
  equivalent of George Woltman: a central authority responsible for
  declaring which assignments are available.</p>

  <p>Mathematicians who have theories about where the next Mersenne
  prime occurs can reserve that range in the hope of getting their
  names in the history books; in contrast, <i>NewAssignment.pl</i>
  chooses its assignment randomly to minimize the possibility of
  collisions, since random selection from a long list of choices is
  a good way to lower the probability of duplications. In fully
  automated systems designed from the beginning to be distributed,
  the clients might query a central server for their next
  assignment instead. The DESCHALL project, for instance, was
  distributed as source code, and each client program in the brute
  force search of the 56-bit RSA key space checked into a central
  key server regularly to get a new range of numbers. (Had DESCHALL
  not been distributed as source code, this would have been a
  substantial security risk. Allowing foreign programs access to
  your computer is risky without assurance that the metacomputing
  client does only what it's supposed to be doing.)</p>
