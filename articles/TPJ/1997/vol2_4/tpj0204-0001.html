  Out of a possible 99 points on a professor's final exam, one
  student, the worst in the class, scored only 47. She marked his
  test, 47.4747...%, since that's 47 / 99. Another student got 83
  correct, so she wrote 83.8383...% at the top. But when she found
  that one student had gotten all 99 correct, she wrote 99.9999...%
  on the exam. After a moment's reflection, she added, "Although I
  can find nothing at fault with your answers, somehow you seem to
  have fallen a little short of perfection!"

  <h3>A Surprising Program</h3>

  <p>Consider another scenario. Your manager shows you this
  program:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w 
# See whether Perl can add? 

use strict; 
my $total = 19.08 + 2.01; 
my $expected_total = 21.09; 
print "The total is \$$total\n"; 
print "The expected total is \$$expected_total\n";
if ($total == $expected_total) { 
    print "They are equal.\n"; 
} else { 
    print "They aren't equal.\n"; 
}
</pre>

  <p>When he ran it, this is what he saw:</p>
  <pre>
The total is $21.09 
The expected total is $21.09 
They aren't equal.
</pre>

  <p>(You might not get exactly the same output on your machine.
  But there is a similar program that "fails" in the same way.)</p>

  <p>Your manager wants you to stop using Perl, since you're
  developing a financial application and Perl clearly has serious
  bugs in its ability to handle basic arithmetic.</p>

  <p>One of your co-workers pops in to say that he can fix that
  program. In a moment, he's re-coded the comparison to look like
  the following. "Now it works!" he says. "I use this trick all the
  time in my scripts." What do you think?</p>
  <pre>
# A better way?
if ($total =~ /$expected_total/) { 
    print "They are equal.\n"; 
} else { 
    print "They aren't equal.\n"; 
}
</pre>

  <p>This prints:</p>
  <pre>
The total is $21.09
The expected total is $21.09
They are equal.
</pre>

  <p>What went wrong? The professor, manager, and co-worker all
  made the mistake of confusing a numeral - a number's
  representation - with the number itself. In the Professor's case,
  she assumed that the number she was writing as 99.9999... was
  somehow different than 100.(Don't believe that 99.9999... is
  exactly equal to 100? Consider that 0.3333... times 3 is
  0.9999... But 0.3333... is one-third, and three times one-third
  is one. So 0.9999... is the same thing as 1.0, and therefore
  99.9999... is 100.)</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, your manager <i>can't</i> count on Perl to know
  how to add a few numbers. It's not Perl's fault; this problem
  affects every computer and every programming language in one way
  or another. The truth is, whenever you add, subtract, multiply,
  or divide in Perl, you're not using numbers. You're using
  numerals, and therein lies the difference.</p>

  <p>Remember the number line? Infinitely long, every real number
  is found somewhere along this line. Stand at the zero position,
  with one, two, three falling neatly in order on one side,
  negative one, two, and three on the other. If you look closely,
  you can see non-integers like 1.5 and two-thirds. <img src=
  "images/pie.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0" alt="pi"> is
  in there, so is <b><i>e</i></b>, and one trillion. If you squint,
  you can see a googol (10<sup>100</sup> ) in the distance, and
  beyond that a googolplex (10<sup>googol</sup>). Somewhere near
  here, still in sight, is the point which represents your age,
  slipping away so slowly that it takes a whole year to crawl from
  one integer to the next. For most of us nonmathematicians, these
  are all the numbers we'll ever need or want. These are the
  numbers that most people mean when they think of arithmetic. But
  what we actually use for arithmetic on a computer is a numeral,
  which isn't always the same.</p>

  <p>A numeral is merely a representation of a number. Hardly
  anybody makes this distinction between "number" and "numeral" in
  casual usage, or even in documentation. I certainly don't, and I
  don't expect anyone else to do so. But I've tried to make it
  clear in this article which I mean, although I occasionally use
  standard computer science terms like "double precision number,"
  which is actually a numeral. Alas.</p>

  <p>Of course, we all work with common numbers like 29, 19.95, and
  -40, and even less common ones like 5.004, 6.022 x
  10<sup>23</sup>, and 98.6. But few of us work with <img src=
  "images/pie.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0" alt="pi">
  itself, for example. Instead, we call upon one of its close
  friends, like 3.14159, knowing (or forgetting) that we are
  missing the mark by a tiny bit. (Not that it usually matters in
  everyday life. If you used that value in place of <img src=
  "images/pie.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0" alt="pi"> to
  calculate how long a string you'd need to encircle the moon's
  equator, you'd be off by just a few meters - and your error would
  likely be dwarfed by the fact that the moon isn't perfectly
  round.) Similarly, when we work with the number two-thirds, we
  are usually satisfied with 0.66667 or so; with many numbers like
  the 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> I mentioned earlier, we intentionally
  retain only a few significant digits because that's all we
  need.</p>

  <p>These numerals don't behave the same as the numbers they
  represent. If you triple 0.66667, you get 2.00001. That's not
  two, even though the professor's students might disagree.</p>

  <p>Computers work with different numerals, but in a similar way.
  If we want to store the number 7 exactly in a computer's memory,
  that's not hard to do. But most real numbers need to be stored as
  an approximation, and this affects the accuracy of our
  results.</p>

  <p>How accurate is Perl? That depends upon your machine, and how
  your C compiler implements double precision numbers. But that
  should be enough accuracy for all everyday applications. If you
  need more accuracy than Perl provides by default, check out the
  Math::BigFloat module.</p>

  <p>Although your computer may store numerals differently than
  mine, virtually all modern computers use the same technique. They
  convert the number to an internal binary form which is more
  easily manipulated than our familiar decimal notation. And, in
  the same way that we round off two-thirds to 0.66667 or so, the
  computer has to round off numbers like three-tenths.</p>

  <p>At first glance, this may seem surprising. A simple number
  like 0.3 shouldn't need to be rounded, should it? But even though
  0.3 seems simple in our familiar decimal notation, it's not so
  simple in binary. In binary, the first digit after the decimal
  point (the phrase "binary point," is more accurate, but we'll let
  it slide) is not the "tenths place", but the "halves place". The
  next bit is the "fourths", and the third is the "eighths". The
  binary form of 0.3 is 0.0 1001 1001 1001 1001 1... - an
  infinitely repeating sequence. And in much the same way that the
  decimal 0.66666... is normally rounded off for convenience, the
  value for 0.3 is rounded off inside the computer. Can a program
  be made to work with endlessly-repeating numbers without rounding
  them off? Yes, but it would be slower, take more memory, or both.
  In particular you can use the <i>bigrat.pl</i> library file
  bundled with Perl to perform arithmetic with fractions.</p>

  <p>The problem isn't that our computers use binary, but that they
  use only a small number of bits to represent numbers. That means
  that some numbers have to be represented imprecisely - and some
  of those numbers surprise us because they happen to have concise
  representations in base 10.</p>

  <p>So, what are we going to tell your manager? Now that we've
  seen that this sort of thing affects all of the ways in which we
  do arithmetic, we can point out that this isn't the fault of
  Perl; a similar program can be written in C or Fortran or Pascal,
  or any other language for that matter. And a similar confusion
  even happens to human beings, as the professor's class learned.
  It's a fundamental consequence of performing arithmetic with
  numerals.</p>

  <p>But Perl uses another kind of numeral as well, and that's what
  your co-worker was using with his regex test. In most computer
  languages, there is a strong distinction between numbers
  (actually, numerals) and strings. But they're used
  interchangeably in Perl, with conversions triggered automatically
  as needed. That is, Perl will convert the string "<tt>10</tt>" to
  the number ten (or, at least, its numeral) and back again as
  needed. (Worried about efficiency? Don't be. When Perl performs
  the conversion, it saves the result, so the computation is only
  performed once.) So, with Perl, we now have numbers, computer
  numerals (used internally), and numbers-as-strings. Converting
  from a number-as-string to Perl's internal format (and back)
  isn't always precise.</p>

  <p>For the co-worker's regular expression, Perl implicitly
  converted both numbers to their string forms.</p>
  <pre>
    $total =~ /$expected_total/ 
    # Both are used as strings
</pre>

  <p>Then, Perl interpreted $expected_total as a regular
  expression. Eek!</p>
  <pre>
    $total =~ /21.09/
</pre>

  <p>If you know regular expressions, you'll see why this matches
  the string form of <tt>$total</tt>, which is <tt>21.09</tt>.
  Unfortunately, it will also match some erroneous values, such as
  <tt>121.093</tt> and <tt>21309</tt>, among many others. This
  solution is the scariest kind of programming: completely
  superficial, and implemented without understanding of where it
  will go wrong.</p>

  <p>But your co-worker's flawed approach could lead to one
  possible solution. When Perl converts a numeral to a string, it
  naturally rounds the value a little. (If you wish to control
  exactly how your numbers are converted to strings, use the
  <tt>sprintf()</tt> function.) We could use this to our advantage,
  and create something like this.</p>
  <pre>
   # string comparison
   if ($total eq $expected_total) { ... }
</pre>

  <p>This way, Perl converts both numbers to strings, then checks
  whether they're identical. Unfortunately, this is a relatively
  slow computation. Worse, it assumes that we want to call two
  numbers the same if they both turn into the same string on the
  current machine, which may use a different numeral-to-string
  conversion than other machines. Not very portable, and therefore
  not very reliable.</p>

  <p>If you need to compare two numbers in a "fuzzy" way, in which
  small differences are allowed, here is one way to do that.</p>
  <pre>
if (    $total &gt; $expected_total - 0.0000001 
    and $total &lt; $expected_total + 0.0000001 ) { 
        ... 
}
</pre>

  <p>This makes it clear just how fuzzy the comparison can be. But
  we can use a little math to simplify this.</p>
  <pre>
if (abs($total - $expected_total) &lt; 0.0000001) { ... }
</pre>

  <p>In this case, we're seeing just how different these numbers
  are, and requiring that the absolute difference be less than a
  certain amount. This allowed difference traditionally goes by the
  name <i>epsilon</i>, so you might see that name used in snippets
  like the following:</p>
  <pre>
# Defined once at top of script
use constant EPSILON =&gt; 1e-7;

if (abs($total - $expected_total) &lt; EPSILON) { ... }
</pre>

  <p>If the <tt>use constant</tt> pragma doesn't work, you're using
  a version of Perl prior to 5.004, and should upgrade.</p>

  <p>To be sure, it's more acceptable to define epsilon in a way
  that takes into account the scale of the numbers being compared.
  And you may want to put the comparison into a subroutine, like
  this: (The (<tt>$$</tt>) in the first line of
  <tt>close_enough()</tt> is a prototype. This one means that the
  subroutine expects two arguments, both scalars. More information
  about prototypes is available in the perlsub documentation.)</p>
  <pre>
sub close_enough ($$) { 
    my($expected, $actual) = @_; 
    if ($expected) {        # allow for 0 
        abs( ($actual-$expected) / $expected ) &lt; EPSILON;
    } else { 
        abs($actual) &lt; EPSILON;
    } 
} 

if (close_enough($expected_total, $total)) { ... }
</pre>

  <p>Note that the order of parameters is important, since now
  epsilon is used as a fraction of the expected value; this is
  actually a different comparison rule than the one used
  before.</p>

  <h3>The Right Way</h3>

  <p>But there's actually a better way to implement financial
  applications like the one shown previously. Don't be misled by
  the decimal point: An amount of money like $21.09 is actually an
  integral number of pennies. If you do the calculations with exact
  integers, putting in the decimal point only at output time,
  you'll reap the benefit that integers are more accurately
  represented than real numbers in computer numerals.</p>

  <p>In the program below, the line <tt>$num = sprintf "%03d",
  $num</tt> makes the integer <tt>$num</tt> into a string with at
  least three digits. Leading zeroes are added as needed, so
  <tt>2001</tt> becomes "<tt>2001</tt>", <tt>20</tt> becomes
  "<tt>020</tt>", and <tt>2</tt> becomes "<tt>002</tt>". That way,
  we can add a decimal point to get "<tt>0.02</tt>".</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

# A better way to work with financial values 

use strict; 

sub money ($) { 

    # Given a non-negative integer number of pennies,
    # returns that figure as a dollars-and-cents
    # amount, like '$12345.67'.

    # Assign the first (and only) argument to $num
    my $num = shift;
    warn "Bad amount of money: $num" if $num &lt; 0;

    # Make $num into a string
    $num = sprintf "%03d", $num;
    substr($num, -2, 0) = "."; # add the decimal point

    return '$' . $num; 
} 

my $total = 1908 + 201;       # integers now 
my $expected_total = 2109;

print "The total is ", money($total), "\n"; 
print "The expected total is ",money($expected_total),"\n";

# Comparing numbers of pennies 
if ($total == $expected_total) {
    print "They are equal.\n"; 
} else { 
    print "They aren't equal.\n"; 
}
</pre>

  <p>Armed with this knowledge, you should find it easier to get
  the answers that you expect from your Perl programs.</p>
