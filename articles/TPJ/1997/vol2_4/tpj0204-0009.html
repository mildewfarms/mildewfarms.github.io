  <h4><i>Jay Rogers</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  This article introduces Net::Telnet, a module that allows your
  Perl program to communicate with networked hosts or devices such
  as workstations, terminal servers, routers, and the like. The
  dialog is established via a client connection to a TCP port -
  typically to a port using the <i>telnet</i> protocol.

  <p>Simple I/O methods such as <tt>print()</tt>, <tt>get()</tt>,
  and <tt>getline()</tt> are provided, of course, but more
  sophisticated interactive features are available as well -
  features tailored for communicating with programs intended solely
  for human interaction. This includes the ability to specify a
  timeout and to wait for patterns to appear in the input stream,
  such as a shell prompt.</p>

  <p>Net::Telnet is written entirely in Perl; it doesn't require a
  locally installed <i>telnet</i> program. This makes Net::Telnet
  especially easy to install and use on those ubiquitous Windows 95
  and NT machines.</p>

  <h3>The Problem</h3>

  <p>Sounded easy when you first thought about it: Your Perl
  program needs to monitor disk space on a remote machine named
  <tt>sparky</tt>, but it can access <tt>sparky</tt> only by
  connecting to it via telnet. So you try something like this:</p>
  <pre>
open  TELNET,  "|telnet sparky"; 
print TELNET  "joebob\n"; 
print TELNET  "passwd-for-joebob\n"; 
print TELNET  "df -k\n";
</pre>

  <p>You find that piping commands to telnet's standard input
  doesn't work. The <i>telnet</i> program connects just fine, but
  <tt>sparky</tt> doesn't process any of the commands you send it.
  You discover that your telnet only reads from the terminal (also
  known as a tty) and not from its standard input.</p>

  <p>Well, you could use a package like Comm.pl to create a
  pseudo-terminal (a <i>pty</i>) and make <i>telnet</i> read from
  that instead. But then you think, "Hey, why don't I just connect
  a socket directly to TCP port 23 on <tt>sparky</tt> and read and
  write directly to the <i>telnet</i> port? That way I don't even
  need a <i>telnet</i> program!"</p>

  <p>So now you write some socket code - only to find out you still
  have the same problem. You can connect a socket to the TCP
  <i>telnet</i> port on <tt>sparky</tt> but the remote side doesn't
  seem to respond to I/O.</p>

  <p>After digging through the RFC documentation for the
  <i>telne</i>t protocol, you learn that <i>telnet</i> sends
  control information along with data in the same socket stream.
  The reason the remote side wasn't sending data was because you
  weren't responding properly to its control queries. In other
  words, you weren't speaking the <i>telnet</i> protocol.</p>

  <h3>The Solution</h3>

  <p>Net::Telnet solves this problem. It recognizes the
  <i>telnet</i> control commands, removes them from the data
  stream, and sends back an appropriate response. This allows you
  to read from and write to a port without having to worry about
  the vagaries of the telnet protocol.</p>

  <p>Net::Telnet also provides sophisticated features to help you
  establish dialogs with programs designed for human interaction.
  "Human interaction" means an online conversation between you and
  some remote service (such as a shell, or a MUD, or IRC). What
  this boils down to is the ability to perform I/O with a specified
  timeout while waiting for patterns to appear in the input
  stream.</p>

  <h3>The Example (the hard way)</h3>

  <p>Here's some code that prints out a summary of disk usage on
  <tt>sparky</tt>. Net::Telnet is used to log in as user "joebob"
  and to issue the <i>df</i> command to get the disk information.
  We assume that joebob's shell prompt is '<tt>$</tt> '.</p>
  <pre>
use Net::Telnet ();
$remote = new Net::Telnet (Timeout =&gt; 10,
                           Errmode =&gt; 'return'); 

$remote-&gt;open("sparky") or die $remote-&gt;errmsg;
$remote-&gt;waitfor('/login: $/i') or die $remote-&gt;errmsg;

$remote-&gt;print("joebob") or die $remote-&gt;errmsg;
$remote-&gt;waitfor('/password: $/i') or die $remote-&gt;errmsg;

$remote-&gt;print("passwd-for-joebob") or die $remote-&gt;errmsg; 
$remote-&gt;waitfor('/\$ $/') or die $remote-&gt;errmsg;

$remote-&gt;print("df -k") or die $remote-&gt;errmsg;

($output) = $remote-&gt;waitfor('/\$ $/') 
                          or die $remote-&gt;errmsg;

print $output;
</pre>

  <p>As with many of the Perl I/O modules, the first step is to
  create an object (<tt>new Net::Telnet</tt>); afterwards, all
  actions are invoked via that object's methods. Here's what the
  output looks like:</p>
  <pre>
df 
Filesystem  1024-blocks  Used  Available  Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/hda2       11709    6184      4921      56%    / 
/dev/hda5      298573  237172     45981      84%    /usr 
/dev/hda6      435180  298877    113827      72%    /home
</pre>

  <p>Net::Telnet has a flexible way of handling errors: the Errmode
  parameter. When <tt>Errmode</tt> is set to <tt>return</tt> as in
  our example above, any errors encountered in Net::Telnet methods
  are saved in the Net::Telnet object, and the method returns
  false. That error message can be obtained with
  <tt>$obj-&gt;errmsg</tt>.</p>

  <h3>The Example (the easier way)</h3>

  <p>If you always want to <tt>die()</tt> on error and print out
  the error message, as the code above does, you can set
  <tt>Errmode</tt> to die. Net::Telnet will kill your program for
  you, showing you the line where the error occurred. Let's clean
  up the above code a bit using an <tt>Errmode</tt> of
  <tt>die</tt>. That's the default, but we'll specify it
  anyway.</p>
  <pre>
use Net::Telnet (); 
$remote = new Net::Telnet (Timeout =&gt; 10,
                    <b> Errmode =&gt; 'die');</b>

$remote-&gt;open("sparky"); 
$remote-&gt;waitfor('/login: $/i');

$remote-&gt;print("joebob") 
$remote-&gt;waitfor('/password: $/i');

$remote-&gt;print("passwd-for-joebob") 
$remote-&gt;waitfor('/\$ $/'); 

$remote-&gt;print("df -k"); 
($output) = $remote-&gt;waitfor('/\$ $/');

print $output;
</pre>

  <p>Now let's look a bit closer at what this code does. The
  <tt>new()</tt> creates a new object which has a base class of
  (that is, it inherits from) FileHandle or IO::Socket::INET,
  depending on whether or not you have the IO:: libraries
  installed. (The IO:: libraries now come standard with Perl
  5.004.)</p>

  <p>What this means is that the <tt>$remote</tt> object can be
  used as a filehandle anywhere a Perl filehandle would be used. If
  you have IO::Socket::INET installed, you have access to its
  routines via method inheritance. For example, you can call its
  <tt>peeraddr()</tt> routine as <tt>$remote-&gt;peeraddr()</tt>.
  (That returns the packed IP address of the remote host to which
  you're connected.)</p>

  <p>In our code we configured the object to use a ten second
  timeout when connecting, reading, and writing. We connect to the
  remote telnet port using <tt>open()</tt> and then use a series of
  <tt>waitfor()</tt> and <tt>print()</tt> routines to log in to the
  host. Three prompts must be waited for: the login prompt, the
  password prompt, and the shell prompt '<tt>$</tt> '.</p>

  <p>The example above makes prominent use of <tt>waitfor()</tt>.
  Let's examine it more closely. <tt>waitfor()</tt> takes a string
  containing a Perl regular expression and waits for the pattern to
  appear in the data stream within <tt>Timeout</tt> seconds.
  Assuming the pattern appears, it reads and removes everything in
  the data stream up to and including the matched string.</p>

  <p>If the pattern doesn't occur before the timeout, Net::Telnet
  signals an error. For example, suppose the following command is
  issued, but the remote side doesn't print '<tt>login:</tt> '
  within ten seconds:</p>
  <pre>
    $remote-&gt;waitfor('/login: $/i');
</pre>

  <p>That's an error, so <tt>waitfor()</tt> will either print an
  error message and <tt>die()</tt>, or just return with a false
  value depending on whether Errmode is set to <tt>die</tt> or
  <tt>return</tt>.</p>

  <p>Once we're logged in and our shell prompt has appeared, we
  issue the <i>df</i> command. We pause until <i>df</i> finishes,
  simply by waiting for the next shell prompt. Notice how we use
  the return value of <tt>waitfor()</tt> to collect the output from
  the <i>df</i> command:</p>
  <pre>
$remote-&gt;print("df -k"); 
($output) = $remote-&gt;waitfor('/\$ $/');
</pre>

  <p>In a list context <tt>waitfor()</tt> returns two values akin
  to <tt>$'</tt> and <tt>$&amp;</tt> (also known as
  <tt>$PREMATCH</tt> and <tt>$MATCH</tt> if you <tt>use
  English</tt>). The first value is all the characters before the
  matched string, and the second value is the matched string
  itself. In our example we only use one of the returned values -
  whatever matches up to the dollar sign and space at the end of
  the string. <tt>$output</tt> is thus exactly what we want:
  everything between the shell prompts, which, if all goes
  according to plan, will be the output from the <i>df</i>
  command.</p>

  <h3>The Example (the easiest way)</h3>

  <p>Because they're such common tasks, Net::Telnet provides a
  routine to log in (<tt>login()</tt>) and a routine to send a
  command and retrieve the output (<tt>cmd()</tt>). Let's rewrite
  our example one last time to use these routines.</p>

  <p>Both <tt>login()</tt> and <tt>cmd()</tt> need to be able to
  recognize the remote shell's prompt, so we set the object's
  <tt>Prompt</tt> attribute when it's created.</p>
  <pre>
use Net::Telnet (); 
$remote = new Net::Telnet (Timeout =&gt; 10, 
                           Prompt =&gt; '/\$ $/');

$remote-&gt;open("sparky"); 
$remote-&gt;login("joebob", "passwd-for-joebob"); 
print $remote-&gt;cmd("df -k");
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>login()</tt> method expects the login prompt to look
  like either <tt>/login[: ]*$/i</tt> or <tt>/username[:
  ]*$/i</tt>. The password prompt must look like <tt>/password[:
  ]*/i</tt>.</p>

  <p>If the thing you're connecting to doesn't use one of those
  prompts, you'll have to customize your own login using a series
  of <tt>waitfor()</tt> and <tt>print()</tt> commands.</p>

  <h3>Special considerations</h3>

  <p>You may have noticed in our example that none of the strings
  being sent via <tt>print()</tt> or <tt>cmd()</tt> ends with a
  newline. As a convenience, the <tt>output_record_separator</tt>
  Net::Telnet attribute is set to a newline because that's what you
  normally see at the end of each line. If for some reason you need
  to write characters without an ending newline, just change
  <tt>output_record_separator</tt> to the null string,
  <tt>""</tt>.</p>

  <p>At some point you might need to debug programs that use
  Net::Telnet. The typical symptom will be a timeout error because
  you've made incorrect assumptions about what the remote side is
  sending. The easiest way to reconcile the remote side with your
  expectations is to use the <tt>input_log()</tt> or
  <tt>dump_log()</tt> methods. <tt>dump_log()</tt> allows you to
  see the data being sent from the remote side before any
  translation is done, while <tt>input_log()</tt> shows you the
  results after translation.</p>

  <p>The translation includes converting end of line characters.
  Typically, when you're communicating with a TCP port such as
  <i>telnet</i> or SMTP, newlines are designated using a two
  character ASCII sequence: a carriage return followed by a line
  feed. As a convenience, Net::Telnet converts sequences of
  carriage returns and line feeds to mere line feeds on input, and
  vice versa for output. You can control this translation with
  <tt>binmode()</tt>.</p>

  <p>The translation also includes stripping and responding to
  telnet commands embedded in the data stream. You can control this
  translation with <tt>telnetmode()</tt>. For example, you might
  want to turn off this mode (<tt>$remote-&gt;telnetmode(0)</tt>)
  if you're connecting to a non-telnet port such SMTP. For the
  curious, <i>telnet</i> commands are preceded by hexadecimal
  255.</p>

  <h3>But wait...there's more</h3>

  <p>Like the <i>telnet</i> program itself, Net::Telnet can be used
  to communicate with any TCP port, not just ports using the telnet
  protocol. Net::Telnet is frequently used to create the client
  side of client-server applications, because of its ability to
  time out when reading and writing.</p>

  <p>You might also want to use Net::Telnet's interactive features
  with filehandles other than sockets. The <tt>fhopen()</tt> method
  can be used to associate an already open filehandle with a telnet
  object:</p>
  <pre>
    $obj-&gt;fhopen(\*STDIN);
</pre>

  <p>Now, whenever you read from the object <tt>$obj</tt>, you're
  actually reading from standard input - with all the features of
  Net::Telnet available.</p>

  <p>If you use Net::Telnet, be sure to read the embedded
  documentation, which includes several examples. Enjoy!</p>
