  <p>When you see one-liners like the one above, you get the
  impression that the ASCII character set is deeply ingrained into
  the heart of Perl. (The one-liner is derived from a posting by
  Felix Gallo.) However, to the extent that your program can
  distinguish code from data, it doesn't matter what your
  computer's underlying character encoding is. In addition to the
  ubiquitous ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
  Interchange) and the up-and-coming Unicode, there's an older
  encoding: EBCDIC, the Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange
  Code. It derives from the first commercial use of computational
  equipment in the 1890s and is still in use today. In this
  article, I'll concentrate on the differences between ASCII and
  EBCDIC in Perl, beginning with a history of how EBCDIC came to
  be.</p>

  <h3>History made non-collating</h3>

  <p>In the late nineteenth century, an enterprising young engineer
  named Herman Hollerith began an instructorship in mechanical
  engineering at MIT. In his spare time, he constructed tabulating
  machines and sorters that outperformed the machines that were
  being used for the United States census.</p>

  <p>Hollerith's tabulating and sorting machines were among the
  first commercial devices to employ two technical innovations: the
  use of electricity (though not electronics) and binary internal
  representations of data. There was, however, no programmatic
  instruction set so the machines couldn't really be called
  computers. The tabulators and sorters also used another, much
  more mature, technology: the punched paper cards that had been
  used for over a century to "program" weaving looms. Allegedly,
  the idea for the use of cards (rather than, say, paper tape)
  occurred to Hollerith while on a train trip during which he
  noticed the conductor's punching passenger information onto stiff
  paper cards. Hollerith's tabulation cards had 10 rows and 45
  columns of round holes. They measured 3 1/4 by 7 3/8 inches - the
  size of the dollar bill at the time - so that money-counting
  machines could be used to process the cards; punch cards haven't
  changed size since. Hollerith's cards even had the telltale cut
  corner that helped machine operators align the cards
  correctly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the 1880 census had just taken more than seven
  years to complete, lasting almost to the beginning of the next
  census, and so the government held a contest to create a machine
  that would speed up data gathering and analysis. Hollerith's
  winning entry was able to count and process the 10,491 citizens
  of St. Louis in record time, and his equipment was then used to
  count and profile 62 million people for the 1890 U.S. census. The
  tabulation required one punch card for each person - a stack that
  towered higher than the Washington Monument. Yet the tabulation
  took less than six weeks, and the final 26,408 page report was
  completed in under three years. Soon Hollerith's tabulators and
  sorters were used by Russia, Austria, and Canada.</p>

  <p>In 1896, Hollerith founded the Tabulating Machine Company, and
  by 1901 he had added a numeric keypad to help with the input
  operation of punching cards. In 1911 the company merged with two
  others to become the Computing Tabulating Recording Company and
  the machines were employed in the British Census for the first
  time. The CTR Company became International Business Machines in
  1924 (for comparison, Bell Telephone Laboratories was founded in
  1925, and the first IBM typewriter was announced in 1935). In
  1928 IBM released the Type IV Tabulator, which used cards with 80
  columns and 12 rows. Other formats would also compete with these
  dimensions - the AS/400, still in use today, would eventually
  support a 96 column card - but it's worth emphasizing the
  profound impact that 80 by 12 has had on subsequent computer
  usage: the 80 column by 24 row size of today's "standard"
  terminal is just enough to edit two Type IV punch cards worth of
  information.</p>

  <h3>Standards and code pages</h3>

  <p>Although the American Standard Association adopted ASCII in
  1964, IBM chose to stick with EBCDIC in their System/360
  computers, simply because it had been in use in all prior IBM
  computers and was a legacy of Hollerith's punch cards. ASCII was
  eventually adopted by the American National Standards Institute
  (ANSI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO) for
  some of its character code sets, including ISO-8859-1 (commonly
  called "quoted-printable"). ASCII is also a subset of the
  ISO-Latin-1 character set used for hexadecimal encodings on web
  pages, and it's also a subset of the Unicode two- and three-byte
  character set designed by Taligent (the collaboration of Apple,
  Hewlett-Packard, and IBM). Unicode is used by Java, and may soon
  be integrated into Perl as well. In contrast, EBCDIC is generally
  considered obsolete, but it's alive and kicking on some computers
  that run Perl.</p>

  <p>Character codes are a necessary part of computing with
  anything other than pure binary data. If you want to invent a
  character code of your own, you'll need the upper and lower case
  26 letter alphabet, plus the ten digits: 62 characters. Add a
  dozen or so punctuation characters and one or two dozen control
  characters (like tab, line feed, carriage return, and form feed),
  and you can easily generate a list of a hundred characters. ASCII
  is seven bits, meaning that its indices range from 0 to
  2<sup>7</sup>-1, or <tt>0..127</tt>, so it has 128 characters.
  EBCDIC is an eight bit encoding, and so has 256 characters. In
  ASCII, the mapping from indices to the characters they represent
  is often counterintuitive; for instance, the digit characters
  aren't <tt>0..9</tt> but <tt>48..57</tt>. (However, the least
  significant nybble in that sequence is <tt>0..9</tt>.) The
  alphabet forms two sets of consecutive characters in the ASCII:
  the upper case letters span from 65 to 90 and the lower case
  letters range from 97 to 122.</p>

  <p>In contrast, EBCDIC does not have the alphabet in a stepwise
  continuous sequence - there are gaps - but both the upper and
  lower case alphabets are numerically sortable just like ASCII.
  EBCDIC digits span 240 through 249, so both the last digit and
  the least significant nybble is <tt>0..9</tt>.</p>

  <h3>Perl on OS/390 OpenEdition</h3>

  <p>EBCDIC is of special interest to me because I work on an IBM
  OS/390 computer running OpenEdition, which internally uses
  EBCDIC.(The OpenEdition environment has been described as Unix on
  a mainframe; MVS OpenEdition comes with a POSIX shell, an ANSI
  C/C++ library and compilers, Berkeley style sockets, a
  hierarchical file system, and a web server. It is POSIX and
  XPG4.2 compliant and distinct from other interactive environments
  such as TSO. It supports Perl 5, and it uses the EBCDIC character
  set.) (In particular, it uses the EBCDIC Latin 1/Open Systems
  Interconnection Code Page 01047, also known as IBM-1047, but it
  can display any of several different international variations of
  EBCDIC.)</p>

  <p>We who use Perl on the OS/390 owe a great deal to John
  Pfuntner (<b>pfuntner@vnet.ibm.com</b>) of IBM, who ported not
  just Perl 5.000 alpha 12h (in EBCDIC-modified source and binary
  forms) but a great many other Unix tools available from the
  "OS/390 OpenEdition Tools and Toys to Download" page, available
  at: <a href="http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/bpxa1toy.html"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/bpxa1toy.html</a>.</p>

  <p>After several months of routine use we have only encountered
  two problems with regular expressions using John Pfuntner's Perl
  port, and they were easily scripted around. Hence we can run a
  collection of several hundred scripts and packages with minimal
  changes. Unless, of course, we want to have a little fun.</p>

        <hr size="1">
        Both ASCII (particularly "8-bit" ASCII) and EBCDIC can be
        "internationalized" so that computers can adopt a variation
        specific to the local language: &ntilde; for Spanish
        computers, &ouml; for German computers, and so on. These
        variations are called <i>locales</i> and the process of
        converting to them is often called L10N, a curious
        contraction of the word "localization. " The process of
        designing software so that L10N is easy is called I18N, for
        "internationalization." Such matters, particularly as they
        apply to Japanization (J10N) are nicely addressed in Ken
        Lunde&rsquo;s book, <i>Understanding Japanese Information
        Processing</i>, O&rsquo;Reilly &amp; Associates, 1993.

  <h3>Stupid EBCDIC tricks</h3>

  <p>The gaps in the EBCDIC alphabets have some startling
  consequences for the unwary. On an ASCII based computer you can
  ask Perl 5 to print out the lower case alphabet like so:</p>
  <pre>
perl -e 'for (97..122) {print chr }'
</pre>

  <p>but on an EBCDIC computer it's not quite so elegant:</p>
  <pre>
perl -e 'for (129..137, 145..153, 162..169) {print chr}'
</pre>

  <p>The differences are similar for the upper case alphabet: in
  ASCII you'd change the list to <tt>65..90</tt>, and in EBCDIC
  you'd need <tt>193..201, 209..217, 226..233</tt>. The gaps in
  EBCDIC are a result of the way the code was laid out to fit on
  punch cards: groups of 9, 9, and 8 characters separated by 16 or
  17 characters. This seems strange, but the regularity of the
  EBCDIC encoding is more obvious when you use hexadecimal indices
  to display it:</p>
  <pre>
 
for ( 0x81..0x89, 
      0x91..0x99, 
      0xa1..0xa9, 
      0xc1..0xc9, 
      0xd1..0xd9, 
      0xe1..0xe9, 
      0xf0..0xf9 ) { print chr }
</pre>

  <p>which prints:</p>
  <pre>
abcdefghijklmnopqr~stuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQR&oelig;STUVWXYZ0123456789
</pre>

  <p>That's both alphabets, all the digits, and a couple of odd but
  printable punctuation characters hiding in the middle. A glaring
  omission from our loop is the <tt>0xb1..0xb9</tt> range, which
  prints out useful glyphs such as the monetary symbols for the
  British Pound and the Japanese Yen, as well as some common
  fractions. By writing the loop with hexadecimal numbers, we
  illustrate the regularity; the spacings of 9 to 10 characters
  within each group fit onto the rows of either a 12 by 80 or even
  the original 10 by 45 Hollerith card. The hexadecimal radix might
  be an artifact of the way the circuitry was arranged in card
  tabulators and sorters, machines that didn't treat characters as
  data types as we do today. Nonetheless, those machines must have
  been hardwired to treat data of the <tt>0xF\d</tt> hexadecimal
  type as integers subject to the rules of decimal addition.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for fans of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the following
  character transformations steer clear of those strange EBCDIC
  punch card boundaries (the first comes close, however):</p>
  <pre>
$<b> perl
print pack('c', ord(H)+1); 
print pack('c', ord(A)+1); 
print pack('c', ord(L)+1), "\n";
&lt;Ctrl-D&gt;</b>
IBM
</pre>

  <p>Another difference between the two encodings is that in ASCII,
  the upper case alphabet lies below the lower case, whereas in
  EBCDIC the order and magnitude of the offset is reversed. In
  ASCII a constant offset of +32 (a bit shift of 5) takes you from
  an upper case character to its lower case counterpart, whereas on
  an EBCDIC computer an offset of -64 (opposite bit shift of 6)
  moves upper case to lower case.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Perl's <tt>uc()</tt> function works on
  EBCDIC:</p>
  <pre>
$ <b>perl -e '$_="the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\n";'\
      -e 'print uc($_)'</b>

THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>ucfirst()</tt>, <tt>lc()</tt>, and <tt>lcfirst()</tt>
  functions and the <tt>\u</tt>, <tt>\U</tt>, <tt>\l</tt>, and
  <tt>\L</tt> string escapes also work as they do on ASCII
  computers.</p>

  <p>Sorting on EBCDIC is no different than in ASCII:</p>
  <pre>
$ <b>perl -e '@_=qw(THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG);'\
      -e 'print sort(@_)'</b>
BROWNDOGFOXJUMPEDLAZYOVERQUICKTHETHE
</pre>

  <p>Owing to the cleverness of the OS/390 port, sorting a mixed
  case string on an EBCDIC computer results in an ASCII-style sort,
  rather than EBCDIC's pseudo-dictionary order:</p>
  <pre>
$ <b>perl -e ' @a=qw(a b A B);print sort(@a), "\n" ' </b>
ABab 
</pre>

  <p>However, attempts to create a continuously collated list will
  simply truncate at the EBCDIC punch card boundaries:</p>
  <pre>
$ <b>perl -e '@a=(a..z); for(@a) {print "$_ ";} print "&lt;\n";'</b>
a b c d e f g h i &lt;
</pre>

  <p>This list range truncation is unique to this particular port
  of EBCDIC Perl and might not occur in future ports.</p>

  <p>Interestingly enough, character classes in regular expressions
  exhibit ASCII-like behavior:</p>
  <pre>
$ <b>perl -e '$_ = "QUICK";'</b> \ 
<b>-e 'print "string has ", (/[A-Z]/) ? "alpha" : "non-alpha", " chars";'</b>
string has alpha chars
</pre>

  <p>Lest you think that merely matched the <tt>C</tt>, here's
  another example:</p>
  <pre>
$ <b>perl -e '$_="AIJRSZ"; /([A-Z]+)/; print $1,"\n"'</b>
AIJRSZ
</pre>

  <p>It should be noted, however, that a regex range such as
  <tt>[a-z]</tt> can match the non-alphabetic gap characters. Here,
  <tt>$s</tt> is assigned all the characters in and bounding the
  first gap in the lower case EBCDIC alphabet:</p>
  <pre>
<b>$ perl -e 'for (137..145) {$s .= chr($_) } $s=~ /([a-z]+)/; print $1,"\n"'</b>
<br>
<img src="images/prymmer-fig2.gif" width="94" height="17" border=
"0" alt="">
</pre>

  <p>Given the American focus of the ASCII character set (for
  instance, <tt>chr(36)</tt> is <tt>$</tt>, but there are no
  monetary symbols from other countries) it is amusing to note that
  IBM-1047 EBCDIC includes the cent symbol (as <tt>chr(74)</tt>)
  whereas ASCII does not. When using <i>rlogin</i> to access an
  OpenEdition session from an ASCII terminal you typically have to
  use eight bit ASCII extensions to render such symbols.</p>

  <h3>ASCII to EBCDIC Translators</h3>

  <p>Thus far I have not mentioned any of the many fine
  ASCII/EBCDIC translation scripts available from the CPAN, in both
  the Convert module directory and the scripts/text-processing
  directory. That's because I haven't needed them, due to the
  excellent translation utilities already built into
  OpenEdition.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>You can find an apparent ASCIIism in the "Semi-formal
  Description" of Perl in the second edition of O'Reilly's
  <i>Programming Perl</i>, where on page 35 it says that "Perl is
  defined in terms of the ASCII character set." Yet the modified
  BNF description of the perly.y yacc grammar (Appendix A) defines
  the CHAR element as <tt>[\000-\377]</tt>. This goes beyond seven
  bit ASCII and can be construed as covering the EBCDIC as
  well.</p>

  <p>EBCDIC-based C libraries have been developed that cover all
  ASCII-style character usages. For the most part the "EBCDIC
  problem" is just like the Year 2000 Problem: neither is a big
  deal unless you handle your characters in ways that make certain
  assumptions about the numeric ranges of the data.</p>

  <p>The following one-liner prints the name of our favorite Swiss
  army chainsaw on EBCDIC computers:</p>
  <pre>
$ <b>perl -e '$e=133;print(chr($e+18),chr($e),chr($e+20),chr($e+14))'</b>
perl
</pre>
