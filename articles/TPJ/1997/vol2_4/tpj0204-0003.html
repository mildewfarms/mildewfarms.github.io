  <h4><i>Brian Jepson</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  <font size="+2">T</font>he announcement of O'Reilly's enhanced
  Perl tools caused some confusion among developers. The greatest
  fear was that two Perls would emerge: a stripped-down version for
  the masses, and a fancier version with bells and whistles for the
  people with credit cards.

  <p>Luckily, that didn't happen. It's true that Larry Wall is
  employed by O'Reilly &amp; Associates, but that doesn't mean that
  Perl has suddenly and inexplicably become a commercial product.
  Larry is still free to work on Perl, and Perl will continue to be
  free, as it always has been. So, what does O'Reilly have Larry do
  until the wee hours of the morning when he's not hacking on Perl?
  The first commercial Perl tool he has developed is JPL, a
  Java-Perl integration kit, which is bundled exclusively with the
  Perl Resource Kit (<a href="http://perl.oreilly.com" target=
  "resource window">http://perl.oreilly.com</a>). Unfortunately,
  the initial JPL design was rejected after it had already been
  publicized.</p>

  <h3>The Rejected Design</h3>

  <p>The goal of JPL is to help Perl and Java communicate with one
  another. This means two things: first, that JPL should be a
  back-end for the Perl compiler, generating Java bytecode. Second,
  that it should make Perl's language features available from Java,
  and vice versa. Unfortunately, the first goal had to be laid
  aside in order to make the first release of JPL as useful as
  possible.</p>

  <p>Having JPL produce Java bytecode would be of limited value
  unless Larry were to completely rewrite Perl in Java. This is
  because many of the features that draw us to Perl, such as
  regular expressions and rapid text manipulation, aren't available
  in the core JDK (Java Development Kit). Any program expressed in
  Java bytecode must only employ features in the core language and
  API if it is to be portable, so if JPL generated Java bytecode,
  it would necessarily prevent you from writing interesting Perl
  programs - you'd only be able to use the language features of
  Perl that already exist in Java. Perl's unique features would
  only be feasible with a platform-dependent shared library.</p>

  <h3>The Accepted Design</h3>

  <p>So a bytecode-generating JPL didn't seem very practical. After
  all, if you want Java, you know where to find it. Larry, while
  not abandoning the goal of bytecode generation, decided to add
  features to JPL that would permit the maximum interaction between
  the languages. (Java bytecode generation, that is. Perl already
  generates its own platform-independent bytecode, thanks to
  Malcolm Beattie's Perl compiler (available from the CPAN as
  modules/by-modules/B).)</p>

  <p>So, does JPL allow you to write an applet in Perl? No.
  Instead, JPL can be used with RMI to build a multi-tier applet
  that invokes Perl methods on your web server. (Remote Method
  Invocation. An API that allows objects in one Java Virtual
  Machine (JVM) to remotely invoke the methods of objects running
  in another JVM.) Can you build JPL applications that make use of
  Java's rich graphical offerings while benefiting from Perl's text
  processing and networking capabilities? Absolutely - the Perl
  resource kit includes a sample application: Shawn Wallace's
  graphical front-end to the FTPSearch engine (<a href=
  "http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/" target=
  "resource window">http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/</a>). Java is used
  for the user interface, and Perl is used for network
  communications (using LWP, naturally) and for manipulating and
  processing the results of searches.</p>

  <h3>Programming With JPL</h3>

  <p>JPL is extremely straightforward to use. Perl code can be
  embedded inside Java applications simply by enclosing Perl code
  within methods declared with the keyword perl. The Perl methods
  must be delimited with double curly braces, as shown in <a href=
  "tpj0204-0003a.html"><i>JPLsimple.jpl</i></a>.</p>

  <p>Note that although Java gives you a default constructor for
  free, I have included one for clarity (the <tt>JPLSimple()</tt>
  subroutine) even though it does nothing other than construct a
  new instance of the class. The <tt>main()</tt> method is invoked
  by default when you run this program through the Java
  interpreter; it, in turn, invokes
  <tt>sayHelloToTheNicePeople()</tt>, an instance method of the
  JPLSimple class.</p>

  <p>Of course, Java itself doesn't know what to do with
  <tt>perl</tt> methods - that's where JPL helps. One major
  component of JPL is its preprocessor, which analyzes your source
  code (which must reside in a <i>.jpl</i> file) and generates a
  <i>.pl</i> file, a <i>.java</i> file, a <i>.c</i> file, and an
  <i>.h</i> file. The <tt>perl</tt> methods become native methods
  within the <i>.java</i> file, and the <i>.pl</i> file ends up
  containing the actual Perl methods. (In Java, a native method is
  a function implemented in some other program, probably in C or
  some other platform-dependent fashion.) The <i>.c</i> and
  <i>.h</i> files contain the native methods that bridge between
  Java and Perl. These are compiled into a platform-dependent
  shared library. Fortunately, the JPL kit includes a Makefile
  template that does all this work for you, so you only need to
  write your <i>jpl</i> file, copy in the Makefile, and type
  make.</p>

  <p>To use JPL, you must have built Perl as a shared library, and
  you must be using your comptuer's <tt>malloc()</tt>, as opposed
  to the <tt>malloc()</tt> that comes with Perl. In addition to the
  preprocessor, JPL includes a number of other components:</p>

  <p><b>The libPerlInterpreter Shared Library.</b> This shared
  library is the glue between the Java language and the
  <i>libperl</i> shared library. This enables Java to create an
  instance of the Perl interpreter.</p>

  <p><b>The JNI Module.</b> This is a Perl module that provides an
  interface to the Java Native Interface (JNI). It offers access to
  many aspects of Java, allowing you to call into Java, create Java
  objects, and access other internal features of a Java Virtual
  Machine.</p>

  <p><b>The JPL::Class and JPL::Autoloader Modules.</b> These
  modules allow your Perl methods to load and instantiate Java
  classes at runtime. The Autoloader performs the necessary magic
  to determine which method you really wanted - unlike Perl, Java
  provides support for implicit method overloading. This means that
  there can be several different methods with the same name,
  differentiated only by the type and number of arguments that each
  method accepts.</p>

  <h3>Calling Back Into Java From Perl</h3>

  <p>Although JPL provides a lot of goodies on the Perl side, the
  current release of the JDK includes a user-level thread package
  that makes it impossible to use parts of the Java API (such as
  AWT, the Abstract Windowing Toolkit) when Java is embedded
  somewhere else. This is because the green threads package
  overrides some system calls, such as those involving I/O. (The
  Solaris version of Java (and versions of Java based on it) uses a
  user-level threading package called "green threads," instead of
  native threads, so that it can pretend to be a single-threaded
  process from the operating system's perspective. This has two
  drawbacks: first, the green threads package doesn't make
  effective use of multiprocessor machines; and second, if green
  threads use blocking I/O, the entire process blocks. That's why
  green threads work in conjunction with an I/O manager that
  converts all blocking I/O calls to nonblocking equivalents.) As a
  result, it is suggested that anything you write with JPL involve
  Perl code embedded in Java. Happily, you can call back into Java
  code from embedded Perl code without worrying about the
  overridden system calls. I have found that this model works quite
  well for JPL development.</p>

  <p>Before you can create a Java object from within Perl, you must
  import the class definition with a use JPL::Class 'classname'
  statement:</p>
  <pre>
use JPL::Class 'java::awt::Button';
</pre>

  <p>You can supply a list of classes as well:</p>
  <pre>
use JPL::Class qw(java::awt::Button java::awt::Frame);
</pre>

  <p>You'll notice that the Perl package delimiter (::) is used for
  the Java class names, rather than the Java package delimiter (.).
  The reason for this is quite simple: the period isn't a valid
  package delimiter in Perl, and in order for you to use the class
  at all in Perl, you need to do it on Perl's terms. The only time
  you'll see the Java package delimiter is in method lookups, shown
  later. To create an instance of the object, you only need to call
  its constructor from within Perl, as in:</p>
  <pre>
my $btn = new java::awt::Button;
</pre>

  <h3>Invoking Methods</h3>

  <p><i>JPLSimple.jpl</i> showed you only how to invoke a
  constructor method: JPLSimple.jpl - Embedding Perl in Javanew(),
  which takes no arguments and returns no values. (Well, it
  "returned" a new instance of an object, but constructors are
  declared as <tt>void</tt> in Java.) This is a vanilla JPL method
  call; if you want to invoke a method that takes arguments or
  returns values, life gets a little more complicated.</p>

  <p>Each method is uniquely identified by its signature. A method
  signature is a combination of its argument types and return
  values. Before you can call a method, you need to look up its
  signature with the <tt>getmeth()</tt> function if it has either
  arguments or return values. <tt>getmeth()</tt> is exported into
  all JPL programs by default, and returns a string with the full
  method signature. It requires three arguments: the name of the
  method to look up, a reference to an array consisting of the
  argument types, and a reference to an array containing the return
  type.</p>

  <p>Here are a couple of examples. The first call to
  <tt>getmeth()</tt> looks up the method <tt>void setLabel(String
  label)</tt>; the second looks up <tt>Component add(String name,
  Component comp)</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
  my $setLabel = getmeth('setLabel', 
           ['java.lang.String'], []);
  my $add = getmeth('add', 
           ['java.lang.String','java.awt.Component'],
           ['java.awt.Component']);
</pre>

  <p>Once you've looked up a method, you can invoke it through an
  object. Note that we supply the method name as the string
  <tt>$setLabel</tt>; we can't simply invoke <tt>setLabel()</tt>.
  The string <tt>$setLabel</tt> contains the JPL signature of the
  method, which happens to be
  <tt>setLabel__Ljava_lang_String_2__V</tt>. Here's how you'd
  invoke <tt>setLabel()</tt> via the <tt>$btn</tt> object:</p>
  <pre>
    $btn-&gt;$setLabel("Hi There!");
</pre>

  <h3>A Simple Example Program</h3>

  <p>The example program, <a href="tpj0204-0003b.html">JPL
  Example</a>, demonstrates some possible interactions between Perl
  and Java. It creates a Frame containing two objects: a Canvas
  onto which an image is drawn, and a Button that displays the
  words "Please do not press this button again" when you press
  it.</p>

  <p>That Button is created within <tt>plSample()</tt>, a Perl
  method which takes the Frame as an argument and is invoked within
  the constructor. Within <tt>plSample()</tt>, a Button is created.
  The label for the button is set using the <tt>setLabel()</tt>
  method, and an ActionListener is added to the Button. The
  ActionListener is an instance field of the class, and must be
  accessed through the method corresponding to it,
  <tt>$self-&gt;al()</tt>. Finally, the button is added to the
  Frame, and the Perl method is done. Here's the Frame in
  action.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/jpl-fig1.gif" align="center"
  alt="JPL Example Button" border="0" width="400" height="123"></p>

  <p>JPL is a work in progress, and will continue to grow. And it
  does more than what I've shown here. It provides access not just
  to Java objects and methods, but JNI functions as well, and
  handles automatic conversion between Perl variables and Java
  arrays.</p>
