  <h4><i>Chris Nandor</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  <font size="+2">I</font> love Macs, and I use them whenever
  possible. But don't worry. I'm not here to convert anybody (this
  time).

  <p>Mac folks have many of the same needs as Unix folks. We need
  to launch programs, manipulate files, shut down processes, log
  actions, and communicate with programs. In this article I'll talk
  about how you can control Mac applications from your Perl
  programs, using the Perl interface to AppleEvents.</p>

  <p>A while back I wanted to send some files via FTP from my Mac
  to my Unix server. Of course, I could have just downloaded libnet
  from the CPAN and used Net::FTP (see <a href=
  "../vol1_3/tpj0103-0007.html">TPJ #3</a>). But I already have
  several FTP programs on my Mac that are fully-featured and allow
  me to interact with them directly via the mouse or keyboard. It
  would be nice to interact with these programmatically, as easily
  as I could with Net::FTP. Maybe something like this:</p>
  <pre>
#!perl -w
use Mac::Apps::Anarchie;
$ftp = new Anarchie;
$file = 'test.txt';
$ftp-&gt;host('ftp.host.com');
$ftp-&gt;store("HD:Desktop Folder:$file", "/pub/$file");
</pre>

  <p>Not all that different from any old FTP module you might
  encounter - but this code opens up Anarchie (Peter N. Lewis'
  popular FTP client for the Mac) and shows the progress in a
  window, allowing the user to interact directly with the session
  if need be. Simple, right? Well, that's a matter of perspective.
  Let's start with something you might be more familiar with.</p>

  <h3>AppleScript</h3>

  <p>AppleScript is Apple's proprietary scripting language for Mac
  OS. It hasn't undergone many revisions over the years; the
  version that shipped with Mac OS 8 is only 1.1.2. It's quite
  powerful.</p>

  <p>Like most scripting languages, AppleScript is extensible. For
  instance, you can add in regular expression capabilities by
  dropping a regex "module" into the Scripting Additions folder.
  But the main purpose of AppleScript is to talk to other
  applications. The snippet of AppleScript below opens an
  application called Progress Bar and creates a new window named
  "Counting" at coordinates 100,50 (x,y). We'll use this later.</p>
  <pre>
<b>tell</b> application "Progress Bar 1.0.1"
make new window with properties {Name:"Counting",Position:{100, 50}}
<b>end tell</b>
</pre>

  <p>That chunk of code uses Apple Events to communicate with the
  Progress Bar application. Many people think of AppleScript and
  Apple Events as synonyms, but in fact any OSA (Open Scripting
  Architecture) language can use Apple Events to control the
  behavior of applications. (Dave Winer's Frontier is another
  popular OSA language for issuing Apple Events.)</p>

  <p>But I don't like AppleScript. And I'm not crazy about
  Frontier. Not that they aren't powerful and enjoyed by their
  users, but they don't suit my preferences, and they probably
  don't suit yours, either. Our preference is Perl. Now, we could,
  if we choose, use AppleScript from MacPerl. The built-in
  <tt>MacPerl::DoAppleScript()</tt> takes one argument and compiles
  and runs that argument as AppleScript:</p>
  <pre>
#!perl -w
print &amp;MacPerl::DoAppleScript(&lt;&lt;EOS);
tell application "Progress Bar 1.0.1"
make new window with properties {Name:"Counting", Position:{100, 50}}
end tell
EOS
</pre>

  <p>That's better than having to write a whole program in
  AppleScript. But it still isn't really Perl. AppleScript is very
  effective for controlling events, but for writing CGI scripts
  it's nothing short of a nightmare. I find the syntax horrible,
  the flow control nauseating, and the data structures entirely
  insufficient. I like Perl. I dream in Perl. I want to manage my
  computers and program in Perl whenever possible.</p>

  <p>Personal preferences aside, the above code is ineffective in
  some key ways. First, AppleScript has to be compiled. Normally,
  you compile AppleScript and save the compiled version. But since
  the code is embedded in a Perl script, it has to be recompiled
  every time it is run. Further, the embedded AppleScript doesn't
  provide good error messages. In short, it's just not the best way
  to do things.</p>

        The current release of MacPerl as of this writing is 5.1.5,
        based on Perl 5.004. It requires System 7 or above
        (including Mac OS 8), and runs on all PowerPC and 68K
        computers. For 68K computers, the "BigMacPerl" archive
        includes extras that provide the full functionality of the
        PowerPC version. Installation is simple - just run the
        installer program, and it does all the work. No
        configuration required.

  <h3>Apple Events</h3>

  <p>The best way would be to use Perl to communicate directly with
  the applications using Apple Events. So when the author of
  MacPerl, Matthias Neeracher, released the Mac::AppleEvents module
  last year, I decided to put it to good use.</p>

  <p>Apple Events (AEs) often intimidate novices, but to use them
  you have to be familiar with how they're constructed. An Apple
  Event is basically a data structure, similar to a hash. A typical
  Apple Event contains several parameters, each consisting of a
  keyword and <i>descriptor record</i>, just like the keys and
  values of a hash. Parameters often include information from
  built-in classes and properties of those classes. For instance, a
  window is a class, and it has properties for its name and
  position.</p>

  <p>Also included in the event is the target application ID, the
  four-character application signature that all Mac OS applications
  possess. All events belong to an event <i>suite</i>, and that
  suite ID is part of the event. Finally, the ID of the event
  itself is given. The whole thing (which must fit within 32
  kilobytes) is bundled up and sent to an event handler. After the
  event is processed by the system and (typically) processed by the
  target application, a reply event is returned to the sender.</p>

  <p>The <tt>AEPrint()</tt> method in Mac::AppleEvents is a useful
  debugging tool. <tt>AEPrint()</tt> displays a string
  representation of an event. That illustrates what your code is
  doing and helps you find errors.</p>

  <p>To be honest, Apple Events aren't too pretty, even in Perl.
  Eventually, I got to the point where I would do the following to
  achieve the same results as the AppleScript on the previous page.
  We'll discuss this program below.</p>
  <pre>
#!perl -wl015
use Mac::AppleEvents;
$params = "kocl:type(cwin), prdt:{ pnam: "Counting", 
           ppos:[100, 50] }";
$evt = AEBuildAppleEvent('core', 'crel', 
                         typeApplSignature, 'PBar', 
                         0, 0, $params) || die $^E;
$rep = AESend($evt, kAEWaitReply) || die $^E;
print AEPrint($evt)
print AEPrint($rep);
AEDisposeDesc($evt);
AEDisposeDesc($rep);
# NOTES:
# \015 is the Mac line break character, not \012!
#
# curly quotes (option-[ and option-shift-[) surround items
# of type TEXT. These are non-ASCII characters: " and ".
#
# $^E is similar to $!, but gives platform-specific error info
# Apple Events don't do automatic garbage collection, so 
# we dispose of the event with AEDisposeDesc.
</pre>

  <p><b>This prints:</b></p>
  <pre>
core\crel{kocl:type(cwin), 
      prdt:{pnam:"Counting", ppos:[100, 50]}, 
      &amp;inte:cans, &amp;timo:3600}
aevt\ansr{}
</pre>

  <p>The first line of the output (from <tt>core</tt> to
  <tt>3600</tt>) is the Apple Event that was sent, and the second
  line is what we got back from the application. An error would
  appear (usually with the keyword <tt>errn</tt> or <tt>errs</tt>)
  if something went wrong.</p>

  <p>Not very pretty, but a thousand times better because it's Perl
  instead of AppleScript. And now I can stick that in a package and
  do something like this:</p>
  <pre>
#!perl -w
use Mac::Apps::PBar;
$bar = Mac::Apps::PBar-&gt;new('Counting','100, 50');
</pre>

  <p>That's the stuff. And, of course, the code is much faster now,
  not only in runtime (since MacPerl doesn't have to compile the
  AppleScript), but in write time (since it is Perl!).</p>

  <p>Of course, this laziness is only made possible by the
  <tt>Mac::Apps::PBar</tt> module. Relatively few Mac applications
  have such modules; communicating with applications that don't
  will be unpleasant because you'll need to use raw Apple
  Events.</p>

  <h3>Accessing Apple Events: A Tutorial</h3>

  <p>Most Mac applications understand a wide variety of Apple
  Events. Trouble is, it's not so easy figuring out which ones.
  Nearly all applications speak a standard set of Apple Events,
  just as most have the same basic menu functions (Open, Close,
  Quit, and so on). But whereas the contents of pull-down menus can
  be discovered just by pointing and clicking, ascertaining the
  Apple Events understood by an application is a bit more
  difficult.</p>

  <p>The best way to find out exactly what Apple Events your
  application understands is to drop it onto Script Editor, the
  editor that comes with AppleScript. Dictionary entries for your
  application will appear, normally with complete descriptions of
  events and classes. Unfortunately, these are in AppleScript's
  native tongue, and aren't useful for handling Apple Events
  directly. For instance, Script Editor will tell you that with
  AppleScript you can create a window by writing "make new window,"
  but it won't tell you that the event is named <tt>crel</tt> and
  is in the suite named <tt>core</tt>.</p>

  <p>There are ways to get the specific terms, of course. One way
  is to use Frontier. (Go to the "Commercial Developers" suite,
  select "Enter your App's Name", and then type in the
  four-character application ID and select it in the dialog box.
  Frontier will give you a database of the events (verbs) for that
  application, including the true suite, event, and parameter
  names.) But the simplest way is by using a MacPerl droplet named
  <i>aete.converter</i>, created by David C. Schooley.
  <i>aete.converter</i> reads in the <i>aete</i> (Apple Event
  Terminology Extension) resources from the application and spits
  out the information into a text file.</p>

  <p>Knowing that I had been working with MacPerl and Apple Events,
  JAMPH (Just Another MacPerl Hacker) Alan Fry contacted me about
  Progress Bar. This freeware application, by Gregory Dow, is
  nothing more than an Apple Event-capable progress bar that shows
  how close some task is to completion. You create a window, give
  it a window name and captions, some maximum and minimum values,
  and every once in a while an update to the value of the bar.</p>

  <p>Using the output from <a href=
  "tpj0204-0006b.html"><i>aete.converter</i></a>, Alan and I tried
  to figure out what to do. Let's revisit the simple event from the
  beginning of the article:</p>
  <pre>
<b>tell</b> application "Progress Bar 1.0.1" 
make new window with properties 
           {Name:"Window",Position:{100, 250}}
<b>end tell</b>
</pre>

  <p>For AppleScript we needed the name of the application.
  However, we need the full-fledged application ID for Apple
  Events. This can be obtained in numerous ways, such as with
  ResEdit.(Select the application with the "Get File/Folder
  Info..." command. The application ID is the "Creator.")
  AppleScript will try to determine the application ID by looking
  for an application of that name, but when it converts the
  AppleScript to events, it uses the application ID too.</p>

  <p>The <i>aete.converter</i> output on the previous page told us
  some key facts about the <tt>make</tt> event. The application ID
  is <tt>PBar</tt>, the suite is <tt>core</tt>, and the event ID is
  <tt>crel</tt> (remember, these are the first three things we need
  to talk to our application). It tells us that the one required
  parameter is <tt>kocl</tt>, the type of element. Scanning further
  down, we find that the window class is <tt>cwin</tt>. So we have
  a nice little Apple Event:</p>
  <pre>
$evt = AEBuildAppleEvent('core','crel',
                        typeApplSignature,
                        'PBar',0,0,
                        "kocl:type(cwin)")
       || die $^E;
</pre>

  <p>Now that we can create a window, how do we give it a name and
  position, as in the original AppleScript? <i>aete.converter</i>
  tells us to use the properties parameter (<tt>prdt</tt>). But to
  use it, we first need to know which properties are available.</p>

  <p>This is put together similarly to the AppleScript version. The
  keyword for the name is <tt>pnam</tt>, and the keyword for the
  position is <tt>ppos</tt>. Note that <tt>pnam</tt> is of type
  <tt>TEXT</tt>, so it's enclosed by curly quotes. <tt>ppos</tt> is
  of type <tt>qdPT</tt>, which is a list. Like an array reference
  in Perl, a list of elements is separated by commas and enclosed
  by square brackets. The full event corresponding to the
  AppleScript version is now complete:</p>
  <pre>
$evt = AEBuildAppleEvent('core', 'crel', typeApplSignature, 
       'PBar', 0, 0,
       "kocl:type(cwin),prdt:{ pnam: "Window" , ppos:[100, 250] }") 
       || die $^E;
</pre>

  <p>We now have a progress bar in a window with a specific name
  and position, shown at the top of the next column. But it's
  empty. How do we update the progress bar? How do we change the
  value of the bar, or add text over the bar? How do we give it a
  caption and get it to look like the image on the next page?
  Looking back at the output of <i>aete.converter</i>, we ascertain
  how to set data: we start out the same way, with suite
  <tt>core</tt>, but a new event ID, <tt>setd</tt>. This time, we
  have two different parameters, and both are required. The first
  is the object to be changed (the caption, in this case). The
  second is the value to give it. This value can be numeric or
  text, depending on what the object is; for the caption, it will
  be some text. For now, let's just leave '<tt>obj</tt> ' as a
  variable (<tt>$miscobj</tt>) and put that in later. Note that the
  direct object parameter, '<tt>obj</tt> ', is always given the
  keyword '<tt>----</tt>', and that '<tt>obj</tt> ' is a four
  character string: three letters and a space.<tt>*</tt> Parameter
  names are always four characters.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/macperl-fig1.gif" width="290" height="102"
    border="0" alt="A Plain Progress Bar">

    <p><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> A Plain Progress
    Bar</font></p>
  </div>
  <pre>
$evt = AEBuildAppleEvent('core', 'setd', typeApplSignature, 
       'PBar', 0, 0, "'----':$miscobj, 
       data:"Caption Text"") || die $^E;
</pre>

  <p>Now what do we do with <tt>$miscobj?</tt> (Keep in mind that
  the direct object parameter mentioned above isn't the same thing
  as an Apple Event object. An Apple Event object can be the value
  of the direct object parameter, or any other parameter, but it's
  not a parameter itself.) We have to start by understanding the
  format of Apple Event objects:</p>
  <pre>
   obj{want:xxxx, from:xxxx, form:xxxx, seld:xxxx)}
</pre>

  <p><tt>want</tt> is the class ID. It describes what type of
  object it is. from is the container description - null unless
  this object is contained inside another object. We will see both
  forms below. <tt>form</tt> is the form of the data, which might
  be a property, an index, or something else. <tt>seld</tt> is the
  data itself.</p>

  <p>This time, our object is a property of a class. The class is
  the progress bar (<tt>PBar</tt>), and the property that
  <i>aete.converter</i> reveals to us is <tt>Cap1</tt>. Remember
  that we're describing the property of the class in this object,
  not the class itself. So want is type(<tt>prop</tt>),
  <tt>form</tt> is <tt>prop</tt>, and <tt>seld</tt> is
  <tt>type(Cap1</tt>). We don't have the container yet, so we leave
  from as another variable, and we construct our object
  accordingly:</p>
  <pre>
$miscobj = "obj{want:type(prop), from:$progobj,
            form:prop, seld:type(Cap1)}";
</pre>

  <p>But we aren't done constructing our object; the property is
  contained by a progress bar (assigned the index number 1, since
  it is in the top window). Now <tt>want</tt> is an object, and we
  give it the class ID of the object, which is <tt>PBar</tt> (event
  classes and suites often take the same name as the application
  ID). Again, this object is contained by another object - the
  window itself - so we'll leave it as a variable.</p>
  <pre>
$progobj = "obj{want:type(PBar), from:$windobj, 
            form:indx, seld:long(1)}";
</pre>

  <p>The window object is similar to the progress bar object, but
  has no container (finally!), so its <tt>from</tt> is null.
  Putting everything together yields the code and image shown at
  the top of the next page.</p>
  <pre>
$windobj = "obj{want:type(cwin), from:null(), 
            form:indx, seld:long(1)}";
$progobj = "obj{want:type(PBar), from:$windobj, 
            form:indx, seld:long(1)}";
$miscobj = "obj{want:type(prop), from:$progobj,
            form:prop, seld:type(Cap1)}";
$evt = AEBuildAppleEvent('core', 'setd', 
            typeApplSignature, 'PBar',  0, 0, 
            "'----':$miscobj, data:"Caption Text"")
            || die $^E;
</pre>

  <p>That's a lot of work to do something that could have been done
  more simply in AppleScript. But now we just can stick it in a
  module and do cool things like this:</p>
  <pre>
#!perl -w
use strict;
use Mac::Apps::PBar;
#create window
my $bar = Mac::Apps::PBar-&gt;new('FTP Download', '100, 50');
# Module sets each element of hashref in turn
$bar-&gt;data({Cap1 =&gt; 'file: BigFile.tar.gz', 
            Cap2 =&gt; 'size: 1,230K',
            MinV =&gt; '0',
            MaxV =&gt; '1230'});
# Set the value of the bar every second, for 11 seconds
for (0..10) {
        $bar-&gt;data({ Valu =&gt; $_*123 });
    sleep(1);
}
sleep(5);
$bar-&gt;close_window;
</pre>

  <p>Sometimes it's not so easy to construct these methods. Often
  the events are confusing, or there's no documentation about how
  to use them, or the documentation is just plain wrong. Help is
  occasionally available: the AETracker Control Panel can be used
  to capture Apple Events. By writing AppleScript to do what you
  want, invoking AETracker, running the AppleScript, and analyzing
  the AETracker output, you can get a better idea of how the event
  works.</p>

  </div>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>Many tasks that people now attempt with AppleScript can be
  done better in Perl - if the proper Apple Events can be
  constructed. The possibilities are endless. Assemble a Quark
  XPress document and apply style sheets. Invoke utilities at night
  and have them perform particular actions. Process HTML files and
  then upload them to a remote server with Anarchie.</p>

  <p>Apple Events will continue to be a part of Rhapsody, whose
  applications will run on any current Mac OS, Windows 95/NT, or
  Rhapsody box. Thus, Apple Events will probably become even more
  important as time goes on. Of course, Apple's new OS could die a
  miserable death, and Mac OS could be relegated to the ranks of
  the Amiga and OS/2, but we try not to think about that.</p>
