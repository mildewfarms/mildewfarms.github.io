  <h4><i>Dave Roth</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  Let's say you administer a network of thousands of Win32
  machines, and one day you decide to synchronize all of their
  clocks. Logging onto each workstation as an administrator so that
  you can run <tt>NET TIME</tt> will take days. Thanks to Win32
  Perl, it'll take you less than an hour, with the help of its
  modules that support an armada of administrative functions. In
  this column, we'll explore the features found in two of those
  modules: Win32::NetAdmin and Win32::AdminMisc.

  <p>You want each of your thousands of workstations to run the
  command <tt>NET TIME \\SERVER /SET /Y</tt>, which sets the local
  machine's time and date to match the time on the machine named
  <tt>\\SERVER</tt>. The <tt>/SET</tt> and <tt>/Y</tt> flags set
  the time and automatically answer "yes" to any questions asked by
  the system. Luckily, you long ago set the machines' schedule
  services (see sidebar, next page) to log on to <tt>\\SERVER</tt>
  under an administrative account. This allows you to set a
  scheduled job to run as if the administrator logged on and ran it
  from the console. All you need to do is to add a scheduled job to
  each machine. Consider the program below, which uses one function
  from each module:</p>
  <pre>
1. use Win32::AdminMisc;
2. use Win32::NetAdmin;
3.
4. srand(time);
5. $Domain = "SOUTH_PARK";
6. $Server = "\\\\ServerName";
7.<b> Win32::NetAdmin::GetServers($Server, $Domain,
                                          SV_TYPE_ALL, \@List);</b>
8. foreach $Machine (@List){ 
9.     $Time = sprintf("3:%02d am", int(rand(60)));
10.    if <b>(Win32::AdminMisc::ScheduleAdd($Machine,
11.               $Time, 
12.               0, 
13.               SUNDAY, 
14.               JOB_RUN_PERIODICALLY | JOB_NONINTERACTIVE,
15.               "net time \\\\server /s /y")) { </b>
16.      print "Job added to $Machine at $Time every Sunday.\n";
17.    } else { 
18.      print "Job not added to $Machine.\n"; 
19.    } 
20. }
</pre>

  <p>We retrieve a list of all of the computer names (by specifying
  the <tt>SV_TYPE_ALL</tt> flag) in the 'SOUTH_PARK' domain. The
  script requests the computer <tt>\\ServerName</tt> to generate
  this list on our behalf. You could request the list from your
  Primary Domain Controller - however, if your PDC is busy with
  other requests and services you could request any machine (PDC,
  BDC, server, or workstation) to generate it.( A primary domain
  controller (PDC) is a special NT server that contains the master
  database of user accounts, user groups, computer accounts, and
  domain trust accounts. A PDC will replicate to and update from a
  BDC (backup domain controller) every so often. Typically, the PDC
  has the most updated database.) If <tt>$Server</tt> is empty,
  <tt>GetServers()</tt> requests the list from the computer running
  the program. Once that a list has been retrieved, we walk through
  it while line 9 picks a random time between 3:00 am and 3:59 am.
  A job is submitted to $Machine in lines 10 through 15. These
  lines show how you can schedule a job on a remote machine,
  specifying the time, day of week, day of month, special flags,
  and what command to execute.</p>

  <p>This is just a sampling of what you can do with the NetAdmin
  and AdminMisc modules. NetAdmin provides the basic WinNT
  administrator functions: adding and removing user accounts,
  adding and removing users from groups, creating and deleting
  groups, and so on. There are, however, some limitations of
  NetAdmin, and that's why I wrote AdminMisc, described later.
  AdminMisc wasn't designed to replace NetAdmin so much as to
  complement it with extra functions that let you edit the full
  spectrum of user account information, rename a user, set a user's
  password, retrieve the time of day, and more.</p>

  <h3>The NetAdmin Module</h3>

  <p>Win32::NetAdmin comes with the ActiveState version of Perl and
  the core distribution's Win32 standard library. I've used
  NetAdmin in CGI scripts that manage accounts, and in programs
  that run perform maintenance on multiple computers. NT includes
  tools that handle most administrative functions - but most are
  GUI based. If you've ever had to enter hundreds of users with the
  User Manager you know why NetAdmin is a must. I'll describe some
  common NetAdmin tasks now.</p>

  <table width="90%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
  align="center" bgcolor="#E0E0E0">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <center>
          <font face="Verdana,sans-serif" size="2"><b>Scheduling
          like an Admin</b></font>
        </center>
        <hr size="1" noshade>

        <p>The Windows NT schedule service is the equivalent of the
        Unix <i>cron</i> daemon - just not as flexible. To set up
        the schedule service so it runs under an administrative
        account, you need to first choose a user ID that belongs to
        the Administrators group. Next, you will need to log on to
        your workstation (or server) as an administrator, and open
        the Services applet in the control panel. Now select the
        "schedule" service and hit the STARTUP button. From here
        you should specify the "startup type" as automatic. Select
        the option "This Account:" from the box section of the
        window labeled "Log On As:" and type in the name of the
        administrative account you created, prepended with the
        domain name (such as <tt>MYDOMAIN\ScheduleService</tt>).
        You&rsquo;ll need to put in the password and confirm it. If
        you&rsquo;ve done everything correctly you can hit the OK
        button and then start the service. The service
        automatically start when you next reboot the machine.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p><b>Managing user accounts.</b> Removing a user account with
  NetAdmin is easy: <tt>Win32::NetAdmin::UserDelete($Server,
  $User). $Server</tt> contains the name of the machine to perform
  the task (usually a PDC or BDC). If it's an empty string, the
  computer running the program executes the deletion. Like most of
  the functions in these modules, <tt>UserDelete()</tt> returns 1
  on success and 0 on failure.Adding users is a bit more
  involved:</p>
  <pre>
1. Win32::NetAdmin::UserCreate(
2.    $Domain,                       # Domain
3.    $User,                         # Userid 
4.    $Password,                     # Password 
5.    $PasswordAge,                  # Password Age 
6.    USER_PRIV_USER,                # Privileges 
7.    $HomeDir,                      # Home directory 
8.    $Comment,                      # Comment 
9.    UF_NORMAL_ACCOUNT | UF_SCRIPT, # Flags 
10.   "c:\\scripts\\$User.bat"       # Log on script 
11.); 
</pre>

  <p><tt>$Domain</tt> can be a domain name, a server, or an empty
  string (which uses the default domain). <tt>$User, $Password,
  $HomeDir</tt>, and <tt>$Comment</tt> are self-explanatory.
  <tt>$PasswordAge</tt> is ignored, and the privilege should always
  be the constant <tt>USER_PRIV_USER</tt>. For the flags on line 9,
  you must specify at least <tt>UF_NORMAL_ACCOUNT</tt> and
  <tt>UF_SCRIPT</tt>. There are four other flags that you can use
  (by logically OR'ing them together):</p>
  <pre>
UF_ACCOUNTDISABLE        Disable the account.
UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD        No password is required.
UF_PASSWD_CANT_CHANGE    User can not change the password.
UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD    The password never expires.
</pre>

  <p>If you want to get an entire list of all of your users, you
  can use: <tt>Win32::NetAdmin::GetUsers($Server,
  FILTER_NORMAL_ACCOUNT, \@Users</tt>). Upon success, this fills
  <tt>@Users</tt> with a list of user account names. Once again,
  <tt>$Server</tt> is the name of the machine that executes the
  function on our behalf, and an empty string means the computer
  you're on now.</p>

  <p><b>Managing groups.</b> Once you've populated your user
  database with accounts, you'll want to start manipulating which
  groups users belong to. Group membership is a nifty feature of
  NT, making it easy to assign permissions to files and directories
  as well as printers, remote dial-in modems, and other
  resources.</p>

  <p>If you want to create a new group you have to first decide
  what kind of group you want: global
  (<tt>Win32::NetAdmin::GroupCreate($Server, $GroupName,
  $Comment)</tt>) or local
  (<tt>Win32::NetAdmin::LocalGroupCreate($Server, $GroupName,
  $Comment)</tt>).(A full definition of global versus local groups
  is beyond the scope of this article. Suffice it to say that a
  global group consists of user accounts and local groups from your
  domain as well as other domains that you trust, while a local
  group contains only accounts from your local domain. Local groups
  can be seen only by the local domain; global groups can be seen
  by other domains. ) The calls accept the same <tt>$server
  name</tt> convention we've seen before. The <tt>$GroupName</tt>
  is the name of the group you are going to create (such as
  "Internet Users"). An example:</p>
  <pre>
Win32::NetAdmin::GroupCreate("\\\\Server",
                             "Internet Users",
                             "Those users who can access the Internet")
</pre>

  <p>Now that you have some groups, you can add users to them with
  <tt>Win32::NetAdmin::GroupAddUsers($Server, $GroupName,
  $User)</tt> or <tt>Win32::NetAdmin::LocalGroupAddUsers($Server,
  $GroupName, $User)</tt>. The variables are the same as when you
  create a group - with the exception that <tt>$User</tt> is the
  name of the user account to be added. There's a trick that isn't
  documented: If $User is a reference to an array, these functions
  add all the users in the array. The following code thus adds four
  users to the "administrators" local group:</p>
  <pre>
1. @Users = ('Stan', 'Kyle', 'Kenny', 'Cartman'); 
2. Win32::NetAdmin::LocalGroupAddUsers('',
                                       'administrators',
                                       \@Users);
</pre>

  <p>Removing users from groups is straightforward:</p>
  <pre>
Win32::NetAdmin::GroupDelUsers($Server, $GroupName, $User);
</pre>

  <p>or</p>
  <pre>
 
Win32::NetAdmin::LocalGroupDelUsers($Server,
                                    $GroupName,
                                    $User);
</pre>

  <p>Likewise, you can provide an array reference when deleting
  users:</p>
  <pre>
Win32::NetAdmin::GroupDelUsers($Server,
                               $GroupName, 
                               \@Users);
</pre>

  <p><b>Checking for group membership.</b> To determine whether a
  user is in a particular group, you need to remember to check both
  local and global groups:</p>
  <pre>
sub IsMember {
   my ($Server, $Group, $User) = @_;
   return (Win32::GroupIsMember($Server, 
                               $Group,
                               $User) ||
          Win32::NetAdmin::LocalGroupIsMember($Server,
                                              $Group,
                                      $User));
} 
</pre>

  <p>If this subroutine were invoked as <tt>IsMember("SOUTH_PARK",
  "Children", "Cartman")</tt> it would return 1 if there was a
  group (either local or global) called "Children" containing
  Cartman.</p>

  <p><b>Retrieve a domain controller.</b> There may come a time
  when you need to know the primary domain controller for your
  domain. You can retrieve the name of this computer with
  <tt>Win32::NetAdmin::GetDomainController($Server, $Domain,
  $Name)</tt>. The <tt>$Domain</tt> argument specifies which domain
  to consider; if it's empty, the primary domain of
  <tt>$Server</tt> is used. If the function is successful,
  <tt>$Name</tt> will be set to the name of the PDC and the
  function will return a 1, as per usual.</p>

  <h3>The AdminMisc Module</h3>

  <p>Some time ago I wrote a module called Win32::AdminMisc that
  provides functions not found in any of the standard Win32
  extensions. I will describe some of its functionality here; more
  information is at: <a href=
  "http://www.roth.net/perl/adminmisc.htm" target=
  "resource window">http://www.roth.net/perl/adminmisc.htm</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Modifying user accounts.</b> NetAdmin allows an
  administrator to modify attributes of a user account. You can
  change the home directory, flags, comments, and the log on
  script. However, it's limited; you can't, say, change the user's
  full name. The AdminMisc module lets you set a wealth of
  attributes, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Home directory</li>

    <li>Comment</li>

    <li>Full name</li>

    <li>Account flags</li>

    <li>Log on script</li>

    <li>Workstations the user can log on to</li>

    <li>Account expiration date</li>

    <li>Hours a user can be logged in</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A call to the <tt>UserGetMiscAttributes()</tt> function
  returns a hash of values constituting the user's account
  information:</p>
  <pre>
if (Win32::AdminMisc::UserGetMiscAttributes('SOUTH_PARK',
                                            'Cartman',
                                            \%Hash)) {
     map {print "$_=$Hash{$_}\n";} sort(keys(%Hash)); 
} 
</pre>

  <p>This displays:</p>
  <pre>
1.  USER_ACCT_EXPIRES=4294967295
2.  USER_AUTH_FLAGS=0
3.  USER_BAD_PW_COUNT=0
4.  USER_CODE_PAGE=
5.  USER_COMMENT=just a test account
6.  USER_COUNTRY_CODE=0
7.  USER_FLAGS=66049
8.  USER_FULL_NAME=Eric Cartman
9.  USER_HOME_DIR=\\server1\users\cartman
10. USER_HOME_DIR_DRIVE=h:
11. USER_LAST_LOGOFF=876103123
12. USER_LAST_LOGON=876092928
13. USER_LOGON_HOURS=255
14. USER_LOGON_SERVER=\\*
15. USER_MAX_STORAGE=4294967295
16. USER_NAME=cartman
17. USER_NUM_LOGONS=0
18. USER_PARMS=
19. USER_PASSWORD=
20. USER_PASSWORD_AGE=18764
21. USER_PASSWORD_EXPIRED=0
22. USER_PRIMARY_GROUP_ID=513
23. USER_PRIV=2
24. USER_PROFILE=c:\users\profiles\cartman
25. USER_SCRIPT_PATH=\\server1\scripts\logon.bat
26. USER_UNITS_PER_WEEK=168
27. USER_USER_ID=1002
28. USER_USR_COMMENT=
29. USER_WORKSTATIONS=
</pre>

  <p>Some of this information is read-only. The most important
  attributes that can't be changed with
  <tt>UserSetMiscAttributes()</tt> are the username (line 16) and
  the password (line 19). These can be altered with
  <tt>RenameUser()</tt> and <tt>SetPassword()</tt> - just pass in
  some named parameters (with <tt>=&gt;</tt>):</p>
  <pre>
Win32::AdminMisc::UserSetMiscAttributes('SOUTH_PARK',
                                        'cartman',
                                  USER_COMMENT =&gt; "CheesyPoofs Rule!",
                  USER_PROFILE =&gt; "c:\\temp\\cartman.usr");
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>USER_LAST_LOGON</tt> and <tt>USER_LAST_LOGOFF</tt>
  attributes are in UNIX time format - the number of seconds since
  January 1, 1970 - so you can display them with
  <tt>localtime()</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
print "Last logged on: ", localtime($Hash{USER_LAST_LOGON}), "\n";
</pre>

  <p><b>Renaming accounts.</b> One of the most popular functions in
  AdminMisc is <tt>RenameUser()</tt>, which lets you rename an
  account.(Many people want to know why I don't let you set the
  username with <tt>UserSetMiscAttributes()</tt>. The Win32 API
  prohibits altering the username and password with the same
  function and structure used for <tt>UserSetMiscAttributes()</tt>.
  I could have modified the code to accommodate it but I felt that
  using a <tt>RenameUser()</tt> function is simpler and more
  intuitive.) If you wanted to rename the user account Eric to
  Cartman it's as easy as
  <tt>Win32::AdminMisc::RenameUser("SOUTH_PARK", "Eric",
  "Cartman")</tt>. Wouldn't be great if more tasks were that easy?
  Resetting a password is.</p>

  <p><b>Resetting a user's password.</b> To reset a user's
  password, use <tt>SetPassword()</tt>. You need to be logged on as
  an administrator or account operator, and then invoke it as
  follows:</p>
  <pre>
Win32::AdminMisc::SetPassword($Server, "Cartman", "CheesyPoofs");
</pre>

  <p><tt>$Server</tt> can be any domain name, or even a computer
  name if you prepend it with double slashes: <tt>\\server</tt> or
  <tt>//server</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Log on as another user (impersonation).</b> I typically
  launch lots of applications when I develop code. I might have a C
  compiler, the user manager, the server manager, about five DOS
  emulations, a text editor, a mail program, and a web browser. I
  need all this clutter - but it becomes a burden when trying to
  debug an application that fails only when a particular user runs
  it. Instead of shutting down all my applications, logging off,
  and then logging in as the user, I use a process known as
  impersonation, shown below.</p>
  <pre>
$Domain = "SOUTH_PARK"; 
if (Win32::AdminMisc::LogonAsUser($Domain, "Cartman",
                                  "CheesyPoofs")) {
print "Logged on as: ", Win32::AdminMisc::GetLogonName(),"\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>LogonAsUser()</tt> function logs on as the troubled
  user. This changes the security context under which the Perl
  script runs - even though I am an administrator for my domain and
  have superuser permissions, the process running the Perl script
  will have limited access - it can do only what the user can do.
  The script then confirms that it's running as the desired user by
  printing <tt>GetLogonName()</tt>.(You could use
  <tt>Win32::LoginName()</tt>, but it seems not to work correctly
  with impersonated user accounts. For example, if you use
  <tt>LogonAsUser()</tt> to log on as administrator,
  <tt>Win32::LoginName()</tt> reports "administrator" - which is
  correct - but if you then use <tt>LogonAsUser()</tt> again to log
  on as, say, Joel, <tt>Win32::LoginName()</tt> still reports
  "administrator." <tt>Win32::AdminMisc::GetLogonName()</tt>
  reports, correctly, "Joel".) If the script tries to open a file
  or directory with inadequate permissions, access will be denied.
  This allows me to test the script as if it was running on this
  user's machine while he is logged on. If you've already thought
  about how groovy it would be to do this in a separate process,
  you're one step ahead of me.</p>

  <p><b>Spawning a process as another user.</b> What if you need to
  start another program (like Microsoft Word or a DOS process)
  under another user's context? It's not as easy as you would
  think. When you impersonate a user, the <i>current</i> running
  process (the Perl script) is placed under the user's context. If
  the Perl script spawns another process, it runs under the
  original user's context, not the impersonated context. There is a
  function to get around this situation called
  <tt>CreateProcessAsUser()</tt>, but it's a bit confusing.
  Consider this code:</p>
  <pre>
1. use Win32::AdminMisc;
2. if (Win32::AdminMisc::LogonAsUser($Server, "Cartman",
                                     "CheesyPoofs")) {
3.     $User = Win32::AdminMisc::GetLogonName();
4.     $Result = Win32::AdminMisc::CreateProcessAsUser(
5.                        "cmd.exe",
6.                        "Flags", CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE, 
7.                        "XSize", 640, 
8.                        "YSize", 400, 
9.                        "X", 200, 
10.                       "Y", 175, 
11.                       "XBuffer", 80, 
12.                       "YBuffer", 175, 
13.                       "Show", SW_MINIMIZE, 
14.                       "Title", "$User's process", 
15.                       "Inherit", 1, 
16.                       "Fill", BACKGROUND_BLUE | 
17.                               FOREGROUND_RED | 
18.                               FOREGROUND_BLUE | 
19.                               FOREGROUND_INTENSITY |
20.                               FOREGROUND_GREEN, 
21.             ); 
22. }
</pre>

  <p>Let's take a look at this mess. First we log on as Cartman
  (line 2) and retrieve the current user's ID in line 3, which
  should be <tt>cartman</tt>. Then a DOS process is launched,
  running under Cartman's user context (lines 4-22). Lines 6
  through 20 aren't necessary, but illustrate some interesting
  options. In line 6 we pass the string '<tt>Flags</tt>' followed
  by the <tt>CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE</tt> flag; this creates the process
  in a new DOS box. The <tt>XSize</tt> and <tt>YSize</tt>
  attributes specify the size (in pixels) of the new DOS
  process.<tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> tell where (also in pixels) to
  place the new process window, offset from the upper left of the
  screen. <tt>XBuffer</tt> and <tt>YBuffer</tt> indicate how many
  characters to buffer (great for providing a scrollable capture
  buffer). Line 13 makes the new window start up minimized. Title
  sets the contents of the title bar of the new window. Inherit
  specifies that open filehandles (such as STDIN, STDOUT, and
  STDERR) will be inherited by the new process (quite handy if you
  associate a socket with your STDIN/STDOUT). Finally, the Fill
  option sets the color of the foreground (the text) and the
  background of the new process window - in this case the
  background is blue and the foreground is bright white (a
  combination of red, green, and blue).</p>

  <p>Now let's look at two more useful functions in AdminMisc:
  <tt>GetHostAddress()</tt> and <tt>GetHostName()</tt>. These are
  similar to Perl's <tt>gethostbyname()</tt> and
  <tt>gethostbyaddr()</tt> but are a bit simpler to use. You pass
  in either an IP address string (e.g. <tt>198.160.5.33</tt>) or a
  DNS name (e.g. <tt>www.roth.net</tt>) and the result is its
  counterpart.</p>
  <pre>
$IP = Win32::AdminMisc::GetHostAddress("www.roth.net");
$DNSname = Win32::AdminMisc::GetHostName("198.160.5.33");
</pre>

  <p>AdminMisc caches the results of both functions, remembering
  previously resolved addresses. You can resize the cache with
  <tt>Win32::AdminMisc::DNSCacheSize(2000)</tt>, which resets the
  cache and erases its current contents. This uses more memory, but
  for typical query patterns it saves time. Keep in mind that if
  you hold too many cached entries it might take longer to look up
  the query in the cache than to resolve the address via DNS
  again.</p>

  <p><b>Discovering your drives.</b> Suppose that you are writing a
  script that scans your drives so you can delete all temporary
  files. The biggest problem is discovering how many drives you
  have and whether they're networked disks, CD-ROMs, or floppies
  (which you don't want to scan). This is where the
  <tt>GetDrives()</tt> and <tt>DriveType()</tt> functions come in
  handy. The following code generates a list of available
  disks:</p>
  <pre>
@Drives = Win32::AdminMisc::GetDrives(); 
foreach $Drive (sort(@Drives)) {
$Type = Win32::AdminMisc::GetDriveType($Drive);
($Total, $Free) = Win32::AdminMisc::GetDriveSpace($Drive);
    if ($Type == DRIVE_FIXED) {
        $Type = "hard drive";
        } elsif ($Type == DRIVE_REMOVABLE) {
        $Type = "removable (floppy) drive";
        } elsif ($Type == DRIVE_REMOTE) {
        $Type = "network drive";
        } elsif ($Type == DRIVE_CDROM) {
        $Type = "CDROM drive";
        } elsif ($Type == DRIVE_RAMDISK) {
        $Type = "RAM disk";
        } else {
        $Type = "disk type $Type";
        } 
    print "The $Drive is a $Type and has a size of $Total
                 bytes with $Free bytes available.\n";
}
 
</pre>

  <p>Here we use <tt>GetDrives()</tt> without any parameters, which
  returns all the drives attached to the machine. Instead, you
  could have passed in a drive type constant which would have
  selected only drives of that type, such as:</p>
  <pre>
@CDRomDrives = Win32::AdminMisc::GetDrives(DRIVE_CDROM)
</pre>

  <table width="200" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
  align="right" bgcolor="#E0E0E0">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <center>
          <font face="Verdana,sans-serif" size="1"><b>Who can
          manage accounts and groups?</b></font>
        </center>
        <hr size="1" noshade>
        Any script that manipulates accounts or groups must be run
        from an account that is member of either the Administrators
        or Account Operators group. If the script manipulates an
        administrator - adding or removing users from the
        Administrators group - then it must be run from an account
        with administrator privileges.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>All drives that are specified or returned are represented as
  the root directory form of the drive, e.g. <tt>A:\</tt> or
  <tt>C:\</tt> or <tt>E:\</tt> It is very important that you use
  this format. Even if you use a UNC (Universal Naming Convention)
  such as: <tt>\\servername\share\</tt> make sure you specify a
  terminating backslash (just as if it were a root directory).</p>

  <p>You can also use these functions to discover specific
  information about your drives. Let's say you're running a script
  that takes inventory of all your machines and you need to know
  how many cylinders and tracks your drives have. You can retrieve
  the sectors per cluster, bytes per sector, free clusters, and
  number of clusters on the drive with:</p>
  <pre>
 
($SectorsPerCluster,
 $BytesPerSector,
 $FreeClusters,
 $TotalClusters) = GetDriveGeometry($Drive)
 
</pre>

  <p><b>Retrieving processor, process/thread, and memory
  information.</b> Perhaps in addition to information about your
  drives, you'd like to know more about your computer's
  configuration: the number and types of processors, total and
  available memory, and the version of Windows you're running.
  AdminMisc provides three functions to help:</p>
  <pre>
if (%Data = <b>Win32::AdminMisc::GetProcessorInfo()</b>){ 
    print "Memory Information:\n";
        print "\tNumber of processors: $Data{ProcessorNum}\n";
        print "\tType of processor: $Data{ProcessorType}\n";
        print "\tProcessor level: $Data{ProcessorLevel}\n";
        print "\tProcessor revision: $Data{ProcessorRevision}\n";
        print "\tPage size: $Data{PageSize}\n"; 
} 
if (%Data = <b>Win32::AdminMisc::GetMemoryInfo()</b>){ 
    print "\nMemory Information:\n";
        print "\tMemory available: $Data{RAMAvail}\n";
        print "\tMemory total: $Data{RAMTotal}\n";
    print "\tVirtual mem avail: $Data{VirtAvail}\n";
        print "\tVirtual mem total: $Data{VirtTotal}\n";
        print "\tPage mem available: $Data{PageAvail}\n";
        print "\tPage mem total: $Data{PageTotal}\n";
        print "\tCurrent memory load: $Data{Load}\n"; 
} 
if (%Data = <b>Win32::AdminMisc::GetWinVersion()</b>){ 
    print "\nWindows Information:\n";
        print "\tPlatform: $Data{Platform}\n";
        print "\tVersion: $Data{Major}.$Data{Minor}\n";
        print "\tBuild: $Data{Build}\n";
        print "\tService Pack version: $Data{CSD}\n"; 
} 
</pre>

  <p>The code is self-explanatory: functions
  <tt>GetProcessorInfo()</tt>, <tt>GetMemoryInfo()</tt>, and
  <tt>GetWinVersion()</tt> all return hashes of information about
  the machine or operating system.</p>

  <p><b>Reading and writing .ini files.</b> As you might be aware,
  Microsoft wants to migrate all those good old INI files into the
  registry.(For Windows novices: An INI file is a configuration or
  initialization file, typically with a file extension of .ini. The
  file is broken into sections; each section is a list of keys and
  values. The registry is a centralized database of values
  maintained by Windows. Software developers are encouraged to
  store configuration information in this registry instead of
  files. A nice idea, but sometimes too limiting because it doesn't
  allow for things like multiple configuration files in different
  directories.) Even though you'd like to oblige, it's not worth
  your time to load and exercise the registry extension just to get
  some configuration information. Or perhaps you find yourself
  needing to modify legacy applications that use INI files. You'll
  want to use <tt>ReadINI()</tt> and <tt>WriteINI()</tt>; just be
  aware that if you reference the <tt>c:/winnt/win.ini</tt> it
  might not be the same as plain old <tt>win.ini</tt>. Windows NT
  maps <tt>win.ini</tt> to two places: the physical
  <tt>win.ini</tt> file in the <tt>%SystemRoot%</tt> directory, and
  a key in the registry:
  <tt>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Win-<br>
  dowsNT\CurrentVersion\IniFileMapping<br>
  \win.ini</tt>. So whenever you change <tt>win.ini</tt> via these
  functions, NT modifies the registry.</p>

  <p>If you call <tt>ReadINI()</tt> without specifying a section, a
  list of all section names will be returned. Likewise, if you call
  the function with a section but no key, a list of all the keys in
  the specified section will be returned. Here's an example that
  dumps the full contents of <i>file.ini</i>:</p>
  <pre>
foreach $Section (sort(
               Win32::AdminMisc::ReadINI("c:/temp/file.ini",
                                         0,
                                         0 ))) {
        print "[$Section]\n";
        foreach $Key (sort( Win32::AdminMisc::ReadINI(
                                             "c:/temp/file.ini"
                                         $Section, 
                                         0 ))) {
        $Value = Win32::AdminMisc::ReadINI(
                                        "c:/temp/file.ini",
                                         $Section, 
                                        $Key);
                print "$Key=$Value\n"; 
    } 
}
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>WriteINI()</tt> function works like
  <tt>ReadINI()</tt>. If no section name is provided, all sections
  are deleted - the file is cleaned out. If a section name is
  provided without a key, all keys in that section are deleted. If
  a key but no value is specified, only that key is deleted.</p>
  <pre>
if ( Win32::AdminMisc::WriteINI("c:/temp/file.ini",   
                                "section 1", 
                                "", 
                                "")) { 
    Win32::AdminMisc::WriteINI("c:/temp/file.ini", 
                               "section 1",
                               "KeyName",
                               "Key's Value");
} 
</pre>

  <p>This removes all entries for <tt>section 1</tt> in the INI
  file and then adds the following section:</p>
  <pre>
[section 1]
KeyName=Key's Value
</pre>

  <p>If you don't specify a path to the INI file - that is, if you
  give only the file name - Windows searches for it by looking in
  the current directory and then in your path. If all else fails it
  looks in the <tt>%SystemRoot%</tt> and
  <tt>%SystemRoot%\System32</tt> directories.</p>

  <p><b>Exiting windows (or forcing users to log off).</b> Let's
  say you're using Perl to install some software, but you need the
  machine to shut down for a driver to take effect. Or maybe you're
  performing some server maintenance that requires all users to log
  out. Both are made possible by
  <tt>Win32::AdminMisc::ExitWindows()</tt>. This function takes a
  flag specifying how to exit:</p>

  <p>
  <tt>EWX_LOGOFF</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Log the user off. Applications will be told to quit so you may be
  prompted to save files.</p>

  <p><tt>EWX_POWEROFF</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Force the system
  to shutdown and power off. The system must support power off.</p>

  <p>
  <tt>EWX_REBOOT</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Shut down the system and reboot the computer.</p>

  <p><tt>EWX_SHUTDOWN</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shut down the
  system but don't reboot.</p>

  <p>For all of these flags except <tt>EWX_LOGOFF</tt>, your
  process must have the "Shut Down The System" privilege.</p>

  <p>You can also force the system to do its business without
  saving unsaved buffers by logically OR'ing the <tt>EWX_FORCE</tt>
  flag with any of the others. So to force the user to log off
  without concern for unsaved files, you'd use</p>
  <pre>
 
Win32::AdminMisc::ExitWindows(EWX_LOGOFF | EWX_FORCE)
</pre>

  <p>Of course, if you do this to the wrong person at the wrong
  time, you might find yourself in the unemployment line.</p>

  <p><b>Maintaining scheduled jobs.</b> In the beginning of this
  article, I wrote about scheduling jobs on an NT machine. The
  scheduler service is an incredibly powerful tool; on my LAN I use
  it religiously. Every night each workstation runs a batch file to
  perform routine maintenance, install software, update templates,
  update our SQL-based machine database (containing information
  about each computer, alerting us when a workstation is running
  low on disk space), synchronize the computer's time and date and
  a slew of other things. I can also add a job to a particular
  machine if I want that workstation to do something special like
  reboot or log off the user at a particular time. Very
  powerful.</p>

  <p>In addition to adding scheduled jobs to a workstation (locally
  or remotely), you can query a machine for the list of scheduled
  jobs. Here's how to find out how many jobs have been
  scheduled:</p>
  <pre>
$Num = Win32::AdminMisc::ScheduleList("//computer")
</pre>

  <p>Here's how to get both the number of jobs and a list of their
  names:</p>
  <pre>
$Num = Win32::AdminMisc::ScheduleList("//computer", \%List) 
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>%List</tt> hash will contain subhashes, one per job,
  with information about each. Keep in mind that if there are many
  jobs <tt>%List</tt> can become quite large. You can request
  information about a single job with</p>
  <pre>
Win32::AdminMisc::ScheduleGet("//computer", $JobNumber, \%Info)
</pre>

  <p>This populates the <tt>%Info</tt> hash with information about
  the job numbered <tt>$JobNumber</tt>. The function returns a 1 if
  successful and a 0 if not. The information stored in the hashes
  for both <tt>ScheduleList()</tt> and <tt>ScheduleGet()</tt> is
  the same as for the <tt>ScheduleAdd()</tt> function, demonstrated
  in the first program in this article.</p>

  <p>You can also delete scheduled jobs, either one at a time or
  within a range. To delete a specific job:</p>
  <pre>
Win32::AdminMisc::ScheduleDel("//computer", $JobNumber) 
</pre>

  <p>This deletes job number <tt>$JobNumber</tt> on
  <tt>//computer</tt>. To delete all jobs within a range:</p>
  <pre>
Win32::AdminMisc::ScheduleDel("//computer",
                              $JobNumber, 
                              $MaxJobNumber)
</pre>

  <p>This removes all jobs from <tt>$JobNumber</tt> and
  <tt>$MaxJobNumber</tt>, inclusive. You may have noticed that I
  use <tt>//computer</tt> as a computer name even though it's not a
  "proper" Microsoft computer name; these functions recognize both
  <tt>\\computer</tt> and <tt>//computer</tt> as valid names - I
  get awfully tired of escaping my backslashes, as in the
  Microsoft-proper "<tt>\\\\computer</tt>".</p>

  <p><b>Get the Time Of Day.</b> What if you need to discover the
  TOD on a remote machine? This is more helpful than you might
  think - if you want a remote machine to run a job five minutes
  from now, it helps to know what the remote machine thinks "now"
  is.</p>
  <pre>
$Time = Win32::AdminMisc::GetTOD($Machine); 
print "The time on $Machine is ", localtime($Time), ".\n";
</pre>

  <p>If you don't specify a <tt>$Machine</tt> then the local
  machine's time is returned.</p>

  <p><b>All things considered.</b> The Win32::NetAdmin and
  Win32::AdminMisc modules let you automate many of the tasks that
  every NT administrator needs to perform. They convert tedium to
  leisure; use them well.</p>
