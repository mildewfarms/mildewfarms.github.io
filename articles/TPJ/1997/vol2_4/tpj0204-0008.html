  Tired of the "which interpreter is best for the job" debates?
  Want something that makes the speed and power of C and C++
  available to several common interpreters - automatically? There's
  a new tool that does exactly this: SWIG, the Simplified Wrapper
  and Interface Generator.

  <p>SWIG is a freely available compiler developed by Dave Beazley,
  now at the University of Utah. It works on many Unix variants, as
  well as NT, Win95, and MacOS, although the Win95 and MacOS
  versions are less polished. It converts C and C++ files into
  interface code (called a "wrapper") that makes the contents
  available to Perl, Tcl, Guile, and Python - all automatically.
  Like Perl's own XS language, SWIG creates Perl wrappers around C
  code . Unlike XS, SWIG requires little or no programming
  effort.</p>

  <p>I'm not going to describe the mechanics of SWIG in detail; a
  more thorough treatment would address function prototypes,
  complex data structures, multiple inheritance, Perl classes, Tcl
  8 modules, exception handling, makefile generation, strict type
  checking in the interpreter, conditional compilation, and
  automatic generation of documentation. There's an excellent
  user's guide bundled with SWIG that covers all of these topics;
  in this article, I'll just show you the basics: how to take an
  existing application and create a Perl wrapper around it.</p>

  <p>This tutorial is divided into three sections. First, in "Take
  a Sip," I'll show you a simple use of SWIG: creating a Perl
  wrapper around a lone C function. Second, you'll see how to make
  C data structures available to Perl via what SWIG calls an
  interface file, in "Take Another Sip." Finally, in "Take a SWIG,"
  I'll take the source code for an entire utility and "port" it to
  Perl.</p>

  <p>Along the way, you'll see examples of how SWIG is invoked, how
  shared libraries are built, and how the resulting Perl modules
  are used. Finally, I'll demonstrate how to write a Perl script
  that does a great job of imitating top - a widely-used process
  monitor - because it uses the actual top source code.</p>

  <h3>Hooks by Hand</h3>

  <p>I first started using Perl and Tcl in the early 1990's when
  both were new. Perl was an immediate hit and I happily used
  <i>a2p</i> and <i>s2p</i> to convert all my <i>awk</i> and
  <i>sed</i> scripts to Perl. Then, looking at the generated Perl
  for clues, I converted my sh scripts too. Tcl, while not nearly
  as powerful as Perl, had the nifty feature of allowing
  user-defined C functions to be exported to the interpreter. While
  Perl would eventually do that as well, it was still years away.
  (I was using Perl 3, after all.)</p>

  <p>I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to simplify the
  writing of Tcl glue code. Eventually an entire library was
  developed that used a C template structure to convert a vector of
  Tcl string arguments into C data structures. This made it much
  easier to call C functions without an argc/argv style interface.
  Even so, the linkage between C and Tcl was still a hassle.</p>

  <p>Perl caught up with Tcl when XS was introduced. Not only could
  developers specify how to convert between the compiled and
  interpreted worlds, but the compiled code could be dynamically
  loaded via a shared library. On the surface, this seemed a
  wonderful solution.</p>

  <p>The problem with interface code is that, well, you have to
  write it. That might be acceptable if you're creating entirely
  new code to be made available via a Perl wrapper, but what about
  legacy code? Wouldn't you really rather develop new programs than
  spend your time creating wrappers around old code?</p>

  <h3>Take a Sip: Wrapping a C Function</h3>

  <p>Let's start out with a simple example. Many people who post to
  the Usenet newsgroup comp.lang.perl.misc ask how to determine the
  amount of time used by chunks of their Perl programs. The usual
  solution is to use one of the timing modules, such as
  Benchmark.pm. To demonstrate SWIG, we'll create and use a C
  function instead.</p>

  <p>At the top of the next page you'll see elapsed.c, containing
  nothing but the <tt>elapsed_seconds()</tt> function.</p>

  <p>Because <a href="tpj0204-0008a.html"><i>elapsed.c</i></a>: a C
  Function to be Wrappered by SWIG is so simple we can feed it
  directly to SWIG:</p>
  <pre>
<b>% swig -perl5 -shadow -module Elapsed elapsed.c</b>
Generating wrappers for Perl 5
</pre>

  <p>This generates three files: the Perl modules in Elapsed.pm, XS
  wrapper code in <i>elapsed_wrap.c</i>, and documentation in
  <i>elapsed_wrap.doc</i>.</p>

  <p>I won't discuss <i>elapsed_wrap.doc</i>. It's enough to say
  that SWIG's surprisingly rich documentation generation can create
  plain ASCII, HTML, or LaTeX. There are options to locate,
  extract, and format comments from the source code. As with most
  configuration preferences, the options can be selected either by
  the SWIG command line or via directives embedded in the source
  code.</p>

  <p>SWIG isn't a full C/C++ parser; some snippets of code will
  give it fits. So instead of throwing full-fledged C programs at
  it, it's more common to process merely a .h (header) file. If
  you're going to be intermixing C/C++ source code with SWIG
  directives, then an interface file (ending in .i by convention)
  would be a better choice. SWIG defines the <tt>SWIG</tt>
  preprocessor token, so you can make a portion of the C source
  code visible only to SWIG by enclosing it between <tt>#ifdef
  SWIG</tt> and <tt>#endif</tt> lines, or render it invisible to
  SWIG with <tt>#ifndef SWIG</tt> and <tt>#endif</tt>.</p>

  <p>In addition to providing the name of the source module, we
  need to tell SWIG a few other things. In the command line of
  <i>elapsed.c</i> we set the output language to Perl, request
  shadow classes (more on those later), and set the module name to
  <i>Elapsed</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Elapsed.pm</i> and <i>elapsed_wrap.c</i> files
  generated by SWIG constitute a full-fledged Perl extension. They
  verify function arguments, translate them into C data structures,
  invoke the functions, and translate return values into a form
  palatable by Perl. It handles not only functions, but global
  variables and read-only constants as well. The wrapper, along
  with the original source file, is compiled and turned into a
  shared library.</p>

  <p>One of the obstacles to using SWIG (and nearly everything
  else) on different platforms is the variety of ways to create
  shared libraries. Here's the particular incantation for
  FreeBSD:</p>
  <pre>
<b>% gcc -DPIC -fpic -I/opt/perl5.004/lib/ \
i386-freebsd/5.00403/CORE -c elapsed_wrap.c 
% gcc -DPIC -fpic -Wall -c elapsed.c 
% ld -Bshareable  -L/usr/local/lib -o \
Elapsed.so elapsed_wrap.o elapsed.o </b>
</pre>

  <p>You'll need to figure out what commands and options your
  platform requires. This information should be available from your
  Perl configuration; here's an ugly but effective <i>make</i> rule
  that appends the pertinent variables to the Makefile. Whenever I
  move to a new platform, <tt>make localvars</tt> deletes the old
  variables and adds the new ones. It's not pretty, but it
  works.</p>
  <pre>
 localvars:
 perl -MConfig -e '                                         \
 printf("LD = %s %s\n", $$Config{ld}, $$Config{lddlflags}); \
 printf("CC = %s %s\n", $$Config{cc}, $$Config{cccdlflags});\
 printf("PERLINC =-I%s/CORE\n", $$INC[0]);'                 \
 &gt;&gt; Makefile
</pre>

  <p>Our test of <tt>elapsed_seconds()</tt> is encapsulated in a
  Perl program called <a href=
  "tpj0204-0008b.html"><i>elapsed</i></a>. This program computes
  the Fibonacci sequence and the ratio between successive numbers
  in the sequence, which converges to the Golden Mean. We'll use
  <tt>elapsed_seconds()</tt> to time our program. (Remember, this
  is only so that we can demonstrate SWIG; to time Perl code you
  can always just use Perl's own Benchmark module, bundled with the
  standard distribution.)</p>

  <h3>Take another Sip: Interface Files</h3>

  <p>Now we'll provide SWIG with an interface file, which lets us
  use SWIG pragmas. We'll skip over compilation and linking, and
  look at a few complex data structures instead.</p>

  <p>In <i>gettime.i</i>, shown below, we set the module name, make
  the global variable <tt>errno</tt> read-only, and ask for default
  structure constructors. We also define two time structures and
  provide the prototypes for <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> and
  <tt>settimeofday()</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
%module Gettime;    // Alternative to command line
                    // arguments (for naming) 
%readonly           // Make all variables read only. 
int errno; 
%readwrite          // Restore default behavior. 
%pragma make_default;  // Generate default constructors. 
struct timeval { 
        long    tv_sec;          // seconds 
        long    tv_usec;         // and microseconds 
}; 
struct timezone { 
     int  tz_minuteswest;  // minutes west of Greenwich
     int  tz_dsttime;      // type of dst correction
}; 
int gettimeofday(struct timeval * tp, 
                 struct timezone * tzp); 
int settimeofday(const struct timeval * tp, 
                 const struct timezone * tzp); 
</pre>

  <p>We can now build the module much as before. Now we don't need
  the <tt>-module</tt> option since the name of the module is set
  in the interface file with the statement <tt>%module
  Gettime</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
<b>% swig -perl5 -shadow gettime.i</b> 
Generating wrappers for Perl 5 
<b>% gcc -DPIC -fpic -I/opt/perl5.004/lib/ \
i386-freebsd/5.00403/CORE -c gettime_wrap.c 
% ld -Bshareable  -L/usr/local/lib -o   \
                   Gettime.so gettime_wrap.o</b> 
</pre>

  <p>Now using <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> is easy:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
<b>use Gettime;</b>
my $tv  = <b>new timeval()</b>; # Allocate a timeval structure
# Below, undef maps to a null pointer
<b>Gettime::gettimeofday($tv, undef)</b> 
 &amp;&amp; warn("gettimeofday() failed, errno = $Gettime::errno.\n");
# The shadow option is what allows these symbolic references
# to structure fields.
printf("Time is %d.%06d\n",
       $tv-&gt;{tv_sec}, 
       $tv-&gt;{tv_usec});
</pre>

  <p>The script's output:</p>
  <pre>
Time is 877438914.248738
</pre>

  <p>Let's look at a program that doesn't work. This script tries
  to set the time, but fails because it wasn't run by the
  superuser. Then it fails again because <tt>$errno</tt> is
  read-only.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
<b>use Gettime;</b>
my $tv  = <b>new timeval()</b>;  # Allocate timeval structure.
$tv-&gt;{tv_sec} = $tv-&gt;{tv_usec} = 0; # Turn back the clock.
# This if statement will fail unless you're root
if <b>(Gettime::settimeofday($tv, undef)</b>) {
       warn("settimeofday() failed, errno =$Gettime::errno.\n");
       # This fails since it's read-only
	   <b>$Gettime::errno = 0;</b>
}
</pre>

  <p>The output:</p>
  <pre>
 
settimeofday() failed, errno = 1.
Value is read-only. at ./Gettime-test.pl line 9.
</pre>

  <h3>A Top Notch Utility</h3>

  <p>The remainder of this article shows how the power of
  <i>top</i> can be made available to Perl. The <i>top</i> utility,
  developed by William LeFebvre and a cast of dozens for more than
  a decade, is a great system utility similar to <i>ps</i>: It
  displays a system summary followed by a listing of processes.
  Unlike <i>ps</i>, the display is updated at regular intervals.
  There are various other nifty features, but the kicker is that
  top is portable. Source code is available from <a href=
  "ftp://ftp.groupsys.com/pub/top" target=
  "resource window">ftp://ftp.groupsys.com/pub/top</a>.</p>

  <p>Before we get started I'll point out three reasons why I
  choose <i>top</i>. First, since I didn't write it, it serves as a
  good test of adapting legacy code to a new environment. Second,
  <i>top</i> was written with portability in mind, and that makes
  our job easier. Version 3.4 runs on over two dozen Unix variants
  - pretty unusual for a program so sensitive to internal kernel
  structures. <i>top</i>'s portability makes it an ideal candidate
  for SWIG. Finally, I've always wanted to have access to top's
  information in my system monitoring scripts without having to
  decode the internal structures of yet another operating
  system.</p>

  <p>One of <i>top</i>'s header files, <a href=
  "tpj0204-0008d.html"><i>machine.h</i></a>, contains three
  structure definitions and a few function prototypes. That's it.
  The operating system-specific code for each port need only
  populate an array of those structures. Those three structures and
  a few functions are all SWIG needs to know about.</p>

  <p>My interface file, <a href=
  "tpj0204-0008e.html"><i>top.i</i></a>, has two sections. The
  first section, delimited by <tt>%</tt>{ and <tt>%</tt>}, is
  literal source code that will be needed by the Perl extension
  generated by SWIG. This section is opaque to SWIG and can be as
  complex as necessary. The code after the %} is almost straight C
  too; in fact, if the special <tt>%include</tt> statements weren't
  necessary, the entire interface file could be nothing but C
  code.</p>

  <p><b>From %{ to %}.</b> This section contains three functions to
  be included in the Perl extension. The <tt>printable()</tt>
  function mimics a function in the top source code. The original
  is in a file that, if compiled and linked, introduces many more
  platform dependencies. So to keep the number of dependencies to a
  minimum, I just duplicated what I needed.</p>

  <p>The two functions after <tt>printable()</tt>,
  <tt>full_format_header()</tt> and
  <tt>full_format_next_process()</tt>, are only needed in the
  interface file for their complete prototype definitions. As you
  can tell, the original prototypes in <i>machine.h</i> lack
  arguments, so we have to provide them here. (As LeFebvre points
  out, this code predates ANSI C and is due for an overhaul.)</p>

  <p>Complete prototypes are required, and for a good reason. SWIG
  isn't as permissive as Perl. It doesn't have Perl's anything-goes
  attitude, and in fact performs extensive type checking of
  function arguments. This should be reassuring to people leery of
  integrating a low-level application into a typeless language.</p>

  <p><b>After the %{... %} block.</b> The next lines in top.i are a
  few <tt>%include</tt> statements. The first two import a couple
  of SWIG's built-in interface files: <i>pointer.i</i> and
  <i>typemaps.i</i>. SWIG supports basic data types, but more
  sophisticated structures (structures, arrays, complex pointers,
  and the like) require additional help. These built-in interface
  files handle common C constructs, such as a null terminated array
  of strings represented as a <tt>char **</tt>.</p>

  <p>The next two include statements pull in two <i>top</i> header
  files: <i>top.h</i> and <i>machine.h</i>. The first contains some
  constants, and the second, as you've already seen, contains the
  portable structures used by <i>top</i>.</p>

  <p>Finally, the five <tt>extern</tt>s at the bottom of
  <i>top.i</i> are function prototypes. The first two should look
  familiar; they need to be included so SWIG will know to generate
  wrappers. (Remember, the earlier code block was opaque to SWIG.)
  The last three statements are prototypes for the <i>top</i>
  functions we'll be calling from our Perl program.</p>

  <p>If this interface file seems overly complex, it's due to my
  desire to leave the legacy <i>top</i> sources untouched. Were
  this new code, the interface file might have been just a few
  include statements - or the <i>.h</i> files might even have been
  used directly.</p>

  <p>You can have SWIG process the interface file as follows
  (assuming you're in the same directory as the code). The only new
  option, <tt>-Itop-3.4</tt>, indicates where to look for include
  files. The other options should all look familiar:</p>
  <pre>
<b>% swig -Itop-3.4 -perl5 -shadow -module Top top.i</b>
</pre>

  <p>SWIG then creates three files: <i>top_wrap.c</i>,
  <i>Top.pm</i>, and <i>top_wrap.doc</i>. The wrapper source file
  contains all the Perl to C interfaces - well over 2000 lines of
  code that you, thankfully, don't have to write. This may seem
  like a lot; it's because of SWIG's type checking and its tests
  for end cases. You might be able to do as good a job by hand, but
  I doubt it.</p>

  <p><i>Top.pm</i> is the Perl module proper. It uses Perl's
  built-in DynaLoader module to load the <i>top</i> shared library
  dynamically (assuming your system supports shared libraries).
  This makes the functions and C constants in <i>top.h</i>
  available to the module.</p>

  <p>The final step is to compile the C code. <i>top_wrap.c</i> is
  compiled along with three files from the top sources. They're
  linked together into a shared library (<i>Top.so</i> on my
  system) and we're ready to go.</p>
  <pre>
<b>% swig -Itop-3.4 -perl5 -shadow -module Top top.i</b>
top-3.4/machine.h : Line 28. Warning. Array member will be
read-only. Generating wrappers for Perl 5
<b>% gcc -DPIC -fpic -Itop-3.4 -I/opt/perl5.004/lib/
                 \ i386-freebsd/5.00403/CORE -c top_wrap.c
% gcc -DPIC -fpic -Itop-3.4 -c top-3.4/machine.c
% gcc -DPIC -fpic -Itop-3.4 -c top-3.4/utils.c

% ld -Bshareable  -L/usr/local/lib -o Top.so \
             top_wrap.o machine.o utils.o username.o -lkvm</b>
</pre>

  <p>The warning from line 28 about the read-only array member
  (<tt>double load_avg[NUM_AVERAGES]</tt>) is telling - the
  distinction between an array and a pointer is subtle in C. To
  avoid such problems, SWIG treats references as read-only by
  default. You can usually create unambiguous types with
  <tt>typedef</tt> if you need to.</p>

  <p>The last line above uses <i>ld</i> to link the four .o files
  with the KVM library. KVM is the kernel memory interface for
  FreeBSD; it will be loaded along with the <i>top</i> library at
  the first call to the top module. Since the module opens
  sensitive kernel structures, you'll most likely need to run it as
  the superuser.)</p>

  <h3>Take a Swig: The top Emulator</h3>

  <p>A Perl program that emulates <i>top</i> is <a href=
  "tpj0204-0008g.html">A SWIG-enabled Top Emulator</a>. There are a
  few new aspects to it, notably the <tt>ptrvalue</tt> calls, but
  most of the program is straightforward.</p>

  <p>If you look back at <i>machine.h</i> you'll see that the
  <tt>statics</tt> structure has pointers to character arrays.
  Normally, the potential ambiguity of pointers to pointers would
  cause SWIG to punt unless it had explicit directions for what to
  do. However, the array-of-strings construct is so common that
  SWIG provides support via the pointer.i interface file.</p>

  <p>The <tt>names()</tt> subroutine steps through the char **
  array, pulling off the strings one by one until NULL is reached.
  <tt>ptrvalue()</tt> is a standard SWIG function that requiring an
  array reference and an index; it returns the element at that
  index. The assembled array is then returned by <tt>names()</tt>.
  The <tt>memfix()</tt> routine is more mundane. It just converts a
  number from kilobytes to megabytes.</p>

  <p>The initialization section of the script creates three
  structures (<tt>$statics</tt>, <tt>$si</tt>, and <tt>$ps</tt>)
  via calls to <tt>new()</tt>. SWIG's <tt>%make_default pragma</tt>
  (back in <i>top.i</i>) automatically allocated the structures and
  created the <tt>new()</tt> methods for you.</p>

  <p>The <tt>ps</tt> structure is initialized by hand so that its
  values make sense the first time they are used, and the
  <tt>Top::machine_init()</tt> method populates the
  <tt>statics</tt> structure. The three calls to <tt>names()</tt>
  extract the respective names into arrays.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the script is just a loop that repeats sixty
  times. On each iteration, the script pauses, gathers current
  statistics, and prints a <i>top</i>-style report. The only
  feature missing is the sorting of processes according to their
  CPU usage.</p>

  <p>This script is simple minded; it merely emulates <i>top</i>
  rather than extends it. Still, it runs equally well on all
  <i>top</i>-ready operating systems. More sophisticated scripts
  might extend <i>top</i> in different ways: data trending, event
  triggers, real time plots of system data, and so on.</p>

  <h3>A Toast</h3>

  <p>SWIG's 300 page user manual goes into great detail about
  features not covered in this article: pointers, input
  constraints, typemaps for complex data types, exception handling,
  and further customization. It also covers C++ and Objective
  C.</p>

  <p>Other common uses of SWIG include rapid prototyping,
  interactive debugging, script-based testing of systems, and
  optimizing existing scripts by implementing slow portions in C or
  C++. SWIG makes it simple to embed C and C++ code in your
  favorite interpreter. In addition to Perl, SWIG can just as
  easily generate interface code for Tcl, Guile, and Python. Best
  of all, SWIG is portable and free. A toast is in order.</p>
