  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  <b>Perl 5.005</b> is on the horizon. It will have in-core support
  for Win32 and probably MacPerl as well, in an attempt to have the
  same exact version running on different platforms. Support for
  threads will be available. I'm guessing that Perl 5.005 will be
  released in late 1998.

  <p>The <b>1998 O'Reilly Perl Conference</b> will take place
  August 17 through 20 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose,
  California. Details will be available on <a href=
  "http://www.oreilly.com" target="_blank">www.oreilly.com</a> in
  the coming months.</p>

  <p>The first Perl User's Group has formed: the <b>New York Perl
  Mongers</b>, dedicated to Perl advocacy, education, and training
  as well as building the social community of Perl users. For
  details, visit <a href="http://ny.pm.org/" target=
  "_blank">http://ny.pm.org/</a>.</p>

  <p>Tom Spindler ported Perl to <b>BeOS</b>; see CPAN/ports/beos
  for a specially-tailored distribution of Perl 5.004.</p>

  <p>There are newly-updated ports of Perl 5.004 for <b>DOS</b> in
  CPAN/ports/msdos. You have three choices: Laszlo Molnar's
  DJGPP-based binary distribution (<i>dos-djgpp.zip</i>), Ilya
  Zakharevich's OS/2 port (which works on DOS), or the
  all-inclusive <i>dosperl.zip</i>, by an anonymous author who
  isn't very good at Robotron.</p>

  <p>The <b>Perl/Tk Reference Guide</b>, by TPJ's own Steve Lidie,
  describes almost every Perl/Tk widget, command, and variable.
  It's available on the CPAN in CPAN/authors/id/LUSOL. Dominique
  Dumont released the <b>Tk::Multi module</b>, which manages
  multiple Tk text widgets, and <b>Tk::ObjScanner</b>, which
  displays object attributes. Graham Barr uploaded the Tk-GBARR
  bundle, which includes <b>Tk::Cloth</b> (an object-oriented
  interface to <b>Tk::Canvas</b>), <b>Tk::Pane</b> (a widget
  panner), <b>Tk::TFrame</b> (frames with titles),
  <b>Tk::ProgressBar</b> (a widget that shows completion status),
  and <b>Tk::NumEntry</b> (an entry widget that accepts numbers
  with increment/decrement buttons).</p>

  <p>Logos Research Systems offers a free GUI debugger for Win32
  Perl at <a href="http://www.logos.com/perl" target=
  "_blank">http://www.logos.com/perl</a>.</p>

  <p>An archive of the <b>perl5-porters mailing list</b> can be
  found at
  http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl-porters,
  courtesy of Achim Bohnet.</p>

  <p>The <b>Velocity Engine</b> for Perl, by Binary Evolution,
  embeds a persistent Perl in the Netscape and Microsoft web
  servers. It lets you use <tt>&lt;perl&gt;</tt> tags to include
  executable code in HTML, and has hooks for database access with
  DBI and on-the-fly GIF generation with GD. See
  http://www.binevolve.com for details. Benjamin Sugars is
  developing a module, <b>Netscape::Server</b>, that embeds a Perl
  interpreter in a Netscape web server so that you can program to
  the Netscape API.</p>

  <p>ActiveState announced <b>PerlEX</b>, a set of server-side
  plugins for ISAPI, NSAPI, and WSAPI that enables Windows NT web
  servers from Microsoft, Netscape, and O'Reilly to execute Perl
  scripts much faster. Scripts are precompiled, just like mod_perl.
  It's available from http://www.ActiveState.com.</p>

  <p>TipTop Software's <b>WOPerl</b> lets you manipulate NeXT's
  WebObjects with Perl. It's based on Objective Perl, which is a
  version of Perl with Objective C's object model. You can download
  it from http://www.tiptop.com/WOPerl/.</p>

  <p>Jason Costomiris' <b>CGI::MozSniff</b> module parses the
  <tt>$ENV{HTTP_USER_AGENT}</tt> variable to report which browser
  is really hitting your pages, since they all seem to say
  "Mozilla" these days.</p>

  <p>Brian Foy's <b>Chemistry::Elements</b> module lets you treat
  chemical elements as objects, providing access to names, symbols,
  and proton numbers.</p>

  <p>John Nolan created <b>Chatbot::Eliza</b>, encapsulating the
  good old Eliza algorithm (an early-AI very bad psychiatrist) in a
  Perl object. "Why do you say that you hack Perl?"</p>

  <p>Norm Walsh's <b>Text::DelimMatch</b> lets you find strings
  bounded by delimiters of your choosing. You can use it to match
  nested text, too.</p>

  <p><b>MailMan</b> is a web/mail gateway by Ryan Alyn Porter. It
  can send and receive mail via any POP3 mailbox and SMTP server,
  and is available from <a href=
  "http://www.endymion.com/portfolio/software/scripts/mailman.htm"
  target=
  "_blank">http://www.endymion.com/portfolio/software/scripts/mailman.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>Version 3.04 of Mike Heins' <b>MiniVend</b> web shopping cart
  program (with SQL support) is available at
  CPAN/authors/id/MIKEH.</p>

  <p>Dan Sugalski's <b>VMS::System</b> and <b>VMS::Process</b>
  modules provide information about processes on the VMS operating
  system.</p>

  <p>Version 2.1 of the <b>Statistics::Descriptive</b> module has
  been released by Colin Kuskie. It now has separate
  implementations for sparse and full data sets.</p>

  <p>A new version of the <b>Ingres</b> DBD module has been
  uploaded by Henrik Tougaard.</p>

  <p>Honza Pazdziora released version 0.03 of the <b>XBase</b> DBD,
  which lets you read and write <i>.dbf</i> and <i>.dbt</i>
  files.</p>

  <p>Joshua Pritikin has developed <b>Envy</b>, a shell-independent
  solution for environment-variable management. Joshua also
  released <b>LinkTree</b>, which creates trees of symbolic links
  (sometimes known as shadow directories). He also uploaded
  <b>HTML::PHTML</b>, a "Perl Embedded HTML" page cache, useful if
  you're already using FastCGI or mod_perl. His <b>Maker</b>
  module, available as CPAN/modules/authors/id/JPRIT/Maker, is a
  replacement for Make, which means it has to compete with Nick
  Ing-Simmons <b>Make</b> module and Bob Sidebotham's Cons, in
  CPAN/modules/authors/id/BOBSIDE.</p>

  <p>The <b>OLE::Storage</b> module, by Martin Schwartz, lets you
  access the binary data format of Microsoft's OLE documents from
  the operating system of your choice.</p>

  <p><b>Convert::Translit</b>, by Genji Schmeder, transliterates
  strings between any of the 8-bit character sets defined in RFC
  1345. Meanwhile, Gisle Aas released <b>Convert::Recode</b>, a
  front end to the GNU recode program, which builds <tt>tr///</tt>
  expressions to perform the conversions. It converts EBCDIC to
  ASCII, as does Chris Leach's <b>Convert::EBCDIC</b>.</p>

  <p>The <b>Devel::DebugInit</b> module, by Jason E. Stewart,
  provides an automated way to create debugger initialization files
  for GDB, the Gnu Debugger. You'll need the <b>C::Scan</b> and
  <b>Data::Flow</b> modules.</p>

  <p>The <b>X11::Wcl</b> module, by Joseph Buehler, provides an
  interface to the Widget Creation Library for the X Window System,
  allowing rapid prototyping of GUI interfaces.</p>

  <p>Mark Kvale released <b>specPerl</b> 1.0, a GUI builder that
  outputs Perl/Tk code. It requires specTcl; both can be downloaded
  from <a href="http://www.keck.ucsf.edu/~kvale/specperl.html"
  target=
  "_blank">http://www.keck.ucsf.edu/~kvale/specperl.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Many people don't realize that when you glob() a file pattern
  in Perl (say, to find out which files match read*.txt in a
  particular directory) a shell process is often launched. Marc
  Mengel's FastGlob module, available from CPAN/authors/id/MENGEL,
  provides a glob that never requires a shell.</p>

  <p>Randy Ray released <b>Devel::Coverage</b>, which shows you
  what parts of your code were and weren't reached. That's not the
  same as profiling your code; if that's what you want to do, use
  Dean Roehrich's <b>Devel::DProf</b> module or Ted Ashton's
  <b>Devel::SmallProf</b>.</p>

  <p>New modules should be cleared with the modules@perl.org
  mailing list before uploading to the CPAN. We don't review the
  code so much as ensure that new modules have appropriate
  names.</p>
