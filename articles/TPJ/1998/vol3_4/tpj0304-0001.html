  <p>In the Beginning, some time around 1960, every part of your
  program had access to all the variables in every other part of
  the program. This caused a lot of bugs when people forgot where
  their variables were used, so language designers invented local
  variables, which were visible in only a small part of the
  program. That way, programmers who used a variable <tt>x</tt>
  could be sure that that nobody was able to tamper with the
  contents of x behind their back. They could also be sure that by
  using x they weren't tampering with someone else's variable by
  mistake.</p>

  <p>Every programming language has a philosophy, and these days
  most of these philosophies have to do with the way the names of
  variables are managed. Details of which variables are visible to
  which parts of the program, and what names mean what, and when,
  are of prime importance. The details vary from somewhat baroque,
  in languages like Lisp, to extremely baroque, in languages like
  C++. Perl unfortunately is on the rococo end of this scale.</p>

  <p>The problem with Perl isn't that it has no clearly-defined
  system of name management, but rather that it two systems, both
  working at once. Here's the Big Secret about Perl variables that
  most people learn too late: Perl has <i>two</i> completely
  separate, independent sets of variables. One is left over from
  Perl 4, the way your vermiform appendix and midbrain are left
  over from a previous geologic era, and the other set is new. The
  two sets of variables are called 'package variables' and 'lexical
  variables', and they have nothing to do with each other.</p>

  <p>Package variables came first, so we'll talk about them first.
  Then we'll see some problems with package variables, and how
  lexical variables were introduced in Perl 5 to avoid these
  problems. Finally, we'll see how to get Perl to automatically
  diagnose places where you might not be getting the variable you
  meant. That often detects mistakes before they turn into
  bugs.</p>

  <h3>PACKAGE VARIABLES</h3>
  <pre>
$x = 1
</pre>

  <p>Here, <tt>$x</tt> is a package variable. There are two
  important things to know about package variables:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Package variables are what you get if you don't say
    otherwise.</li>

    <li>Package variables are <i>always</i> global.</li>
  </ol>'Global' means that package variables are always visible
  everywhere in every program. After you do <tt>$x = 1</tt>, any
  other part of the program, even another subroutine defined in
  another file, can inspect and modify the value of $x. There's no
  exception to this; package variables are always global. Don't say
  'But...'; there are no buts.

  <p>Package variables are divided into families, called packages.
  Every package variable has a name with two parts. The two parts
  are like the variable's given name and family name. You can call
  the Vice-President of the United States 'Al', if you want, but
  that's really short for his full name, which is 'Al Gore'.
  Similarly, <tt>$x</tt> has a full name, which is something like
  <tt>$main::x</tt>. The main part is the package qualifier,
  analogous to the 'Gore' part of 'Al Gore'. Al Gore and Al Capone
  are different people even though they're both named 'Al'. In the
  same way, <tt>$Gore::Al</tt> and <tt>$Capone::Al</tt> are
  different variables, and <tt>$main::x</tt> and <tt>DBI::x</tt>
  are different variables.</p>

  <p>You're always allowed to include the package part of the
  variable's name, and if you do, Perl will know exactly which
  variable you mean. But for brevity, you usually like to leave the
  package qualifier off. What happens if you do?</p>

  <h3>THE CURRENT PACKAGE</h3>

  <p>If you just say <tt>$x</tt>, Perl assumes that you mean the
  variable <tt>$x</tt> in the current package. What's the current
  package? It's normally main, but you can change the current
  package by writing</p>
  <pre>
package Mypackage;
</pre>

  <p>in your program; from that point on, the current package is
  <tt>Mypackage</tt>. The only thing the current package does is
  affect the interpretation of package variables that you wrote
  without package names. If the current package is
  <tt>Mypackage</tt>, then <tt>$x</tt> really means
  <tt>$Mypackage::x</tt>. If the current package is main, then
  <tt>$x</tt> really means <tt>$main::x</tt>.</p>

  <p>If you were writing a module, let's say the <tt>MyModule</tt>
  module,you would probably put a line like this at the top of
  <tt>MyModule.pm:</tt></p>
  <pre>
package MyModule;
</pre>

  <p>Thereafter, all the package variables you used in the module
  file would be in package <tt>MyModule</tt>, and you could be
  pretty sure that those variables wouldn't conflict with the
  variables in the rest of the program. It wouldn't matter if both
  you and the author of DBI were to use a variable named $x,
  because one would be $MyModule::x and the other would be
  $DBI::x.</p>

  <p>Remember that package variables are always global. Even if
  you're not in package DBI, even if you've never heard of package
  DBI, nothing can stop you from reading from or writing to
  <tt>$DBI::errstr</tt>. You don't have to do anything special.
  <tt>$DBI::errstr</tt>, like all package variables, is a global
  variable, and it's available globally; all you have to do is
  mention its full name to get it. You could even say</p>
  <pre>
package DBI;
$errstr = 'Ha ha Tim!';
</pre>

  <p>in your own file, and that would modify
  <tt>$DBI::errstr</tt>.</p>

  <h3>PACKAGE VARIABLE TRIVIA</h3>

  <p>There are only three other things to know about package
  variables, and you might want to skip them on the first
  reading:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The package with the empty name is the same as main. So
    <tt>$::x</tt> is the same as <tt>$main::x</tt> for any
    <tt>x</tt>.</li>

    <li>Some variables are always forced to be in package main. For
    example, if you mention <tt>%ENV</tt>, Perl assumes that you
    mean <tt>%main::ENV</tt>, even if the current package isn't
    main. If you want <tt>%Fred::ENV</tt>, you have to say so
    explicitly, even if the current package is Fred. Other names
    that are special this way include INC, all the one-punctuation
    character names like <tt>$_</tt> and <tt>$$</tt>,
    <tt>@ARGV</tt>, and <tt>STDIN</tt>, <tt>STDOUT</tt>, and
    <tt>STDERR</tt>.</li>

    <li>Package names, but not variable names, can contain ::. You
    can have a variable named <tt>$DBD::Oracle::x</tt>. This means
    the variable <tt>x</tt> in the package <tt>DBD::Oracle</tt>; it
    has nothing at all to do with the package DBD, which is
    unrelated. Isaac Newton is not related to Olivia Newton-John,
    and <tt>$Newton::Isaac</tt> is not related to
    <tt>$Newton::John::Olivia</tt>. Even though they both begin
    with Newton, the appearance is deceptive.
    <tt>$Newton::John::Olivia</tt> is in package
    <tt>Newton::John</tt>, not package Newton. The slogan is
    "Packages do not nest."</li>
  </ol>

  <p>That's all there is to know about package variables.</p>

  <p>Package variables are global, which is dangerous, because you
  can never be sure that another part of your program isn't
  tampering with them behind your back. Up through Perl 4, all
  variables were package variables, which was worrisome. So Perl 5
  added new variables that aren't global.</p>

  <h3>LEXICAL VARIABLES</h3>

  <p>Perl's other set of variables are called 'lexical variables'
  (we'll ee why later) or 'private variables' because they're
  private. They're also sometimes called 'my variables' because
  they're always declared with my. It's tempting to call them
  'local variables', because their effect is confined to a small
  part of the program, but don't do that, because people might
  think you're talking about Perl's <tt>local</tt> operator, which
  we'll see later. When you want a local variable, think my, not
  <tt>local</tt>.</p>

  <p>The declaration</p>
  <pre>
my $x;
</pre>

  <p>creates a new variable, named <tt>x</tt>, which is totally
  inaccessible to most parts of the program - the whole program,
  except for the block in which the variable was declared. This
  block is called the <i>scope</i> of the variable. If the variable
  wasn't declared in any block, its scope is the entire file,
  beginning at the place it was declared. You can also declare and
  initialize a my variable by writing something like this:</p>
  <pre>
my $x = 119;
</pre>

  <p>You can even declare and initialize several at once:</p>
  <pre>
my ($x, $y, $z, @args) = (5, 23, @_);
</pre>

  <p>Let's see an example of where some private variables will be
  useful. Consider this subroutine:</p>
  <pre>
sub print_report {
    @employee_list = @_;
    foreach $employee (@employee_list) {
       $salary = lookup_salary($employee);
       print_partial_report($employee, $salary);
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>If <tt>lookup_salary()</tt> happens to also use a variable
  named <tt>$employee</tt>, that's going to be the same variable as
  the one used in <tt>print_report()</tt>, and the works might get
  gummed up. The two programmers responsible for
  <tt>print_report()</tt> and <tt>lookup_salary()</tt> will have to
  coordinate to make sure they don't use the same variables. That's
  a pain. In fact, in even a medium-sized project, it's an
  intolerable pain.</p>

  <p>The solution: Use my variables:</p>
  <pre>
sub print_report {
    my my @employee_list = @_;
    foreach my $employee (@employee_list) {
        my $salary = lookup_salary($employee);
        print_partial_report($employee, $salary);
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>my <tt>@employee_list</tt> creates a new array variable which
  is totally inaccessible outside the <tt>print_report()</tt>
  function. foreach my $employee creates a new scalar variable
  which is totally inaccessible outside the foreach loop, as does
  my <tt>$salary</tt>. You don't have to worry that the other
  functions in the program are tampering with these variables,
  because they can't; they don't know where to find them, because
  the names have different meanings outside the scope of the my
  declarations.</p>

  <p>These <tt>my</tt> variables are sometimes called 'lexical'
  because their scope depends only on the program text itself, and
  not on details of execution, such as what gets executed in what
  order. You can determine the scope by inspecting the source code
  without knowing what it does. Whenever you see a variable, look
  for a my declaration higher up in the same block. If you find
  one, you can be sure that the variable is inaccessible outside
  that block. If you don't find a declaration in the smallest
  block, look at the next larger block that contains it, and so on,
  until you do find one. If there is no my declaration anywhere,
  it's a package variable. my variables are not package variables.
  They're not part of a package, and they don't have package
  qualifiers. The current package has no effect on the way they're
  interpreted. Here's an example:</p>
  <pre>
my $x = 17;

package A;
$x = 12;

package B;
$x = 20;

# $x is now 20.
# $A::x and $B::x remain undefined
</pre>

  <p>The declaration my <tt>$x = 17</tt> at the top creates a new
  lexical variable named x whose scope continues to the end of the
  file. This new meaning of <tt>$x</tt> overrides the default
  meaning, which was that <tt>$x</tt> meant the package variable $x
  in the current package.</p>

  <p><tt>package A</tt> changes the current package, but because
  <tt>$x</tt> refers to the lexical variable, not to the package
  variable, <tt>$x=12</tt> has no effect on <tt>$A::x</tt>.
  Similarly, after <tt>package B</tt>, <tt>$x=20</tt> modifies the
  lexical variable, and not any of the package variables.</p>

  <p>At the end of the file, the lexical variable <tt>$x</tt> holds
  20, and the package variables <tt>$main::x</tt>, <tt>$A::x</tt>,
  and <tt>$B::x</tt> are still undefined. If you had wanted them,
  you could still have accessed them explicitly by using their full
  names.</p>

  <p>The maxim you must remember is:</p>

  <p><b>Package variables are global variables.<br>
  For private variables, you must use 'my'.</b></p>

  <h3>LOCAL AND MY</h3>

  <p>Almost everyone already knows that there's a local function
  and imagines that it has something to do with local variables.
  What is it, and how does it relate to my? The answer is simple,
  but bizarre:</p>

  <p><tt>my</tt> <b>creates a local variable.</b><br>
  <tt>local</tt> <b>doesn't</b>.</p>

  <p>First, here's what <tt>local $x</tt> really does: It saves the
  current value of the <i>package</i> variable <tt>$x</tt> in a
  safe place, and replaces it with a new value, or with undef if no
  new value was specified. It also arranges for the old value to be
  restored when control leaves the current block. The variables
  that it affects are package variables. But package variables are
  always global, and a <tt>local</tt> package variable is no
  exception. To see the difference, try this:</p>
  <pre>
$lo = 'global';
$m = 'global';
A();

sub A {
    local $lo = 'string';
    my $m = 'string';
    B();
}

sub B {
    print "B can",
      ($lo eq 'string' ? 'can' : 'cannot'),
      " see the value of lo set by A.\n";
    print "B can",
      ($m eq 'string' ? 'can' : 'cannot'),
      " see the value of m set by A.\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>This prints</p>
  <pre>
B can see the value of lo set by A.
B cannot see the value of m set by A.
</pre>

  <p>What happened here? The local declaration in <tt>A()</tt>
  saved a new temporary value, string, in the package variable
  <tt>$lo</tt>. The old value, global, will be restored when
  <tt>A()</tt> returns, but before that happens, <tt>A()</tt> calls
  <tt>B()</tt>. <tt>B()</tt> has no problem accessing the contents
  of <tt>$lo</tt>, because <tt>$lo</tt> is a package variable and
  package variables are always available everywhere, and so it can
  detect the local value, string, that was set in <tt>A()</tt>.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the my declaration created a new, lexically
  scoped variable named <tt>$m</tt>, which is only visible inside
  of function <tt>A()</tt>. Outside of <tt>A()</tt>, <tt>$m</tt>
  retains its old meaning:</p>

  <p>It refers to the package variable $m, still set to global.
  This is the variable that <tt>B()</tt> sees. It can't see the
  value string, because the variable with the value string is a
  lexical variable, and only exists inside <tt>A(</tt>).</p>

  <h3>WHAT GOOD IS LOCAL?</h3>

  <p>Because <tt>local</tt> does not actually create local
  variables, it is not of very much use. If, in the example above,
  <tt>B()</tt> happened to modify the value of <tt>$lo</tt>, then
  the value set by <tt>A()</tt> would be overwritten. That is
  exactly what we don't want to happen. We want each function to
  have its own variables that are untouchable by the others. This
  is what my does.</p>

  <p>Why have <tt>local</tt> at all? The answer is 90% history.
  Early versions of Perl only had global variables. local was very
  easy to implement, and was added to Perl 4 as a partial solution
  to the local variable problem. Later, in Perl 5, more work was
  done, and real local variables were put into the language. But
  the name 'local' was already taken, so the new feature was
  invoked with the word my. my was chosen because it suggests
  privacy, and also because it's very short; the shortness is
  supposed to encourage you to use it instead of <tt>local</tt>. my
  is also faster than <tt>local</tt>.</p>

  <h3>WHEN TO USE "MY' AND WHEN TO USE 'LOCAL'</h3>

  <p>Always use <tt>my</tt>; never use <tt>local</tt>.</p>

  <p>Wasn't that easy?</p>

  <h3>OTHER PROPERTIES OF 'MY' VARIABLES</h3>

  <p>Whenever Perl reaches a my declaration, it creates a new,
  fresh variable. For example, this code prints <tt>x=1</tt> fifty
  times:</p>
  <pre>
for (1 .. 50) {
    my $x;
    $x++;
    print "x=$x\n";
}
</pre>

  <p>You get a new <tt>$x</tt>, initialized to <tt>undef</tt>,
  every time through the loop.</p>

  <p>If the my were outside the loop, control would only pass it
  once, so there would only be one variable:</p>
  <pre>
  { my $x;
    for (1 .. 50) {
      $x++;
      print "x=$x\n";
  }
}
</pre>

  <p>This prints <tt>x=1, x=2, ..., x=50</tt>.</p>

  <p>You can use this to play a useful trick. Suppose you have a
  function that needs to remember a value from one call to the
  next. For example, consider a random number generator. A typical
  random number generator (like Perl's rand function) has a 'seed'
  in it. The seed is just a number. When you ask the random number
  generator for a random number, the function performs some
  arithmetic operation that scrambles the seed, and it returns the
  result. It also saves the result and uses it as the seed for the
  next call.</p>

  <p>Here's typical code: (I stole it from the ANSI C standard, but
  it behaves poorly, so don't use it for anything important.)</p>
  <pre>
$seed = 1;
sub my_rand {
    $seed = int(($seed * 1103515245 + 12345) / 65536) % 32768;
    return $seed;
}
</pre>

  <p>And typical output:</p>
  <pre>
16838
14666
10953
11665
7451
26316
27974
27550
</pre>

  <p>There's a problem here, which is that <tt>$seed</tt> is a
  global variable, and that means we have to worry that someone
  might inadvertently tamper with it. Or they might tamper with it
  on purpose, which could affect the rest of the program. What if
  the function were used in a gambling program, and someone
  tampered with the random number generator?</p>

  <p>But we can't declare <tt>$seed</tt> as a <tt>my</tt> variable
  in the function:</p>
  <pre>
sub my_rand {
    my $seed;
    $seed = int(($seed*1103515245 + 12345) / 65536) % 32768;
    return $seed;
}
</pre>

  <p>If we did, it would be initialized to undef every time we
  called <tt>my_rand()</tt>. We need it to retain its value between
  calls.</p>

  <p>Here's the solution:</p>
  <pre>
BEGIN {
    my $seed = 1;
    sub my_rand {
      $seed = int(($seed*1103515245 + 12345) / 65536) % 32768;
      return $seed;
    }
}
</pre>The declaration is outside the function, so it only happens
once, at the time the program is compiled, not every time the
function is called. But it's a <tt>my variable</tt>, and it's in a
block, so it's only accessible to code inside the block.
<tt>my_rand()</tt> is the only other thing in the block, so
<tt>$seed</tt> is only accessible to the <tt>my_rand()</tt>
function. We wrapped the whole thing in a <tt>BEGIN</tt> block to
make sure that <tt>$seed</tt> was properly initialized during
compilation.

  <p><tt>$seed</tt> here is sometimes called a 'static' variable,
  because it stays the same in between calls to the function. (And
  because there's a similar feature in the C language that is
  activated by the <tt>static</tt> keyword.)</p>

  <h3>MY VARIABLE TRIVIA</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>You can't declare a variable with my if its name is a
    punctuation character, like <tt>$_</tt>, <tt>@_</tt>, or
    <tt>$$</tt>. You can't declare the backreference variables
    <tt>$1</tt>, <tt>$2</tt>, ... as <tt>my</tt>. The authors of my
    thought that that would be too confusing.</li>

    <li>Obviously, you can't say my <tt>$DBI::errstr</tt>, because
    that's contradictory&ndash;it says that the package variable
    <tt>$DBI::errstr</tt> is now a lexical variable. But you can
    say local <tt>$DBI::errstr</tt>; it saves the current value of
    <tt>$DBI::errstr</tt> and arranges for it to be restored at the
    end of the block.</li>

    <li>New in Perl 5.004, you can write</li>
  </ol>
  <pre>
foreach my $i (@list) {
</pre>

  <p>instead, to confine <tt>$i</tt> to the scope of the loop
  instead.</p>

  <p>Similarly,</p>
  <pre>
for (my $i=0; $i&lt;100; $i++) {
</pre>

  <p>confines the scope of <tt>$i</tt> to the <tt>for</tt>
  loop.</p>

  <h3>DECLARATIONS</h3>

  <p>If you're writing a function, and you want it to have private
  variables, you need to declare the variables with my. What
  happens if you forget?</p>
  <pre>
sub function {
    $x = 42; # Oops, should have been 'my $x = 42'.
}
</pre>

  <p>In this case, your function modifies the global package
  variable <tt>$x</tt>. If you were using that variable for
  something else, it could be a disaster. Recent versions of Perl
  have an optional protection against this that you can enable if
  you want. If you put</p>
  <pre>
use strict 'vars';
</pre>

  <p>at the top of your program, Perl insists that all package
  variables have an explicit package qualifier. The <tt>$x</tt> in
  <tt>$x=42</tt> has no such qualifier, so the program won't even
  compile; instead, the compiler will abort and deliver this error
  message: <tt>Global symbol "$x" requires explicit package name at
  ...</tt> If you wanted <tt>$x</tt> to be a private variable, you
  could go back and add the <tt>my</tt>. If you really wanted to
  use the global package variable, you could go back and change it
  to <tt>$main::x = 42;</tt> or whatever is appropriate. Just
  saying <tt>use strict</tt> turns on <tt>strict vars</tt>, and
  severalother checks besides. See <tt>perldoc strict</tt> for more
  details.</p>

  <p>Now suppose you're writing the Algorithms::KnuthBendix module,
  and you want the protections of <tt>strict vars</tt>. But you're
  afraid that you won't be able to finish the module because your
  fingers are starting to fall off from typing
  <tt>$Algorithms::KnuthBendix::Error</tt> all the time.</p>

  <p>You can save your fingers and tell strict vars to allow that
  variable without the full package qualification:</p>
  <pre>
package Algorithms::KnuthBendix;
use vars '$Error';
</pre>

  <p>This exempts <tt>$Algorithms::KnuthBendix::Error</tt> from
  triggering a strict vars failure when you refer to it by its
  short name, <tt>$Error</tt>.</p>

  <p>You can also turn <tt>strict vars</tt> off for the scope of
  one block by writing</p>
  <pre>
{ no strict 'vars';
# strict vars is off for the rest of the block.
}
</pre>

  <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

  <p>Package variables are always global. They have a name and a
  package qualifier. You can omit the package qualifier, in which
  case Perl uses a default, and you can set that with the
  <tt>package</tt> declaration. For private variables, use
  <tt>my</tt>. Don't use <tt>local</tt>; it's obsolete.</p>

  <p>You should avoid using global variables because it can be hard
  to be sure that no two parts of the program are using one

  <p>To avoid using global variables by accident, add use
  <tt>strict 'vars'</tt> to your program. It checks to make sure

  <i>Mark-Jason Dominus lives in Philadelphia, where he has worked
  as a programmer and consultant long enough to habitually add or
  die; to the end of every statement. His new manual page,
  'perlreftut', will appear soon in an upcoming version of Perl if
  it hasn't already, and his article on 'Seven Useful Uses for
  local' will appear in this space in three months. Sometime in the
  next year he will probably write a book about something; watch
  this space for updates as they happen. He likes to get mail, so
  send him some at <b><a href=
