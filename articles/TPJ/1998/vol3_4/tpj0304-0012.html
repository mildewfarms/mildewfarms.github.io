  <h2 align="center">The 1998 Perl Quiz Show</h2>

  <h4>Jon Orwant</h4>

  <p>At the Second Perl Conference last August, I wrote and
  moderated the first-ever Perl Quiz Show. Four three-person teams
  competed for a variety of delicious prizes: Perl Resource Kits,
  TPJ subscriptions, TPJ Magnetic Perl kits, Perl Mongers T-Shirts,
  and O&rsquo;Reilly gift certificates.</p>

  <p>There were two semifinal rounds and one final round; each
  round pitted two teams against one another with fifteen toss-up
  questions. Toss-ups are questions answered by individuals; each
  correctly-answered toss-up earns ten points and the right for the
  entire team to collaborate on a bonus question worth up to thirty
  points.</p>

  <p>Here, then, are all of the toss-up and bonus questions I
  wrote, including several that weren&rsquo;t asked. If the
  toss-ups seem simple, bear in mind that merely knowing the answer
  isn&rsquo;t enough &ndash; you also have to answer it before the
  other team buzzes in.</p>

  <h3>Toss-up Questions</h3>

  <p><b>Toss-up 1</b>: In a regular expression, you can use curly
  braces to specify how many times you want to match something. For
  instance, <tt>x{5,10}</tt> matches at least five but no more than
  10 <tt>x</tt>&rsquo;s. What is the maximum number of occurrences
  you can match with this technique?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 2</b>: Guess that switch: Every once in a while,
  someone tells me they wish they could use <tt>#if</tt> and
  <tt>#ifdef</tt> statements in Perl. They can; all they need to do
  is use this flag.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 3</b>: Guess that variable: what scalar contains
  the name of the operating system you&rsquo;re on?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 4</b>: A tangent function, a floor function, a
  function to generate temporary filenames. These are all part of
  what module bundled with Perl, meant to provide a uniform way of
  calling functions independent of what operating system
  you&rsquo;re on?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 5</b>: Let&rsquo;s say you have a digital clock
  that displays twelve-hour time (that is, it displays AM and PM).
  Ignoring the colon, what&rsquo;s the smallest power of two that
  will appear on the display?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 6</b>: Continuing with the previous question,
  what&rsquo;s the largest power of two?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 7</b>: Spin The Black Circle, Who You Are, Jeremy,
  Evenflow. These are songs by a Seattle grunge rock band with a
  two-word name of particular relevance to this conference.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 8</b>: It&rsquo;s the only Perl program I know of
  that has been tattooed on a forearm. This cryptographic scheme
  was invented in 1977 by three MIT graduate students: Ron Rivest,
  Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 9</b>: If you have multiple _____________ in your
  Perl program, they&rsquo;ll be executed in reverse order: the
  last one will be executed first, and the first one last. This
  behavior is the opposite of the <tt>BEGIN</tt> block.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 10</b>: <tt>$_</tt> has two characters,
  <tt>@ARGV</tt> has five. This symbol is arguably the only
  single-character variable in Perl. It&rsquo;s a special
  filehandle used to speed up calls to stat, lstat, or any of the
  file tests.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 11</b>: The first day of the year is always a
  Monday, somewhere between December 29th and January 4th.
  That&rsquo;s according to the standard year of this organization
  responsible for POSIX.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 12</b>: The <tt>hex()</tt> function converts a
  hexadecimal number to decimal. What function would you use to
  convert back to hex?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 13</b>: Back Orifice &lsquo;98 allows you to
  remotely control the Windows 95 and 98 desktops. For ten points,
  name the group responsible.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 14</b>: A 233-MHz 750 PowerPC processor, a 4GB hard
  disk drive, 32MB of memory, built-in networking, an internal
  modem, a CD-ROM drive, and no floppy drive. What is this
  computer, released by Apple in August 1998?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 15</b>: A Frankenstein language created with pieces
  of JavaScript, cascading stylesheets, and HTML. That&rsquo;s how
  WIRED News describes this variant on HTML that lets you enhance
  HTML with animation.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 16</b>: "The Lurking Horror", "Planetfall",
  "Leather Goddesses of Phobos", and the classic "Zork" were all
  games produced by what company?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 17</b>: A pragma is like a module - you invoke it
  with use - but it affects how Perl interprets your program. Which
  pragma is most likely to speed up the typical Perl program?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 18</b>: Definitions of <tt>croak()</tt> and
  <tt>confess()</tt> are found in which module?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 19</b>: Sarah Ophelia Cannon&rsquo;s hat resides at
  the National Museum of History. The hat, with the price tag still
  attached, symbolizes Cannon&rsquo;s character at the Grand Ole
  Opry, a homophone with the little program that Perl uses to build
  itself.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 20</b>: If Perl 5 were designed from scratch, these
  two functions (which currently exist in both Perl 4 and Perl 5)
  probably wouldn&rsquo;t be there, because everything you can do
  with them you can now do with the <tt>tie()</tt> function. They
  let you store hashes on disk.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 21</b>: Give me the two common ways to access (but
  not modify) the last element of the array <tt>@bar</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 22</b>: What does this display?</p>

  <blockquote>
    <tt>print print print print print</tt>
  </blockquote>

  <p><b>Toss-up 23</b>: This selfish-sounding keyword didn&rsquo;t
  exist before Perl 5. It&rsquo;s a faster and safer way to declare
  variables than <tt>local()</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 24</b>: This word is the name for what a pearl is
  before it&rsquo;s big enough to be called a pearl, but is better
  known in biology as the protoplasmic center of a cell in control
  of growth and metabolism.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 25</b>: Someone comes up to you and says that use
  strict is broken, because they say <tt>$a = $[; use strict;</tt>
  and no error occurs; they were expecting to see <tt>Global symbol
  'a' requires explicit package name.</tt> What Perl function is
  responsible for this crime of omission?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 26</b>: There&rsquo;s no difference between the
  <tt>foreach</tt> and <tt>for</tt> operators, but those
  aren&rsquo;t the answers to this question. Two Perl operators
  that manipulate strings are 100% synonymous. What are they?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 27</b>: When I write a smiley face, it&rsquo;s a
  colon followed by a hyphen followed by a right parenthesis.
  Consider the three scalar variables <tt>$:</tt>, <tt>$-</tt> ,
  and <tt>$)</tt>. Which one will vary from user to user on the
  same system?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 28</b>: Gem, moo, six, miss. Which of these words
  couldn&rsquo;t you find immediately after the second slash of an
  <tt>m//</tt> pattern match?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 29</b>: <tt>$x</tt> is set to fuzz. What is
  <tt>$x++</tt>?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 30</b>: <tt>tr/a-z//;</tt> What does that do?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 31</b>: In a Perl regular expression, how do you
  create a grouping without creating a backreference?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 32</b>: What&rsquo;s the sum of the protocol
  numbers for SMTP, FTP, and telnet?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 33</b>: The 1997 Ig Nobel Prize for Communications
  went to this man, the president of Cyber Promotions and
  widely-acknowledged King of Spam.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 34</b>: "Join us now and share the software." This
  is the first line of a song by a MacArthur grant winner who hangs
  out at MIT, wrote Emacs, and founded the Free Software
  Foundation.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 35</b>: This built-in function constructs a linked
  list of every character in a string, and is sometimes invoked
  before expensive pattern matches. It&rsquo;s what good little
  boys and girls do after school.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 36</b>: What command-line switch checks the syntax
  of Perl programs?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 37</b>: "When you say it to your computer, the
  terminal may become slightly moist." This was said by Donald
  Knuth, describing what text formatting package of his own
  design?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 38</b>: He'll be twenty years old next year and
  underwent a five-hour operation on a brain tumor in 1991. The
  operation was successful, allowing him to enjoy his title as
  recipient of the world's most postcards - 33 million inall,
  thanks to a massive Internet campaign.</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 39</b>:<br></p>
  <pre>
hash_PeRlHaSh = hash_PeRlHaSh * ____ + *s_PeRlHaSh++;
</pre>This line of Perl code comes from the file <i>hv.h</i> in the
Perl distribution, and it&rsquo;s what Perl uses to convert the
keys of your hash into its internal representation. The number that
goes in the blank is a power of two plus one. It&rsquo;s two
digits, and both digits are the same. What is it?

  <p><b>Toss-up 40</b>: To help the Perl development team debug
  Perl, you decide you&rsquo;re going to write a program that
  generates and executes random Perl programs. You exclude
  functions like <tt>system()</tt> and <tt>unlink()</tt> and
  <tt>syscall()</tt> and <tt>open()</tt> and <tt>kill()</tt> that
  directly affect your operating system or any other processes
  running on your computer. You leave your program on all night,
  and in the morning you discover that many of your programs
  crashed. What four-letter function is the culprit?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 41</b>: What&rsquo;s the longest function name in
  Perl?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 42</b>: Initial etic inquiry typically yields
  particles whose wave or field relationships (i.e., situatedness)
  to other particles are undetected, indistinct, or ambiguous and
  which must be identified before progress can be made toward emic
  understanding. This description of something called "eticity" is
  a core definition of what field of compuational linguistics that
  influenced Larry&rsquo;s design of Perl?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 43</b>: "If there is a Perl 6, Perl 7 will be built
  out of sticks and stones." I made that up, but it&rsquo;s an
  allusion to a statement about World Wars 3 and 4 by what famous
  physicist known for his Theory of Relativity?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 44</b>: Perl is free software. If you redistribute
  it, you can choose between two completely separate licenses: the
  GNU General Public License, and what other license?</p>

  <p><b>Toss-up 45</b>: Assuming a default Perl configuration,
  which of these four code snippets will beep?</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
print "\a" if $[;
print "\007" if $0;
print "\x7" if $$$;
alarm;
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Bonus Questions</h3>

  <p><b>Bonus 1</b>: I'm going to make four statements about values
  that a scalar can hold. After each, you tell me whether the
  statement is true or false, for five points each.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Every string is true except for the null string.</li>

    <li>Every number is true except for the quantity 0.</li>

    <li>Every reference is true.</li>

    <li>Every undefined value is false.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>Bonus 2</b>: I'll give you three lexically scoped variable
  declarations. Which are valid? Answer yes or no.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
my $_;
my $::dog;
my $big{dog};
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p><b>Bonus 3</b>: Pencil and paper ready: give me a regular
  expression that matches these three misspellings of O'Reilly:<br>
  <tt>Oreilly O`Reilly O Riley</tt><br>
  ...but not match these two misspellings:<br>
  <tt>Or Reilly Oh really O'Rwant</tt></p>

  <p><b>Bonus 4</b>: I'll give you four partial Larry sayings. You
  complete them, for ten points each.<br>
  "Down that path lies madness. On the other hand, the road to hell
  is paved with ________________."<br>
  "It's easy to solve the halting problem with __________."<br>
  "The three principal virtues of a programmer are
  ____________."</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 5</b>: Write a Perl one-liner that can be executed
  from the command line. The one-liner should take a file and
  replace each tab with a space, but use no more than six letters
  to do so. You don't have to count Perl or the filename, but it
  does have to count command-line switches.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 6</b>: If you say <tt>3 + 4 * 5</tt> without any
  parentheses, the answer is 23 and not 35 because of something
  called precedence. <tt>*</tt> has a higher precedence than
  <tt>+</tt>, so it steals the 4 away from the 3. Rank the
  precedence of these five Perl operators from lowest to highest.
  You get an extra five points if you get them all correct. <tt>++
  ** == .. ||</tt></p>

  <p><b>Bonus 7</b>: I'll give you four comments. After each one,
  you tell me whether the comment appears in the Perl source code,
  for five points each.<br>
  "And you'll never guess what the dog had in its mouth." "Here
  there be dragons."<br>
  "I'm not insane, you're insane, and you're trying to steal my
  magic bag."<br>
  "It all comes from here, the stench and the peril."</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 8</b>: Collecting demographic information about Perl
  is difficult because there's no central distribution point, and
  there's no registration process. So we'll treat the Perl Journal
  subscriber list as representative of the Perl community as a
  whole. After the United States and United Kingdom, which six
  countries have the most Perl programmers, for five points each?
  You don't have to order them.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 9</b>: Caffeine is the drug of choice for
  programmers. I'll give you four drinks; you rank them in order
  from least caffeinated to most caffeinated for five points each.
  Mountain Dew, Pepsi, Jolt, and Coca Cola. For ten extra points,
  where does one tablet of Excedrin fit into this list?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 10</b>: People complain about Perl's unreadability,
  but there are many ways to write crystal-clear Perl code. One of
  those ways is the <tt>English.pm</tt> module, which lets you use
  verbose alternatives to the sometimes cryptic scalars that Perl
  predefines for you. For instance, instead of saying <tt>$_</tt>,
  you can say <tt>$ARG</tt>. I'll give you five English names; you
  give me the Perl scalar it represents. <tt>MATCH</tt>,
  <tt>INPUT_LINE_NUMBER</tt>, <tt>OUTPUT_AUTOFLUSH</tt>,
  <tt>FORMAT_LINES_PER_PAGE</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 11</b>: Usenet started as a 300-baud connection
  between which two universities?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 12</b>: Full credit if your answer is within a factor
  of 10: How many black market kidneys could Microsoft buy? I'm
  assuming the August 14, 1998 market capitalization of Microsoft
  and the price of one kidney quoted in the famous piece of
  Internet folklore. Assume that Microsoft wants to corner the
  kidney market and is willing to spend its entire net worth to do
  so.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 13</b>: Rank the following in order of
  occurrence:<br>
  IRC is launched.<br>
  Perl is introduced to the public.<br>
  The acronym "FAQ" first appears on Usenet.<br>
  Intel introduces the 80386 CPU.<br></p>

  <p><b>Bonus 14</b>: Rank the following in order of
  occurrence:<br>
  The Communications Decency Act is introduced.<br>
  DOOM is released.<br>
  Altavista is launched by Digital.<br>
  33.6 kilobit modems are introduced.<br></p>

  <p><b>Bonus 15</b>: You've heard of MP3s, the CD-quality audio
  format that's giving music producers the shivers about this
  Internet thing. MP3 stands for MPEG-3; MPEG is a digital video
  format. What do the four letters M, P, E, and G stand for?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 16</b>: After I finish reading this question, I'm
  going to ask the crowd to choose whether they prefer vi to Emacs.
  Will substantially more people choose vi, substantially more
  people choose Emacs, or will the two be roughly equal?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 17</b>: Write a syntactically perfect program that
  prints "yes" if a number is evenly divisible by 10. The number
  will be provided as an argument to the program. I'll give you a
  little extra time.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 18</b>: Rank these code snippets from slowest to
  fastest:</p>

  <blockquote>
    A) <tt>print "$c$d";</tt><br>
    B) <tt>print $c, $d;</tt><br>
    C) <tt>print $c . $d;</tt><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p><b>Bonus 19</b>: Expand these four acronyms, for five points
  each. CGI, FQDN, URL, ISDN.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 20</b>: Expand these four acronyms, for five points
  each. TCP, SMTP, MIME, XML.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 21</b>: Expand these four acronyms, for five points
  each. IANAL, CERT, API, FTP.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 22</b>: I'm going to name six cities. After each, you
  tell me whether it has a Perl Mongers chapter, yes or no.<br>
  Toronto, London, Redmond, Washington, Paris, St. Louis,
  Helsinki.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 23</b>: The Perl source code is peppered with Tolkien
  quotes. For ten points each, what are the three books in
  Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 24</b>: Pencil and paper ready. Take the area code of
  this hotel and subtract from it the number of bones in the adult
  human body. You'll end up with the area code for a U.S. city
  commonly known by a two-letter abbreviation, or four characters
  if you count punctuation. Give me a pattern that precisely
  matches that four character abbreviation.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 25</b>: I use the mSQL DBD to do CRUD. There are
  three database-oriented acronyms here: mSQL, DBD, and CRUD. For
  ten points each, what do they stand for?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 26</b>: I'll name six modules. After each, you tell
  me whether it exists on the CPAN, for five points each.
  Search::Patent, Text::GenderFromName, Mortgage::Calculate, D'oh,
  Lint, Business::UPS.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 27</b>: I'll give you an operating system or
  computer, you tell me whether Perl runs on it, yes or no, five
  points each. BeOS, Cray, Amiga, PalmPilot.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 28</b>: I'll give you three built-in Perl functions;
  you tell me what prototypes they would have if you were writing
  equivalent subroutines. <tt>join</tt>, <tt>keys</tt>,
  <tt>pipe</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 29</b>: When you apply the built-in <tt>ref()</tt>
  function to an object, you get the name of the object. When you
  apply it to a non-object reference, you get one of six answers.
  For five points each, what are they?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 30</b>: Consider the scalar $X::Y::Z. X and Y are
  both packages. What is the relationship between X and Y?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 31</b>: I'm going to list five functions. For each,
  tell me whether it's built into Perl 4, Perl 5, both, or neither.
  <tt>reverse</tt>, <tt>bless</tt>, <tt>eval</tt>, <tt>tag</tt>,
  <tt>abs</tt></p>

  <p><b>Bonus 32</b>: Many of Perl's operators can be made into
  assignment operators by adding an equals sign. For instance,
  <tt>$a + 4</tt> adds <tt>$a</tt> and 4, but <tt>$a += 4</tt> adds
  <tt>$a</tt> and 4 and sticks the result in <tt>$a</tt>. I'll give
  you four operators; you tell me which can be made assignable by
  adding an equals sign. Answer yes or no after each. <tt>x</tt>,
  <tt>^</tt>, <tt>&amp;</tt>, <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 33</b>: Laptops in the movies! For ten points, name
  the movie in which alien ships are infested with a virus uploaded
  from a PowerBook. For another ten, name the Tom Cruise movie in
  which we briefly see lists of Usenet groups scrolling by on a
  laptop.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 34</b>: I'll give you three code snippets. For ten
  points each, tell me which module bundled with the Perl
  distribution contains the snippet.<br></p>
  <pre>
print $query-&gt;textfield( -name =&gt; 'field_name' ...
@type = qw/Author Bundle Distribution Module/;
tr/AEHIOUWYBFPVCGJKQSXZDTLMNR/00000000111122222222334556/;
</pre>

  <p><b>Bonus 35</b>: Many people don't know that Perl comes with
  its own built-in symbolic debugger, perhaps because Perl programs
  practically debug themselves. It's invoked with the <tt>-d</tt>
  switch. I'll give you a debugger command, and you tell me what it
  does, for five points each. lower case b, lower case x, lower
  case h, lower case s.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 36</b>: What does this print?</p>
  <pre>
perl -e '$-=$=; print $&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; - &ndash;&ndash;$&ndash;'
</pre>

  <p><b>Bonus 37</b>: You have a hash, and you know it's been tied
  to some package. Which two functions should you use to find out
  what package that is?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 38</b>: Entropy coding (and more to the point, common
  sense) dictates that you should use short terms to represent
  commonly-occurring concepts. That's why Morse code uses a dot for
  E and a dash for T. You see this all over Perl, too. For five
  points each, give me a three, four, five, six, and seven letter
  builtin Perl function.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 39</b>: There are five tokens beginning and ending
  with double underscores that have special meaning to Perl. What
  are they?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 40</b>: Name that file test. I'll give you five
  operations. For five points each, you give me the single-letter
  file test that performs that operation. Don't forget to specify
  whether the letter is lower or upper case. Is the file there? Is
  it a binary file? Is it empty? How long has it been since the
  last access? How big is the file?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 41</b>: Which modules are bundled for the first time
  with 5.005? I'll give you six modules that might or might not
  exist; answer yes or no after each. Test.pm, Bytecode.pm,
  Thread.pm, Java.pm, fields.pm, Compiler.pm.</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 42</b>: There's always more than one way to do it,
  but can you tell me the two most concise ways to make Perl add a
  newline after each print?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 43</b>: The <tt>caller()</tt> function returns
  information about the environment in which it was invoked. If
  it's invoked with no arguments inside a subroutine, it tells you
  three things. For ten points each, what are they?</p>

  <p><b>Bonus 44</b>: This little known technique lets you
  transform your Perl program as it's being interpreted. For
  instance, you can use this to encrypt your source code and have
  Perl decrypt it on the fly. For all twenty points, what is this
  technique?</p>

  <h3>Scoring</h3>

  <p>The actual quiz show scoring was ten points for a correctly
  answered toss-up, minus five for interrupting a toss-up and
  answering incorrectly, and anywhere from twenty to thirty points
  for a bonus, with partial credit offered.</p>

  <p>Remember that these were questions given to teams of people,
  not to individuals, so you shouldn&rsquo;t expect to do very
  well. But if you simply must quantify your score, count one point
  for each correct answer (rounding partial credit on bonuses) and
  sum.</p>

  <p><b>0-20</b>: Perl Intern. Hit head with board, read FAQ,
  retake test. Beware Aquarius.<br>
  <b>21-40</b>: Perl Dentist. Keep telling yourself that you would
  have scored a lot higher if you&rsquo;d used the online
  documentation, and really isn&rsquo;t that a better way to gauge
  programming competence. Create dissent between Scorpios and
  Libras.<br>
  <b>41-60</b>: Perl Orthopedist. Feel guilty for peeking at the
  answers, disagreeing with them, and deciding that you&rsquo;re
  really correct. A Taurus will cut you off on the freeway.<br>
  <b>61-80</b>: Perl Neurosurgeon. Your future holds satori and
  high consulting fees. Expect a lawsuit from a Gemini.<br>
  <b>81+</b>: You already knew the answers because you attended the
  quiz show in person. Shame on you for pretending that you really
  did this well. If a Sagittarius offers to duel, refuse.</p>
