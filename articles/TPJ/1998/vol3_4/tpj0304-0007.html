  <b>Larry Wall</b> won the Free Software Foundation Award for the
  Advancement of Free Software for his many contributions, most
  notably Perl. His other widely-used programs cited include
  <i>rn</i> (a news reader), <i>patch</i> (a development and
  distribution tool), <i>metaconfig</i> (a program that writes
  Configure scripts), and the Warp space-war game.

  <p><img src="images/news1.gif" width="164" height="126" alt=
  "news1" border="0" align="left"> In giving the award, the FSF
  noted that Perl is "a tool that takes the Unix ideas of
  flexibility and portability further than almost any program
  before it. Perl is probably the most powerful and widely
  applicable GNU program... Larry Wall has always promoted keeping
  his implementations free for all to study, enhance, and build on,
  without restrictions, and the freedom for all to benefit in
  whatever ways they can from his products."</p>

  <p>Perl News is still being updated daily on The Perl Institute's
  web site at <a href="http://www.perl.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.org/</a>. There's also a
  keyword search of the archives there. Note that the mailing list
  has moved from announce@perl.org to <b><a href=
  "mailto:daily-news@perl.org">daily-news@perl.org</a></b>. It just
  makes more sense that way.</p>

  <p>Nathan Torkington has redesigned <b>The Perl Institute</b> web
  site, and added the Perl advocacy page, including tidbits to help
  people advocate Perl, such as language comparisons and usage
  stories. He's also added a calendar of events. Check it out at
  <a href="http://www.perl.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.org/</a>.</p>

  <p>In February, the first <b>German Perl Workshop</b> will take
  place in Sankt Augustin near Bonn. You can find more information
  at <a href="http://www.gmd.de/Events/Perl-WS99/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.gmd.de/Events/Perl-WS99/</a>.</p>

  <p>Taken with a grain of Morton's finest, the results of the
  <b>Perl Usage Survey</b> might be good for some purposes. Check
  it out at http://www.perl.org/cgi-bin/survey.</p>

  <p><b>ActivePerl 507</b> is available from <a href=
  "http://www.activestate.com" target=
  "resource window">www.activestate.com</a>. It's self-updating and
  comes with the latest libwin32 bundle and the new XML::Parser
  extension. <b>PerlEx 1.1</b> beta will be ready by the time you
  read this, as well as the ActiveState <b>Perl Development Kit
  1.1</b> beta.</p>

  <p><b>MacPerl</b> has been number one on Download.COM's download
  list for Mac OS developer tools for a couple of months now. Perl
  for Win32 has been near the top of the Windows list. What does
  this mean? Well, this information, plus the usage survey results,
  plus $3.75 will buy you a latte at Starbucks.</p>

  <p>The O'Reilly-sponsored <a href="http://www.perl.com" target=
  "resource window"><b>www.perl.com</b></a> has been updated
  regularly with articles about Perl being used to solve real
  problems by real companies.</p>

  <p>Bek Oberin announced a <b>Perl and AI mailing list</b>. To
  subscribe, send subscribe to
  <b>ai-perl-request@tertius.net.au</b> or visit <a href=
  "http://www.tertius.net.au/lists/perl-ai/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.tertius.net.au/lists/perl-ai/</a>.</p>

  <p>New <b>Perl Mongers</b> groups announced since last issue
  include Albany, Ann Arbor, Austin, Cincinnati, Gothenberg
  (Sweden), Grand Rapids, Lexington KY, Madrid (Catalunya.pm),
  Omaha, Orange County CA, Raleigh, Rochester NY, Santa Cruz
  (BananaSlug.pm), Springfield IL, St. Petersburg, Sydney, and
  Toronto.</p>

  <p>Some special Perl Mongers groups were founded, too: <b>AOL</b>
  (for America Online employees), <b>JPL</b> (for Jet Propulsion
  Labs), and <b>MarsNeedsWomen</b> (for women only). For more
  information, check out <a href="http://www.pm.org/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.pm.org/</a>.</p>

  <p>Mozilla's bug tracking system, <b>Bugzilla</b> (<a href=
  "http://www.mozilla.org/bugs/source.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.mozilla.org/bugs/source.html</a>),
  was completely rewritten in Perl, with Mysql as its backend. So
  now both the build process and the bug tracking system are Perl.
  Could Netscape possibly lose the browser war now? We think
  not.</p>

  <p>Nick Ing-Simmons wrote <b>Make</b> in Perl. It will require
  quite a bit of testing, but may indeed be the way of the future
  for the Perl build process. If Mozilla's build process is in
  Perl, why not Perl's?</p>

  <p>The <b>perl5.005_02 documentation</b> is now on the CPAN in
  PDF (Bill Middleton) and Newton Book format (Chris Nandor).</p>

  <p>COAST Lab at Purdue released Autonomous Agents for Intrusion
  Detection (<b>AAFID</b>), a security system that uses a
  distributed architecture to monitor a network for anomalous or
  malicious behavior. Check it out at
  http://www.cs.pur-due.edu/coast/projects/autonomous-agents.html.</p>

  <p>In editor news, <b>CodeForge</b> for Linux
  (http://www.code-forge.com/) now has support for Perl, and
  <b>BBEdit 5.0</b> for Mac OS (<a href="http://www.barebones.com/"
  target="resource window">http://www.barebones.com/</a>) has
  improved support.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Kurt Starsinic, the <b>CPAN Scripts archive</b> is
  now open for business. See CPAN/scripts/index.html for the
  scripts repository, and CPAN/scripts/new/submitting.html for
  submission instructions.</p>

  <p>Jarkko Hietaniemi has compiled a list of places of
  distribution for <b>binary builds</b> of Perl and extension
  modules. It's available at CPAN/ports/index.html.</p>

  <p>Speaking of binary builds, there's a MacPerl build of DBI 1.01
  available at ftp://pudge.net/pub/pudge/macperl/DBI/.</p>

  <p>Joe Marzot's <b>TFTP</b> is, unsurprisingly, a module
  implementing TFTP (the Trivial File Transfer Protocol, described
  in RFC 783).</p>

  <p><b>AppConfig</b>, from Andy Wardley, is a bundle of Perl5
  modules for reading configuration files and parsing command line
  arguments. This supersedes the App::Config module.</p>

  <p>Marc Liyanage finished the first version of <b>Barcode</b>,
  which creates barcodes in GIF and EPS formats.</p>

  <p>Stanislav Malyshev announced <b>Lingua-IW-Logical</b>, for
  converting logical representations of Hebrew to visual
  representations.</p>

  <p>Fran&amp;ccecil;ois Desarmenien's <b>Parse::Yapp</b> compiles
  <i>yacc</i>-like LALR grammars into Perl parser modules.</p>

  <p><b>TkApache</b>, a Perl/Tk app, is a GUI frontend to managing
  and configuring Apache. See <a href=
  "http://eunuchs.org/linux/TkApache" target=
  "resource window">http://eunuchs.org/linux/ TkApache</a>.</p>

  <p>Lots of new and updated Apache modules are available on the
  CPAN; see www.modperl.org for a list of what's new. In
  particular, <b>Apache::Throttle</b> performs speed-based content
  negotation; that is, depending on the speed of the connection,
  different content can be sent. Also, Demetrios Paneras released
  A<b>pache::AuthenPasswd</b> and <b>Apache::AuthenNIS</b>, which
  perform web-based authentication via Unix password files and NIS
  (Network Information Service).</p>

  <p>Jonathan Eisenzopf has released several modules that use
  <b>XML::Parser: XML::Dumper</b>, which converts XML to/from Perl
  source code, <b>XML::Registry</b>, which implements a registry in
  XML, <b>XML::CGI</b>, which converts CGI.pm variables to/from
  XML, and TkApache, which works with a DBI-enabled relational
  database. More XML modules and information can be found on
  Jonathan's XML FAQ at <a href=
  "http://www.pobox.com/~eisen/xml/perl-xml-faq.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.pobox.com/~eisen/xml/perl-xml-faq.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Sean Burke has also been busy. <b>Games::Dissociate</b>
  implements a Dissociated Press algorithm, which garbles text in
  natural-sounding ways. <b>MIDI-Perl</b> is a suite of modules for
  reading, writing, and composing MIDI files. His
  <b>Tree::DAG_Node</b> implements tree-shaped data structures for
  use manipulating parse trees, game trees, or natural language
  syntax trees. Finally, <b>I18N::LangTags</b> matches and compares
  language tags. We shudder to see what he does next.</p>

  <p>Benjamin Holzman has his own Tree module,
  <b>Tree::RedBlack</b>, implementing the the Red/Black balanced
  tree algorithm.</p>

  <p>Michael Edmondson has written a Perl program called
  <b>Rezrov</b>, a z-code interpreter for Infocom games (such as
  Zork), at <a href="http://www.voicenet.com/~mikeedmo/rezrov/"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www.voicenet.com/~mikeedmo/rezrov/</a>.
  Inevitably, denizens of EFNet's #perl channel were playing Zork
  with a Net::IRC bot by the end of the week.</p>

  <p><b>Finance::YahooChart</b>, from Dj Padzensky, pulls stock
  quotes from Yahoo! Finance. It's also been turned into an IRC
  bot.</p>

  <p>James Briggs released <b>Aviation::Report</b> for retrieving
  U.S. Aviation METAR, TAF, and PIREP reports, and Jeremy D.
  Zawodny released <b>Geo::METAR</b>. No word yet of an IRC bot for
  either.</p>

  <p><b>Net::Rexec</b>, implementing the REXEC (Remote Execution)
  protocol, was developed by Fila Kolodny.</p>

  <p>The prolific Graham Barr released <b>perl-ldap</b>, a
  collection of modules providing an LDAP services API.</p>

  <p><b>CDDB</b> is a module from Rocco Caputo for using the online
  Compact Disc Database. Rocco also released 0.01 of POE, which he
  calls a cross between a MUD and an operating system.</p>

  <p>The MPEG::MP3Tag module announced last issue now has the
  ability to retrieve header info, like bitrate, length, etc., from
  MP3 audio files. As such, it has been renamed to
  <b>MPEG::MP3Info</b>. A script comes with the module to get CDDB
  data (using the CDDB module) using MP3 info from a complete album
  of MP3 files.</p>

  <p><b>Watchdog</b> is a set of classes from Paul Sharpe for
  monitoring whether a process, HTTP server, or Mysql server is
  functioning.</p>

  <p>Matt Sergeant wrote <b>Win32::ASP</b> for PerlScript
  programming.</p>

  <p>Ken Williams released <b>Text::FillIn</b>, which implements
  fillin text templates.</p>

  <p>Philippe Verdret filled the gaping RTF void in CPAN with
  <b>RTF::Parser</b>.</p>

  <p>Information about modules and other Perl news should be sent
  to <b>news@perl.org</b>.</p>
