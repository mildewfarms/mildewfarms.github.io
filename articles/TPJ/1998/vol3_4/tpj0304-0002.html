  <p>Perl has a lot of slogans. Probably the most popular is
  "There's More than One Way To Do It" (TMTOWTDI). Despite this,
  some ways of doing things are frowned upon in the Perl community.
  In this article, I present four heresies for those pariahs who
  dare go against the established grain.</p>

  <p>I have two reasons for disliking the Perl Orthodoxy. First, it
  discourages the idea that if you know enough Perl to get your job
  done then you know enough Perl. And programming is an artistic as
  well as technical discipline, so just as "wrong notes" can make a
  good piece of music better, programmers should be free to use the
  "forbidden constructs" if it makes their programs more
  aesthetically pleasing. However, this comes with a caveat: as
  with music, if you don't know <i>why</i> you're breaking the
  rules, you probably shouldn't be.</p>

  <h3>Heresy #1: Don't use <tt>-w</tt>.</h3>

  <p>According to my reading of the 5.004 source, Perl has around
  60 optional warnings. If you are a moderately skilled Perl
  programmer, you will see at most one or two of them on a regular
  basis.</p>

  <p>I rarely use <tt>-w</tt>. For whatever reason, the kind of
  mistakes I make are not ones that it catches. The most frequent
  appearance of <tt>-w</tt> warnings in my programs are due to DBI
  queries that return rows with empty columns. Since there's no way
  to predict in advance which columns will be empty, I'm treated to
  a slew of <tt>Use of uninitialized value at line</tt> ...
  messages.</p>

  <p>Since <tt>-w</tt> generates its warnings based on conditions
  that change at run-time, it makes the behavior of your programs
  unpredictable. If your program is sending data to something that
  merges <tt>STDOUT</tt> and <tt>STDERR</tt> like a Netscape web
  server, this could spell death. If you're doing something
  interactively, a user unfamiliar with Perl might be unnecessarily
  alarmed by its warning messages. In these situations I recommend
  developing with <tt>-w</tt> and then removing it for production
  use. Sometimes it's nice to have Perl hold your hand, but
  sometimes it's impractical.</p>

  <p>Don't forget that warnings can be turned on and off within a
  program.</p>

  <p><i>... with no</i> <tt>-w</tt>, <i>code here will run without
  warnings ...</i></p>
  <pre>
{
  local $^W=1;
  ... code here will run with warnings ...
}

</pre>

  <p>After the curly-brace-delimited block, <tt>$^W</tt> reverts to
  its previous value, and warnings will no longer be on.</p>

  <h3>Heresy #2: Don't always use regular expressions just because
  they're cool.</h3>

  <p>Regular expressions are an extremely powerful tool. They can
  also quickly become difficult to decipher and maintain. Perl has
  a rich palette of string handling functions, many of which have
  nothing to do with regular expressions. One of my favorite
  techniques is using substr as an lvalue. To change the first
  three characters on a line, you could do:</p>
  <pre>
$string =~ s/^.../abc/;
</pre>

  <p>or you could say:</p>
  <pre>
substr($string,0,3) = 'abc';
</pre>

  <p>The second one is a few characters longer, but to me, much
  more clear. Unfortunately, clarity sometimes comes at the cost of
  speed. I benchmarked this script:</p>
  <pre>
use Benchmark;

$string = 'mary had a little lamb.';

timethese (800000, {
  regex = sub { $string =~ s:^...:abc: }
  substr = sub { substr($string,0,3) = 'abc'; }
});
</pre>

  <p>However, the results were inconclusive. On my FreeBSD box,
  substr had the slight edge. On a Sun Ultra Enterprise 450, the
  regex was a hair faster. Try it yourself and see.</p>

  <h3>Heresy #3: Don't always use modules.</h3>

  <p>Modules are great &ndash; they save time and save you from
  common mistakes. However, they also create dependencies, add to
  loading time, and sometimes keep you from exploring a subject on
  your own. One of the first medium-size programs I ever wrote (in
  BASIC/PLUS on a PDP-11) was a mail program. Of course I didn't
  write the world's best mailer right out of the gate, but it did
  work and I learned a lot in the process. Sometimes I feel that
  Perl's moduleoriented culture prevents people from exploring for
  the sake of exploring. True, if you're programming on someone
  else's dime you owe it to them to do the job efficiently, but if
  you're just messing around, reinventing the wheel can be
  rewarding.</p>

  <p>For instance, the sixth field of localtime contains the
  current day of the week. If you know this simple fact, you can do
  a number of useful calculations with simple arithmetic and a
  little cleverness. What day of the week was yesterday? The answer
  is:</p>
  <pre>
$yesterday = ( (localtime)[6] - 1 ) % 7;
</pre>

  <p>This returns a number in the range 0-6, with 0 denoting
  Sunday. One line of code, using one built-in Perl function.</p>

  <p>Compare to Date::Manip, weighing in at 5790 lines. Even the
  author admits there are many situations in which Date::Manip is
  not practical. On the other hand, if you are trying to handle
  dates of the form "1st Thursday in June 1992", you're better off
  using Date::Manip than writing your own parser from scratch.</p>

  <p>Sometimes you might want to avoid modules just to get a little
  practice. HTML::Parser can handle a wide range of possibilities,
  but if your HTML is machine-generated, you might not need all of
  its power. If I want to build up a concordance of title tags, I
  can rely on the regular expression
  <tt>&lt;TITLE&gt;(.*?)&lt;/TITLE&gt;</tt> to get the job done.
  Most of the time, I prefer to handle our files by creating
  regular expressions &ndash; since regexps are such a powerful
  tool, I like to get as much practice with them as possible.</p>

  <p>This leads us to a mini-heresy:</p>

  <h3>Heresy #4: Partial Solutions Are OK</h3>

  <p>You don't always have to create a generic solution that will
  solve every possible case. This is more about software design
  than Perl, but as Perl lends itself to rapid application
  development so well, there's no reason to fear the <i>rapid</i>
  part. For one thing, you'll undoubtedly discover new and better
  ways to solve the problem as you gain experience, and trying to
  rewrite a huge program that has a fundamental design flaw is
  harder than expanding a simple program that only requires a few
  tweaks.</p>

  <p>Also, partial solutions can sometimes help you avoid difficult
  tasks. Consider the ever-popular task of validating an email
  address. While it's impossible to make sure there's a human on
  the other end, it is possible to determine if a given address is
  syntactically invalid. For example, the address
  <tt>jsd@.bud.com</tt> is obviously undeliverable, and this is
  easy to verify with a specific regular expression. We can avoid
  the complete solution with an instantaneous partial solution that
  catches a lot of simple typing errors.</p>
