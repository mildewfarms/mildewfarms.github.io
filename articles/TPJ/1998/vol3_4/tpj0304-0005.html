  <p>I'm composing this text in Emacs, which is running on my Linux
  PC. At the same time, I'm developing and testing Perl/Tk code for
  this article on the PC and another machine running Windows 95.
  These machines are part of a LAN, so I don't race madly from
  machine to machine. Instead, I sit in front of my Macintosh and
  work in several environments simultaneously, thanks to an X11
  server and a VNC viewer (Virtual Network Computing, which allows
  you to see one computer's desktop from another; see <a href=
  "http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/</a>.</p>

  <p>I do this because these days you must be able to interoperate,
  and I want my Unix Perl/Tk programs to run on Win32 machines.
  Professionally, it's hard to ignore the millions of PCs running
  Windows and NT. That fact really hit home while reading about the
  Navy's new "smart ships" being deployed with systems running NT
  in an effort to cut costs by reducing personnel.</p>

  <p>So, in a departure from the usual format of this column, we'll
  follow my trials and tribulations as I try to make a simple
  widget run on both Unix and Windows 95. We'll cover how to fetch
  and install Perl, Tk, and CPAN modules, what you can do to make
  your Win32 environment more Unix friendly, and what portability
  issues might arise.</p>

  <h3>INSTALLING PERL ON WIN32</h3>

  <p>First, we need a Win32 Perl binary. Gurusamy Sarathy's port
  has been around over a year and has lots of prebuilt modules,
  including Tk 4. Times change, however, and there's a newer Perl
  available (along with lots of modules, including Tk 8) called
  ActivePerl, which is the Perl we'll use.</p>

  <p>The ActivePerl binary is on the Internet, ready to run on
  Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT. All you need to do is
  find the web page, download the self extracting archive and
  double-click to install it. Windows 95 requires that DCOM 1.2 be
  installed first. Once DCOM is installed, reboot Windows 95. Now
  fetch ActivePerl; both of these can be found at the URLs in the
  Packages Used box above.</p>

  <p>When the download completes, use Explorer (or the tool of your
  choice) to figure out where Windows placed the file; the
  particular version is named <tt>APi502e.EXE</tt> (<a href=
  "images/tk-figure1.gif">Figure 1</a>). (The 502 part of the name
  means Perl 5.005_02; 507 just became available as this article
  went to press.)</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/tk-figure1.gif"><img align=
  "center" alt="Figure 1: APi502e.EXE" border="0" height="107" src=
  "images/tk-figure1_sm.gif" width="155"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b>
  APi502e.EXE</font></p>

  <p>As you can see, I placed it in my <tt>/tmp</tt> directory,
  which I created earlier. I double-click the APi502e icon, and the
  ActivePerl setup wizard starts. Just accept all the defaults. In
  particular, let it modify your <tt>AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt> file and add
  the Perl bin directory to your path. Then PERL, PERLDOC and
  <tt>PL2BAT</tt> (more on <tt>PL2BAT</tt> later) can be invoked by
  name in whatever directory you happen to be in. After the install
  completes you are given a chance to read the release notes, which
  you should do at least once. When finished, reboot the
  machine.</p>

  <p>Now let's see what we have. <a href=
  "images/tk-figure2.gif">Figure 2</a> is an Explorer window
  displaying the contents of Perl's <tt>bin</tt> directory, which
  is now part of your standard path. The actual Perl executable
  resides in the directory
  <tt>...\5.00502\bin\MSWin32-x86-object</tt>. The file of
  particular importance to us is PPM, the Perl Package Manager.
  We'll run it shortly.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/tk-figure2.gif"><img align=
  "center" src="images/tk-figure2_sm.gif" border="0" width="220"
  height="184" alt=
  "Figure 2: Contents of Perl's bin directory"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2:</b> Contents of
  Perl's <tt>bin</tt> directory</font></p>

  <p><b>INSTALLING PERL MODULES</b></p>

  <p>PPM is like the CPAN module, CPAN.pm, which downloads and
  installs modules from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. PPM
  downloads and installs Win32 modules from the ActivePerl
  repository. To learn how to use PPM, either run the program and
  type help, or read the online documentation: bring up the Start
  menu and select <tt>Programs -&gt; ActivePerl -&gt; Online
  Documentation</tt>. Your browser will activate and display an
  extensive table of contents. Key sections are the Perl Package
  Manager, the Win32 FAQ, and the documentation on Perl and all the
  modules on your system (<a href="images/tk-figure3.gif">Figure
  3</a>).</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/tk-figure3.gif"><img align=
  "center" alt="Figure 3: Welcome ot ActivePerl" border="0" width=
  "220" height="151" src="images/tk-figure3_sm.gif"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 3:</b> Welcome to
  ActivePerl</font></p>

  <p>To install Tk, double-click the PPM icon in the Explorer
  window. A DOS window similar to <a href=
  "images/tk-figure4.gif">Figure 4</a> appears. As you can see, the
  interface is very straightforward.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/tk-figure4.gif"><img align=
  "center" alt="Figure 4: Welcome ot ActivePerl" border="0" width=
  "223" height="129" src="images/tk-figure4_sm.gif"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 4:</b> DOS Window to
  Install TK</font></p>

  <p>By default, package names are case sensitive, so make sure you
  type <tt>install Tk</tt>. When you hit <tt>&lt;Return&gt;</tt>,
  go get some coffee, because PPM is downloading Tk over the net
  from ActiveState, and this can take a long time depending on how
  you're connected (perhaps twenty minutes on a 28.8 line). PPM
  gives absolutely no feedback whatsoever during this time, so
  avoid the temptation to abort the command. Eventually install
  messages fly by, and the PPM prompt appears. Type <tt>quit</tt>
  and you're ready to rock.</p>

  <p>Besides installing Tk proper, PPM places two new executables
  in the Perl bin directory: <tt>PTKSH</tt> and <tt>WIDGET</tt>.
  Try them both by typing their names in a DOS window (remember,
  all executables in the Perl bin directory are now in your path),
  or by double-clicking them from an Explorer window. Note that
  Perl/Tk applications always have a DOS window for <tt>STDIN</tt>,
  <tt>STDOUT</tt>, and <tt>STDERR</tt>. The window will stay
  iconified on the task bar, but you can open it at any time to
  look for messages or enter input. The WIDGET program (<a href=
  "images/tk-figure5.gif">Figure 5</a>) is helpful if you're
  learning Perl/Tk; it demonstrates common widgets and displays the
  source code used to render them.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/tk-figure5.gif"><img align=
  "center" alt="Figure 5: Perl/TK Widget Demonstrations" border="0"
  width="154" height="198" src="images/tk-figure5_sm.gif"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 5:</b> Perl/TK Widget
  Demonstrations</font></p>

  <p>Now that we have Perl and Tk installed, what's next? Let's say
  I want to install a Frog widget provided in a module downloadable
  from the CPAN. The CPAN is designed for Unix, with gzipped tar
  files and makefiles. Is the following installation sequence still
  viable in Win32?</p>
  <pre>
gtar -zxvf distribution.tar.gz
cd distribution
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
</pre>

  <p>As it happens, the answer is yes - once we collect the
  requisite tools. We'll assume that the module is Perl only - no C
  code - since regrettably few Windows 95 machines have a
  compiler.</p>

  <p>For unpacking CPAN distributions, I use WinZip 7.0, a nifty
  utility that handles not only zip files, but many other common
  formats like tar, gzip, and binhex. It integrates nicely with
  Netscape, is easy to use, and performs flawlessly. Once the
  distribution is unpacked simply run perl <tt>Makefile.PL</tt> to
  generate your Makefile.</p>

  <p>The hardest part of this project was locating a working make
  substitute. Long story short: cygwin (a Unix-like API for
  Windows; <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com" target=
  "resource window">http://sourceware.cygnus.com</a>) has its own
  make, but I was saved by Gurusamy Sarathy, who pointed me to his
  <tt>DMAKE</tt> executable.</p>

  <p>Once unpacked, just move DMAKE.EXE and STARTUP to some
  directory in your path. You could use Perl's bin directory, but
  I'd recommend using a directory of your own. There are two
  caveats that Sarathy points out:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Config.pm, located in 5.00502\lib\MSWin32-x86-object\, must
    be changed so it knows to use DMAKE rather than NMAKE. Change
    this the editor of your choice (WordPad works fine).</li>

    <li>Avoid directories with embedded spaces. For instance, don't
    use the default WinZip archive directory, My Zip Files.</li>
  </ol>At last, with everything set to go, I typed:
  <pre>
C:\ DMAKE DMAKE
</pre>

  <p>Success! Next step:</p>
  <pre>
C:\ DMAKE test DMAKE test
C:\PERL\5.00502\BIN\MSWIN3~1\ ... test.pl
The getpwuid function is unimplemented at
                      blib\lib/Tk/Frog.pm line 86.
at C:\PERL\site\5.005\lib/Tk/Widget.pm line 186
</pre>

  <p>Darn, failure! But the error makes perfect sense - Windows 95
  has no concept of multiple users and passwords (Novell Client 32
  excepted), so why should any of the <tt>getpw()</tt> functions
  work? Indeed, there are even more Perl functions unavailable in
  Win32, all listed in the "ActivePerl FAQ/Quirks" section of the
  online documentation.</p>

  <p>Okay, let's look at the code, but I want a familiar editor.
  NotePad is a disaster since it has no concept of a Unix
  end-of-line character and can't handle any but the tiniest files.
  WordPad is acceptable - in fact, that's what I edited
  <tt>Config.pm</tt> with - but I want my Emacs! (Sorry, vi folks,
  you're on your own. <i>[both vim and vile are available for
  Win32. -editor]</i>)</p>

  <p>There is a very nice Emacs implementation at
  ftp://ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/latest/i386/emacs
  -20.3.1-bin-i386.tar.gz.</p>

  <p>Once unpacked, you install it with one command at a DOS
  prompt. Assuming the Emacs source tree is c:\emacs, enter
  this:</p>
  <pre>
c:\emacs\bin\addpm c:\emacs
</pre>

  <p>At this point we have a comfortable, albeit minimal,
  development environment. The online documentation details other
  repositories of Unix tools in the section "ActivePerl FAQ/Windows
  95/NT."</p>

  <p>Now, back to the <tt>DMAKE</tt> test failure - here's the
  offending code:</p>
  <pre>
if (not $user = getlogin) {
    die "Can't get user name." if not $user = getpwuid($&lt;);
}
</pre>

  <p>As porting problems go, this one has no real fix because the
  code does not apply to Windows 95. Since I wrote the code, I know
  why it needs a user name - for authentication later in the
  program. But for Windows, a fake user name is okay, so all we
  need to do is add one:</p>
  <pre>
if (not $user = getlogin) {
    if ($^O eq 'MSWin32') {
        $user = $^O;
    } else {
       die "Can't get user name." if $user != getpwuid($&lt;);
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>The Perl special variable <tt>$^O</tt> contains the operating
  system name, and I've used it with the assumption that the new
  code will function properly on any OS other than Windows. That
  may not be a good assumption (what about NT?),(Once I have access
  to an NT machine, I'll use <tt>Win32::IsWinNT()</tt> and
  <tt>Win32::IsWin95()</tt> to tune this code further. but it's the
  best I can do. At least I can proceed with testing the
  widget.)</p>

  <p>The next DMAKE test worked perfectly, as did <tt>DMAKE
  install</tt>. My Tk module installed in the
  <tt>...site\5.00502\lib\Tk</tt> hierarchy, and I used
  <tt>PTKSH</tt> to try it out. No problems, although there was one
  more detail to investigate - the install will have placed a Perl
  script called FROG in my path. In Unix the script is copied to
  the directory containing the Perl executable. Is the same true in
  Windows?</p>

  <p>Yes. In fact, two files are stored in the Perl bin directory,
  the original script (<tt>FROG</tt>) and the script wrapped (by
  <a href="tpj0304-0005a.html"><tt>pl2bat</tt></a>) in a DOS batch
  file (<tt>FROG.BAT</tt>). Try <tt>perldoc pl2bat</tt>, <tt>pl2bat
  -h</tt> or read the online documentation for details. The
  <a href="tpj0304-0005a.html">pl2bat</a> wrapper is clever - it's
  a valid Perl program and a valid DOS batch file.</p>

  <p>These statements are designed so that two programs can parse
  them properly, DOS and Perl. This trickery was devised so the
  script would run from a variety of incantations.</p>

  <p>To DOS, the first line, <tt>@rem = '--*-Perl-*--</tt>, is a
  comment (remark), which it ignores. The fourth line executes
  Perl, passing <tt>-x</tt> (which discards any text prior to the
  #! line and begins executing the program from that point), -S
  (which searches through your path, emulating what #! does on
  Unix), the script's name, and up to nine command line parameters.
  When the script terminates, the batch file jumps to the label
  <tt>endofperl</tt>.</p>

  <p>To Perl, these statements assign a large multiline string to
  <tt>@rem</tt>, beginning with <tt>'--*-Perl-*--</tt> and ending
  with the solitary ' ten lines later. Nothing is ever done with
  <tt>@rem;</tt> it just gets the DOS batch commands out of the way
  so Perl can do its business, starting with the <tt>#!</tt> line
  after that final apostrophe.</p>

  <p>So <tt>FROG</tt> will launch whether you type it in from a DOS
  prompt or a double-click its icon in an Explorer window. But will
  it run correctly? Alas, the script fails:</p>

  <p><tt>Bad command or file name</tt></p>

  <p>It's my widget, so I know that the <tt>system()</tt>
  invocation in <tt>FROG.BAT</tt> is the culprit. <tt>system()</tt>
  works perfectly well in Win32, but <tt>FROG</tt> uses it to call
  the <tt>klog</tt> program, which is Unix-specific. A quick
  modification yields:</p>
  <pre>
if ($^O eq 'MSWin32') {
    ($pw eq $^O) ? exit(0) : return(0);
} else {
    system "/usr/afsws/bin/klog $user " .
                   quotemeta($pw) . " 2&gt; /dev/null";
    ($? == 0) ? exit(0) : return(0);
}
</pre>

  <p>But when I run <tt>FROG</tt> again the error reoccurs.
  Eventually, you'll realize that Perl isn't running the file you
  think it is! What's wrong?</p>

  <p>Think <tt>-S</tt> (it's in the <tt>.BAT</tt> file). This
  command line option tells Perl to search our path for the script.
  So Perl finds the FROG file in the Perl bin directory - the other
  file installed by <tt>DMAKE</tt> install. Two separate programs,
  both of which need to be fixed.</p>

  <p>In my Win32 testing I've found that almost all of Perl/Tk
  works. The few outstanding bugs I know about involve
  <tt>fontFamilies()</tt> and <tt>fileevent()</tt>. No doubt there
  are others. When I see patches that look important, I test them,
  and if they check out I make them available at</p>

  <p>Until next time, use Tk;</p>
