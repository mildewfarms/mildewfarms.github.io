  <p>I admit it. I love navigation bars. I go completely green with
  envy whenever I browse one of those fancy Web sites with
  navigation bars that change color as you move the mouse over them
  or expand and contract a table of contents with one click.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I think "OK, that's it. I'm going to install a
  navigation bar like this one <i>right now</i>." So I download the
  HTML source code for the page and have a peek. What I see always
  diminishes my enthusiasm substantially. Navigation bars are a lot
  of work! Either they're done by hand using individually crafted
  HTML pages, or they require a slow-loading Java applet, or most
  frequently, they consume several pages of JavaScript code filled
  with convoluted workarounds for various makes and models of
  browser.</p>

  <p>One of the cardinal virtues of programming in laziness, and as
  a Perl programmer I have this virtue in spades. I don't want to
  do any hard work to create my navigation bar. I just want it to
  appear, automatically, when I write an HTML page and save it into
  my Web site's document directory. When I finally bit the bullet
  and got down to writing a site-wide navigation bar, I used
  mod_perl, the nifty embedded Perl module for Apache, to create a
  system that automatically adds a navigation bar to all my pages
  without my having to lift a finger. You'll need the Apache Web
  server, version 1.3.3 or higher, mod_perl version 1.16 or higher,
  and Perl 5.004_03 or higher to use this system.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/screenshot1.gif"><img src=
  "images/screenshot1_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 1: Screenshot 1" border="0" width="240" height=
  "234"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> Screenshot
  1</font></p>

  <p>Screenshot 1 shows a page from my laboratory's Web site with
  the navigation bar at the top. The bar is a single row of links,
  embedded inside an HTML table, running along the top and bottom
  of the page. Each link represents a major subdivision of the
  site. In this case, the subdivisions are groups of software
  products that I maintain, namely "Jade", "AcePerl", "Boulder",
  and "WWW." There's also a "Home" link for the top level page of
  the site. When the user selects a link, it takes him directly to
  the chosen section. The link then changes to red to indicate that
  the selected section is currently active. The link remains red
  for as long as the user is browsing pages contained within or
  beneath the section (as determined by the URL path). When the
  user jumps out of the section, either by selecting a link from
  the navigation bar or by some other means, the navigation bar
  updates to reflect his new position.</p>

  <h3>THE CONFIGURATION FILE</h3>

  <p>The nice feature about this system is that there's no
  hard-coded information anywhere the HTML pages themselves about
  the organization of the site or the appearance of the navigation
  bar. The navigation bar is added to the page using configuration
  information contained in a site-wide configuration file. The
  bar's appearance is determined by Perl code. I favor a visually
  simple horizontal navigation bar with text links with a few
  adjustments to the code; however, you could change the bar so
  that it displays vertically, or uses inline images as its links.
  It's also possible to associate different sections of the site
  with different navigation bars, or hide the navigation bar
  completely.</p>

  <p>The configuration file is usually stored with Apache's other
  configuration files inside the server root directory's etc
  subdirectory. Below you can see the configuration I use at my
  site. It's a simple text file consisting of tab-delimited text.
  The first column contains the URLs to link to for each of the
  site's major sections. The second column contains the text to
  display for each link. Blank lines and lines beginning with the
  comment character are ignored.</p>
  <pre>
# stein.cshl.org navigation bar
# file etc/navigation.conf
/index.html           Home
/jade/                Jade
/AcePerl/             AcePerl
/software/boulder/    BoulderIO
/software/WWW/        WWW
/linux/               Linux
</pre>

  <p>Notice that you can link to either a file name, e.g.
  <tt>index.html</tt>, or to a directory name, e.g.
  <tt>/jade/</tt>. The navigation bar systems treats the two cases
  slightly differently when deciding whether to consider a certain
  section "active." The system uses prefix mapping to determine
  whether a page lies within a section. In the example above, any
  page that starts with the URL <tt>/jade</tt> will be considered
  to be part of the "Jade" area, and the corresponding label will
  be highlighted in red. However, since <tt>/index.html</tt> refers
  to a file rather than a partial path, only the home page itself
  is ever considered to be within the "Home" area.</p>

  <p>Major sections do not have to correspond to a top level
  directory. For example, the "Boulder" and "WWW" sections are both
  subdirectories beneath "software", which doesn't have an explicit
  entry. The navigational system will also work with user-supported
  directories. For example:</p>
  <pre>
/~lstein/      Lincoln's Pages
</pre>

  <h3>ACTIVATING THE NAVIGATION BAR</h3>

  <p>Apache itself needs to be configured to use the navigation bar
  system. This is done by adding the <tt>&lt;Location&gt;</tt>
  directive section shown below to one of Apache's configuration
  files. There are three directives in this section. The SetHandler
  directive tells Apache that every URL on the site is to be passed
  to the embedded Perl interpreter. The PerlHandler directive tells
  the Perl interpreter what to do with the URL when it gets it. In
  this case, we're telling Perl to pass the URL through the
  Apache::NavBar module. The last directive, <tt>PerlSetVar</tt>,
  sets a configuration variable named <tt>NavConf</tt> to the
  relative configuration file path etc/navigation.conf. The
  Apache::NavBar module will use NavConf to find its configuration
  file.</p>
  <pre>
&lt;Location /&gt;
  SetHandler perl-script
  PerlHandler Apache::NavBar
  PerlSetVar NavConf etc/navigation.conf
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>

  <p>In this example, the <tt>&lt;Location&gt;</tt> directive's
  path argument is <tt>/</tt>, indicating that the navigation bar
  system is to be applied to each and every URL served by the Web
  site. To apply the navigation bar to a portion of the site only,
  you would just modify the path accordingly. You can even apply
  different navigation bar configuration files to different parts
  of your Web site!</p>

  <h3>GENERATING THE NAVIGATION BAR</h3>

  <p>Page 15 shows the code for the navigation bar module. The file
  should be named <tt>NavBar.pm</tt> and stored in the Apache
  subdirectory of the Perl library directory. This is a slightly
  longer code example than you've seen in previous columns, so
  we'll walk through it in chunks.</p>
  <pre>
package Apache::NavBar;
# file Apache/NavBar.pm
use strict;
use Apache::Constants qw(:common);
use Apache::File ();
</pre>

  <p>After declaring the package, the module turns on the
  <tt>strict pragma</tt>, thereby avoiding the use of barewords,
  undeclared globals, and other sloppy programming practices. The
  module then brings in two helper packages. As its name implies,
  Apache::Constants provides various constant values that are
  meaningful to the Apache server. We bring in the "common"
  constants, and then Apache::File, which contains routines useful
  for manipulating files.</p>
  <pre>
my %BARS = ();
my $TABLEATTS = 'WIDTH="100%" BORDER=1';
my $TABLECOLOR = '#C8FFFF';
my $ACTIVECOLOR = '#FF0000';
</pre>

  <p>These lines define several file-wide lexical variables. %BARS
  is a hash that will be used to hold a set of "NavBar" navigation
  bar objects. The NavBar class, which we'll examine later, defines
  methods for reading and parsing navigation bar configuration
  files, and for returning information about a particular
  navigation bar. Because a site is free to define several
  different navigation bars, the <tt>%BARS</tt> hash is necessary
  to keep track of them. The hash's keys are the paths to each
  navigation bar's configuration file, and its values are the
  NavBar objects themselves.</p>

  <p>The <tt>$TABLEATTS</tt>, <tt>$TABLECOLOR</tt>, and
  <tt>$ACTIVECOLOR</tt> globals control various aspects of the
  navigation bar's appearance. <tt>$TABLEATTS</tt> controls the
  table's width and border attributes, <tt>$TABLECOLOR</tt> sets
  the background color of each cell, and <tt>$ACTIVECOLOR</tt> sets
  the color of the active links.</p>
  <pre>
sub handler {
    my $r = shift;
</pre>

  <p>This begins the definition of the <tt>handler()</tt>
  subroutine, which Apache calls to fetch a requested document. The
  subroutine begins by shifting the request object off the
  subroutine stack. The request object will be used subsequently
  for all communication between the subroutine and Apache.</p>
  <pre>
$r-&gt;content_type eq 'text/html' || return DECLINED;
my $bar = read_configuration($r) || return DECLINED;
my $table = make_bar($r, $bar);
</pre>

  <p>In this section we attempt to read the configuration file and
  create or retrieve the appropriate navigation bar object. The
  first thing we do is test the requested document's MIME type by
  calling the <tt>content_type()</tt> method. If the MIME type is
  anything other than <tt>text/html</tt>, it doesn't make any sense
  to add a navigation bar, so we return a result code of
  <tt>DECLINED</tt>. This tells Apache to pass the request on to
  the next module that has expressed interest in processing
  requests. Usually this will be Apache's default document handler,
  which simply sends the file through unmodified.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, we try to read the currently configured navigation
  bar definition file, using an internal routine named
  <tt>read_configuration()</tt>. If this routine succeeds, it will
  return the navigation bar object. Otherwise it returns undef.
  Again, we exit with a <tt>DECLINED</tt> error code in case of
  failure.</p>

  <p>In the third line, we call an internal routine named
  <tt>make_bar()</tt>, which turns the NavBar object into a
  properly formatted HTML table.</p>
  <pre>
    $r-&gt;update_mtime;
    $r-&gt;set_last_modified($bar-&gt;modified);
    my $rc = $r-&gt;meets_conditions;
    return $rc unless $rc == OK;
</pre>

  <p>This bit of code represents a useful optimization. In order to
  reduce network usage, most modern browsers temporarily cache the
  files they retrieve on the user's hard disk. Then, in the request
  header, the browser sends the server an HTTP header called
  <tt>If-Modified-Since</tt>, which contains the modification time
  and date of the cached file. In order to avoid an unnecessary
  file transmission, the server should compare the modification
  time specified in the <tt>If-Modified- Since</tt> header to the
  modification time of the file on disk. If the modification time
  of the server's copy is the same as the time specified by the
  browser, then there's no reason to retransmit the document, and
  the server can return an <tt>HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED</tt> status code.
  Otherwise, the server should send the updated file.</p>

  <p>In this case, the logic is a bit more complicated, because the
  contents of the requested document depend on not one but two
  factors: the modification time of the file, and the modification
  time of the navigation bar configuration file. Fortunately,
  Apache has a general mechanism for dealing with these situations.
  We begin calling the request object's <tt>update_mtime()</tt>
  method to copy the requested file's modification time into
  Apache's internal table of outgoing HTTP header fields. Next we
  call <tt>set_last_modified()</tt> with the modification date of
  the navigation bar configuration file. This updates the
  modification time that is sent to the browser, but only if it's
  more recent than the modification time of the requested file. The
  navigation bar's modification date is, conveniently enough,
  returned by the NavBar object's <tt>modified()</tt> method.</p>

  <p>The next line calls the request object's
  <tt>meets_conditions()</tt> method. This checks whether the
  browser made a conditional request using the
  <tt>If-Modified-Since</tt> header field (or any of the
  conditional fetches defined by HTTP/1.1). The method returns OK
  if the document satisfies all the conditions and should be sent
  to the browser, or another result (usually
  <tt>HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED</tt>) otherwise. To implement the
  conditional fetch, we simply check whether the result code is OK.
  If not, we return the status code to Apache and it forwards the
  news on to the browser. Otherwise, we manufacture and transmit
  the page.</p>
  <pre>
my $fh = Apache::File-&gt;new($r-&gt;filename)
                                || return DECLINED;
</pre>

  <p>This next line attempts to open the requested file for
  reading, using the Apache::File class. Apache::File is an
  object-oriented filehandle interface. It is similar to IO::File,
  but has less of an impact on performance and memory footprint.
  The request object's <tt>filename()</tt> method returns the
  physical path to the file. If anything fails at this point, we
  return <tt>DECLINED</tt>, invoking Apache's default handling of
  the request. Otherwise, the filehandle object returned by
  <tt>Apache::File-&gt;new()</tt> is stored in a variable named
  $fh.</p>
  <pre>
$r-&gt;send_http_header;
return OK if $r-&gt;header_only;
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>send_http_header()</tt> method makes Apache send the
  HTTP header off to the browser. This header includes the
  <tt>If-Modified-Since</tt> field set earlier, along with other
  header fields set automatically by Apache. The second line
  represents yet another optimization. If the brower sent a HEAD
  request, then it isn't interested in getting the document body
  and there's no reason for this module to send it. The
  <tt>header_only()</tt> method returns true if the current request
  uses the <tt>HEAD</tt> method. If so, we return OK, telling
  Apache that the request was handled successfully.</p>
  <pre>
local $/ = "";
while (&lt;$fh&gt;) {
    s:(&lt;BODY.*?&gt;):$1$table:soi;
    s:(&lt;/BODY&gt;):$table$1:oi;
} continue {
    $r-&gt;print($_);
}
return OK;
</pre>

  <p>These lines send the document body. We read from the HTML file
  paragraph by paragraph, looking for <tt>&lt;BODY&gt;</tt>
  and<tt>&lt;/BODY&gt;</tt> tags. When we find either, we insert
  the HTML table containing the navigation bar adjacent to it. The
  bar is inserted beneath <tt>&lt;BODY&gt;</tt> and immediately
  above <tt>&lt;/BODY&gt;</tt>. The reason for using paragraph mode
  and a multiline regular expression is to catch the common
  situation in which the <tt>&lt;BODY&gt;</tt> tag is spread across
  several lines. The regular expression isn't guaranteed to catch
  all possible <tt>&lt;BODY&gt;</tt> tags (in particular, it'll
  mess up on tags with an embedded <tt>'&gt;'</tt> symbol), but it
  works for the vast majority of cases.</p>

  <p>We then send the possibly modified text to the browser using
  the request object's <tt>print()</tt> method. After reaching the
  end of the file, we return OK, completing the transaction. Note
  that there is no need to explicitly close the Apache::File
  object. The filehandle is closed automatically when the object
  goes out of scope.</p>

  <p>We now turn our attention to some of the utility functions
  used by this module, starting with <tt>make_bar()</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
sub make_bar {
    my ($r, $bar) = @_;
    # create the navigation bar
my $current_url = $r-&gt;uri;
my @cells;
foreach my $url ($bar-&gt;urls) {
    my $label = $bar-&gt;label($url);
    my $is_current = $current_url =~ /^$url/;
    my $cell = $is_current
? qq(&lt;FONT COLOR="$ACTIVECOLOR"
                  CLASS="active"&gt;$label&lt;/FONT&gt;)
    : qq(&lt;A HREF="$url"
                  CLASS="inactive"&gt;$label&lt;/A&gt;);
    push @cells, qq(&lt;TD CLASS="navbar" ALIGN=CENTER
                  BGCOLOR="$TABLECOLOR"&gt;$cell&lt;/TD&gt;\n);
    }
return qq(&lt;TABLE CLASS="navbar"
        $TABLEATTS&gt;&lt;TR&gt;@cells&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;\n);
}
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>make_bar()</tt> function takes two arguments, the
  request object and the previously-created NavBar object. Its job
  is to create an HTML table that correctly reflects the current
  state of the navigation bar. <tt>make_bar()</tt> begins by
  fetching the current URL, calling the request object's
  <tt>uri()</tt> method. Next, it calls the NavBar object's
  <tt>urls()</tt> method to fetch the list of partial URLs for the
  site's major areas, and iterates over them in a <tt>foreach</tt>
  loop.</p>

  <p>For each URL, the function fetches its human-readable label by
  calling <tt>$bar-&gt;label()</tt> and determines whether the
  current document is part of the area. What happens next depends
  on whether the current document is contained within the area or
  not. If so, the code generates a label enclosed within a
  <tt>&lt;FONT&gt;</tt> tag with the <tt>COLOR</tt> attribute set
  to red and enclosed in a <tt>&lt;B&gt;</tt> tag. In the latter
  case, the code generates a hypertext link. The label or link is
  then pushed onto a growing array of HTML table cells. At the end
  of the loop, the code incorporates the table cells into a one-row
  table, and returns the HTML to the caller.</p>

  <p>The next bit of code defines the <tt>read_configuration()</tt>
  function, which is responsible for parsing the navigation bar
  configuration file and returning a new NavBar object.</p>
  <pre>
# read the navigation bar configuration file and
# return it as a hash.
sub read_configuration {
  my $r = shift;
  return unless my $conf_file = $r-&gt;dir_config('NavConf');
  return unless -e
  ($conf_file=$r-&gt;server_root_relative($conf_file));
  my $mod_time = (stat _)[9];
  return $BARS{$conf_file} if $BARS{$conf_file}
    &amp;&amp; $BARS{$conf_file}-&gt;modified &gt;= $mod_time;
return $BARS{$conf_file} = NavBar-&gt;new($conf_file);
}
</pre>

  <p>The most interesting feature of <tt>read_configuration()</tt>
  is that it caches its results so that the configuration file is
  not reparsed unless it has changed recently. The function begins
  by calling the request object's <tt>dir_config()</tt> method to
  return the value of the directory configuration variable
  <tt>NavConf</tt> (this was previously set in the
  <tt>&lt;Location&gt;</tt> sectin with the <tt>PerlSetVar</tt>
  configuration directive). If no such configuration variable is
  defined, <tt>dir_config()</tt> returns undef and we exit
  immediately.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, we call <tt>server_root_relative()</tt> to turn a
  relative pathname like <tt>etc/navigation.conf</tt> into an
  absolute one like <tt>/usr/local/apache/etc/navigation.conf</tt>.
  We test for the existence of the configuration file using Perl's
  <tt>&ndash;e</tt> switch, and then fetch the file's modification
  time using the <tt>stat()</tt> call. We now test the cached
  version of the configuration file to see if we can still use it
  by comparing the modification time of the configuration file with
  the time returned by the cached copy's <tt>modified()</tt>
  method. We return the cached copy of the navigation bar object if
  it exists and it is still fresh. Otherwise, we invoke the NavBar
  class's <tt>new()</tt> method to create a new object from the
  configuration file, store the returned object in the %BARS object
  cache, and return the object.</p>

  <p>The next bit of code defines the NavBar class, which is really
  just an object-oriented interface to the configuration file.</p>
  <pre>
package NavBar;

# create a new NavBar object
sub new {
    my ($class, $conf_file) = @_;
    my (@c, %c);
    my $fh = Apache::File-&gt;new($conf_file) || return;
    while (&lt;$fh&gt;) {
        chomp;
        next if /^\s*#/; # skip comments
        next unless my($url, $label) = /^(\S+)\s+(.+)/;
        push @c, $url; # keep urls in an array
        $c{$url} = $label; # keep its label in a hash
    }
    return bless { 'urls' =&gt; \@c,
                 'labels' =&gt; \%c,
        'modified' =&gt; (stat $conf_file)[9]}, $class;
}
</pre>

  <p>Following the package declaration, we define the
  <tt>NavBar::new()</tt> method. The method takes two arguments,
  the class name and the path to the configuration file. The method
  begins by opening the configuration file, again using the
  Apache::File utility class to return an open file-handle. The
  code reads from the filehandle line by line, skipping comments
  and blank lines. Otherwise we parse out the section URL and its
  label and store them it into an array and a hash. Both are
  necessary because we need to keep track of both the mapping from
  URL to section label and the order in which to list the sections
  in the navigation bar. When the navigation bar has been
  completely read, the list of section URLs, the labels, and the
  modification time of the configuration file are all stored into a
  new object, which we return to the caller.</p>
  <pre>
# return ordered list of the URLs in the bar
sub urls { return @{shift-&gt;{'urls'}}; }

# return the label for a URL in the navigation bar
sub label { return $_[0]-&gt;{'labels'} || $_[1]; }

# return the modification date of the config file
sub modified { return $_[0]-&gt;{'modified'}; }
</pre>

  <p>The last three subroutines defined in this module are
  accessors for NavBar configuration date. <tt>urls()</tt> returns
  the ordered list of URLs that define the configured main sections
  of the site. <tt>label()</tt> takes a section URL and returns the
  corresponding section label. If no label is configured, it just
  returns the original URL. Finally, <tt>modified()</tt> returns
  the modification time of the configuration file, for use in
  caching.</p>

  <h3>A FOUNDATION TO BUILD ON</h3>

  <p>The navigation bar displayed by this module is spartan in
  appearance because my taste runs to simplicity. However, with a
  little work, it can be made as snazzy as you desire. One of the
  simpler ways to change the appearance of the navigation bar is to
  take advantage of the cascading stylesheet standard. Both the
  navigation bar table and the individual cells are tagged with the
  "navbar" style, which is currently unused. Further, the links
  themselves contain style tags. The links for the active, current
  section are tagged with the style class named "active", while the
  links for the other sections are tagged with "inactive." By
  placing a stylesheet definition in your pages, you can adjust the
  appearance of the table to suit your preferences.</p>

  <p>You might wish to enhance the navigation bar by turning it
  into a column of labels that runs down the left hand side of the
  page. To do this, you'd either have to use frames, or place both
  the navigation bar and the HTML page into a table in two
  side-by-side cells. Or you could replace the links with in-line
  images of buttons or tabs to create a spiffy graphical navigation
  bar. In this case, you'd want two sets of buttons: one for the
  button in unpressed inactive state, and one for its pressed
  active state to indicate that the user is in its corresponding
  section.</p>

  <p>Finally, a nice enhancement would be to add an extra dimension
  to the navigation bar, creating a hierarchical list of sections
  and subsections that expands outward to show more detail when the
  user enters a particular section. That'll put an end to
  navigation bar envy!</p>
