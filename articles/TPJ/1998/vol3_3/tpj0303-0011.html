  <p><b><i>"Because <tt>mod_perl</tt> is, frankly, scarier than a
  typical Apache module."</i></b><br>
  -Jon Udell, <b><i>Byte</i></b> March 1998</p>

  <p>While it may be scarier than most Apache modules, mod_perl is
  also one of the more powerful additions available. In <a href=
  "../vol3_1/ewtoc.html" target="resource window">TPJ #9</a>, Doug
  MacEachern (author of mod_perl) and Lincoln Stein (of CGI.pm
  fame) presented an introduction to mod_perl. This article builds
  on their foundation and demonstrates a full-fledged mod_perl
  application that lets users provide feedback on web
  documentation. I'll also describe some of the performance
  concerns and how your Apache configuration should be modified to
  make the most of mod_perl.</p>

  <h3>SO WHAT IS THIS mod_perl THING ANYHOW?</h3>

  <p>Most people are familiar with CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
  scripts written in Perl that add dynamic content generation to a
  web server. In addition to CGI, most web servers provide some
  sort of interface that allows code to be run inside the server,
  such as NSAPI for Netscape and ISAPI for Microsoft.</p>

  <p>Apache lets you create a chunk of code, called a
  <b><i>handler</i></b>, that is invoked when the server fulfills a
  browser's request. That might happen when a URL is translated
  into a local pathname, or when a child process terminates.( Not
  all handler hooks are available in all versions of Apache. For
  example, the child exit hook mentioned above is only available in
  Apache 1.3 and higher.) mod_perl embeds a Perl interpreter within
  each Apache httpd process, giving you the ability to write
  handlers in Perl instead of C.</p>

  <p>Aside from exposing the Apache module API, mod_perl also
  provides other benefits, such as running existing CGI scripts
  inside the persistent interpreter, and letting you configure
  Apache with Perl code enclosed in
  <tt>&lt;Perl&gt;&lt;/Perl&gt;</tt> and placed in your server
  configuration files. You can do anything from setting the port
  Apache listens for requests on, to configuring virtual hosts
  based on the contents of a database. For more information on
  <tt>&lt;Perl&gt;</tt> configuration, see the online mod_perl.pod
  document bundled with the mod_perl distribution.</p>

  <h3>DEVELOPING WITH mod_perl</h3>

  <p>There are several possible ways you can use mod_perl to speed
  up your web applications, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using Apache::Registry to run existing CGI scripts</li>

    <li>Using Embperl to embed code in HTML pages</li>

    <li>Using Apache.pm directly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each has its own particular strengths and weaknesses.</p>

  <h3>APACHE::REGISTRY</h3>

  <p>If you already have existing CGI scripts written in Perl, the
  Apache::Registry module lets you run them with little (if any)
  changes--but much more quickly because the Perl interpreter is
  already resident in memory. The first time a URI is requested,
  Apache::Registry compiles the CGI script and stores a reference
  to the compiled code. Forever after, the program is run within
  the child httpd process, rather than launching a new Perl process
  each time.</p>

  <p>In essence, Apache::Registry wraps up your entire existing
  script as a subroutine named <tt>handler()</tt> inside a package
  named after the script's name. It then calls this precompiled
  handler whenever the corresponding URL is accessed. If the file
  containing the script changes on disk, Apache::Registry notices
  and recompiles the code.</p>

  <p>This example, modeled after a slide from Doug's Perl
  Conference presentation, shows the code that Apache::Registry
  wraps around a CGI script. The contents of the script are read
  into a string. Everything up until the <tt>local $^W = 1</tt>; is
  prepended by Apache::Registry, and it appends the last }. The
  entire string is then passed to Perl's <tt>eval</tt> function and
  compiled.</p>
  <pre>
package Apache::Root::mp::example_2epl;
&#13;use Apache qw(exit);
&#13;sub handler {
#line 1 /usr/local/apache/mp/example.pl
    local $^W = 1; #!/usr/bin/perl
&#13;    use CGI;
&#13;    my $q = CGI-&gt;new;
    my $them = $q-&gt;remote_host;
&#13;    print $q-&gt;header( 'text/html' ),
      $q-&gt;start_html(-title =&gt; 'My Apache::Registry Example');
&#13;    print &lt;&lt;EOT;
&lt;h1&gt;My Apache::Registry Example&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello browser at $them.&lt;/p&gt;
EOT
&#13;    print $q-&gt;end_html;
}
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>One caveat: Not all CGI scripts run without modifications (for
  example, those with <tt>__DATA__</tt> or <tt>__END__</tt> tokens
  won't run at all). Also, by the time Apache::Registry kicks in,
  several stages of the request (such as user authentication and
  authorization) have already finished. So just as with regular CGI
  scripts, you don't have any way to authenticate or authorize
  users.</p>

  <p>On the positive side, most any web server will have some sort
  of capability to run CGI scripts, making it easy to port to and
  from non-Apache web servers. And since CGI is so widespread,
  programmers can easily leverage their existing web scripting
  knowledge while enjoying the reduced overhead. For more
  information on Apache::Registry, see the file cgi_to_mod_perl.pod
  which comes with mod_perl, or read it on the web at: <a href=
  "http://perl.apache.org/dist/cgi_to_mod_perl.html" target=
  "resource window">http://perl.apache.org/dist/cgi_to_mod_perl.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Also see Lincoln's article on Stately Scripting with mod_perl
  in <a href="../vol3_1/ewtoc.html" target="resource window">TPJ
  #9</a>.</p>

  <h3>EMBPERL</h3>

  <p>In addition to faster CGI service, another popular reason to
  use mod_perl is for fast Embperl processing. This module allows
  Perl code to be embedded within HTML documents, just like the
  standard Apache SSI (Server Side Include) module mod_include. The
  Perl code should appear between one of four delimiters; which
  delimiter you use determines what Embperl does with your
  code.</p>

  <p>[+ <i><b>Perl code</b></i> +]<br>
  Replaces the code with what it evaluates to.</p>

  <p>[- <i><b>Perl code</b></i> -]<br>
  Executes the Perl code invisibly.</p>

  <p>[! <i><b>Perl Code</b></i> !]<br>
  Same as [- Perl Code -], but the code is only executed the first
  time it's encountered. This is used to define subroutines and
  perform one-time initialization.</p>

  <p>[$ <i><b>Command Arg</b></i> $]<br>
  Executes an Embperl metacommand. The commands (e.g. if and while)
  are listed in the Embperl documentation.</p>

  <p>Embperl also understands HTML and is capable of dynamically
  generating tables, lists, and form selection buttons. Here's an
  example taken from the Embperl manual page that prints the
  contents of the environment:</p>
  <pre>
<b>[- @k = keys %ENV -]</b>
&lt;TABLE&gt;
    &lt;TR&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;<b>[+ $i=$row +]</b>&lt;/TD&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;<b>[+ $k[$row] +]</b>&lt;/TD&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;<b>[+ $ENV{$k[$i]} +]</b>&lt;/TD&gt;
    &lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The first line sets <tt>@k</tt> to the names of the
  environment variables and produces no output; that's why the
  minus signs are used as delimiters. Embperl then parses the table
  and looks for use of any of three special variables:
  <tt>$row</tt>, <tt>$col</tt>, or <tt>$cnt</tt>. If none are found
  in the table it is passed through with no modification. If they
  are used, Embperl repeats the text between
  <tt>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</tt> as many times as there are
  elements in <tt>@k</tt>.</p>

  <p>As with Apache::Registry, Embperl processes pages only after
  many other stages of the request have finished. Code is compiled
  once and cached, giving much better performance over other
  similar embedded constructs such as <tt>mod_include</tt>.</p>

  <h3>WRITING YOUR OWN HANDLER</h3>

  <p>The last alternative is writing your own request handler
  directly, using Apache.pm to access the Apache API. Under the
  hood, this is exactly what Apache::Registry and Embperl do. You
  can create handlers for each step that Apache takes to respond to
  a request. Handlers can be used to provide access control, to
  rewrite incoming URLs, or to implement custom logging, such as
  logging to a database system instead of a log file. Apache.pm
  lets you do everything in Perl that you can do in C.</p>
  <pre>
package MyHandler;
&#13;use Apache::Constants qw(:common);
&#13;sub handler {
    # $r contains Apache request object
    my $r = shift;
    # $them is the client's hostname or IP
    my $them = $r-&gt;get_remote_host;
&#13;   $r-&gt;content_type( "text/html" );
   $r-&gt;send_http_header;
&#13;    print qq{
      &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;My First Handler&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body bgcolor="#ffffff"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;My First Apache Handler&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hello to the browser at $them.&lt;/p&gt;
	  
      &lt;p&gt;Here are the headers your browser sent me:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;
};
&#13;    my %headers = $r-&gt;headers_in;
    foreach ( sort keys %headers ) {
        $r-&gt;print( "$_: $headers{$_}\n" );
    }
&#13;    print qq{
       &lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
	  
};
&#13;    return OK;
&#13;}
&#13;1;
&#13;
</pre>

  <p>Now you have direct access to the entire Apache API. In
  contrast, CGI and HTML::Embperl pages are limited to executing
  during the content generation phase, while handler routines can
  run at any of the fourteen different stages. However, if you
  aren't familiar with the Apache API, you might find writing your
  own handlers a bit daunting since it requires detailed knowledge
  of how Apache handles requests. For generating simple dynamic
  pages, Apache::Registry/CGI and Embperl perform admirably.</p>

  <h3>PERFORMANCE</h3>

  <p>While mod_perl is a great improvement over vanilla CGI, you
  should be aware of some of the issues involved in squeezing the
  most efficiency from it. If you're just running a small web
  application on its own dedicated machine used inside your company
  by twenty people, you might not be that concerned. But if your
  site is intended for a large audience you need to be aware of
  these issues.</p>

  <p><b>Preload your modules.</b> One of the biggest items to be
  aware of is the fact that each Apache process with mod_perl
  requires more memory than one without mod_perl. This can cause
  performance to suffer if your system runs out of physical memory
  and needs to swap out to disk. This <tt>PerlModule</tt>
  configuration directive can help; it causes mod_perl to load the
  named module (or modules) at server startup:</p>
  <pre>
PerlModule CGI Apache::Registry MyFavoriteModule
</pre>

  <p>Preloading modules that will be used by your scripts improves
  the performance of requests and reduces the amount of memory
  needed, since the memory can be shared between all the processes.
  (Whether this actually buys you anything depends on how your
  operating system handles shared memory between spawned
  processes.) While modifying Perl modules used by your
  application, you might want to set <tt>PerlFreshRestart On</tt>
  in one of your server configuration files (e.g.
  <tt>httpd.conf</tt>). Otherwise, Apache won't know to reload your
  Perl modules when it next restarts, and you won't see any changes
  you have made.</p>

  <p><b>Use multiple servers.</b> Another performance enhancement
  is to run multiple servers. You can run servers on different
  ports on the same machine, or on different machines entirely. One
  server can have mod_perl installed for all content requiring it,
  and another without mod_perl for static content such as images.
  With the Apache mod_proxy module or Squid (an HTTP cache/ proxy
  program) you can make the multiple servers appear as one.</p>

  <p>For a more thorough discussion of tweaking mod_perl to get the
  most performance from it, see the mod_perl_tuning.pod document
  bundled with the mod_perl distribution. Information on
  configuration directives such as <tt>PerlModule</tt> can be found
  in the mod_perl.pod online documentation.</p>

  <h3>OUR SAMPLE APPLICATION</h3>

  <p>To demonstrate how to use mod_perl to create applications,
  we'll develop a site which provides documentation (such as FAQs,
  tech notes, and white papers) to customers, and accept feedback
  on which documents are the most helpful and most used. The idea
  comes from a paper presented at last year's Perl Conference by
  Dav Amann of Netscape on the customer support site they developed
  using Perl. The site (<a href="http://help.netscape.com/" target=
  "resource window">http://help.netscape.com/</a>) allows customers
  quick access to the most frequently requested tech notes, and
  allows customers to give feedback on the documents to Netscape
  (both a simple yes-or-no "This document answered my question" as
  well as a more detailed questionnaire). A sample is shown in
  Figure 1.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/fletcher-fig1.gif"><img src=
  "images/fletcher-fig1_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 1: A footer added to every document by Apache::Sandwich."
  border="0" width="250" height="97"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> A footer added
  to every document by Apache::Sandwich.</font></p>

  <p>Our sample application will manage a document tree, provide a
  count of the number of hits for each document within the tree,
  and allow readers to rate each document from 1 to 5. Our
  application will use a little bit of all three approaches: CGI
  scripts, Embperl pages, and Apache handlers.</p>

  <p>A handler routine will be used during the
  <tt>PerlTransHandler</tt> stage so that we can map URIs to
  filenames based on a database. This <b><i>translation
  handler</i></b> will also arrange for another handler to be
  called during the log phase to update the hit counts in the
  database for each file. An Embperl document will be used to
  dynamically generate an index of the most frequently accessed
  documents based on the contents of the database. Finally, two CGI
  scripts will be used to record user feedback and manage adding
  and removing files. In addition to the modules we develop, we'll
  be using several existing Perl modules to handle access control
  and adding footers to pages.</p>

  <h3>COMPONENTS</h3>

  <p>There are many Perl modules available for use with mod_perl
  and Apache; a complete list of Apache specific modules is
  available at: <a href=
  "http://perl.apache.org/src/apache-modlist.html" target=
  "resource window">http://perl.apache.org/src/apache-modlist.html</a>.
  All modules should also be available from your favorite CPAN
  mirror. A quick introduction to the modules used in the sample
  application follows. Here, we use five modules: DBI, Apache::DBI,
  Apache::AuthenDBI, Apache::AuthzDBI, and Apache::Sandwich.</p>

  <h3>DBI AND APACHE::DBI</h3>

  <p>DBI is a Perl module that provides a consistent method of
  accessing most any relational database system from Perl. You use
  the same Perl methods regardless of which database you're using.
  Different database driver modules (DBDs) handle the
  database-specific API so you don't have to.</p>

  <p>Apache::DBI improves the performance of DBI by caching
  database connections. Opening a connection to a database often
  takes a lot of time, so Apache::DBI maintains a cache of open
  database handles. As long as Apache::DBI is loaded before the DBI
  module, all connect requests will be handled by Apache::DBI. One
  limitation of the cache: You cannot create database connections
  in the parent Apache process and have them shared by child
  processes.</p>

  <p>For developing the sample application I used the freely
  available Postgresql: (<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/"
  target="resource window">http://www.postgresql.org/</a>) and its
  driver, DBD::Pg.However, any database for which you have the
  proper DBD::module installed should work. Postgresql is an SQL
  database; if you aren't familiar with SQL, an excellent tutorial
  is available at: <a href="http://w3.one.net/~jhoffman/sqltut.htm"
  target=
  "resource window">http://w3.one.net/~jhoffman/sqltut.htm</a>.</p>

  <h3>APACHE::AUTHENDBI AND<br>
  APACHE::AUTHZDBI</h3>

  <p>These two modules allow you to store authentication (i.e.
  usernames and passwords) and authorization (e.g. group
  membership) information in a database accessed via DBI. To use
  these modules, you must have enabled the appropriate Perl
  handlers when you built mod_perl. See the Apache::AuthenDBI
  documentation for the required handlers, and the <tt>INSTALL</tt>
  file in the mod_perl distribution to learn how to enable handlers
  at build time.</p>

  <h3>APACHE::SANDWICH</h3>

  <p>This module allows you to "sandwich" a page's contents between
  a header and footer without modifying the page's source. Apache
  sends the headers, then the contents of the requested URI, and
  finally the footers. We'll use this module to append an HTML form
  that lets users provide feedback on the usefulness of the
  documents. Thanks to Apache::Sandwich, we won't have to modify
  any of our documents to add these footers.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <h3>WRITING THE APPLICATION</h3>
  </div>

  <h3>THE CODE</h3>

  <p><b>Database Setup.</b> The first task is to create the tables
  in our database. The <tt>documents</tt> table keeps track of the
  title and number of hits for each file being tracked. The
  <tt>rating</tt> and <tt>raters</tt> fields are used to calculate
  the average rating given to the document by readers. Several
  indices are created to maintain unique entries and to speed up
  queries. The other table, <tt>users</tt>, maintains username and
  password information for Apache::AuthenDBI. In this case,
  Apache::AuthenDBI is probably overkill for the minuscule number
  of users we'll be concerned with, but we'll stick with it for
  instructional purposes.</p>

  <p>In addition to creating the tables, you'll probably want to
  create a user account for use by Apache; we'll use
  <tt>ap_auth</tt> in the examples that follow.</p>

  <p><b>TopTenTrans.pm.</b> Our application uses a PerlTransHandler
  to customize the mapping of URIs to filenames. A translation
  handler can change the default mapping of URIs to filenames.
  Similar to Apache's <tt>&lt;Alias&gt;</tt> configuration
  directive, the TopTenTrans::handler subroutine modifies the
  filename to which URIs with a specified prefix resolve.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/fletcher-fig2.gif"><img src=
  "images/fletcher-fig2_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 2: An Embperl-generated table." border="0" width="250"
  height="92"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2:</b> An
  Embperl-generated table.</font></p>

  <p>The translation handler also allows us to map URIs based on
  the database contents. For example, the fifth most useful
  document will be accessible as http://server/topten/5. The
  handler connects to the database and retrieves the corresponding
  record, and then sets the filename accordingly. Later stages will
  use this information to return the contents of the request.</p>

  <p>The translation handler requests that Apache let mod_perl
  handle the content generation phase of the request, and that
  mod_perl should use Apache::Sandwich as the PerlHandler to
  generate the content. This is the runtime equivalent of placing
  these lines in the access.conf:</p>
  <pre>
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::Sandwich
</pre>

  <p>Lastly, the handler arranges for a subroutine to be called
  during the logging phase of the request (after the page has been
  sent) using <tt>Apache::push_handlers()</tt>, which allows a Perl
  handler to specify which handlers should be called during later
  phases. The <tt>TopTenTrans::log_hit()</tt> subroutine increments
  the hits field in the database record for the corresponding
  file.</p>

  <p>This facility is often useful if you have a long-running task
  but don't want to delay sending a response back to the client
  until it is complete. On an extremely busy site, the overhead of
  updating the hit count for each file immediately might be too
  much of a load; one possible solution is to keep the statistics
  in memory using the IPC::Shareable module and then periodically
  send the statistics to the database using a log handler
  subroutine. <a href=
  "tpj0303-0011a.html"><b>index.epl</b></a><b>.</b> The next
  component is the <b><i>document index</i></b>, which can list all
  tracked documents or just the top ten. This is implemented using
  Embperl to generate the listing on the fly. Why use Embperl?
  Because the index page is just a table, which is a snap to create
  with Embperl's dynamic table generation facilities.</p>

  <p>Depending on whether it is called with a query string of all
  (that is, http://server/topten?all versus http://server/ topten),
  the embedded code pulls the appropriate information from the
  database and stores it in an array reference. Embperl's dynamic
  table generation creates an HTML table listing the rank, title,
  hits, and rating for each document.</p>

  <p><b>rateit.</b> The Apache::Sandwich routine appends a file,
  rate.html, to each document which contains a form the user can
  use to rate how useful they found the document. The results will
  be processed by a CGI script called <i><b>rateit</b></i> that
  computes the new rating.</p>

  <p>There isn't anything mod_perl specific about
  <b><i>rateit</i></b>, so we won't go into much detail about it.
  If the user didn't select a rating, the script asks them to use
  the back button and select one. If they did check one of the
  boxes, the script retrieves the current rating and the number of
  people who have submitted ratings from the database, uses these
  values to calculate the new rating, and updates the database with
  the new information. The script then prints a message with the
  user's choice, the new rating, and links back to the document and
  Top Ten index.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/fletcher-fig3.gif"><img src=
  "images/fletcher-fig3_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 3: The ttadmin CGI script uses DBI to modify the document repository."
  border="0" width="250" height="192"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 3:</b> The ttadmin
  CGI script uses DBI to modify the document repository.</font></p>

  <p><b>ttadmin.</b> The last component we need is some method of
  administering documents. The <b><i>ttadmin</i></b> script
  provides a means of adding new files to the repository, zeroing
  the hit count for a file, and deleting a file from the
  repository. When called with no parameters, it returns a page
  with three forms on it: one to let the user specify a file to
  upload; another form get a page from which to choose a file to
  zero the hit counter for; and one to retrieve a listing so that
  the files can be deleted from the repository. Like
  <b><i>rateit</i></b>, <b><i>ttadmin</i></b> is pretty much a
  vanilla CGI script. The section that adds a file simply copies
  the uploaded file into the Top Ten root directory and adds the
  appropriate information to the database. The counter zeroing and
  deletion routines use the <tt>list_all_files()</tt> subroutine to
  generate a table listing all of the entries from the database if
  called with out the <tt>victimfile</tt> query parameter being
  set. If the parameter is set, the appropriate changes are made to
  the database.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0303-0010a.html">index.epl</a></p>

  <h3>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</h3>

  <p>Now that the code has been written, you'll need to place all
  of the components in the correct locations and let Apache and
  mod_perl know where to find them. In the configurations below, I
  have Apache installed in /usr/local/apache and the Top Ten root
  directory is located in /home/fletch/topten. The Top Ten
  repository appears under the URI http://servername/topten/. Your
  copy of mod_perl should have been compiled with at least
  <tt>PERL_TRANS, PERL_AUTHEN, PERL_CLEANUP, PERL_STACKED_HANDLERS,
  PERL_SECTIONS</tt>, and <tt>PERL_SSI</tt> enabled. See the
  <tt>INSTALL</tt> file that comes with mod_perl for more
  information.</p>

  <p><b>httpd.conf.</b> The following directives should go in your
  server configuration (httpd.conf) file. The first line tells
  mod_perl to force a reload of modules when Apache is restarted.
  The <tt>&lt;Perl&gt;&lt;/Perl&gt;</tt> section is Perl code to be
  executed by Apache at server startup. In this case, all does is
  add the directory containing the handler modules to Perl's
  library search path. The TopTenTrans.pm file should be located in
  this directory. The last line instructs mod_perl that the three
  modules listed should be loaded by the server at startup
  time.</p>
  <pre>
PerlFreshRestart on
&#13;&lt;Perl&gt;
use lib qw(/usr/local/apache/lib);
&lt;/Perl&gt;
&#13;PerlModule Apache::DBI Apache::AuthenDBI HTML::Embperl
</pre>

  <p><b>srm.conf.</b> Two lines need to be added to srm.conf. The
  first two lines create aliases in the server's document tree to
  the directories where our Apache::Registry CGI scripts reside
  (one which will not be password protected, the other which is).
  The third line tells the server that the output generated by
  Embperl files should be given a MIME content type of
  text/html.</p>
  <pre>
Alias /perl/ /usr/local/apache/perl/
Alias /protected/ /usr/local/apache/protected/
AddType text/html .epl
</pre>

  <p><b>access.conf.</b> The last configuration file that needs to
  be modified is access.conf. The first group of lines (in between
  the <tt>&lt;Files&gt;</tt> directives) tells Apache to allow
  mod_perl to handle any files which end in .epl. The actual Perl
  handler which will be called is the
  <tt>HTML::Embperl::handler()</tt> subroutine, defined by
  Embperl.</p>

  <p>The <tt>&lt;Location /perl&gt;</tt> section arranges for
  scripts in /usr/local/apache/perl to be run under
  Apache::Registry. It also specifies several environment variables
  which should be set in <tt>%ENV</tt> for the scripts.</p>

  <p>The next set of directives sets up the authentication for any
  URLs beginning with <tt>/protected</tt>. The first lines in this
  section make Apache call Apache::Registry to handle requests. The
  various <tt>PerlSetVar</tt> commands set configuration data for
  the AuthenDBI handler, such as the DBI data source and table
  containing user/password information, and what field names to use
  from that table.</p>

  <p>The last variable controls whether AuthenDBI uses the
  <tt>crypt()</tt> routine to encrypt the password before comparing
  it against the value from the database. For development it is
  easier to leave this turned off to facilitate adding users by
  hand, but in most cases you should never store the plaintext of
  passwords. It's just asking for trouble.</p>

  <p>The final set of directives set up the TopTenTrans and
  Apache::Sandwich modules. The PerlSetVar lines specify the
  location of our feedback footer, what database to connect to,
  where the tracked documents reside in the filesystem, and what
  document to use for the index page.</p>

  <i>Mike Fletcher works for Internet Security Systems. He lives in
  Atlanta with his wife Cathy, dog Phydeaux, and far too many

  has been expressed either way by the dog). Fletch once wrote
  several chapters about Java for three editions of Java Unleashed
  (ISBN 1-57521-298-6; look for it in fine remainder bins
