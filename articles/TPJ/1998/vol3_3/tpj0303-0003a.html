              <p><font color="#000000">Some of the techniques used
              in the text might not be obvious to new Perl
              converts. The three boxes in this article explain
              some of the ones which might most baffle newcomers.
              The techniques introduced here are by no means
              obscure hacks-they are well-documented and stable
              features of Perl that you can rely on in the future.
              It's just that they are unexpectedly practical for
              people who are used to other languages where there is
              only one way of doing things.</font></p>

              <p><font color="#000000">Because Perl is so dynamic,
              you can do many things while your program is running
              (run-time) as opposed to when the Perl compiler is
              reading your program (compile-time). The parser takes
              advantage of this, letting you choose classes on the
              fly. Consider this program:</font></p>
              <pre>
<font color=
"#000000">package A; sub foo {print "You called the sub A::foo\n"}
package B; sub foo {print "The routine B::foo was called\n"}
package main; $ARGV[0]-&gt;foo();
</font>
</pre>

              <p>There are two <tt>foo()</tt> methods here; which
              one is called depends on what argument (<tt>A</tt> or
              <tt>B</tt>) you provide on the command line. Even
              though this little program doesn't explicitly pass
              any parameters to <tt>foo()</tt>, Perl adds one for
              you: all subroutines called in this manner receive is
              the name of the caller's package as the first
              parameter. This might seem silly - after all, we know
              which package the function is in - but there is
              actually a very good use for this: inheritance.</p>
              <pre>
package A; sub foo {print "You called A::foo through package $_[0]\n"}
package B; @ISA = ('A');
package C; @ISA = ('A');
package main; $ARGV[0]-&gt;foo();
</pre>

              <p>In this case, the subroutine <tt>A::foo</tt> is
              invoked on any call to <tt>A::foo</tt>,
              <tt>B::foo</tt>, or <tt>C::foo</tt>. But because of
              that first parameter, it knows where it was called
              from, and can operate differently if necessary. This
              might again seem pointless-why don't we just call
              <tt>A::foo</tt> with that argument in the first
              place? Again, there is a reason for doing it like
              this. Suppose that <tt>A::foo</tt> implements the
              same things as<tt>B::foo</tt>, but in a slower and
              more general fashion. In this case, we can first
              prototype the system with code like the above and
              later replace <tt>B::foo</tt> with something quick
              and specific. The advantage is that we won't have to
              change any other code. If we had hardcoded
              <tt>A::foo</tt> with the parameter, we would now have
              to either change the calls or make <tt>A::foo</tt>
              more complicated. (This is exactly what happened with
              the FreeWRL code for multiple-valued fields.)</p>

              <p>Of course, it is possible to achieve similar
              things in C++, or Java (using inheritance), or C
              (using function pointers). However, in Perl the
              packages do not need to be related in any way before
              runtime (Java can do that too, but only in a more
              complicated way). See the <b><i>perlmod</i></b> and
              <b><i>perlobj</i></b> documentation for more detail.
