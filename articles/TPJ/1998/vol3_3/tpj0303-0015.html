  <p>Oh, you shameless, malign bastards.</p>

  <p>Coming so soon after Orwant's cortex reconstruction therapy
  and my own first hesitant touch of a keyboard in months, the new
  brace of Obfuscated Perl Contest entries can only be taken as an
  unprovoked attack by a band of malicious sociopaths.</p>

  <p>And it gets worse - most of the entries were submitted by new
  entrants. While this meant that some of the new players made
  first-timer mistakes, it also raises the spectre of an unending
  flow of new Obfuscated Perl programmers. As a result, we have
  gone into hiding from the UN War Crimes Tribunal. Humanity, we
  pray forgiveness!</p>

  <p>But! We must judge on; we are, after all, professionals.
  Drawing on the lessons of the past, the judging team came up with
  brand new software for this round. Combined with the hard-won
  experience of the judges, this made this contest the most
  difficult and incisively-analyzed match in its history. And also
  the most brutal; when a Russian software munition formatted
  lovingly in the shape of a leaping dolphin doesn't place, it's a
  sign that the competition is <b><i>fierce</i></b>.</p>

  <p>Many entries fell immediately to critical study and our
  gleaming machine. Here are the ones which survived and won. We
  strongly recommend that you check them out; many teach valuable
  lessons useful even for production code!</p>

  <h3>CATEGORY 1: MOST POWERFUL</h3>

  <p><b>Third Place.</b> Tomas Rokicki and his implementation of a
  fast 20x80 version of Conway's Game of life.</p>

  <p><b>Second Place.</b> Kevin Miller, whose program is a nicely
  obfuscated graphing calculator that plots arbitrary one-variable
  functions in ASCII.</p>

  <p><b>First Place.</b> Clifford Adams, whose Pure Perl
  implementation of two software munitions is jam packed into 5
  (five) lines, including some breathtaking space-savers. One fears
  what he would have done with six. Added bonus: his patented
  Algorithmic Key Recovery System for RSA in the SOLUTION file.
  Capital.</p>

  <p><b>Dishonorable mention.</b> Dave Hartnoll's entry generates a
  very nice calendar; Dean Inada's parenthesis balancer is cute;
  and Vipul Ved Prakash's dolphin-shaped Russian cipher was barely
  squeaked out (you see, the new minimum requirement is two
  ciphers).</p>

  <h3>CATEGORY 2: MOST CREATIVE</h3>

  <p>Halfway through the submission period, only two entries had
  been submitted! But the celebratory champagne went flat and the
  canapes congealed in our throats as these entries appeared in the
  download directory. Clearly the contestants had been timing their
  blows for maximum &lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;shock
  value.</p>

  <p><b>Third Place.</b> Mark James claims third place with the
  last entry that builds on the work of James Conway that will ever
  be accepted - a factoring program nicely (and obfuscatorily)
  formatted in the shape of &nbsp;<img src="images/pie.gif" width=
  "10" height="10" border="0" alt="">.</p>

  <p><b>Second Place.</b> Cayce Ullman, whose entry not only
  decodes Morse Code, but The 3 rd Annual Obfuscated Perl Contest
  Victors is partially written in Morse Code. Cayce, we want you to
  know that there's help available for people like you.</p>

  <p><b>First Place.</b> Stephane Payrard's Polyominos - fitting
  problem solver is very beautiful - eclipsed only by the
  entertaining reading available in the SOLUTION file. Perhaps it's
  fitting that such a powerful obfuscatory statement comes from the
  land that bred semiotics, deconstructionism and Jean-Paul Sartre.
  Or maybe Stephane is just demented.</p>

  <p><b>Dishonorable mention.</b> James Shute, who had us stumped
  until we realized he was cleverly bending the rules; and Stijn
  van Dongen, whose entry was fun, but unfortunately over the
  character limit.</p>

  <h3>CATEGORY 3: BEST 'THE PERL JOURNAL'</h3>

  <p>The awesome might of our AI was unleashed on these contestants
  without mercy. And they fell; oh yes, they fell. Only a few
  entries of the original 18 required extensive human study. A
  great many tried to flaunt the whitespace rule and were
  disqualified for being obvious. Here, then, are the cockroaches
  of the category: the hardy, repulsive survivors.</p>

  <p><b>Third Place.</b> (Tie.) Cameron Kaiser, for an old-sk00l
  ASCII art entry with many layers of chaff; and Jeff Pinyan, whose
  exhaustive exploration of the asterisk was particularly
  grotesque.</p>

  <p><b>Second Place.</b> (Tie.) Ken Rich, man of many quality
  entries, whose first entry was visually splendid; and Dan
  Rinehart, whose storytelling entry uses copious errors to
  work.</p>

  <p><b>First Place.</b> Jani Joki's brain bending style, the
  implementation of brute forcecracking of an 8-bit Feistel Network
  encryption algorithm and multiple misdirections caused our
  brains, organic and silicon, to dribble out our noses. We can't
  believe Jani didn't post this from a mental ward.</p>

  <p><b>Dishonorable mention.</b> Bill Wendling, Kevin Meltzer, and
  Poul Sorensen, all of whom had excellent flair but could not hide
  from our automaton's unblinking eye. Be sure to check out Shawn
  Wallace's scintillating output - too bad he fell for the overused
  whitespace trap.</p>

  <h3>BEST OF SHOW</h3>

  <p>Jani Joki wrests away the Obfuscated Perl Best of Show award,
  won last time by the Americans, and returns it triumphantly to
  Europe. Can it be? Can Europeans really be so much better at
  writing disgusting Perl code than Americans? Is it something in
  the water? If so, does the CDC know? Will the proud citizens of
  the United States rally in the face of Euro-domination? Stay
  tuned for the next round of ...</p>

  <p>THE OBFUSCATED PERL CONTEST</p>

  <p>Our nurses are telling us computer time is over. So, for the
  judges, see you next time!</p>
