  <p>What is good coding practice? What is readable code? For some
  programmers, these questions lead to heated arguments. In the
  relatively young field of programming, it's natural that
  generally accepted rules of style and usage haven't yet emerged.
  Fortunately, our colleagues in the more mature field of philology
  (the study of language as used in literature) have set examples
  that we can follow. In this article, I'll describe Fathom, a
  module that grades the readability of Perl programs.</p>

  <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>

  <p>You may have experience with the grammar check feature of some
  word processors, which finds likely spelling, grammar, and usage
  errors in your documents. These tools can be quite useful,
  particularly for people who don't do much writing, or for people
  who haven't had much writing instruction.</p>

  <p>As a programmer who works mostly in teams, often training new
  or junior programmers <b><i>during</i></b> time-critical
  projects, I want automated ways to encourage compliance with team
  coding standards. I know that such tools can (and do) work for
  business writing, but I've been unable to find a tool that would
  do the job for business coding. I did some investigation to see
  if any of the available grammar checkers could be adapted for use
  with program code.</p>

  <h3>EXISTING MEASURES</h3>

  <p>There are many well-known measures of readability in
  literature. You may have heard of Flesch-Kincaid, FOG, SMOG,
  Bormuth, or other readability or grade level tests; Microsoft
  Word uses three Flesch tools to evaluate style. These tests
  generally look at the average number of syllables per word and
  the average number of words per sentence, then report a single
  number which indi-cates either the grade level (1--12) or
  readability (usually 1-100) of the document. As an example, the
  Flesch-Kincaid formula for determining the grade level of a
  document is:</p>
  <pre>
((average sentence length in words) * 0.39)
+ ((average syllables per word) * 11.8)
- 15.59
</pre>

  <p>Unfortunately, these measures don't map well onto code; for
  example, how many syllables are there in <tt>++</tt> or { or
  <tt>$_?</tt> Is select easier to read than
  <tt>gethostbyname</tt>?</p>

  <p>Once I realized that I wouldn't be able to simply run one of
  the prose-readability tests on my code and get meaningful
  results, I began to study the design and function of those tests.
  Then, I constructed a working model for code readability.</p>

  <h3>THE BASIC UNITS</h3>

  <p>After thinking about tools like Flesch-Kincaid, and discussing
  the idea of a readability tool with colleagues, I came up with a
  basic model for a code readability metric. I decided to measure
  the number of tokens per expression, the number of expressions
  per statement, and the number of statements per subroutine.</p>

  <p>Some sample tokens:</p>
  <pre>
++
$foo::bar
;
{
&amp;&amp;
<i>any keyword</i>
</pre>

  <p>Sample expressions:</p>
  <pre>
0.2
($a + 6)
wantarray ? @a : 0
</pre>

  <p>Sample statements:</p>
  <pre>
$a = $foo::bar * 7;
$x++;
</pre>

  <h3>THE TOOL</h3>

  <p>Given the basic model I've described, I wrote a module,
  <tt>Fathom.pm</tt>, that grades the readability of a Perl
  program. It rates on an open-ended scale, where 1 indicates a
  trivial program, 5 indicates "mature" code, 7 indicates very
  sophisticated code, and anything over 7 is Very Hairy. I
  established the following norms for mature code:</p>
  <pre>
3 tokens per expression
6 expressions per statement
20 statements per subroutine
</pre>

  <p>From this, I came up with the formula on the next page.</p>
  <pre>
code complexity =
  ((average expression length in tokens) * 0.55)
+ ((average statement length in expressions) * 0.28)
+ ((average subroutine length in statements) * 0.08)
</pre>

  <p>If you plug the norms (3, 6, 20) into this formula, you'll see
  that ideal mature code actually gets a score of 4.93; that's
  because I rounded all the multipliers to 2 decimal digits, to
  keep things simple.</p>

  <h3>USAGE</h3>

  <p>First, you'll need to install <tt>Fathom</tt>. You can find it
  on CPAN, under authors/id/K/KS/KSTAR.</p>

  <p>After installing <tt>Fathom</tt>, you can invoke it as
  follows:</p>
  <pre>
perl -MO=Fathom filename
</pre>

  <p>The output looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
315 tokens
97 expressions
17 statements
1 subroutine
readability is 4.74 (easier than the norm)
</pre>

  <h3>WHY THIS WOULD BE A HARD PROBLEM</h3>

  <p>Perl is an unusual programming language, in that it has
  <b><i>dynamic syntax</i></b>; that is, any programmer can write
  code that extends or changes the syntax of Perl. Consider the
  following code:</p>
  <pre>
use Mystery;
 if (mystery /1/ . . .
 
</pre>

  <p>You can't parse this without knowing about
  <tt>Mystery.pm</tt>! Let's consider two different versions of
  <tt>Mystery.pm</tt>.</p>

  <p>Version 1:</p>
  <pre>
package Mystery;
sub main::mystery { return 5; }
1;
</pre>

  <p>Version 2:</p>
  <pre>
package Mystery;
sub main::mystery() { return 5; }
1;
</pre>

  <p>These two packages are almost trivially different. They both
  define one function, named <tt>mystery()</tt>, which returns the
  value 5. However, the second version uses a prototype. In the
  first case, our program parses as:</p>

  <p>if (<tt>mystery</tt>(<i>the results of matching the regular
  expression</i> /1/ ...</p>

  <p>In the second case, it parses as:</p>

  <p>if (<tt>mystery()</tt> divided by <tt>1</tt> divided by
  ...</p>

  <p>By the time you've written a program which can successfully
  parse every possible case, you've rewritten Perl!</p>

  <h3>THE PERL COMPILER TO THE RESCUE</h3>

  <p>Fortunately, Malcolm Beattie's Perl compiler gives us access
  to the pertinent guts of Perl. Without the compiler, this project
  would have been prohibitively difficult.</p>

  <h3>EXAMPLES</h3>

diagnostics.pm
767 tokens
272 expressions
96 statements
1 subroutine
readability is 10.02 (obfuscated)
</pre>

  <h3>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h3>

  <p>I intend to continue to refine <tt>Fathom.pm</tt> in several
  ways: by tweaking its basic formula to produce more accurate
  grades, by considering the placement and length of comments and
  PODs, by having it identify problematic code sections, and by
  having it make specific suggestions for improvement.</p>

  <p>There are also some problems which I hope to address in the
  near future: <tt>Fathom</tt> doesn't see code which executes at
  compile time, such as code in <tt>BEGIN</tt> blocks or use
  statements; and sometimes it counts implicit tokens, such as
  <tt>$_</tt> in a <tt>foreach</tt> statement. These limitations
  probably won't make much statistical difference in a
  medium-to-large program, but they could give wildly strange
  grades to one-liners and other short hacks.</p>

  <p><tt>Fathom</tt> also opens the door to a whole suite of
  companion tools: a program which checks variable names against a
  site-wide naming policy; a tool, much like C's <tt>indent</tt>,
  to normalize the indentation of Perl code; and likely several
  more tools, based on experience and feedback. Some of these are
  already being developed by others.</p>

  <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>

  <p>Perl's extraordinary architecture makes it possible to produce
  very powerful companion tools without having to re-invent the
  wheel. Fathom was developed with a relatively small amount of
  original code&mdash;it simply hooks into the pre-existing Perl
  internal data structures to do its job. Similarly, the Perl
  debugger uses built-in features of Perl, plus a minimal amount of
  black magic, to provide a full-featured debugging environment for
  your Perl programs.</p>

  <p>In most other languages, writing a tool like <tt>Fathom</tt>
  would force you to start from scratch, since some of the best
  tools for other languages (e.g., <tt>gdb</tt>, <tt>indent</tt>,
  and <tt>cxref</tt> for C) are based on code which is completely
  independent from the compilers or interpreters which they
  complement. In the case of languages which are still undergoing
  refinement (such as C++), maintenance of these tools can be a
  nightmare. However, <tt>Fathom</tt> will continue to work even if
  Perl's syntax changes, because it's hooked into the Perl compiler
  itself!</p>

  <p>I hope that you're so intrigued by <tt>Fathom</tt> that you'll
  want to refine it, rewrite it, or develop new tools in a similar
  vein. Try this at home, kids!</p>

  <h3>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h3>

  <p><tt>Fathom</tt> would not have been possible without Malcolm
  Beattie's outstanding work on the Perl compiler. Stephen
  McCamant's <tt>B::Deparse</tt> module was tremendously helpful in
  demonstrating how to write a compiler backend. And, of course, I
  couldn't have done any of this without such a rich language as
  Perl.</p>
