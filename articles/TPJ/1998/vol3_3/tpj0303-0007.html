  <font size="+2">P</font>erl 5.005 is no longer in beta. The most
  recent version is Perl 5.005_02, available on the CPAN.

  <p>The O'Reilly Perl Conference 2.0 took place August 17&ndash;20
  in the San Jose Fairmont hotel. It was better attended (over 1200
  attendees) and had more material for seasoned Perl programmers
  than last year. There were three parallel tracks: Applied Perl,
  User Applications, and Perl and Apache.</p>

  <p>There's too much to say about the conference; I recommend
  Vicki Brown's SunWorld summary at
  http://www.sun-world.com/swol-09-1998/swol-09-perlconf.html.</p>

  <p>Larry Wall gave another well-received State of the Onion
  speech, talking about complexity, natural language, Unicode, and
  onion rings.</p>

  <p>People seemed to like my possibly-annual Perl Quiz Show. The
  1998 champions: Graham Barr, Brand Hilton, and Nick Ing-Simmons,
  representing the Dallas/Fort-Worth Perl Mongers.</p>

  <p>Tim Bray gave a well-attended talk about XML; more information
  about the marriage of Perl and XML is available at
  http://www.perl.com/perl-xml.html.</p>

  <p>Ted Nelson, who coined the term 'hypertext' back in 1965,
  surprised the Developer's Workshop by demoing Zigzag, his
  multidimensional hyperstructure construction kit written in
  Perl.</p>

  <p>Head Perl Mongers brian d foy, Adam Turoff, and David Adler
  did a great job popularizing the Perl Mongers at the conference,
  which is why there are so many new user groups to report:
  <b>Amsterdam, Blacksburg, Champaign-Urbana, Dayton, Lisbon,
  Melbourne, Pittsburgh, Rhode Island, Stockholm, Vancouver, and
  Washington D.C.</b> More information about the Mongers is
  available from <a href="http://www.pm.org" target=
  "resource window">http://www.pm.org</a>.</p>

  <p>Next year's conference will take place August 21&ndash;24,
  1999 in Monterey, California. The <b>Call for Papers</b> is now
  available at <a href=
  "http://conference.perl.com/pace/conf/confdocs/call.html" target=
  "resource window">http://conference.perl.com/pace/conf/confdocs/call.html</a>;
  working code and abstracts are due April 9.</p>

  <p>Chris Nandor now maintains a <b>Perl News</b> column at
  <a href="http://www.perl.org/news.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.org/news.html</a>, updated
  daily with newly-uploaded modules. Chris also released
  <b>Audio::MP3::Tag</b>, which lets you extract and edit tag
  information in MP3 files. Then he got a little crazy and wrote
  <b>perlport.pod</b>, a guide to writing portable Perl code. It's
  bundled with new versions of Perl and is therefore available at
  <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/manual/html/pod/perlport.html"
  target=
  "resource window">CPAN/doc/manual/html/pod/perlport.html</a>.</p>

  "resource window">http://www.cre.canon.co.uk/perl/authors/wrigley/</a>.</p>

  <p>Blair Zajac's <b>WebFS::FileCopy</b> module lets you move
  files around the web. Instead of providing traditional pathnames,
  you provide URLs instead. It requires Gisle Aas' <b>LWPng</b>
  (Library-World-Wide-Web-Perl-Next-Generation) package. Gisle also
  released URI, an update and simplification of the <b>URI::URL</b>
  classes. He also wrote a Lisp evaluator in Perl called
  <b>perl-lisp</b>.</p>

  <p>Raphael Manfredi's popular <b>Storable</b> module, for
  maintaining persistent data structures, is now in beta.</p>

  <p>Philip Aston's <b>CORBA::IOP::IOR</b> lets you manipulate
  Common Object Request Broker Architecture Interoperable Object
  References if you can handle all the jargon. The other CORBA
  module is Oliver Kellogg's <b>CORBA::IDLTree</b>, an IDL to
  symbol tree translator.</p>

  <p><b>ptkdb</b>, by Andrew Page, is a graphical (Perl/Tk)
  debugger. You can retrieve it from <a href=
  "http://world.std.com/~aep/ptkdb" target=
  "resource window">http://world.std.com/~aep/ptkdb</a>.</p>

  <p>The <b>Perl/Tk module list</b> is at <a href=

  <p>Shinji Kono released <b>CheckBoard</b>, a Perl/Tk calendar and
  scheduler.</p>

  <p>The <b>Text::Graphics</b> module, by Stephen Farrell, is a

  <b>NetServer::ProcessTop</b>, which shows you information about
  the event loop of a process.</p>

  <p><b>mon</b>, by Jim Trocki, is a an extensible service monitor
  which can be used to watch network resources. It supports
  parallelization and can send out email, pages, or other alerts
  when something fails. It can test for disk space, HTTP, SMTP,
  NNTP, FTP, POP3, IMAP, SNMP, ping, and telnet. You can download
  it from <a href="http://www.kernel.org/software/mon/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.kernel.org/software/mon/</a>.</p>

  <p>Amine Moulay Ramdane released the <b>Win32::MemMap</b> module,
  which lets you move regions of memory around faster than a
  traditional copy. It's available from
  http://www.generation.net/~cybersky/Perl/camel.shtml.</p>

  <p>Joshua Pritikin's <b>Module::Reload</b> reloads any files in
  %INC based on their timestamps.</p>

  proof-of-concept for creating Perl interpreters from within
  Perl.</p>

  implementation of cryptographic cipher block chaining. It
  requires the <b>MD5</b> module and either the <b>Crypt::DES</b>
  module or the <b>Crypt::IDEA</b> module, depending on which
  encryption algorithm you want to use. Luis Munoz released
  <b>Crypt::PasswdMD5</b>, which uses the <b>MD5</b> module to
  implement the <tt>crypt()</tt> function. However, it's not
  freeware; according the license you have to buy Luis a beer if
  you meet him. Luis also wrote <b>Auth::Challenge::Basic</b>,
  which uses MD5 to implement a simple challenge-response
  authentication.</p>

  <p>The <b>Geanfammer</b> module (GEnome ANalysis and protein
  FAMily MakER), by the Cyrus Clothia group, takes a protein
  sequence and shows all of the sequence domains.</p>
