  <p>How web proxy servers work is one of the darker secrets of the
  web protocols. In this article we plunge into the depths to show
  you how to write a proxy module for the Apache web server. This
  module will handle the proxy's basic job of fetching web
  documents on your behalf and forwarding them to you, but with a
  twist: it acts as an advertisement filtering service.</p>

  <p>An ordinary web server returns local documents in response to
  incoming requests. In contrast, a proxying server has elements of
  both server and client. Instead of sending the proxy server a
  request for a local document, the client requests the URL of a
  document located somewhere else on the Internet. The proxy then
  acts as a client itself by fetching the document and forwarding
  it to the waiting client.</p>

  <h3>WHY PROXY?</h3>

  <p>What's the purpose of this? Proxy servers have several uses.
  Historically the most important use for proxies was to allow web
  requests to cross firewalls. Many firewall systems are configured
  to prohibit port 80 traffic. In order to circumvent this
  restriction, administrators installed web server proxies on the
  firewall system. Users then configured their browsers to connect
  to the firewall machine for web access, and the proxy did the
  rest. Nowadays all commercial firewall systems come with built-in
  web proxies and it is no longer necessary to run a general
  purpose web server on the firewall (which was never much of a
  good idea for security reasons).</p>

  <p>A second reason to proxy is that some proxying servers, Apache
  included, can cache the contents of the remote documents by
  sav-ing them to disk files. If they later receive a request for a
  previously cached document, they return the cached document
  instead of fetching it remotely. This cuts down on network
  bandwidth and improves performance, particularly if the server is
  connected to the Internet by a slow connection. America Online
  uses caching proxies to improve response time for its large and
  content-hungry membership. Unfortunately, caching introduces a
  lot of complexity. When is a cached document no longer fresh,
  requiring another fetch again from its source? Given the web's
  eclectic mixture of static pages, CGI scripts, dynamic HTML, and
  server-side includes, not even the best caching proxies answer
  this question correctly 100% of the time.</p>

  <p>A third use for proxy servers is to filter the request. A
  proxy server can change the outgoing request or modify the
  document on its way back to the user. This allows for many useful
  applications. One popular use of this technique is to create an
  anonymizing proxy. Such a proxy sits on the Internet somewhere
  and is used by people who want to protect their identity. As the
  ano- nymizer receives incoming requests, it strips out all
  potentially identifying information from the outgoing request,
  including the User-Agent field, which identifies the browser make
  and model, HTTP cookies, and the Referer field, which contains
  the URL of the last document the user viewed.</p>

  <p>Like an anonymizer, the example proxy in this article filters
  the data that passes through it. However, instead of modifying
  the outgoing request, it modifies the document that is returned
  to the user. Each proxied document is examined to see whether it
  might be an advertising banner image. If so, the proxy replaces
  the banner with a transparent GIF generated on the fly,
  preserv-ing the size and shape of the original image. The result
  is shown in <a href="images/stein-fig1.gif">Figure 1</a>
  ("before") and <a href="images/stein-fig2.gif">Figure 2</a>
  ("after").</p>

  <p>You might use this proxy if you are offended by the web's
  crass commercialism, or just easily distracted by the blinking,
  brightly colored ads on your favorite search page. The proxy is
  written as an add-in module for the Apache server running
  <tt>mod_perl</tt>, the embedded Perl interpreter that Doug
  MacEachern and I wrote about in <a href="../vol3_1/ewtoc.html"
  target="resource window">TPJ #9</a>. The code itself was written
  by Doug MacEachern, and is used with his permission.</p>

  <h3>HOW THE PROXY PROTOCOL WORKS</h3>

  <p>Despite its aura of the arcane, the basic proxy protocol is
  ridiculously simple. A normal web request begins with the browser
  sending a server a line of ASCII text that looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
GET /path/to/document HTTP/1.0
</pre>

  <p>The server responds by returning the document located at the
  indicated path.</p>

  <p>In contrast, to make a proxy request, the browser modifies the
  first line of the request to look like this:</p>
  <pre>
GET http://some.site/path/to/document HTTP/1.0
</pre>

  <p>If the server is proxy-capable, it sees that the requested URL
  contains the protocol and hostname, and forwards the request to
  the indicated remote host. Some proxies can only handle requests
  for HTTP URLs, while others can also handle FTP, Gopher, and
  (occasionally) WAIS.</p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> An Alta Vista
  page with ads</font></p>

  <p>As you may recall from the <tt>mod_perl</tt> article, Apache
  divides each browser transaction into ten different phases
  responsible for handling everything from translating a URI into a
  physical pathname, to generating the page content, to writing
  information about the completed transaction into a log file. To
  extend the server's abilities, you write "handlers" to intercept
  one or more of the phases, supplementing Apache's built-in
  handlers or replacing them entirely.</p>

  <p>The easiest way to intercept and handle proxy requests is to
  write two different handlers. The first handler operates during
  the URI translation phase and is responsible for distinguishing a
  proxy request from an ordinary one. When the URI translation
  handler detects a proxy request, it installs the second handler,
  whose job is to service the content-generation phase of the
  transaction. It is the content handler that does the actual proxy
  request and returns the (possibly modified) document.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0303-0005a.html">Listing 1</a> gives the complete
  code for a module called Apache::AdBlocker. To use this module,
  you'll need LWP 5.08 (or higher), Image::Size 2.6 (or higher),
  and GD 1.18 (or higher). LWP is needed to fetch the remote page,
  Image::Size is used to determine the size of retrieved GIF and
  JPEG advertisements, and GD is used to generate a transparent GIF
  of the same size and shape as the blocked ad. You'll also need
  Apache 1.3.0 or higher, and a recent version of <tt>mod_perl</tt>
  (currently at revision 1.15).</p>

  <p>The module starts by declaring its package name. By
  convention, Apache modules are placed in the Apache:: namespace.
  We then turns on strict syntax checking, and bring in code from
  GD, Image::Size and LWP::UserAgent. We also bring in commonly
  used constants from the Apache::Constants package.</p>

  <p>Lines 9 and 10 inherit from the LWP::UserAgent class.
  LWP::UserAgent is used by the LWP library for all objects that
  are capable of making web client requests, such as robots and
  browsers. Although we don't actually override any of
  <tt>LWP::UserAgent</tt>'s methods, declaring the module as a
  subclass of <tt>LWP::UserAgent</tt> allows us to cleanly
  customize these methods at a later date should we need to. We
  then define a version number, as every module intended for
  reusability should.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/stein-fig2.gif"><img src=
  "images/stein-fig2_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 2: The same page viewed through Apache::AdBlocker."
  border="0" width="265" height="218"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2:</b> The same page
  viewed through Apache::AdBlocker.</font></p>

  <p>In lines 11 to 14, we create two package globals. <tt>$UA</tt>
  is the LWP::UserAgent that we will use for our proxy requests. It
  is created using the special token <tt>__PACKAGE__</tt>, which
  evaluates at run time to the name of the current package. In this
  case, <tt>__PACKAGE__-&gt;new</tt> is equivalent to
  Apache::AdBlocker-&gt;new (or <tt>new Apache::AdBlocker</tt> if
  you prefer Perl's indirect object style of method call).
  Immediately afterward we call the object's <tt>agent()</tt>
  method with a string composed of the package name and version
  number. This is the calling card that LWP sends to the remote
  hosts' web servers as the HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt> field.
  Provided that the remote server records this information, the
  string that will show up in the access log will be
  <tt>Apache::AdBlocker/</tt> 1.00.</p>

  <p>Line 14 defines a regular expression that detects many (but
  not all) banner ads. It's a simple expression that matches the
  words "ads", "banners", "promotion" and so on. If you use this
  service regularly, you'll probably want to broaden this
  expression to catch more ads.</p>

  <p>Lines 16 through 22 define the <b><i>translation
  handler</i></b>, a subroutine which, by convention, is named
  <tt>handler()</tt>. This subroutine is simple enough. It begins
  by copying the Apache request object from the argument stack to a
  lexical variable, <tt>$r</tt>. The request object is the
  interface between user-written modules and Apache, and can be
  used both to learn about the current transaction and to send
  commands back to the server.</p>

  <p>In this case, we call the request object's <tt>proxyreq()</tt>
  method to learn whether the current request is an ordinary one
  for a local document, or a proxy request for a URL on another
  system. If this is just an ordinary request, we decline to handle
  it, returning the <tt>DECLINED</tt> status code. This tells
  Apache to handle the translation phase using its default
  mechanism. Otherwise, we set the stage for a custom content phase
  handler.</p>

  <p>There are now two things that need to be done. First we need
  to tell Apache that the Perl interpreter will be handling the
  content phase. We do this with a call to the request object's
  <tt>handler()</tt> method, giving it an argument of
  <tt>perlscript</tt>, which is the internal name that
  <tt>mod_perl</tt> uses for the Perl interpreter. Next we need to
  tell Perl what user-written subroutine to call when the time
  comes. We do this with a call to <tt>push_handlers()</tt>. This
  routine takes two arguments: the name of the phase to handle, and
  a reference to the subroutine to call. PerlHandler is the name
  used for the content phase (the others are more descriptive, such
  as <tt>PerlTransHandler</tt> or <tt>PerlLogHandler)</tt>, and
  <tt>proxy_handler()</tt> is the subroutine that we want to run.
  As its name implies, you can call <tt>push_handlers()</tt>
  multiple times in order to set up a chain of handlers that will
  be called in order. (We don't take advantage of this facility in
  this example.) The last thing we do is to return an OK status
  code, telling Apache that we handled the request ourselves and no
  more needs to be done.</p>

  <p>Apache now takes over very briefly until it reaches the
  content-handling phase of the transaction, at which point we find
  ourselves inside the <tt>proxy_handler()</tt> routine (lines 24
  through 62). As a content handler, this subroutine is responsible
  for producing the document that is eventually trans-mitted back
  to the browser. When a proxied document is requested, this
  routine will be called once for the main document, and once for
  each image, sound, or other inline content.</p>

  <p>The routine starts as before by copying the request object
  into lexical variable <tt>$r</tt>. It now uses the LWP library to
  construct an <tt>HTTP::Request</tt>, an object that contains the
  various and sundry headers in an HTTP request. We need all the
  header fields that were passed to Apache to be passed through to
  the LWP library. This is so that cookies, authorization
  information, and the list of acceptable MIME types continue to
  work as expected. First we create a generic
  <tt>HTTP::Request</tt> object by calling its <tt>new()</tt>
  method with the request method and the request URI (derived from
  the request object's <tt>method()</tt> and <tt>uri()</tt> methods
  respectively). Next we copy all the incoming header fields to the
  new HTTP::Request object. The Apache request object's
  <tt>headers_in()</tt> method returns a hash of field name-value
  pairs. We iterate over this hash, inserting each header into the
  <tt>HTTP::Request</tt> object.</p>

  <p>If the current request uses the POST method, there's also
  content data to copy over&mdash;typically the contents of
  fill-out forms. In lines 34 through 39 we retrieve the request's
  content length by calling the request object's
  <tt>header_in()</tt> method with an argument of Content-length.
  This call is similar to <tt>headers_in()</tt>, but returns the
  value of a single field, rather than a hash containing them all
  (yes, we could reuse <tt>%headers_in</tt> here, but then you
  would have missed a useful part ofobject's <tt>read()</tt> method
  to read the data into a buffer, and then add the buffer to the
  outgoing <tt>HTTP::Request</tt>, with the help of its
  <tt>content()</tt> method.</p>

  <p>Line 41 is where we actually send out the request. We pass the
  fully prepared <tt>HTTP::Request</tt> object to the user agent
  object's <tt>request()</tt> method. After a brief delay for the
  network fetch, the call returns an <tt>HTTP::Response</tt>
  object, which we copy into the lexical variable
  <tt>$response</tt>. Now the process of copying the headers is
  reversed. Every header in the LWP <tt>HTTP::Response</tt> object
  must be copied to the Apache request object. First we handle a
  few special cases. The Apache API has a call named
  <tt>content_type()</tt> to get and set the document's MIME type.
  In line 42 we call the <tt>HTTP::Response</tt> object's
  <tt>header()</tt> method to fetch the content type, and
  immediately pass the result to the Apache request object's
  <tt>content_type()</tt> method. Next, we set the numeric HTTP
  status code and the human-readable HTTP status line (this is the
  text like <tt>200 OK</tt> or <tt>404 Not Found</tt> that begins
  each response from a web server). We call the
  <tt>HTTP::Response</tt> object's <tt>code()</tt> and
  <tt>message()</tt> methods to return the numeric code and human
  readable messages respectively, and copy them to the Apache
  request object, using the <tt>status()</tt> and
  <tt>status_line()</tt> methods to set the values.</p>

  <p>When the special case headers are done, we copy all the other
  header fields, using the <tt>HTTP::Response</tt> object's
  <tt>scan()</tt> method to rapidly loop through each of the header
  name-value pairs (lines 47 through 49). For each header field,
  <tt>scan()</tt> invokes an anonymous callback routine that sets
  the appropriate field in the Apache request object with the
  <tt>header_out()</tt> method. <tt>header_out()</tt> works just
  like <tt>header_in()</tt>, but accepts the name-value pair of a
  outgoing header field to set.</p>

  <p>At this point, the outgoing header is ready to be sent to the
  waiting browser. We call the request object's
  <tt>send_http_header()</tt> method (line 51) to have Apache send
  a correctly-formatted HTTP header.</p>

  <h3>IDENTIFYING ADS</h3>

  <p>The time has now come to deal with potential banner ads. To
  identify something an ad, we require that the document be an
  image and that its URI satisfy a regular expression match that
  detects words like "advertisement" and "promotion." On line 52 we
  call the <tt>HTTP::Response</tt> object's <tt>content()</tt>
  method to return the data contained within the response, and
  store a reference to it in the lexical variable
  <tt>$content</tt>. Next, in lines 54-57 we use the information
  stored in the Apache request object to check whether the MIME
  type corresponds to an image, and if so, whether the URL matches
  the ad scanner pattern. If both these conditions are true, we set
  the content type to image/gif and call an internal subroutine
  named <tt>block_ad()</tt> to replace the original image with a
  custom GIF. On line 59, we send the possibly modified content on
  to the browser by passing it to the Apache request object's
  <tt>print()</tt> method. Lastly, we return a status code of OK to
  inform Apache that we handled the transaction successfully.</p>

  <p>The <tt>block_ad()</tt> subroutine, beginning on line 64, is
  short and sweet. Its job is to take an image in any of several
  possible formats and replace it with a custom GIF of exactly the
  same dimensions. The GIF will be transparent, allowing the page
  background color to show through, and will have the words
  "Blocked Ad" printed in large friendly letters in the upper
  left-hand corner.</p>

  <p>To get the width and height of the image we call
  <tt>imgsize()</tt>, a function imported from the Image::Size
  module. <tt>imgsize()</tt> recognizes most web image formats,
  including GIF, JPEG, XBM, and PNG. Using these values, we create
  a new blank <tt>GD::Image</tt> object and store it in a variable
  named <tt>$im</tt>. We call the image object's
  <tt>colorAllocate()</tt> method three times to allocate color
  table entries for white, black and red, and declare that the
  white color is transparent, using the <tt>transparent()</tt>
  method. The routine calls the <tt>string()</tt> method to draw
  the message starting at coordinates (5,5), and finally frames the
  whole image with a black rectangle. The custom image is now
  converted into GIF format with the <tt>gif()</tt> method, and
  copied into <tt>$$data</tt>, overwriting whatever was there
  before.</p>

  <p>This ends the module. The only remaining step is to tell
  Apache about it. You do this by placing the following directive
  in one of Apache's configuration files:</p>
  <pre>
PerlTransHandler Apache::AdBlocker
</pre>

  <p>Apache::AdBlocker's <tt>handler()</tt> subroutine will now be
  invoked to inspect all incoming requests.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to try this module out for yourself and your LAN
  configuration doesn't already require you to use a proxy, you
  will find the module running at <a href="http://www.modperl.com/"
  target="resource window">http://www.modperl.com/</a>. Open up
  your browser's proxy configuration settings, and set HTTP
  requests to proxy through www.modperl.com using port 80. Now
  browse the Internet, and see how different things look without
  all the flashing banner ads! After you're finished be sure to set
  your browser's proxy settings back to their original values. The
  modperl server is a lowly 90 MHz Pentium and performance will
  suffer if too many people decide to use the Ad blocker on a
  permanent basis.</p>
