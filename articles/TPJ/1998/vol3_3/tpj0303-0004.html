  <p>This article is about a little-known feature of Perl called
  <b><i>source filters</i></b>. Source filters alter the program
  text of a module before Perl sees it, much as a C preprocessor
  alters the source text of a C program before the compiler sees
  it. This article tells you more about what source filters are,
  how they work, and how to write your own.</p>

  <p>The original purpose of source filters was to let you encrypt
  your program source to prevent casual piracy. This isn't all they
  can do, as you'll soon learn. But first, the basics.</p>

  <h3>CONCEPTS</h3>

  <p>Before the Perl interpreter can execute a Perl script, it must
  first read it from a file into memory for parsing and
  compilation. (Even scripts specified on the command line with the
  <tt>-e</tt> option are stored in a temporary file for the parser
  to process.) If that script itself includes other scripts with a
  <tt>use</tt> or <tt>require</tt> statement, then each of those
  scripts will have to be read from their respective files as
  well.</p>

  <p>Now think of each logical connection between the Perl parser
  and an individual file as a <b><i>source stream</i></b>. A source
  stream is created when the Perl parser opens a file, it continues
  to exist as the source code is read into memory, and it is
  destroyed when Perl is finished parsing the file. If the parser
  encounters a <tt>require</tt> or use statement in a source
  stream, a new and distinct stream is created just for that
  file.</p>

  <p>The diagram below represents a single source stream, with the
  flow of source from a Perl script file on the left into the Perl
  parser on the right. This is how Perl normally operates.</p>

  <p><b>file -------&gt; parser</b></p>

  <p>There are two important points to remember:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Although there can be any number of source streams in
    existence at any given time, only one will be active.</li>

    <li>Every source stream is associated with only one file.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>A source filter is a special kind of Perl module that
  intercepts and modifies a source stream before it reaches the
  parser. A source filter changes the our diagram like this:</p>

  <p><b><nobr>file ----&gt; filter ----&gt; parser</nobr></b></p>

  <p>If that doesn't make much sense, consider the analogy of a
  command pipeline. Say you have a shell script stored in the
  compressed file <b><i>trial.gz</i></b>. The simple pipeline
  command below runs the script without needing to create a
  temporary file to hold the uncompressed file.</p>
  <pre>
  gunzip -c trial.gz | sh
</pre>

  <p>In this case, the data flow from the pipeline can be
  represented as follows:</p>

  <p><b><nobr>trial.gz ----&gt; gunzip ----&gt; sh</nobr></b></p>

  <p>With source filters, you can store the text of your script
  compressed and use a source filter to uncompress it for Perl's
  parser:</p>

    <tr>

      <td valign="middle" nowrap><b>---&gt;</b></td>

      <td valign="middle" nowrap><b>parser</b></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>USING FILTERS</h3>

  <p>So how do you use a source filter in a Perl script? Above, I
  said that a source filter is just a special kind of module. Like
  all Perl modules, a source filter is invoked with a use
  statement.</p>

  <p>Say you want to pass your Perl source through the C
  preprocessor before execution. You could use the existing
  <tt>-P</tt> command line option to do this, but as it happens,
  the source filters distribution comes with a C preprocessor
  filter module called Filter::cpp. Let's use that instead.</p>

  <p>Below is an example program, <tt>cpp_test</tt>, which makes
  use of this filter. Line numbers have been added to allow
  specific lines to be referenced easily.</p>
  <pre>
1: use Filter::cpp ;
2: #define TRUE 1
3: $a = TRUE ;
4: print "a = $a\n" ;
</pre>

  <p>When you execute this script, Perl creates a source stream for
  the file. Before the parser processes any of the lines from the
  file, the source stream looks like this:</p>

  <p><b><nobr>cpp_test ---------&gt; parser</nobr></b></p>

  <p>Line 1, <tt>use Filter::cpp</tt>, includes and installs the
  <tt>cpp</tt> filter module. All source filters work this way. The
  use statement is compiled and executed at compile time, before
  any more of the file is read, and it attaches the cpp filter to
  the source stream behind the scenes. Now the data flow looks like
  this:</p>

  <p><b><nobr>cpp_test ----&gt; cpp filter ----&gt;
  parser</nobr></b></p>

  <p>As the parser reads the second and subsequent lines from the
  source stream, it feeds those lines through the <tt>cpp</tt>
  source filter before processing them. The <tt>cpp</tt> filter
  simply passes each line through the real C preprocessor. The
  output from the C preprocessor is then inserted back into the
  source stream by the filter.</p>
  <pre>
                  .-&gt; <b>cpp</b> --.
                  |         |
                  |         |
                  |       &lt;-'
   <b>cpp_test</b> ----&gt; <b>cpp filter</b> ----&gt; <b>parser</b>
</pre>

  <p>The parser then sees the following code:</p>
  <pre>
use Filter::cpp ;
$a = 1 ;
print "a = $a\n" ;
</pre>

  <p>Let's consider what happens when the filtered code includes
  another module with use:</p>
  <pre>
1: use Filter::cpp ;
2: #define TRUE 1
3: use Fred ;
4: $a = TRUE ;
5: print "a = $a\n" ;
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>cpp</tt> filter does not apply to the text of the Fred
  module, only to the text of the file that used it
  (<tt>cpp_test</tt>). Although the use statement on line 3 will
  pass through the cpp filter, the module that gets included
  (<tt>Fred</tt>) will not. The source streams look like this after
  line 3 has been parsed and before line 4 is parsed:</p>

  <p><b><nobr>cpp_test ---&gt; cpp filter ---&gt; parser
  (INACTIVE)</nobr></b></p>

  <p><b><nobr>Fred.pm ----&gt; parser</nobr></b></p>

  <p>As you can see, a new stream has been created for reading the
  source from Fred.pm. This stream will remain active until all of
  <tt>Fred.pm</tt> has been parsed. The source stream for
  <tt>cpp_test</tt> will still exist, but is inactive. Once the
  parser has finished reading Fred.pm, the source stream associated
  with it will be destroyed. The source stream for
  <tt>cpp_test</tt> then becomes active again and the parser reads
  line 4 and subsequent lines from <tt>cpp_test</tt>.</p>

  <p>You can use more than one source filter on a single file.
  Similarly, you can reuse the same filter in as many files as you
  like.</p>

  <p>For example, if you have a uuencoded and compressed source
  file, it is possible to stack a uudecode filter and an
  uncompression filter like this:</p>
  <pre>
use Filter::uudecode ; use Filter::uncompress ;
&#13;M'XL(".H&lt;US4''V9I;F%L')Q;&gt;7/;1I;_&gt;_I3=&amp;E=%:F*I"T?22Q/
M6]9*&lt;IQCO*XFT"0[PL%%'Y+IG?WN^ZYN-$'J.[.JE$,20/?K=_[&gt;
...
</pre>

  <p>Once the first line has been processed, the flow will look
  like this:</p>

  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td valign="middle" nowrap><b>file</b></td>

      <td valign="middle" nowrap><b>---&gt;</b></td>

      <td valign="middle" nowrap><b>uudecode<br>
      filter</b></td>

      <td valign="middle" nowrap><b>---&gt;</b></td>

      <td valign="middle" nowrap><b>uncompress<br>
      filter</b></td>

      <td valign="middle" nowrap><b>---&gt;</b></td>

      <td valign="middle" nowrap><b>parser</b></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Data flows through filters in the same order they appear in
  the source file. The uudecode filter appeared before the
  uncompress filter, so the source file will be uudecoded before
  it's uncompressed.</p>

  <h3>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER</h3>

  <p>There are three ways to write your own source filter. You can
  write it in C, use an external program as a filter, or write the
  filter in Perl. I won't cover the first two in any great detail,
  so I'll get them out of the way first. Writing the filter in Perl
  is most convenient, so I'll devote the most space to it.</p>

  <h3>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN C</h3>

  <p>The first of the three available techniques is to write the
  filter completely in C. The external module you create interfaces
  directly with the source filter hooks provided by Perl.</p>

  <p>The advantage of this technique is that you have complete
  control over the implementation of your filter. The big
  disadvantage is the increased complexity required to write the
  filter - not only do you need to understand the source filter
  hooks, but you also need a reasonable knowledge of Perl guts. One
  of the few times it is worth going to this trouble is when
  writing a source scrambler. The <tt>decrypt</tt> filter (which
  unscrambles the source before Perl parses it) included with the
  source filter distribution is an example of a C source filter
  (see <a href="tpj0303-0004a.html">Decryption Filters</a>).</p>

  <h3>CREATING A SOURCE FILTER AS A SEPARATE EXECUTABLE</h3>

  <p>An alternative to writing the filter in C is to create a
  separate executable in the language of your choice. The separate
  executable reads from standard input, does whatever processing is
  necessary, and writes the filtered data to standard output.
  <tt>Filter:cpp</tt> is an example of a source filter implemented
  as a separate executable - the executable is the C preprocessor
  bundled with your C compiler.</p>

  <p>The source filter distribution includes two modules that
  simplify this task: <tt>Filter::exec</tt> and
  <tt>Filter::sh</tt>. Both allow you to run any external
  executable. Both use a coprocess to control the flow of data into
  and out of the external executable. (For details on coprocesses,
  see Stephens, W.R. "Advanced Programming in the UNIX
  Environment." Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-210-56317-7, pages
  441&#8211;445.) The difference between them is that
  <tt>Filter::exec</tt> spawns the external command directly, while
  <tt>Filter::sh</tt> spawns a shell to execute the external
  command. (Unix uses the Bourne shell; NT uses the <tt>cmd</tt>
  shell.) Spawning a shell allows you to make use of the shell
  metacharacters and redirection facilities.</p>

  <p>Here is an example script that uses <tt>Filter::sh</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
use Filter::sh 'tr XYZ PQR' ;
$a = 1 ;
print "XYZ a = $a\n" ;
</pre>

  <p>The output you'll get when the script is executed:</p>
  <pre>
PQR a = 1
</pre>

  <p>Writing a source filter as a separate executable works fine,
  but a small performance penalty is incurred. For example, if you
  execute the small example above, a separate subprocess will be
  created to run the Unix <tt>tr</tt> command. Each use of the
  filter requires its own subprocess. If creating subprocesses is
  expensive on your system, you might want to consider one of the
  other options for creating source filters.</p>

  <h3>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN PERL</h3>

  <p>The easiest and most portable option available for creating
  your own source filter is to write it completely in Perl. To
  distinguish this from the previous two techniques, I'll call it a
  Perl source filter.</p>

  <p>To help understand how to write a Perl source filter we need
  an example to study. Here is a complete source filter that
  performs rot13 decoding. (Rot13 is a very simple encryption
  scheme used in Usenet postings to hide the contents of offensive
  posts. It moves every letter forward thirteen places, so that A
  becomes N, B becomes O, and Z becomes M.)</p>
  <pre>
package Rot13 ;
&#13;use Filter::Util::Call ;
&#13;sub import {
   my ($type) = @_ ;
   my ($ref) = [] ;
   filter_add(bless $ref) ;
}
&#13;sub filter {
   my ($self) = @_ ;
   my ($status) ;
   
   tr/n-za-mN-ZA-M/a-zA-Z/
      if ($status = filter_read()) &gt; 0 ;
   $status ;
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>All Perl source filters are implemented as Perl classes and
  have the same basic structure as the example above.</p>

  <p>First, we include the <tt>Filter::Util::Call</tt> module,
  which exports a number of functions into your filter's namespace.
  The filter shown above uses two of these functions,
  <tt>filter_add()</tt> and <tt>filter_read()</tt>.</p>

  <p>Next, we create the filter object and associate it with the
  source stream by defining the <tt>import</tt> function. If you
  know Perl well enough, you know that <tt>import</tt> is called
  automatically every time a module is included with a <tt>use</tt>
  statement. This makes <tt>import</tt> the ideal place to both
  create and install a filter object.</p>

  <p>In the example filter, the object (<tt>$ref</tt>) is blessed
  just like any other Perl object. Our example uses an anonymous
  array, but this isn't a requirement. Because this example doesn't
  need to store any context information, we could have used a
  scalar or hash reference just as well. The next section
  demonstrates context data.</p>

  <p>The association between the filter object and the source
  stream is made with the <tt>filter_add()</tt> function. This
  takes a filter object as a parameter (<tt>$ref</tt> in this case)
  and installs it in the source stream.</p>

  <p>Finally, there is the code that actually does the filtering.
  For this type of Perl source filter, all the filtering is done in
  a method called <tt>filter()</tt>. (It is also possible to write
  a Perl source filter using a closure. See the Filter::Util::Call
  manual page for more details.) It's called every time the Perl
  parser needs another line of source to process. The
  <tt>filter()</tt> method, in turn, reads lines from the source
  stream using the <tt>filter_read()</tt> function.</p>

  <p>If a line was available from the source stream, filter_read()
  returns a status value greater than zero and appends the line to
  $_. A status value of zero indicates end-of-file, less than zero
  means an error. The filter function itself is expected to return
  its status in the same way, and put the filtered line it wants
  written to the source stream in <tt>$_</tt>. The use of
  <tt>$_</tt> accounts for the brevity of most Perl source
  filters.</p>

  <p>In order to make use of the rot13 filter we need some way of
  encoding the source file in rot13 format. The script below,
  <tt>mkrot13</tt>, does just that.</p>
  <pre>
die "usage mkrot13 filename\n" unless @ARGV ;
my $in = $ARGV[0] ;
my $out = "$in.tmp" ;
open(IN, "&lt;$in") or die "Cannot open file $in: $!\n";
open(OUT, "&gt;$out") or die "Cannot open file $out: $!\n";
&#13;print OUT "use Rot13;\n" ;
while (&lt;IN&gt;) {
   tr/a-zA-Z/n-za-mN-ZA-M/ ;
   print OUT ;
}
&#13;close IN;
close OUT;
unlink $in;
rename $out, $in;
</pre>

  <p>If we encrypt this with <tt>mkrot13</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
print " hello fred \n" ;
</pre>

  <p>the result will be this:</p>
  <pre>
use Rot13;
cevag "uryyb serq\a" ;
</pre>

  <p>Running it produces this output:</p>
  <pre>
hello fred
</pre>

  <h3>USING CONTEXT: THE DEBUG FILTER</h3>

  <p>The rot13 example was a trivial example. Here's another
  demonstration that shows off a few more features.</p>

  <p>Say you wanted to include a lot of debugging code in your Perl
  script during development, but you didn't want it available in
  the released product. Source filters offer a solution. In order
  to keep the example simple, let's say you wanted the debugging
  output to be controlled by an environment variable,
  <tt>DEBUG</tt>. Debugging code is enabled if the variable exists,
  otherwise it is disabled.</p>

  <p>Two special marker lines will bracket debugging code, like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
## DEBUG_BEGIN
if ($year &gt; 1999) {
   warn "Debug: millennium bug in year $year\n" ;
}
## DEBUG_END
</pre>

  <p>When the <tt>DEBUG</tt> environment variable exists, the
  filter ensures that Perl parses only the code between the
  <tt>DEBUG_BEGIN</tt> and <tt>DEBUG_END</tt> markers. That means
  that when <tt>DEBUG</tt> does exist, the code above should be
  passed through the filter unchanged. The marker lines can also be
  passed through as-is, because the Perl parser will see them as
  comment lines. When <tt>DEBUG</tt> isn't set, we need a way to
  disable the debug code. A simple way to achieve that is to
  convert the lines between the two markers into comments:</p>
  <pre>
## DEBUG_BEGIN
#if ($year &gt; 1999) {
#     warn "Debug: millennium bug in year $year\n" ;
#}
## DEBUG_END
</pre>

  <p>Here is the complete Debug filter:</p>
  <pre>
package Debug;
&#13;use strict;
use Filter::Util::Call ;
&#13;use constant TRUE =&gt; 1 ;
use constant FALSE =&gt; 0 ;
&#13;sub import {
   my ($type) = @_ ;
   my (%context) = (
     Enabled =&gt; defined $ENV{DEBUG},
     InTraceBlock =&gt; FALSE,
     Filename =&gt; (caller)[1],
     LineNo =&gt; 0,
     LastBegin =&gt; 0,
   ) ;
   filter_add(bless \%context) ;
}
&#13;sub Die {
   my ($self) = shift ;
   my ($message) = shift ;
   my ($line_no) = shift || $self-&gt;{LastBegin} ;
   die "$message at $self-&gt;{Filename} line $line_no.\n"
}
&#13;sub filter {
   my ($self) = @_ ;
   my ($status) ;
   $status = filter_read() ;
   ++ $self-&gt;{LineNo} ;
   
   # deal with EOF/error first
   if ($status &lt;= 0) {
       $self-&gt;Die("DEBUG_BEGIN has no DEBUG_END")
           if $self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} ;
       return $status ;
   }
&#13;   if ($self-&gt;{InTraceBlock}) {
      if (/^\s*##\s*DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) {
          $self-&gt;Die("Nested DEBUG_BEGIN", $self-&gt;{LineNo})
      } elsif (/^\s*##\s*DEBUG_END/) {
          $self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = FALSE ;
      }
&#13;      # comment out the debug lines when the filter is disabled
      s/^/#/ if ! $self-&gt;{Enabled} ;
   } elsif ( /^\s*##\s*DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) {
      $self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = TRUE ;
      $self-&gt;{LastBegin} = $self-&gt;{LineNo} ;
   } elsif ( /^\s*##\s*DEBUG_END/ ) {
      $self-&gt;Die("DEBUG_END has no DEBUG_BEGIN", $self-&gt;{LineNo});
   }
   return $status ;
}
&#13;1 ;
</pre>

  <p>The big difference between this filter and the previous
  example is the use of context data in the filter object. The
  filter object is based on a hash reference, and is used to keep
  various pieces of context information between calls to the filter
  function. All but two of the hash fields are used for error
  reporting. The first of those two, Enabled, is used by the filter
  to determine whether the debugging code should be given to the
  Perl parser. The second, InTraceBlock, is true when the filter
  has encountered a <tt>DEBUG_BEGIN</tt> line, but has not yet
  encountered the following <tt>DEBUG_END</tt> line.</p>

  <p>If you ignore all the error checking that most of the code
  does, the essence of the filter is as follows:</p>
  <pre>
sub filter {
   my ($self) = @_ ;
   my ($status) ;
   $status = filter_read() ;
   
   # deal with EOF/error first
   return $status if $status &lt;= 0 ;
   if ($self-&gt;{InTraceBlock}) {
      if (/^\s*##\s*DEBUG_END/) {
         $self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = FALSE
      }
&#13;      # comment out debug lines when the filter is disabled
      s/^/#/ if ! $self-&gt;{Enabled} ;
   } elsif ( /^\s*##\s*DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) {
      $self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = TRUE ;
   }
   return $status ;
}
</pre>

  <p>Be warned: just as the C-preprocessor doesn't know C, the
  Debug filter doesn't know Perl. It can be fooled quite
  easily:</p>
  <pre>
print &lt;&lt;EOM;
##DEBUG_BEGIN
EOM
</pre>

  <p>Such things aside, you can see that a lot can be achieved with
  a modest amount of code. <i>[Note that Tuomas' toy VRML parser on
  p. 17 had the same difficulty parsing VRML strings that look like
  comments. -Jon]</i></p>

  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

  <p>You now have better understanding of what a source filter is,
  and you might even have a possible use for them. If you feel like
  playing with source filters but need a bit of inspiration, here
  are some extra features you could add to the Debug filter.</p>

  <p>First, an easy one. Rather than having debugging code that is
  all-or-nothing, it would be much more useful to be able to
  control which specific blocks of debugging code get included. Try
  extending the syntax for debug blocks to allow each to be
  identified. The contents of the DEBUG environment variable can
  then be used to control which blocks get included.</p>

  <p>Once you can identify individual blocks, try allowing them to
  be nested. That isn't difficult either.</p>

  <p>Here is a interesting idea that doesn't involve the Debug
  filter. Currently Perl subroutines have fairly limited support
  for formal parameter lists. You can specify the number of
  parameters and their type, but you still have to manually take
  them out of the <tt>@_</tt> array yourself. Write a source filter
  that allows you to have a named parameter list. Such a filter
  would turn this:</p>
  <pre>
   sub MySub ($first, $second, @rest) { ... }
</pre>

  <p>into this:</p>
  <pre>
   sub MySub($$@) {
      my ($first) = shift ;
      my ($second) = shift ;
      my (@rest) = @_ ;
      ...
   }
</pre>

  <p>Finally, if you feel like a real challenge, have a go at
  writing a full-blown Perl macro preprocessor as a source filter.
  Borrow the useful features from the C preprocessor and any other
  macro processors you know. The tricky bit will be choosing how
  much knowledge of Perl's syntax you want your filter to have.</p>
