  <p>Perl's motto is "There Is More Than One Way To Do It." Some
  ways are easy to read, some are fast, and some are just plain
  incomprehensible. Often I'll need to know how long it takes for
  my program to execute, and I'll use the Benchmark module to find
  out. Benchmark.pm comes with the standard Perl distribu-tion and
  is written completely in Perl, so you can use it right away.</p>

  <h3>THE TROUBLE WITH <tt>time()</tt></h3>

  <p>Before I discuss the Benchmark module, let's think about what
  I must do to time an event. I need to know when the event started
  and when the event ended. If I know those I can determine the
  difference between them.</p>

  <p>If I want to time one of my programs, I could use my stopwatch
  to time how long it takes to execute. If it takes more than
  several seconds I might actually be able to do that. However, I
  don't need my watch, since Perl already provides a way to do this
  with the built-in <tt>time()</tt> function, which returns the
  system time. I can record the system time twice and take the
  difference:</p>
  <pre>
my $start_time = time;
# My code here
my $end_time = time;

my $difference = $end_time - $start_time;

print "My code took $difference seconds\n";
</pre>

  <p>Since <tt>time()</tt> returns an integral number of seconds,
  this method can only record times and differences with one-second
  precision. That might be too coarse a granularity for the really
  fast code that I've written. Also, the CPU works on other things
  before it finishes my program, so the stopwatch approach doesn't
  tell me how long the CPU actually spent on my program. When the
  CPU is more heavily loaded, the time to execute might even be
  longer. A program might take ten seconds to execute but only use
  two seconds of actual CPU time.</p>

  <h3>BETTER RESOLUTION WITH <tt>TIMES()</tt></h3>

  <p>The built-in <tt>times()</tt> function provides a list of the
  user time, system time, children's user time, and children's
  system time, all with a finer granularity than <tt>time()</tt>.
  Better still, it only records the time actually spent on my
  process - an important distinction for multitasking operating
  systems. I can use the same technique that I used before to time
  my program:</p>
  <pre>
my @start_times = times;
# My code here
my @end_time = times;

my @differences = map { $end_time[$_] - $start_time[$_] }
                      (0..$#start_time);
                                          
my $difference = join ', ', @differences;
print " My code took ($difference) seconds\n";
</pre>

  <p>But computers are pretty fast and that code might run a lot
  faster than the smallest time that I can measure, even with
  <tt>times()</tt>. To get around this I can run my code several
  times and compute the average. This makes the situation much more
  complicated. Not only I would need to make a loop to run the code
  several times, but I would need to figure out how the addition of
  the loop increased the time. But you don't have to worry about
  any of this if you use the Benchmark module.</p>

  <h3>THE BENCHMARK MODULE</h3>

  <p>Now I want to rewrite my previous examples using the
  Bench-mark module. To record a time, I construct a Benchmark
  object. The constructor creates a list of the times returned by
  <tt>time()</tt> and <tt>times()</tt>, although I don't need to
  worry about that since I just use the object-oriented
  interface.</p>
  <pre>
<b>use Benchmark;</b>

<b>my $start_time = new Benchmark;</b>

# My code here
my @array = (1 .. 1000000);
foreach my $element ( @array ) { $_ += $element }

<b>my $end_time = new Benchmark;</b>
</pre>

  <p>I also need a way to determine the time difference, which I
  can do with the <tt>timediff()</tt> function:</p>
  <pre>
my $difference = timediff($end_time, $start_time);
</pre>

  <p>This returns another Benchmark object. When I want to see the
  times that I have measured, I use the <tt>timestr()</tt>
  method:</p>
  <pre>
print "It took ", timestr($difference), "\n";
</pre>

  <p>This function provides several ways to print the time by using
  optional <tt>FORMAT</tt> and <tt>STYLE</tt> parameters, explained
  in the documentation embedded in the Benchmark module (type
  perldoc Benchmark or man Benchmark). After running this code I
  get:</p>
  <pre>
It took 40 secs (17.53 usr 6.39 sys = 23.92 cpu)
</pre>

  <p>The first number, 40 seconds, is the real time it took to
  execute exactly what my stopwatch would have revealed. The module
  takes this directly from <tt>time()</tt>. The next numbers are
  the values from <tt>times()</tt> giving the user and system
  times, which, when summed, give the total CPU time.</p>

  <p>I can also measure the time it takes to perform several
  iterations of the code by using the <tt>timeit()</tt> method,
  which takes either a code reference (a reference to an anonymous
  subroutine) or a string. The function returns a Benchmark object
  that I can print as before.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
<b>use Benchmark;</b>

my $ITERATIONS = 1000;

my $code = &lt;&lt;'CODE';
foreach my $element ( 1 .. 1000 ) { $_ += $element }
CODE

my $time = <b>timeit($ITERATIONS, $code);</b>

print "It took ", <b>timestr($time)</b>, "\n";
</pre>

  <p>On my computer, this program prints:</p>
  <pre>
It took 14 secs ( 8.49 usr 0.00 sys = 8.49 cpu)
</pre>

  <p>CAUTION! Do not compare benchmarks of code references and
  strings! Use the same for each technique that you compare since
  there is extra overhead with the <tt>eval()</tt> needed to
  benchmark a string. This is true for <tt>timeit()</tt> and all of
  the Benchmark functions.</p>

  <p>As I mentioned before, running a snippet of code several times
  has additional overhead unrelated to the speediness of my code -
  the time required to set up the loop constructs, for instance.
  One of the advantages of the Benchmark module is that
  <tt>timeit()</tt> tests how long it takes to execute an empty
  string and subtracts that time from the time to run your code;
  this compensates for the extra overhead introduced by the act of
  benchmarking code. There are several methods that let you exert
  finer control over this feature; they're described in the
  documentation embedded in the module.</p>

  <p>The function <tt>timethis()</tt> is similar to
  <tt>timeit()</tt>, but has optional parameters for <tt>TITLE</tt>
  and <tt>STYLE</tt>. The <tt>TITLE</tt> parameter allows you to
  give your snippet a name, and <tt>STYLE</tt> affects the format
  of the output. The results are automatically sent to
  <tt>STDOUT</tt>, although <tt>timethis()</tt> still returns a
  Benchmark object. Internally, <tt>timethis()</tt> uses
  <tt>timeit()</tt>.</p>

  <h3>EXAMPLE: SUMMING AN ARRAY</h3>

  <p>Now that I know how long it took to run my bit of code, I'm
  curious if I can make that time shorter. Can I come up with
  another way to do the same task, and, if I can, how does its time
  compare to other ways? Using the Benchmark module, I can use
  <tt>timeit()</tt> for each bit of code. However, the Benchmark
  module anticipates this need, providing a function that compares
  several chunks of code: <tt>timethese()</tt>.</p>

  <p>The <tt>timethese()</tt> function is a wrapper around
  <tt>timethis()</tt>. The <tt>%SNIPPETS</tt> hash contains snippet
  names as keys and either CODE references or strings as values.
  The function returns a list of Benchmark objects for each chunk
  of code.</p>
  <pre>
my @benchmarks = timethese($ITERATIONS, \%SNIPPETS);
</pre>

  <p><tt>timethese()</tt> doesn't guarantee any particular order
  for testing the snippets, so I have to keep track of the order in
  which <tt>time-this()</tt> reports the results. If I wanted to do
  further programmatic calculations with the times, I could store
  the list returned by <tt>timethese()</tt>, but for now I will
  rely on the information printed from <tt>timethis()</tt>. Now I
  just need something to compare.</p>

  <p>To demonstrate <tt>timethese()</tt>, I want to compare five
  different ways to sum an array. I gave each snippet a name based
  on my impression of it. The <i><b>Idiomatic</b></i> method is the
  standard use of <tt>foreach</tt>. Even if this technique turns
  out to be slower than another, I'd still prefer it because it's
  the most straight forward solution. The <i><b>Evil</b></i> use of
  <tt>map</tt> in a void context seems like it might be really
  clever and preferred by some Perl pedants, but how fast is it?
  The <i><b>Builtin</b></i> technique uses the <tt>sum()</tt>
  function from Graham Barr's <tt>builtin</tt> module, which uses
  XS to tie C code to a Perl function. I think
  <i><b>Builtin</b></i> might be very competitive. I expect the
  <i><b>Curious</b></i> and <i><b>Silly</b></i> methods to be very
  slow, but at the very least they'll make me appreciate the speed
  of the other techniques.</p>

  <p>Idiomatic:</p>
  <pre>
foreach (@array) { $sum += $_ }
</pre>

  <p>Evil (use of map in void context)</p>
  <pre>
map { $sum += $_ } @array;
</pre>

  <p>Builtin:</p>
  <pre>
$sum = sum @array;
</pre>

  <p>Curious:</p>
  <pre>
grep { /^(\d+)$/ and $sum += $1 } @array
</pre>

  <p>Silly:</p>
  <pre>
$_ = join 'just another new york perl hacker', @array_name;
while ( m/(\d+)/g ) { $sum += $1 }
</pre>

  <p>Our program to test all five techniques:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

<b>
use Benchmark qw(timethese);
use builtin qw(sum);</b>

my $ITERATIONS = 10000;
@array = (1 .. 10);

my %SNIPPETS = (
  Idiomatic =&gt; ' $sum=0; foreach (@array) { $sum += $_ }',
  Evil =&gt; '$sum=0; map { $sum += $_ } @array',
  Builtin =&gt; '$sum=0; $sum = sum @array'
  Curious =&gt; '$sum=0; grep { /^(\d+)$/ and $sum += $1 } @array',
  Silly =&gt; q|$sum=0;
      $_ = join 'just another new york perl hacker', @array;
      while( m/(\d+)/g ) { $sum += $1 }|
);
timethese($ITERATIONS, \%SNIPPETS);
</pre>

  <p>The surprising results:</p>
  <pre>
Idiomatic: 1 secs ( 1.08 usr 0.00 sys = 1.08 cpu)
     Evil: 2 secs ( 1.44 usr 0.00 sys = 1.44 cpu)
   Builtin: 1 secs ( 0.24 usr 0.00 sys = 0.24 cpu)
           (warning: too few iterations for a reliable count)
   Curious: 8 secs ( 8.17 usr 0.00 sys = 8.17 cpu)
     Silly: 11 secs ( 7.26 usr 0.01 sys = 7.27 cpu)
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>sum()</tt> function from <tt>builtin</tt> is
  <b><i>very</i></b> fast. In fact, it was so fast that for 10,000
  iterations the Benchmark module couldn't measure a reliable time.
  The <tt>foreach</tt> loop is slightly faster than the "clever"
  use of map, but both are significantly slower than
  <tt>sum()</tt>. The other methods, which I never expected to be
  fast, are indeed quite slow.</p>

  <p>However, this comparison doesn't satisfy me. What happens as
  the size of the array and the number of iterations changes? Over
  the past several weeks I ran several combinations of array size
  and iterations for each of the methods. Since I don't really care
  about the Curious and Silly methods, I only report the results
  for the Idiomatic, Evil, and Builtin methods. I ran each with
  arrays of sizes from 10 to 10,000 elements and iterations from
  1000 to 1,000,000 times. The longest time took about 86,000 CPU
  seconds of a Sparc20 (96 Mb RAM, Perl 5.004) - that's about 1 CPU
  day! Don't try this without telling the system administrator what
  you are doing, especially if you called your script "test" - it's
  not fun to get email nastygrams from an administrator who thinks
  you have a script running amok when it's really doing exactly
  what you want it to do. Not that this happened to me and you
  can't prove it anyway.</p>

    methods summing an array of 10,000 integers.<br>
    The "builtin" method is significantly faster.</font></p>
  </div>

  <h3>SO WHAT HAVE I LEARNED?</h3>

  <p>Stopwatches aren't very effective for timing a piece of code
  because the CPU might work on other things before it finishes
  your task. The <tt>times()</tt> function is a little better, but
  my code might run faster than it can measure. I don't have to
  worry about these issues when I use the Benchmark module, which
  averages the time needed over many iterations.</p>

  <p>In my summing example, I discovered that the "clever" use of
  <tt>map()</tt> was consistently slower than the idiomatic
  <tt>foreach</tt>, which in turn was much slower than
  <tt>sum()</tt>. Although <tt>foreach</tt> is the conventional way
  to sum an array, I am hard-pressed to justify the order of
  magnitude speed penalty - I'll be using <tt>sum()</tt> from now
  on. If you think that you have a faster method, you now have the
  tools to test it. If your method beats <tt>sum()</tt>, send me a
  note (and Graham too)!</p>
