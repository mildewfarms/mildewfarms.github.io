  Learning Perl has been my most enjoyable experience working as a
  systems administrator. Perl isn't the easiest language to master;
  most programmers have to rewire their brains somewhat to "think
  Perl." Once programmers have learned the basics, they have a
  powerful and rich tool for attacking most any task. But you know
  this already.

  <p>In the old days, if you wrote a program to perform data
  manipulation on some file, there were standard operations that
  had to be implemented to access the file's data. Your program
  would have to open the file, read each record and process it,
  decide what to do with the newly manipulated data, and close the
  file. Perl doesn't let you avoid any of these steps, but by
  employing some of Perl's unique features, you can express your
  programs much more concisely-and they'll be faster, too.</p>

  <p>In this article, we'll take a simple task and show how
  familiarity with Perl idioms can reduce the size and complexity
  of the solution. Our task is to display the lines of a file that
  are neither comments nor blank, and here's our first attempt:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

# Obtain filename from the first argument.

$file = $ARGV[0];

# Open the file - if it can't be opened, terminate program
# and print an error message.

open INFILE, $file or die("\nCannot open file $!\n");

# For each record in the file, read it in and process it.

while (defined($line = &lt;INFILE&gt;)) {

    # Grab the first one and two characters of each line.
    $firstchar = substr($line,0,1);
    $firsttwo = substr($line,0,2);
        
    # If the line does NOT begin with a #! (we want to see
    # any bang operators) but the first character does begin
    # with a # (we don't want to see any # comments), skip it.
    
    if ($firsttwo ne "#!" &amp;&amp; $firstchar eq "#") { next; }
        
    # Or, if the line consists of only a newline (i.e. it's
    # a blank line), skip it.
        
    elsif ($firstchar eq "\n") { next; }
        
    # Otherwise display the line to standard output (i.e.
    # your terminal).
        
    else { print $line; }
        
    # Proceed to next record.
}

# When finished processing records, be a good programmer
# and close the input file.

close INFILE;
</pre>

  <p>This script works just fine, but it's pretty large-you have to
  look at a lot of lines to figure out what it does. Let's
  streamline this code step-by-step until we're left with the bare
  essentials.</p>

  <p>First, <tt>while (&lt;&gt;)</tt> opens the files provided on
  the command line and reads input lines without you having to
  explicitly assign them to a variable. Let's remove the comments
  and change the Perl script to use this feature.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

<b>while</b> (&lt;&gt;) {
    $firstchar = substr($_,0,1);
    $firsttwo = substr($_,0,2);
    if ($firsttwo ne "#!" &amp;&amp; $firstchar eq "#") {
        next;
    } elsif ($firstchar eq "\n") {
        next;
    } else {
        print $_;
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>As each line is read, it is stored in the scalar <tt>$_</tt>.
  We changed our call to <tt>substr</tt> (which extracts or
  replaces individual characters from a string) and the
  <tt>print</tt> statement to use this internal variable.</p>

  <p>We can even make the while loop implicit as well. The -n
  switch wraps your program inside a loop: <tt>LINE: while
  (&lt;&gt;)</tt> { <i>your code</i> }.</p>

  <p>So we can shorten our little program even more:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w<b>n</b>

$firstchar = substr($_,0,1);
$firsttwo = substr($_,0,2);
if ($firsttwo ne "#!" &amp;&amp; $firstchar eq "#") { next; }
elsif ($firstchar eq "\n") { next; }
else { print $_; }
</pre>

  <p>In Perl, there's more than one way to do nearly anything-even
  good old conditionals. We can use an alternate form-and the fact
  that our loop is now named <tt>LINE</tt>-to rewrite our program
  with even less punctuation:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wn

$firstchar = substr($_,0,1);
$firsttwo = substr($_,0,2);
<b>next LINE if</b> $firsttwo ne "#!" &amp;&amp; $firstchar eq "#";
<b>next LINE if</b> $firstchar eq "\n";
print $_;
</pre>

  <p>The '<tt>next LINE</tt>' commands aren't executed unless their
  <tt>if</tt> statements are true.</p>

  <p>The intermediate variables <tt>$firstchar</tt> and
  <tt>$firsttwo</tt> make sense if they're going to be used
  repeatedly, but for our program they aren't. They require
  unnecessary amounts of time and memory. So let's eliminate them
  by using the <tt>substr</tt> function on the left side of the
  comparisons:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wn
next LINE if <b>substr($_,0,2)</b> ne "#!" &amp;&amp; substr($_,0,1) eq "#";
next LINE if <b>substr($_,0,1)</b> eq "\n";
print $_;
</pre>

  <p>Our Perl program is now down to three lines of code (not
  count-ing the <tt>#!</tt> line). By combining the two
  <tt>if</tt>s into one compound <tt>if</tt>, I can reduce the
  program to two lines:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wn
next LINE if (substr($_,0,2) ne "#!"
        &amp;&amp; substr($_,0,1) eq "#") || substr($_,0,1) eq "\n";
print $_;
</pre>

  <p>That '<tt>next LINE</tt>' statement won't fit in one column,
  but as usual There's Always More Than One Way To Shorten It.
  Using the match (<tt>m//</tt>) operator, you can construct
  regular expressions, which determine whether a string matches a
  pattern. Some simple regular expressions relevant to our
  task:</p>
  <pre>
m/^#!/     Does the string begin (^) with '#!'
m/^#/      Does the string begin (^) with '#'
m/^\n$/    Does the string begin (^) a newline (\n) and
           end ($) with it too?
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>=~</tt> and <tt>!~</tt> operators are used to test
  whether the pattern on the right applies to the string on the
  left. <tt>$string =~ /^#/</tt> is true if <tt>$string</tt> begins
  with a<tt>#</tt>, and <tt>$string !~ /^#/</tt> is true if it
  doesn't. The program can now be shortened even further:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wn
next LINE if <b>($_ !~ m/^#!/</b> &amp;&amp;<b> $_ =~ m/^#/)</b> || <b>$_ =~ m/^\n$/;</b>
print $_;
</pre>

  <p>What if there are blank lines with whitespace preceding the
  new-line? Then <tt>m/^\n$/</tt> won't be true, and the line will
  be displayed, which isn't what we want to happen. Inside a
  pattern, Perl can test for a whitespace character with
  <tt>\s</tt>, which matches not only spaces but tabs and carriage
  returns as well. Inside a pattern, you can specify how much you
  want of something with a quantifier. The quantifiers are:</p>
  <pre>
*      0 or more times
+      1 or more times
?      0 or 1 time
{x,y}  at least x but not more than y times
</pre>

  <p>Since we might have any amount of extraneous whitespace, even
  none, <tt>*</tt> fits the bill. <tt>\s*</tt> means zero or more
  whitespace characters. Added into the matching operator, our
  program now reads:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wn
next LINE if ($_ !~ m/^#!/ &amp;&amp; $_ =~ m/^#/) || $_ =~ m/^\<b>s*</b>\n$/;
print $_;
</pre>

  <p>Perl often uses <tt>$_</tt> as a default variable for its
  operators. It does this both with pattern matches and
  <tt>print</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wn
next LINE if (!m/^#!/ &amp;&amp; m/^#/) || m/^\s*\n$/;
print;
</pre>

  <p>If we're applying a pattern match to <tt>$_,</tt> we can leave
  off the <tt>m</tt> in <tt>m//</tt> matches:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wn
next LINE if <b>(!/^#!/ &amp;&amp; /^#/)</b> || <b>/^\s*\n$/;</b>
print;
</pre>

  <p>We can combine these two lines into one by using
  <tt>unless</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wn
print <b>unless</b> !/^#!/ &amp;&amp; /^#/ || /^\s*\n$/;
</pre>

  <p>Finally, we can execute this program directly from the command
  line, with the <tt>-e</tt> flag. We can even trim the semicolon
  because it's the last statement of a block.</p>
  <pre>
% perl -wne 'print unless !/^#!/ &amp;&amp; /^#/ || /^\s*\n$/'
</pre>

  <p>The result is a script that is starting to look like the
  others here in TPJ. Once you get used to these idioms, you'll
  spill out streamlined code like this without thinking. There are
  probably some Perl hackers out there who will come up with
  further optimiza-tions to this code.</p>

  <p>Have fun!</p>
