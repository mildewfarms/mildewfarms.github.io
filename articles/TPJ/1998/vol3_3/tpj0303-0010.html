  </div>

  <p>My nephew asked for help with a homework problem he was given
  for extra credit. He was given a set of digits <b><i>s</i></b>,
  an integer <b><i>n</i></b>, and was asked to come up with two
  numbers <b><i>x</i></b> and <b><i>y</i></b> such that the
  difference between x and y is as close as possible to n. Each
  <b><i>x</i></b> and <b><i>y</i></b> must be composed of digits in
  <b><i>s</i></b> with no repetitions.</p>

  <p>In mathematical parlance, here's what his particular problem
  looked like.</p>

  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td><b><i>s</i></b></td>

      <td>= (9, 2, 3, 8, 6)</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><b><i>n</i></b></td>

      <td>= 5029</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>minimize:</td>

      <td>| x - y - n |</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>where:</td>

      <td><img src="images/formula-p42.gif" border="0" alt=
      "formula"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The last statement is just a funny way of saying that
  <b><i>x</i></b> and <b><i>y</i></b> have to be composed of digits
  from <b><i>s</i></b>. For example, if you chose <b><i>x</i></b> =
  9268 and <b><i>y</i></b> = 268, you get:</p>
  <pre>
9268 &ndash; 268 = 9000
</pre>

  <p>leaving a remainder of</p>
  <pre>
9000 &ndash; 5029 = 3971.
</pre>

  <p>After convincing myself that a brute force search was
  necessary, I decided that this was a nice opportunity to explain
  what permutations are and how handy a computer can be at solving
  problems like this, at least when the number of permutations is
  small.</p>

  <p>We started out by counting the possibilities for choosing the
  numbers <b><i>x</i></b> and <b><i>y</i></b>.</p>
  <pre>
5 digits:     5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1   = 120
4 digits:       5 * 4 * 3 * 2     = 120
3 digits:         5 * 4 * 3       = 60
2 digits:           5 * 4         = 20
1 digit:              5           = 5
</pre>

  <p>In order to try all possible cases, a program would need to
  perform 325 * 325 = 105625 different subtractions. Not too bad;
  it's reasonable to expect a program to be able to try each and
  every case.</p>

  <p>Now it's time to write a program to actually try all the
  cases. This is tricker than it looks at first unless you are
  willing to write 5 * 5 different subroutines for each of the
  cases above. I wanted a general solution where I could just plug
  in the set s and the number n, and let it do all the rest. What
  we need in order to be able to try the subtraction on all these
  permutations is a good iterator</p>

  <h3>ITERATORS</h3>

  <p>Programmers use iterators to provide a way to access every
  element of a set in a particular sequence. For example, if you
  had a set of different colors, you might want to access each one
  ordered by its hue. If you had a set of jazz albums, you might
  want to access each one ordered by artist and recording date.
  Most of the time, there is a nice well-ordered set to iterate
  over and doing so is commonplace enough we don't even think about
  it anymore. If you want to print the integers between 1 and 10,
  you might do it like this:</p>
  <pre>
for ($val=0; $val&lt;10; $val++) {
print($val + 1, "\n");
}
</pre>

  <p>How about if you wanted to print the lower case letters
  between 'a' and 'z'? You might do it a slightly different
  way:</p>
  <pre>
$val = 'a';
while ($val ne 'z') {
    print $val, "\n";
    $val++;
}
print $val, "\n";
</pre>

  <p>Instead of iterating by explicitly adding 1 to each element to
  set the next element, let's generalize a bit and iterate by
  making a function call. One way to do this is to introduce a
  <b><i>state variable</i></b> that you pass to and from the
  iterating function, but is otherwise ignored by the code calling
  the function. The iterator will then use this state variable to
  generate the successor to any given state.</p>

  <p>Here is an example that iterates over the lower case letters
  just like the previous example. In this slightly contrived
  example, the state variable is simply the ASCII value of the
  letter we're interested in:</p>
  <pre>
sub <b>alpha_init</b> {
    my ($state) = shift;
    return(ord($state));
}

sub <b>next_alpha</b> {
    my ($state) = shift;
    my ($val);
    if ($state &gt;= ord('a') and $state &lt; ord('z')) {
      $state++;
    } else { $state = 0; }
    $val = chr($state);
    return($state, $val);
}

sub main {
    my ($state, $val);

    $val = 'a';
    $state = <b>&amp;alpha_init($val)</b>;
        
    while ($state != 0) {
        print $val, "\n";
        ($state, $val) = <b>&amp;next_alpha($state)</b>;
    }
}
&amp;main
</pre>

  <p>Why should we go through so much trouble? Because it's not
  always easy to determine the next state. Or our state variable
  might be so complex that there's no easier way to iterate.</p>

  <h3>DESIGNING AN ITERATOR OVER PERMUTATIONS</h3>

  <p>Now that we know we want to use an iterator to try all the
  possible combinations, what will our code look like? It looks
  much the same as the previous example:</p>
  <pre>
sub main {
    my ($s, $n);
    my ($state1, $state2, $val1, $val2);
    my ($tmp, $diff, $len, $bestleft, $bestright, $bestdiff);
        
    $s = [9, 2, 3, 8, 6];
    $n = 5029;
        
    $state1 = &amp;permute_init($s); 

    ($state1, $val1) = &amp;permute_next($state1);

    while (defined($val1)) {

        $state2 = &amp;permute_init($s);
        ($state2, $val2) = &amp;permute_next($state2);
          
        while (defined($val2)){

            # do computation involving $val1, $val2, and $n
            ($state2, $val2) = &amp;permute_next($state2);
        }
                
    ($state1, $val1) = &amp;permute_next($state1);
    }
}
&amp;main
</pre>

  <p>It's time to get our hands dirty and define
  <tt>&amp;permute_init()</tt> and <tt>&amp;permute_next()</tt>.
  Let's look at a simple example of what we are after in some
  detail. Assume we have <b><i>s</i></b> = (1, 2, 3). Our goal is
  to obtain a representation such that given our current state, we
  can return the appropriate value and generate the next state.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/vol3-3_pg43.gif" align=
  "center" alt="Figure 1: Divide and conquer" border="0" width=
  "559" height="133"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> Divide and
  conquer: Finding permutations of three by finding permutations of
  two, and finding permutations of two by finding permutations of
  one.</font></p>

  <p>When faced with a large problem, it is often useful to
  <b><i>divide and conquer</i></b>, reducing the problem to a
  smaller version of itself over and over again, until you're left
  with a trivial problem that is easily solved.</p>

  <p>In our case, we start with trying to figure out the
  permutations of a set of three numbers. It would be nice if we
  could perform a step that pulls out one of those numbers and
  leaves us with the smaller problem of finding out the
  permutations of a set of two numbers. If we can do that once
  more, we're left with a trivial problem: finding the permutation
  of one number.</p>

  <p>One way we can do the breakdown from a set of three to a set
  of two is to pull out each number in turn, keeping track of the
  number we pulled out.</p>

  <p>That would look like the Figure 1 shown above.</p>

  <p>Our Perl implementation will keep the state variable as an
  array of items, each of which is a reference to two arrays, which
  I call left and right. The left array keeps track of the things
  we pulled from the right array. The initial state is:</p>
  <pre>
[ [], [1, 2, 3] ]
</pre>

  <p>The procedure: we pop an item, check to see if the right array
  still has digits, and if it does, replace the item with all the
  successor states that can be generated from this state. A
  successor state is generated by going through each digit on the
  right, pulling it out and tacking it on the end of the digits on
  the left. So in this case, there will be three successor states
  that replace this state.</p>

  <p>If we wanted our iterator to return only combinations of three
  digits, our &amp;permute_next() function would keep pulling items
  and replacing them with successor items until it ran across an
  item where the right side was empty. Then our left side would
  represent a combination of three and that would be returned.</p>

  <p>However, in our case, we wanted not only combinations of three
  but also combinations of two and combinations of one. Looking at
  our state tree, we see that this can be done simply by returning
  what ends up on the left side--provided it isn't empty.</p>

  <p>The iterator returns <tt>undef</tt> when it has finished
  iterating.</p>

  <p>Note that since we only pull off states one at a time, but add
  them many at a time, the state variable can get pretty large.</p>

  <p>Listing 1: <a href="tpj0303-0010a.html">perm.pl</a>.</p>

  <h3>PARTING COMMENTS</h3>

  <p>When it comes time to pull a state off of the list to replace
  it with its successors, we can either pull the newest state or
  the oldest state. Which one we choose determines whether we're
  performing a <b><i>breadth-first</i></b> or
  <b><i>depth-first</i></b> search. When we're searching the entire
  state space - that is, an exhaustive search, it doesn't much
  matter which we use - unless doing it one way keeps the list
  smaller and conserves significant memory.</p>

  <p>Doing this whole exercise in Perl is a joy because with
  anonymous arrays, we don't have to worry about memory management,
  and Perl's builtin functions let you treat the array as either a
  FIFO (first-in-first-out) or LIFO (last-in-first-out) data
  structure.</p>

  <p>Oh, in case you were actually interested in the answer, here
  is what the program came up with:</p>
  <pre>
%<b> perl perm.pl</b>
105625 different possibilities were tested.
There are 4 answers that are off by 1
8926 - 3896 = 5030
8296 - 3268 = 5028
8326 - 3298 = 5028
8326 - 3296 = 5030
</pre>
