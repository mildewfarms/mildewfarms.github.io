  <p>Imagine for a moment a community in Canada's far north, one
  thousand people with not so much as a caribou between themselves
  and the North Pole. Let's let the moment grow longer, so that we
  can fill in a few details. It's suspected that this community
  might be experiencing an outbreak of a nasty disease called
  backslashitis, so the public health department has organized a
  general test of the population.</p>

  <p>Backslashitis is fatal, but it can be successfully treated if
  caught in its earliest stage. However, the treatment is almost as
  bad as the disease. It's painful, lengthy, expensive, and would
  require relocating the patient to the nearest major urban
  center-Edmonton, over two thousand kilometers away. Long-term
  studies have shown that contaminated regions tend to have one
  infected individual per thousand.</p>

  <p>The test for backslashitis isn't perfect, however. An infected
  individual will be correctly diagnosed as possessing it 99 times
  out of 100, while a healthy individual will incorrectly register
  a positive test result one time in 1000.</p>

  <p>Now, we have to make a tough decision: based on the results of
  this test throughout the population of the community, what course
  of action will we recommend to people who test positive? Are we
  willing to advise them to leave their families for months and
  endure a great deal of hardship for the sake of curing a disease
  they might not even have?</p>

  <p>I'm going to examine this situation in two ways. First, with
  probability theory, and then with Perl. In this article, I'll
  work through the simple but often misunderstood notion of
  conditional probability - a misunderstanding that applies to a
  lot more than just diseases.</p>

  <h3>PROBABILITY THEORY</h3>

  <p>My methodology is fairly straightforward. First, I will
  identify the relevant events in our scenario. Then, I'll
  determine what probabilities I know about these events. From
  here, I will apply a little probability theory to arrive at a
  guideline for making our tough decisions. Then I'll back up the
  math with some empirical data generated by a Perl program.</p>

  <p>The basic events involved here are easy to pick out from the
  scenario given above. The first of these is that a person has
  backslashitis. We'll call this event <b><i>A</i></b>. The other
  event is that the person yields a positive test result, which
  we'll call <b><i>B</i></b>. Rather than making wholly new labels
  for the complementary events of "not being infected with
  backslashitis" and "not yielding a positive test result," I'll
  just give my previously defined labels stylish flat-top hats:
  <b><i><img src="images/hat_A.gif" width="11" height="18" border=
  "0" valign="bottom" alt=""></i></b> and <b><i><img src=
  "images/tophat_B.gif" width="14" height="15" border="0" alt=
  ""></i></b>.</p>

  <p>The probability that a random person the community has the
  disease can be read directly out of the scenario:
  P(<b><i>A</i></b>) = 1/1000. Therefore, P(<img src=
  "images/tophat_A.gif" width="12" height="14" border="0" alt="">)
  = 999/1000.</p>

  <p>We don't care about P(<b><i>B</i></b>). The test only matters
  to the extent that it helps us determine whether or not an
  individual has backslashitis. What we want to find out is
  P(<i><b>A|B</b></i>), which is the probability that an individual
  is infected <b><i>given</i></b> that they have tested positive.
  The scenario doesn't tell us this, though. It tells us that
  P(<b><i>B|A</i></b>) = 99/100, which is the probability that a
  test yields a positive result given that the person is infected.
  So, P(<b><i><img src="images/tophat_B.gif" width="14" height="15"
  border="0" alt="">|A</i></b>) = 1/100. Also,
  P(<b><i>B</i></b>|<img src="images/tophat_A.gif" width="12"
  height="14" border="0" alt="">), the probability that the test
  yields a false negative, is 1/ 1000, and the probability that the
  test correctly yields a negative result is P(<img src=
  "images/tophat_B.gif" width="14" height="15" border="0" alt=
  "">|<img src="images/tophat_A.gif" width="12" height="14" border=
  "0" alt="">) = 999/1000.</p>

  <p>Really, what we want to know is
  P(<b><i>A</i></b>|<b><i>B</i></b>), the probability that a person
  has backslashitis given that their test result is positive.
  That's what will help us decide whether to recommend that they
  pack up their things and head to Edmonton. If
  P(<b><i>A</i></b>|<b><i>B</i></b>) is very nearly 1, then it is
  almost certain that the person has the disease and should be sent
  to Edmonton for treatment. Since our test is so good, what with
  P(<b><i>B</i></b>|<b><i>A</i></b>) = 99/100 and all, we would
  expect P(<b><i>A</i></b>|<b><i>B</i></b>) to be equally good...
  wouldn't we?</p>

  <p>Well, let's do the math to find out.</p>

  <p>Our primary challenge is to find a way to obtain
  P(<b><i>A</i></b>|<b><i>B</i></b>) given the information at our
  disposal above. The very definition of conditional probability
  is:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/math1.gif" width=
  "134" height="55" border="0" alt=""></p>

  <p>In English, this states that, given that <b><i>B</i></b> has
  occurred, the probability of <b><i>A</i></b> occurring is the
  probability of both <b><i>A</i></b> and <b><i>B</i></b>
  occurring, divided by the probability of just <b><i>B</i></b>
  occurring. That's great, but how can we use this to determine
  P(<b><i>A</i></b>|<b><i>B</i></b>)? We currently know neither
  P(<b><i>A</i></b> <img src="images/unhappy.gif" width="13"
  height="10" border="0" alt=""> <b><i>B</i></b>) nor
  P(<b><i>B</i></b>).</p>

  <p>Lucky for us, determining P(<b><i>B</i></b>) is pretty easy.
  The probability of a positive test result is the weighted average
  of all possible situations that might lead to such a result. In
  our situation, positive test results can be either a "true
  positive" or a "false positive."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/math2.gif" width=
  "311" height="126" border="0" alt=""></p>

  <p>Now, we need to peg down P(<b><i>A</i></b> <img src=
  "images/unhappy.gif" width="13" height="10" border="0" alt="">
  <b><i>B</i></b>). We can compute this with The Multiplicative Law
  of Probability:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/math3.gif" width=
  "285" height="21" border="0" alt=""></p>

  <p>The middle form is what will be helpful to us, seeing as we
  already know P(<b><i>A</i></b>) and
  P(<b><i>B</i></b>|<b><i>A</i></b>):</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/math4.gif" width=
  "343" height="54" border="0" alt=""></p>

  <p>With all this, P(<b><i>A</i></b>|<b><i>B</i></b>) comes out of
  the mix:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/math5.gif" width=
  "377" height="55" border="0" alt=""></p>

  <h3>WHOA!</h3>

  <p>This is something of a surprising result - even though our
  test is "99% accurate," the odds that someone with a positive
  result actually has the disease is only about fifty-fifty.</p>

  <p>With this kind of uncertainty, it's difficult to make the
  clear-cut policy decisions that we might want. But without our
  analysis, we might have send everyone to Edmonton without a
  second thought.</p>

  <h3>PERL</h3>

  <p>A quick Perl program can be useful in analyzing these
  concepts. First, it's convenient - I don't have a small northern
  community in my office, but I <i>do</i> have Linux. This will
  help me compare my analytic results to my simulated experiment as
  a sort of sanity check. Beyond that, a Perl program can allow me
  to tweak the parameters, to see if small changes in the numbers
  make for qualitatively different scenarios.</p>

  <p>The program I wrote to test these ideas, <a href=
  "tpj0303-0013a.html">prob.pl</a> is essentially a small town
  medical test simulator. It's a bit more complicated than that,
  because I have it loop through multiple experiments and multiple
  towns.</p>

  <p>The outermost loop, while (<tt>&lt;IN&gt;</tt>), parses lines
  in the external data file prob.data. Each line is an independent
  experiment, with opportunities to change the various parameters:
  the number of people in the community, P(<b><i>A</i></b>),
  P(<b><i>B</i></b>|<b><i>A</i></b>) and
  P(<b><i>B</i></b>|<img src="images/tophat_A.gif" width="12"
  height="14" border="0" alt="">).</p>

  <p>The next level of looping, <tt>for ($j = 0; $j &lt; $trials;
  $j++)</tt>, is tied to the first field in prob.data. This is a
  somewhat artificial "trial smoothing" value. Basically, this
  variable tells the program to visit N different (yet identical)
  computer-generated small towns. The program averages the results
  collected in these N trials in the hopes that this procedure will
  make the numerically generated data less subject to randomness
  and more convergent on a true value.</p>

  <p>The third and final level of looping, <tt>for ($i = 0; $i &lt;
  $pop; $i++)</tt>, is simply the number of people tested in a
  town, as given by the second field in prob.data. The procedure
  for testing a person is an amazingly straightforward random
  number test that I managed to make unduly complicated by cramming
  lots of code all in one place. First, a random number is
  generated to see if the person is "really" infected with the
  disease. If so, another is generated to see whether the test
  yields a true positive or a false negative result. If not, then a
  random number is still generated but used to see if the test
  yields a false positive or a true negative.</p>

  <p>Just shy of the halfway mark through the program, I use a
  somewhat rare form of the <tt>?:</tt> ternary operator to
  determine which of two variables is incremented:</p>
  <pre>
( <b><i>expression</i></b> ? <b><i>variable1</i></b> : <b><i>variable2</i></b> )++;
</pre>

  <p>After finishing the two innermost loops, the program evaluates
  a handful of probability statistics and displays the values using
  a Perl format. We have a top-of-page format containing the title
  and column headings of our report, and the format proper at the
  end of the program. The <tt>write_form_line()</tt> subroutine is
  called at the end of the outermost loop; the <tt>write()</tt>
  statement triggers the format, which is displayed to STDOUT.</p>

  <h3>LAST WORDS</h3>

  <p>Just as the theoretical analysis yielded a somewhat counter -
  intuitive result, the numerical trials present a few noteworthy
  points as well. I ran quite a number of these numerical
  experiments to get a feel for how things work out. Here are some
  observations. The numerically calculated probability statistics
  come very close to the theoretically determined ones, but only
  when the number of trials performed gets very large. After
  running 50 different trials of our scenario, I found a great deal
  of variation in the numeric P(<b><i>A</i></b>) between trials,
  ranging from 0 to 0.003. I'm sure that the average converges on
  the expected 0.001, but that won't be much comfort to the poor
  schmoe you sent to Edmonton to be poked and prodded.</p>
