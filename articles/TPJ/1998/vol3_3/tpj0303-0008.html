  <h4>Brian Jepson</h4>

  <p>When you're developing a non-trivial application, you'll often
  have to glue that application to something else. That something
  else could be a data server, a library of functions, or some sort
  of visual component. If there is a single, widely accepted way of
  doing things, the act of gluing doesn't have to be traumatic.
  However, it's not always this easy.</p>

  <p>If you've worked in Perl for a while, you know that there's
  more than one way to do anything, and this is especially true
  when it comes to gluing Perl to other things. You might say that
  Perl has a glue habit. It can be tricky to pick the right way to
  glue things together, but if you look the problem directly in the
  eye, you can generally make some sense of it.</p>

  <p>For example, let's take embedding. Perl offers a very simple
  embedding API; see the <b><i>perlembed</i></b> documentation for
  details. If you have the source code to a program, it's pretty
  easy to embed a Perl interpreter into it. But if you don't have
  the source code, it's difficult. And if the notion of embedding a
  language at compile time repulses you, you need an
  alternative.</p>

  <p>On Win32, you can use PerlCOM and PerlCtrl to use Perl in
  surprising places. Both PerlCOM and PerlCtrl are based on COM
  (Microsoft's Component Object Model), which allows you to glue
  objects together at run-time in a language-independent way. It's
  language-independent because you can access a COM object written
  in C++ from Perl or Visual Basic, a COM object written in Perl
  from C++ or Visual Basic, and so on. If you can develop a COM
  component in one language, you can use that component from any
  other language that supports COM. I'll demonstrate both PerlCOM
  and PerlCtrl in this article. We'll use PerlCOM to use a Perl
  module, Net::Ping, from COM. Then we'll use PerlCtrl to turn a
  chunk of Perl code, Vector.ctrl, into an ActiveX control that can
  be embedded in a web page.</p>

  <p>COM provides the low-level mechanisms to glue objects
  together. There are two ways to create controls with COM: OLE and
  ActiveX. OLE (see <a href="../vol3_2/ewtoc.html" target=
  "resource window">TPJ #10</a>) is the bulkier of the two,
  providing services for desktop applications, such as facilities
  for creating compound documents. ActiveX is a slimmer version of
  OLE that was originally optimized for embedding controls in web
  documents. However, you can use ActiveX and OLE controls in
  applications written in a high-level language such as Visual C++,
  Visual Basic, or Perl.</p>

  <p>Perl developers can use PerlCOM and PerlCtrl to leverage Perl
  in a COM environment. For example, if you've got a spreadsheet
  that needs to do some heavy regular expression work, you can use
  ActiveState's PerlCOM or PerlCtrl to call on Perl without having
  to embed Perl in the spreadsheet program itself. PerlCOM is an
  ActiveX component that exposes a Perl interpreter, and PerlCtrl
  is a tool that lets you develop ActiveX controls in Perl.
  ActiveState's PerlCOM and PerlCtrl are included with the Win32
  Perl Resource Kit, which is published by O'Reilly and Associates.
  PerlCOM and PerlCtrl may also be available separately in the
  future. Keep an eye on <a href="http://perl.oreilly.com" target=
  "resource window">http://perl.oreilly.com</a> and <a href=
  "http://www.ActiveState.com" target=
  "resource window">http://www.ActiveState.com</a> for details.</p>

  <h3>WHAT ARE PEOPLE DOING WITH COM?</h3>

  <p>People are developing all sorts of groovy things with COM -
  there's no shortage of ActiveX controls available to web
  developers. These include simple plugins such as the multimedia
  viewers to sophisticated tools like the WinFrame client, which
  allows you to launch remote Windows applications within your
  browser. ActiveX controls are available for application
  development as well, such as hierarchical data controls to data
  engines for performing mathematical manipulations.</p>

  <p>Wouldn't it be neat to be able to tap in to Perl's richness
  from within Visual Basic or a desktop application like Word or
  Excel? With PerlCOM or PerlCtrl, it's no trouble to add powerful
  WWW access to your application with something like
  libwww-perl.</p>

  <h3>VBSCRIPT FOR THE SAKE OF DISCUSSION</h3>

  <p>I'm going to use VBScript to showcase the talents of PerlCOM
  and PerlCtrl. Although VBScript is, at best, a lightweight
  development tool, it is ideal for what we need to cover in this
  article. It is a generic flavor of Visual Basic - examples
  developed with VBScript can be easily adapted to other Visual
  Basic variants, or other programming languages such as Visual
  C++, or Perl - the Win32::OLE module lets you work with COM
  objects. Also, VBScript can be used in conjunction with the
  Windows Scripting Host to develop lightweight programs that run
  from the command line. Finally, you can get it for free from
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/scripting" target=
  "resource window">http://www.microsoft.com/scripting</a>. Simply
  download and install the Windows Scripting Host, and you'll be
  able to try these examples yourself (provided you have PerlCOM
  and PerlCtrl installed).</p>

  <h3>SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?</h3>

  <p>If you're new to COM, you're probably wondering how PerlCOM
  and PerlCtrl differ. PerlCtrl is a utility that lets you build
  ActiveX controls in Perl, such as the Sample.Vector that I'll
  show later in this article. PerlCOM is an ActiveX component
  (PerlCOM.Script) that exposes a Perl interpreter. PerlCtrl is
  ideal for developing reusable controls, while PerlCOM is useful
  for adding Perl capabilities to programs written in other
  languages.</p>

  <h3>ELEMENTARY PERLCOM</h3>

  <p>Let's take a look at how we can bring a little Perl into
  Visual Basic. Before you do anything with PerlCOM, you need to
  create a PerlCOM.Script object. In VBScript, you simply use the
  Dim statement to allocate a variable for the object, and then
  create the object with the <tt>CreateObject</tt> function. You
  must use the Set statement to assign the object to the
  variable:</p>
  <pre>
Dim objPerlCOM
Set objPerlCOM = CreateObject("PerlCOM.Script")
</pre>

  <p>That's all there is to creating the object. If you want to do
  something simple, you can give the PerlCOM object
  (<tt>objPerlCOM</tt>) a little bit of Perl to evaluate using the
  EvalScript method. You simply pass a snippet of code to
  EvalScript, and it is instantly evaluated within the Perl
  interpreter that is embedded within PerlCOM.Script. This snippet
  of Perl code creates a subroutine called hello that returns the
  text <tt>Hello, World!</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
objPerlCOM.EvalScript("sub hello { return 'Hello, World!'; }")
</pre>

  <p>Now that you've defined a subroutine, you can invoke it
  through the PerlCOM object. If you'd like to display a message
  box with the return value of hello, it's as simple as this:</p>
  <pre>
MsgBox objPerlCOM.hello
</pre>

  <h3>CLASSES AND OBJECTS WITH PERLCOM</h3>

  <p>You may not know that the only way to have serious (or at
  least extreme) fun with Perl is to use its object-oriented
  features. Mix with PerlCOM, and it's more fun than a barrel of
  drunken monkeys. If there is a class that you want to use with
  PerlCOM, you can use <tt>CreateObject()</tt> to use it and create
  a new object instance. The <tt>CreateObject</tt> method accepts
  the module name and the name of the constructor as its first two
  arguments. The <tt>CreateObject</tt> method returns a
  <tt>SubPerlCOM</tt> object that exposes the methods and
  properties of the underlying instance of the Perl object (object
  is used in two senses here - see the <a href=
  "tpj0303-008a.html">glossary</a> for details).</p>

  <h3>PERLCOM EXAMPLE: USING NET::PING</h3>

  <p>Here is a simple example that uses the Net::Ping object to
  ping a remote host. <tt>Net::Ping</tt> is available separately -
  you can install it with the command ppm install
  <tt>Net::Ping</tt>. When you run this program, you must supply
  the name of the remote host, as in <tt>ping.vbs
  www.perl.com</tt>. After a couple of seconds (give or take a
  couple of seconds) you'll see a message box that states either
  <tt>www.perl.com is alive</tt> or <tt>No answer from
  www.perl.com</tt>. Here is the source code for
  <tt>ping.vbs</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
' ping.vbs
'
' Simple VBScript program to demonstrate the use of the
' Net::Ping Perl module.
'
' Get the name of the host the user wants to ping.
'
If (WScript.Arguments.Count &lt; 1) Then
MsgBox "Usage: ping.vbs hostname"
WScript.Quit
End If
host = WScript.Arguments(0)
' Create the PerlCOM object.
'
Dim objPerlCOM
Set objPerlCOM = CreateObject("PerlCOM.Script")
' Create an instance of Net::Ping and use the ICMP protocol.
'
Dim objPing
Set objPing = objPerlCOM.CreateObject("Net::Ping", "new", "icmp")
' Try to ping the remote host.
'
rc = objPing.ping(host, 3)
If (rc) Then
MsgBox host &amp; " is alive."
Else
MsgBox "No answer from " &amp; host &amp; "."
End If
</pre>

  <p>I've only touched on a couple of PerlCOM's features; there are
  others. The UsePackage method is handy when you need to use a
  module that isn't a class definition, such as
  <tt>LWP::Simple</tt> (a simple interface to libwww-perl). The
  <tt>PerlCOM::Hash</tt> feature of PerlCOM allows you to work with
  Perl hashes within a host language such as Visual Basic.
  <tt>PerlCOM::Hash</tt> wraps the hash in an ActiveX control that
  allows you to manipulate the hash and its contents.</p>

  <h3>PERLCTRL EXAMPLE: TURNING PERL CODE INTO AN ACTIVEX
  CONTROL</h3>

  <p>PerlCtrl is a utility that allows you to package a Perl module
  as an ActiveX control. The utility is an executable,
  PerlCtrl.exe, that performs two functions: with the <tt>-t</tt>
  switch, it generates a skeleton Perl control for you. You simply
  add your functionality to this template to define the control.
  When invoked without any switches, <tt>PerlCtrl.exe</tt>
  processes a Perl control and generates a DLL from it. You then
  run the Windows utility <tt>regsvr32</tt> on the DLL, and the
  control is registered and ready to use. (The <tt>regsvr32</tt>
  utility registers ActiveX components on your system. Once the
  component has been registered, other applications can use the
  ProgID (the human-readable name of the component) or the CLSID
  (the globally unique identifier for the component) to launch an
  instance of it.)</p>

  <p>The control's source file includes both the class definition
  and a special hash that defines the COM attributes of the
  control. This includes certain GUIDs (Globally Unique
  Identifiers), the control name, and information about the methods
  and properties. Here is the first part of Vector.ctrl, which
  defines a very simple Vector class:</p>
  <pre>
package Vector;
# Construct a new Vector.
#
sub new {
my $type = shift;
my $self = {};
bless($self);
$self-&gt;{array} = []; # the contents of the Vector
return $self;
}
# Add an element to the Vector.
#
sub addElement {
my $self = shift;
push @{ $self-&gt;{array} }, shift;
}
# Fetch an element from the Vector.
#
sub elementAt {
my $self = shift;
my $index = shift;
return $self-&gt;{array}-&gt;[ $index ];
}
# Retrieve the size of the Vector.
#
sub size {
my $self = shift;
return scalar @{ $self-&gt;{array} };
}
# Produce a comma-delimited representation of
# the Vector's elements.
#
sub toString {
my $self = shift;
return join(', ', @{ $self-&gt;{array} });
}
</pre>

  <p>In order to use PerlCtrl with Perl's object-oriented features,
  your package must include a method that generates an instance of
  the object. Here's the second part of Vector.ctrl:</p>
  <pre>
# Create a new instance of the Vector.
#
sub New {
return new Vector;
}
</pre>

  <p>Note that we use New instead of new - that's because this is
  code meant to be used by external languages, not by Perl.
  Finally, you must include a <tt>%TypeLib</tt> hash that defines
  the methods you want to expose. The only method you need to
  expose through the control is the New method. This method
  actually returns an instance of a PerlCOM object that exposes all
  of the methods in the Vector class (<tt>addElement</tt>,
  <tt>elementAt</tt>, <tt>size</tt>, and <tt>toString</tt>). Here
  is the third and final part of Vector.ctrl:</p>
  <pre>
=POD
=BEGIN PerlCtrl
%TypeLib = (
# Name of the package (in this file) that includes the
# method(s) you want to expose.
#
PackageName =&gt; 'Vector',
# Do not edit the next three lines. These are generated
# when you run PerlCtrl <tt>-t</tt>, and are globally unique
# identifiers.
#
TypeLibGUID =&gt; '{5A7AB274-1B74-11D2-B456-0800365DA902}',
ControlGUID =&gt; '{5A7AB275-1B74-11D2-B456-0800365DA902}',
DispInterfaceIID =&gt; '{5A7AB276-1B74-11D2-B456-0800365DA902}',
# The control name and other information.
#
ControlName =&gt; 'Sample.Vector',
ControlVer =&gt; 1, # increment if new object with same ProgID
# create new GUIDs as well
ProgID =&gt; 'Sample.Vector',
# Method information.
#
DefaultMethod =&gt; '',
Methods =&gt; {
'New' =&gt; {
RetType =&gt; VT_DISPATCH,
TotalParams =&gt; 0,
NumOptionalParams =&gt; 0,
ParamList =&gt; [ ]
},
}, # end of 'Methods'
# Property information.
#
Properties =&gt; {
# No properties
}, # end of 'Properties'
); # end of %TypeLib
=END PerlCtrl
=cut
</pre>

  <p>Once you have a complete Perl control source file, you can
  generate its DLL by running it through PerlCtrl:</p>
  <pre>
PerlCtrl Vector.ctrl
Vector.ctrl syntax OK
Creating PerlCtrl Vector.dll ...all done.
</pre>

  <p>Next, you must run the DLL through the registry server with
  the command <tt>regsvr32</tt> <i>dllname</i>, such as
  <tt>regsvr32 Vector.DLL</tt>. If it is successful, you will see a
  message box with the text <tt>DLLRegisterServer in Vector.dll
  succeeded</tt>.</p>

  <p>The next example is a simple VBScript program that uses the
  Sample.Vector control to create two Vector objects. It then adds
  some elements to the Vectors and displays them in two different
  ways, as shown below.</p>

  <p>Here is the source code for Vector.vbs:</p>
  <pre>
' Vector.vbs
'
' A simple PerlCtrl example.
'
' Create an instance of the Sample.Vector object. This object
' is used to generate instances of the Vector class.
'
Dim objVectorFactory
Set objVectorFactory = CreateObject("Sample.Vector")
' Create two Vectors.
'
Dim objVectorOne
Set objVectorOne = objVectorFactory.New
Dim objVectorTwo
Set objVectorTwo = objVectorFactory.New
' Add some elements to our Vectors.
'
objVectorOne.addElement("A")
objVectorOne.addElement("B")
objVectorOne.addElement("C")
objVectorTwo.addElement("X")
objVectorTwo.addElement("Y")
objVectorTwo.addElement("Z")
' Display a message box with the string representation of
' objVectorOne's elements.
'
MsgBox objVectorOne.toString, vbOkOnly, "Vector One"
' Loop through objVectorTwo and produce a cr/lf
' delimited string with the index and values
'
message = ""
For i = 0 To objVectorTwo.size - 1
value = objVectorTwo.elementAt(i)
message = message &amp; "Element " &amp; i &amp; " = " &amp; value
message = message &amp; chr(10) &amp; chr(13)
Next
MsgBox message, vbOkOnly, "Vector Two"
</pre>

  <h3>OTHER PLACES</h3>

  <p>There is more to the Perl and COM picture than I've discussed
  here. PerlCOM and controls developed with PerlCtrl can both be
  used with DCOM (Distributed COM), which provides a low-hassle way
  to launch COM objects on remote machines. In fact, PerlCOM and
  controls you develop with PerlCtrl need no modification to work
  with DCOM. You just need to set their permissions with the
  <tt>DCOMCNFG.EXE</tt> utility to allow remote users to launch
  instances of the objects on your machine.</p>

  <p>The future will bring exciting possibilities, as well. In the
  current incarnation of PerlCtrl, controls you develop require
  Perl on each machine you want to launch the control on. Future
  revisions of PerlCtrl may include the ability to develop
  standalone controls that can be bundled up and shipped out. World
  domination through Perl is a distinct possibility at this
  point!</p>
