  <p>On January 22, 1998, Netscape announced that the source code
  for its flagship client software product, Netscape Communicator,
  would be freely available for modification and redistribution on
  the Internet. Other programs have been developed using open
  source models before, but this was the first time a commercial
  software company allowed broad access to the source code of a
  major shipping product.</p>

  <p>When Communicator was developed solely within Netscape, it was
  a sizable development effort that required a good deal of
  coordination to manage. With the release of the Communicator
  source code, the group of developers working on the code at any
  one time grows from hundreds to thousands. It may seem that a
  development effort of this size may be impossible to manage, but
  successful open source development projects such as Perl, Linux,
  and Apache have proven that a distributed, loosely organized
  group of developers can be very effective at developing
  high-quality software rapidly.</p>

  <p>While several factors are required for success, including a
  compelling need for the software and a good base of code from
  which to start, the most important is a person or group trusted
  by the development community to lead and guide the development
  effort. To fill this role, Netscape created mozilla.org to
  provide leadership for the Communicator source code. Mozilla.org
  is responsible for fostering communications among developers,
  maintaining Communicator source code, and hosting Communicator
  source code as well as other developer tools on the mozilla.org
  web site.</p>

  <p>Mozilla.org isn't just about Communicator source code. Other
  developer tools such as source code to the Netscape Directory and
  Mission Control Console software development kits are also
  available through mozilla.org. Netscape Directory SDK gives
  developers the complete set of software libraries, command-line
  utilities, sample code, and documentation needed to build
  applications that access networked directory data using the
  Light-weight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).</p>

  <p>LDAP was developed at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor
  in conjunction with the Internet Engineering Task Force, and is
  the Internet directory protocol for accessing and managing
  directory services. It is a distributed database application
  designed to manage the entries and attributes in a directory and
  makes them available to users and other applications. The
  Netscape Directory Server is an example of an LDAP-compliant
  directory service.</p>

  <p>For example, you might use a directory service to look up
  someone's telephone number, or to retrieve a list of email
  addresses.</p>

  <p>An LDAP-enabled server manages and provides information about
  users and organizational structures, such as groups and
  departments. Examples of LDAP clients might include the HTTP
  gateway to the Netscape Directory Server, Netscape Navigator, and
  Netscape Communicator. The gateway uses the directory service to
  find, update, and add information about users. The Netscape
  Directory SDK provides developers with the tools to access the
  LDAP layer.</p>

  <p>Netscape plans to expand the set of tools with the release of
  PerLDAP source code-Perl modules that allow developers to access
  and manipulate LDAP-enabled directories quickly and easily. Until
  now, Perl users would have to write complex Perl code or use C or
  Java to access LDAP. PerLDAP will increase productivity by
  abstracting the lower level details of LDAP with an
  object-oriented Perl interface. You will be able to easily
  search, add, delete, and update directory entries with minimal
  knowledge of LDAP. Here's a demonstration of PerLDAP:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use Perldap;

$ldap = new Perldap("mars", "3006",
        "cn=Directory Manager, corp=Corporate Express",
        "administrator");
                
$entry = $ldap-&gt;search("corp=Corporate Express",
                       "subtree","objectclass=company");
                                           
$ldap-&gt;printentry($entry) if $entry;

while ($entry = $ldap-&gt;entry) {
    $ldap-&gt;printentry($entry);
}

$ldap-&gt;close;
</pre>

  <p>This program creates a Perldap object to create a connection
  to the directory server running on host mars, on port
  <tt>3006</tt>, as <tt>cn=Directory Manager</tt>,
  <tt>corp=Corporate Express</tt>, with <tt>administrator</tt> as
  password. Then it searches for all the directory entries where
  <tt>objectclass=company</tt>, in the subtree <tt>corp=Corporate
  Express</tt>, and prints out the information contained in each
  entry. Finally, it closes the connection to the directory
  server.</p>

  <p>PerLDAP source code and documentation are available for
  download on Mozilla.org and CPAN. PerLDAP binaries are also
  available on Netscape's DevEdge site, <a href=
  "http://developer.netscape.com" target=
  "resource window">http://developer.netscape.com</a>.</p>

  <p>The development process for Netscape-branded products in the
  open source development world is very similar to Netscape's
  production process today, with one key difference - Netscape is
  no longer the sole contributor to the Communicator source code.
  Instead, Netscape will benefit from the best of both worlds,
  using its own development team to develop new features, while
  selecting the best enhancements from the open source development
  to create Netscape-branded versions of software.</p>
