  <p><font size="+2">V</font>RML, the Virtual Reality Modeling
  Language, enables you to describe complicated 3D scenes and
  interactions with them in a platform-independent way. It has even
  been standardized by ISO (ISO/IEC 14772-1:1998), but while the
  technology is interesting, it hasn't really caught on, mostly for

  while many people who could create applications for the

  <p>Not long ago, I needed a <b><i>real</i></b> VRML browser for
  Linux. So I decided to write one. This is the story of how I got
  the prototype up and running in just a couple of hours. I have
  modified some of the gory details to show the final, cleaned-up
  APIs instead of my first attempts which were not quite
  presentable. In this article, I'll talk about how I use Perl to
  parse the VRML language; that is, how my program turns VRML files
  into something that Perl can understand. In a future article,
  I'll show how I embedded that parser into a web browser to
  display the images.</p>

  <h3>VRML FILE FORMAT</h3>

  <p>An example is better than a thousand words--here is a small
  VRML file that describes a blue ball with radius 1.5 centered at
  the point (0, 1, 0). A snapshot of the scene is shown below. I've
  changed the background to white for convenience, although the
  default background in VRML is black. I didn't want to bother you
  with the additional complexity of adding a Background node, which
  you can read about in the in VRML documentation.</p>
  <pre>
#VRML V2.0 utf8
Transform {
    translation 0 1 0
    children [
       Shape {
         appearance Appearance {
            material Material {
                   diffuseColor 0 0 0.8
            }
        }
        geometry Sphere {
            radius 1.5
        }
      }
   ]
}
</pre>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/vrml-fig1_sm.jpg" align=
  "center" alt="Figure 1: A VRML Object" border="0" width="120"
  height="125"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> A VRML
  Object.</font></p>

  <p>The first line identifies the VRML version and encoding used.
  To understand the rest of the file, you need to know that most
  VRML consists of <b><i>nodes</i></b> and <b><i>fields</i></b>,
  which are properties of those nodes. Let's start from the node
  called <tt>Shape</tt>. (By convention, nodes start with capital
  letters and fields begin with lowercase letters.) We specify two
  fields for this node, <tt>appearance</tt> and <tt>geometry</tt>.
  As the value for <tt>geometry</tt> we provide another node, a
  <tt>Sphere</tt> with one field, <tt>radius</tt>, with value 1.5.
  The value for the <tt>appearance</tt> field of the sphere is a
  little more complicated it is an <tt>Appearance</tt> node, which
  for its <tt>material</tt> field has a <tt>Material</tt> node,
  which for its <tt>diffuseColor</tt> field has 0 0 0.8 as value--a
  bright blue. The <tt>Shape</tt> node in turn is the value of the
  <tt>children</tt> field of a <tt>Transform</tt>, whose
  <tt>translation</tt> is <tt>0 1 0</tt>--one meter upwards.</p>

  <p>This description may seem a little verbose to express such a
  simple shape. For longer files, it is possible to optimize some
  of the complexity by declaring prototypes (akin to C
  <tt>#define</tt> statements, but with named instead of positional
  parameters). However, for this simple file, there can be no
  shorter description. VRML violates the credo familiar to Perl
  programmers: "Easy things should be easy, and hard things should
  be possible." VRML has concentrated only on making complicated
  things possible. That's because VRML is meant more as a portable
  file transfer format than a programming language, and is more
  suited for automatic generation than hand coding. I'm currently
  planning to write (in Perl, of course) a text-based authoring
  system that will look like VRML but deal with the common cases
  more elegantly. So our file consists only of nodes, their fields,
  and comments. In turn, the fields may have other nodes as their
  values. Full VRML97 is slightly more complicated than this, so
  let us immediately make life more difficult and introduce the
  fact that you can refer to nodes via DEF and USE. See Figures 2
  and 3.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/vrml-fig2_sm.jpg" align=
  "center" alt="Figure 2: Two Overlapping Cylinders" border="0"
  width="120" height="150"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2:</b> Two
  Overlapping Cylinders.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/vrml-fig3_sm.jpg" align=
  "center" alt="Figure 3: Two Overlapping Cylinders" border="0"
  width="120" height="126"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 3:</b> Both Cylinders
  are the same Object so a change in one affects the
  other.</font></p>

  <p><br></p>
  <pre>
#VRML V2.0 utf8
DEF CYL Shape {
     appearance Appearance {
         material Material {
           diffuseColor 0.8 0.8 0
         }
     }
     geometry Cylinder {
     }
}

Transform {
     translation -0.4 0.5 0.5
     children [
        USE CYL
     ]
}
</pre>

  <p>This file contains two (overlapping) copies of the
  <tt>Shape</tt> node. The difference between this scene and one
  that has a second copy of the <tt>Shape</tt> node: If, say, the
  color of one cylinder is changed later, the color of the other
  cylinder changes as well. There is only one node.</p>

  <h3>THE API</h3>

  <p>Every VRML-compliant browser performs three tasks: reading the
  VRML file, managing the internal scene graph (including
  event-based animations), and rendering the scene on your display.
  In this article, we're concentrating on the first two tasks and
  their interaction.</p>

  <p>In order to be able to parse future VRML formats (such as
  compressed binaries, which are being developed by the VRML
  consortium), it would be nice to have a concise API between the
  parser and the scene graph so that the parser can explain any
  structure with a fixed set of methods. Separating these two
  components lets us change one without having to worry about the
  other. For instance, it would be possible to create a program
  that transforms VRML worlds in some way by plugging the browser
  onto a different backend, or create VRML worlds in the scene
  manager with simple Perl method calls, so we get functionality
  equivalent to Sun's Java3D as a bonus for Perl.</p>

  <p>Let us encapsulate the API so that we can focus on the parser.
  We'll use a Perl object for the scene manager. We need methods to
  create new nodes, establish <tt>DEF/USE</tt> dependencies, and
  name the topmost nodes of the scene:</p>
  <pre>
$n = $s-&gt;new_node($typename, 
            {field =&gt; $val, field2 =&gt; $val2});

$d = $s-&gt;new_def($name, $node);

$u = $s-&gt;new_use($name);

$s-&gt;topnodes($nodes);  # nodes is an array reference
</pre>

  <p>That's all there is to it--now that we've settled on these
  methods as our API, we don't need to know about their
  implementation to dive into the parser.</p>

  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>The Details, Part 1: Dynamic Function Calls (<a href=
      "tpj0303-0003a.html">Listing 1</a>).</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>THE PARSER</h3>

  <p>Let's examine the file format more closely. It's actually dead
  simple. At any given moment, we are expecting the next thing to
  be either the beginning of a VRML node (possibly
  <tt>DEF/USE</tt>), a field name (or the curly brace finishing the
  node), or a field value. In fact, we can reduce this even further
  by noting that a node is simply a field value of the generic VRML
  type <tt>SFNode</tt>, so parsing a VRML file is equivalent to
  parsing a node--except that a file has no brackets.</p>

  <p>And that's how we'd write the parser if we were coding it
  top-down, from the most generic types to the most specific. But
  let's code bottom-up and define a package for each field type,
  named <tt>VRML::Field::</tt><b><i>type</i></b>. Each package will
  have a subroutine called <tt>parse()</tt> that accepts two
  parameters: the scene into which we are inserting new nodes, and
  the string we are parsing. Each subroutine will return a scalar
  that describes the field value parsed starting at the position
  using <tt>\G</tt> (see the <b>perlre</b> documentation, and
  <a href="tpj0303-0003b.html">Listing 2</a>). For instance,</p>
  <pre>
package VRML::Field::SFVec3f;
sub parse {
    $_[2] =~ /\G\s*($Float)\s+
                   ($Float)\s+
                   ($Float)\b/ogscx
          or die "$_[2] at $p didn't match SFVec3f: '",
                 $type-&gt;es($_[2]), "'\n";
    return [$1, $2, $3];
}
</pre>

  <p>where the variable <tt>$Float</tt> has been defined as</p>
  <pre>
$Float = q( [\deE+\-\.]+ );
</pre>

  <p>Note that we don't use the usual idiom at the beginning of the
  subroutine (see <a href="images/vrml-fig3_sm.jpg">Figure
  3</a>):</p>
  <pre>
sub parse {
my ($type, $scene, $string) = @_
</pre>

  <p>This would make a copy of the string, wasting memory and
  making it impossible to use <tt>\G</tt>. The members of the
  <tt>@_ array</tt>, however, are passed by reference so we can use
  <tt>\G</tt>.</p>

  <p>Parsing simple VRML field values seems clear enough, and we
  can easily write more of these subroutines later to handle
  different field types. We can even use inheritance:</p>
  <pre>
package VRML::Field::SFColor;
@ISA=VRML::Field::SFVec3f;
</pre>

  <p>This implements parsing for colors. Since colors have the same
  syntax as 3-D vectors, this lets us reuse the vector code to
  parse colors.</p>

  <p>Note that I already chose (without telling you) the basic
  representation of field values natural to Perl. The
  <tt>SFVec3f</tt> field is represented as a reference to an array
  containing three scalar members, giving the components of the
  vector along each axis.</p>

  <p>In order to parse the nodes, we need to know the type of all
  its fields. For the moment, let us assume they are stored at
  <tt>$VRML::Nodes</tt>{<b><i>nodetype</i></b>}{<tt>FieldTypes</tt>}{<b><i>fieldname</i></b>}.</p>

  <p>Given all this, we can write the function to parse an
  <tt>SFNode</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
package VRML::Field::SFNode;
sub parse {
    my ($type, $scene) = @_;
    $_[2] =~ /\G\s*($Word)\b/ogsc or
        parsefail($_[2], "SFNode didn't begin with a word!");
    my $nodetype = $1;
    if ($nodetype eq "NULL") {return "NULL"}
    if ($nodetype eq "DEF") {
        $_[2] =~ /\G\s*($Word)\b/ogsc or
        parsefail($_[2],"DEF must be followed by defname");
        my $defname = $1;
        my $node = VRML::Field::SFNode-&gt;parse($scene,$_[2]);
        return $scene-&gt;new_def($defname, $node);
    }
    if ($nodetype eq "USE") {
        $_[2] =~ /\G\s*($Word)\b/ogsc or
            parsefail($_[2],"USE must be followed by defname");
        my $usename = $1;
        return $scene-&gt;new_use($usename);
    }
    my $fieldtypes = $VRML::Nodes{$nodetype}{FieldTypes};
    if (!defined $fields) {
        parsefail($_[2], "Undefined node type '$nodetype'");
    }
    my %fields;
    while ($_[2] !~ /\G\s*}/gsc) {
        $_[2] =~ /\G\s*($Word)\s+/ogsc or
            parsefail($_[2], "Field name not found");
        my $fname = $1;
        my $ftype = $fieldtypes-&gt;{$fname};
        if (!defined $ftype) {
            parsefail($_[2],"Unknown field '$fname' for '$nodetype'");
        }
        $fields{$fname} = "VRML::Field::$ftype"-&gt;parse($scene,$_[2]);
    }
    return $scene-&gt;new_node($nodetype, \%fields);
}
</pre>

  <p>Here, <tt>$Word</tt> is a variable containing a pattern (see
  <a href="tpj0303-0003b.html">Listing 2</a>). It's interpolated
  into match (<tt>//</tt>) expressions several times, and is
  defined like so:</p>
  <pre>
$Word = q([^+0-9"'#,\.\[\]\\{}\0-\x20-][^"'#,\.\{\}\\{}\0-\x20]*);
</pre>

  <p>That's how VRML defines an identifier, allowing characters
  like the dash to appear in identifiers, unlike most other
  languages. Note how we don't just parse the next word if we get a
  DEF, but recurse, calling <tt>parse()</tt> again. We need the
  recursion, because statements like <tt>DEF FOO1 DEF FOO2 DEF FOO3
  USE BAR</tt> are legal VRML. Not that they are particularly
  useful.</p>

  <p>There is one more thing we need to parse the VRML files shown
  above: we need to be able to handle MFNodes. An SFNode is a
  single node; an MFNode is an array of SFNodes. However, since all
  the MF types are related to the SF types in the same way, we can
  cut corners and define all of the MF types in one stroke:</p>
  <pre>
package VRML::Field::Multi;
sub parse {
    my($type,$scene) = @_;
    my $stype = $type;
    $stype =~ s/::MF/::SF/;
    if ($_[2] =~ /\G\s*\[\s*/gsc) {
        my @a;
        while($_[2] !~ /\G\s*,?\s*\]\s*/gsc) {
            $_[2] =~ /\G\s*,\s*/gsc; # Eat any commas
            my $v = $stype-&gt;parse($scene, $_[2], $_[3]);
            push @a, $v if defined $v;
        }
        return \@a;
    } else {
        my $res = [$stype-&gt;parse($scene, $_[2], $_[3])];
        # Eat comma if it's there
        $_[2] =~ /\G\s*,\s*/gsc;
            return $res;
        }
}
package VRML::Field::MFNode;
@ISA=qw/VRML::Field::Multi/;

package VRML::Field::MFVec3f;
@ISA=qw/VRML::Field::Multi/; ...
</pre>

  <p>We've made frequent use of the <tt>parsefail()</tt> subroutine
  along the way. It simply prints out an error message depending on
  the position:</p>
  <pre>
sub parsefail {
    my $p = pos $_[0];
    my $n = ($p&gt;=50 ? 50 : $p);
    my $textb = substr($_[0], $p-$n,$n);
    my $texta = substr($_[0], $p,50);
    die("PARSE ERROR: '$textb' XXX '$texta', $_[1]");
}
</pre>

  <p>This way the position of the error is pinpointed for the user
  with the <tt>XXX</tt> so that it will be easier to figure out
  what went wrong.</p>

  <p>Now we just pull it all together: the following measly little
  subroutine will actually parse our chosen subset of VRML</p>
  <pre>
sub parse {
    my($scene, $text) = @_;
    $text =~ s/#.*\n//g; # Remove comments
    my @a;
    while ($text !~ /\G\s*$/gsc) {
        push @a, VRML::Field::SFNode-&gt;parse($scene, $text);
    }
    $scene-&gt;topnodes(\@a);
}
</pre>

  <p>This function parses a string of VRML code and places the
  structure into <tt>$scene</tt>, the scene manager object. Now we
  can test this toy parser by creating an impromptu scene manager.
  The scene manager prints out the things passed to it and returns
  incremented strings (<tt>"Node1"</tt>, "<tt>Node2</tt>",...) from
  <tt>new_node()</tt> and the other functions in our API.</p>

  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td>The Details, Part 3: Pass By Reference (<a href=
      "tpj0303-0003c.html">Listing 3</a>).</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>REALITY</h3>

  <p>There are several things where we have simplified the
  situation a little to fit it all into this article. For instance,
  the parser as I describe it here chokes on strings that look like
  comments:</p>
  <pre>
Text {
        string "
                  Foo
# The browser will think this is a comment "
}
</pre>

  <p>Now the poor parser is hopelessly confused. We do need a more
  complicated regex to remove comments.</p>

  <p>Also, in order to do <b><i>real</i></b> VRML, our parser needs
  to be expanded to handle prototypes (<tt>PROTO</tt> declarations,
  in VRML parlance) and events. Furthermore, a particular node
  called <tt>Script</tt> is tricky, because it can define its own
  fields. However, it is possible if we let our parser define new
  node types on the fly.</p>

  <p>And this is exactly what I've done: the toy project has grown
  into a full-blown VRML browser called FreeWRL, which implements
  the <tt>VRML::Browser</tt> module. The home page of the project
  is at http://www.iki.fi/~lukka/freewrl. The browser is
  approaching full VRML97 compliance fast, with scripting working
  for Java and JavaScript as well as several navigation paradigms
  and True-Type text support.</p>
