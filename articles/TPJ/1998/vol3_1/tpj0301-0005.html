  <p>I've written a <b>Module Installation Guide</b> about how to

  contains the proposed charter) in news.announce.newgroups and the
  discussion in news.groups and on comp.lang.perl.misc.</p>

  <p>Four more Perl User Groups have formed: the <b>Boston, D.C.,

  <p>Joshua Pritikin released <b>Manifest</b>, creates file

        <p>The CPAN is the world's distributed, replicated
        repository of Perl utilities. Unless noted otherwise, you
        can find everything in this column on the CPAN. Visit Tom
        Christiansen's multiplexer to be redirected to a CPAN site
        near you:</p>

        <div align="center">
          <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN" target=
          "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN</a>
        </div>

        <p>You'll be able to find the modules under the author's
        name, at <a href=
        "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-authors" target=
        "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-authors</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/INSTALL.html"
        target=
        "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/INSTALL.html</a>
        has instructions on how to build modules on all major
        operating systems.</p>

        <p>You can also use Andreas K&ouml;nig's CPAN module to
        automatically install modules. Once you've installed it,
        <tt>perl -MCPAN -e 'install(" modulename")</tt>' will
        automatically download, build, and install the module for
        you.</p>

        <p>If you'd like to contribute your module to the CPAN,
        good for you! Read <a href=
        "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/04pause.html" target=
        "resource window">CPAN/modules/04pause.html</a> for
        details.</p>

  <p>Like Mike Stok's <b>Text::Soundex</b> module, Michael
  Schwern's <b>Text::Metaphone</b> converts words to a lossy
  phonetic representation. <b>Tkst::Mtfn</b>, by Mxl Skrn, knfrts
  rts t a fntk rprsnt.</p>

  <p>The <b>TacacsPlus</b> module, by Mike Shoyher, is a Perl
  extension for authentication on tacacs+ servers.</p>

  <p>Two more SGI modules have been uploaded: Jesse Glick's
  <b>SGI::FAM</b>, which lets you monitor filesystem activity, and
  <b>Jail</b>, Just Another Image Library.</p>

  <p>Mark-Jason Dominus uploaded a <b>Memoize</b> module, which
  caches function-argument pairs: if you call <tt>function(4)</tt>
  twice, the second invocation returns immediately. A proof that
  regex matching is NP-complete can be found on his web site at
  <a href="http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/NPC/index.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/NPC/index.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Advance notice: the <b>3rd Annual Obfuscated Perl Contest</b>
  will be formally announced next issue. Categories are likely to
  be 'Most Powerful', 'Most Creative', and 'Best "The Perl
  Journal"'. Information will be available on the TPJ Web site.</p>

  <p>New modules should be cleared with the modules@perl.com
  mailing list before uploading to the CPAN. We don't review the
  code so much as ensure that new modules have appropriate
  names.</p>

  <p>Too many CPAN modules are by developers for developers. We
  need more modules like Business::UPS, which probably took very
  little time to write, yet appeals to a lot of people who wouldn't
  have known about Perl otherwise.</p>
