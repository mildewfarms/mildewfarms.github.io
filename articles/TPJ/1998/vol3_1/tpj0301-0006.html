  Web servers aren't very friendly. When a CGI program fails,
  you're typically greeted with a brusque and uninformative server
  error, with no constructive criticism about why the program
  failed. The detective work is left to the person maintaining the
  program. Sometimes the program's author is unavailable, making
  diagnosis all the more difficult.

  <p>I present four methods for dealing with uncooperative CGI
  programs. The first two, "Fiddling with <tt>die()</tt>" and
  "Redirecting STDERR", demonstrate basic techniques in error
  handling that you can apply to more than just CGI programs. The
  third method illustrates the CGI::Carp module, which adapts those
  two methods to the Web. The last method should be part of every
  CGI developer's arsenal - a custom built error handling routine
  that not only outputs error messages to the right places, but can
  also send mail alerts or take other action to fix the
  problem.</p>

  <p>A respected physicist once told me that an expert is someone
  who has made every mistake. I'll defer the expert moniker and
  simply share what I've learned from my mistakes.</p>

  <h3>1. Fiddling With <tt>die()</tt></h3>

  <p>What happens when you need to fix a CGI program written by
  someone else? I've had plenty of clients ask me to patch their
  existing program so they'd have something in production while I
  created a long-term solution. Along the way, I've encountered
  many CGI programs that - unfortunately - use <tt>die()</tt>.
  Usually the problem is a failed <tt>open()</tt> that triggers the
  <tt>die()</tt> and terminates the program before the HTTP header
  is printed. The result is an invalid Web page and an infuriating
  error message from the server.</p>

  <p>The first time I was given a CGI program that used
  <tt>die()</tt>, I simply replaced all occurrences of die with
  something else:</p>
  <pre>
     s/die/$another_thing/g;
</pre>

  <p>That was a big mistake, since the three letters '<tt>die</tt>'
  aren't always a function call. Luckily, no one was around to see
  this. I needed a more intelligent approach.</p>

  <p>Rather than changing every instance of '<tt>die</tt>', I now
  simply redefine what <tt>die()</tt> does. Instead of printing to
  STDERR, I have <tt>die()</tt> print to STDOUT, starting with the
  HTTP header.</p>

  <p>I change what <tt>die()</tt> does with <tt>$SIG{_ _DIE_
  _}</tt>, which is triggered whenever any <tt>die()</tt> is
  called. I set it to an anonymous subroutine to redirect
  <tt>die()</tt>'s message from STDERR to STDOUT. The same trick
  works for <tt>warn()</tt> with <tt>$SIG{_ _WARN_ _}</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl 
&#13;# use an anonymous subroutine to replace die()'s 
# default behavior 
&#13;<b>$SIG{_ _DIE_ _}</b> = sub { 
    my $message = shift; 
&#13;    print STDOUT "Script died with this message:\n";
    print STDOUT "$message\n"; 
}; 
&#13;print STDOUT "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
print STDOUT "This is from STDOUT\n"; 
&#13;# If /etc/pass doesn't exist, the die() triggers.
open FILE, '/etc/pass' or <b>die "Can't open /etc/pass: $!\n";</b> 
</pre>

  <p>This is a great tool if you inherit a program from a
  colleague, but I don't recommend it if you're creating your own
  program from scratch. It's probably fine for short scripts, but
  someone reviewing your code might not remember that you're
  trapping <tt>die()</tt> several hundred lines later. (Not that I
  know this from experience.)</p>

  <h3>2. Redirecting STDERR To STDOUT</h3>

  <p>What happens if your program redefines <tt>die()</tt>, but
  still prints to STDERR? If STDERR flushes before the server
  receives a proper HTTP header, you still lose.</p>

  <p>I once had to debug a complicated mess of CGI programs whose
  documentation seemed to be in a seven-bit encoding of Cyrillic.
  The tangle of <tt>require()</tt>s and files was such a mess that
  I couldn't figure out what was printing to STDERR. I wanted to
  see the error message so I could infer where it came from, but I
  was on a VT100 terminal and watching the server log was annoying
  and time-consuming. Running the script from the command line
  interwove STDOUT and STDERR into an indecipherable pile of
  HTML.</p>

  <p>I decided to redirect STDERR to STDOUT so that I could see the
  error message in Lynx, which would also nicely format the HTML.
  There is an example under "How do I capture STDERR from an
  external command?" in the Perl FAQ, but my situation was a bit
  trickier since I needed to print things in a certain order to
  avoid errors from Web server:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
&#13;BEGIN {
    # we want STDOUT to flush right away 
    $| = 1; 
    print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
}
&#13;open STDERR, "&gt;&amp;STDOUT";
&#13;print STDOUT "This is from STDOUT\n"; 
print STDERR "This is from STDERR\n";
&#13;die 'This is from die';
</pre>

  <p>Notice that I set STDOUT to autoflush. If I don't do that,
  STDERR flushes first and I get a "Malformed header from script"
  error, even though I printed the HTTP header in a BEGIN
  block.</p>

  <h3>3. Using CGI::Carp</h3>

  <p>Now that I've shown you the basics of managing fatal errors
  and STDERR, you can forget about them. Use Lincoln Stein's
  CGI::Carp module, bundled with the standard Perl distribution.
  CGI::Carp traps fatal errors with ease and sends them elsewhere.
  It contains two functions providing simplistic error handling -
  <tt>carpout()</tt> and <tt>fatalsToBrowser()</tt>.</p>

  <p>The <tt>carpout()</tt> function lets you redirect the output
  from <tt>die()</tt>, <tt>warn()</tt>, <tt>croak()</tt>,
  <tt>confess()</tt>, and <tt>carp()</tt> to another filehandle.
  The CGI::Carp documentation suggests setting up the redirection
  in a BEGIN block to catch compile-time errors:</p>
  <pre>
  BEGIN {
      use CGI::Carp qw(carpout); 
      open(ERROR_LOG, "&gt;&gt;my_error_log") 
                      or die("my_error_log: $!\n");
      carpout(\*ERROR_LOG); 
  }
</pre>

  <p>Beware! We've now redirected STDERR to a file. STDERR is where
  Perl prints the <tt>carpout.cgi syntax OK</tt> message after you
  test it from the command line with perl <tt>-cw carpout.cgi</tt>.
  I forgot this when I tried it the first time, and here's what I
  saw:</p>
  <pre>
    dog[32] perl -cw carpout.cgi 
    dog[33]
</pre>

  <p>I couldn't figure out what I'd done wrong. The <tt>-c</tt>
  switch (which checks a program for syntax errors without running
  it) always prints <i>something</i>. Running the script was
  equally fruitless; since its whole job was to <tt>die()</tt> that
  output disappeared into the cornfields too.</p>
  <pre>
    dog[36] ./carpout.cgi 
    dog[37]
</pre>

  <p>When I play with redirection, I usually need to draw a picture
  of what's redirected where to prevent such memory lapses.</p>

  <p>I still needed to send the HTTP header to the server, since
  the <tt>carpout()</tt> function doesn't do that. The second
  method, <tt>fatalsToBrowser()</tt>, redirects fatal messages from
  <tt>die()</tt>, <tt>croak()</tt>, or <tt>confess()</tt> to the
  browser along with a minimal set of HTTP headers so that the
  server won't complain. It uses <tt>$SIG{_ _DIE_ _}</tt> to trap
  <tt>die()</tt> statements:</p>
  <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl 
&#13;use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser); 
&#13;open FILE, "quotes.txt" or die "Can't open: $!\n";
&#13;    ...your code here...
&#13;close FILE;
</pre>

  <p>Some HTML is then sent to my browser:</p>
  <pre>
   &lt;H1&gt;Software error:&lt;/H1&gt; 
   &lt;CODE&gt;No such file or directory 
   &lt;/CODE&gt; 
   &lt;P&gt; 
   Please send mail to this site's webmaster for help.
</pre>

  <p>and the error message is neatly recorded in the error log
  along with the time and filename.</p>
  <pre>
[Wed Mar 18 04:20:48 1998] test.cgi: No such file or directory
</pre>

  <h3>4. Rolling Your Own</h3>

  <p>By far the best solution for large projects is to make a
  custom error handling routine. Instead of using <tt>die()</tt>, I
  have my own routine which I export from a module:
  <tt>cgi_error()</tt>. I can do various janitorial tasks while
  making sure that I get an intelligent message in the browser if
  something went wrong. I can even send myself nasty little mail
  messages:</p>
  <pre>
sub cgi_error { 
    my $message = shift; 
&#13;    print &lt;&lt;"HTTP";
Content-type: text/plain
&#13;there was an error:
&#13;$message 
HTTP
&#13;    open MAIL, '| /usr/lib/sendmail -t -odq -oi';
    print MAIL &lt;&lt;"MESSAGE"; 
	
To: brian@sri.net
From: jiminy_cricket\@sri.net 
Subject: Your groovy CGI, baby.
&#13;something horrible has happened: 
$message 
MESSAGE
&#13;    close MAIL; 
}
</pre>

  <p>I use <tt>cgi_error()</tt> wherever I'd normally use
  <tt>die()</tt>.</p>

  <p>I can add even more to <tt>cgi_error()</tt> to collect any
  other data that I need to diagnose the problem, and perhaps even
  to fix it. This was especially handy with one script that needed
  to be setuid. If it wasn't setuid, it lacked the permissions it
  needed to lock a database, and looped forever.</p>

  <p>The program itself didn't break. There were no server errors.
  It simply ate as much processing time as it could, making the Web
  site seem very slow. A well-tuned <tt>cgi_error()</tt> diagnosed
  the problem - if the script couldn't get the database lock after
  several tries, it called <tt>cgi_error()</tt>, which made a few
  inquiries. Was the process with the lock still running? If not,
  <tt>cgi_error()</tt> launched a program to release the zombie
  lock. Did the program have the right permissions? If not,
  <tt>cgi_error()</tt> called a script that gave proper permissions
  to the program.</p>

  <p>Whenever my <tt>cgi_error()</tt> attempts to fix a problem, it
  sends me a message saying what it tried to do - and what actually
  happened. I have found this to be a far superior solution to
  listening to clients complain "I don't know what's wrong with it
  - it's just broken!" or waking up before three in the afternoon
  to diagnose the problem manually. Once I developed a satisfactory
  <tt>cgi_error()</tt> function, I spent much less time
  debugging.</p>
