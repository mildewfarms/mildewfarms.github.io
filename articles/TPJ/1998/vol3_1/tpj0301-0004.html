  <h4><i>Steve Lidie</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  <font size="+2">L</font>ast year, I mowed my lawn on a warm and
  wonderful late summer day. As I followed my usual mowing pattern.
  I wondered if there was a better way to do it. In this article,
  we'll use Perl/Tk to visualize some different mowing patterns and
  see how well they represent reality.

  <h3>Our Mower is Programmable!</h3>

  <p>For this exercise we have at our disposal a programmable
  robotic mower. Our job is to write a software simulation of
  lawnmowing. It's exceedingly difficult to model the complexities
  of the physical world with a computer, so we'll make some
  simplifying assumptions. First, we'll define the lawn as a
  rectangular area without trees, gardens, rocks, ponds, or cats.
  (I once saw a solar-powered robot that mowed in a random
  direction until it bumped into something, at which time it took
  off in a new, random, direction. Given enough time, it would mow
  any area completely. I hear these mowers use color/luminance to
  detect edges, so I guess my cats are safe as long as they don't
  turn green.) The lawn is also a perfect mowing surface without
  bumps or undulations, and the grass has uniform thickness; this
  way we know that the mower can be steered accurately. Finally,
  we'll assume the mower has a turning radius of zero: that is, it
  can pivot. (Automatic mowers that are always going forward have a
  nonzero turning radius.)</p>

  <h3>A Canvas Widget is the Lawn</h3>

  <p>To represent the mowing area, we'll use a Perl/Tk canvas
  widget, colored chlorophyll green of course. Let's assume that to
  program the mower all we need is to write Perl/Tk code that
  overlays various items that display the mower's path (lines,
  arcs, ovals and such) on the canvas, making sure that no green
  remains. Our first program starts by mowing (drawing a line) 100
  feet in a straight line and turning right. It repeats three times
  until it's mowed the periphery of the lawn. Then the mower shifts
  right by the width of one cut (I mow clockwise), and repeats the
  process until there's nothing left to mow.</p>

  <h3>Defining the Perl Mowing Module</h3>

  <p>We'll be creating several variants of the mowing program, so
  we'll program for reusability by including constants in a module,
  Mow.pm. This module simply exports a list of variables. It's not
  object-oriented, although it does inherit some methods from
  Exporter. Here it is:</p>
  <pre>
# Mow.pm - mowing module.
&#13;package Mow;
&#13;use 5.004; 
use Exporter; 
@ISA = qw(Exporter); 
@EXPORT = qw/$CHLOROPHYLL $COLOR $CUT $D2R $PPF $SIDE $TURN/;
&#13;$CHLOROPHYLL = '#8395ffff0000'; # rye-grass-green, maybe
$COLOR = 0xffff;                # initial line color
$CUT = (38 / 12);               # cut width in feet
$D2R = 3.14159265 / 180.0;      # map degrees to radians
$PPF = 2;                       # pixels/foot
$SIDE = 100;                    # size of square mow area
$TURN = (27 / 12);              # turn radius in feet
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>When Perl sees a use Mow statement it populates the program
  with the variables from the <tt>@EXPORT</tt> list. With the
  definitions <tt>$CHLOROPHYLL</tt>, <tt>$CUT</tt>, and
  <tt>$SIDE</tt> in place (more on 'color numbers' like
  <tt>$CHLOROPHYLL</tt> shortly) we can write a simple zero turning
  radius mowing program.</p>

  <h3>Zero Turning Radius, Take One</h3>
  <pre>
use Mow; 
use Tk; 
my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
my $canvas = $mw-&gt;Canvas(-width =&gt; $SIDE, 
                       -height =&gt; $SIDE,
                -background =&gt; $CHLOROPHYLL)-&gt;grid;
$mw-&gt;waitVisibility;
</pre>

  <p>A chlorophyll green, 100-pixel-square canvas is created and
  gridded. The <tt>waitVisibility()</tt> statement forces Tk to
  display the canvas before the program can proceed, so we can
  watch the mowing process in real time. Otherwise, the simulation
  might complete before we could see it. All we need to do now is
  define a recursive subroutine and call it once:</p>
  <pre>
<b>mow $canvas, 0, 0, $SIDE, $SIDE;</b>
&#13;sub <b>mow</b> {                 # Recursively mow until done.
    my($canvas, $x1, $y1, $x2, $y2) = @_; 
    return if $x1 &gt;= $x2 or $y1 &gt;= $y2;
&#13;    $canvas-&gt;createLine($x1, $y1, $x2, $y1, $x2, $y2, 
                        $x1, $y2, $x1, $y1);
&#13;    $canvas-&gt;idletasks; 
    $canvas-&gt;after(250);
&#13;    <b>mow $canvas, $x1+$CUT, $y1+$CUT, $x2-$CUT, $y2-$CUT;</b>
} # end mow
</pre>

  <p>Besides the reference to the canvas, the arguments to
  <tt>mow()</tt> are simply coordinates of the top left and bottom
  right corners of a square. <tt>mow()</tt> calls the
  <tt>createLine()</tt> to paint four line segments - one across
  the top, right, bottom, and left of the canvas, in that order.
  Then <tt>mow()</tt> updates the display and waits a quarter of a
  second (<tt>$canvas-&gt;after(250)</tt>) before invoking itself
  again, to mow a smaller square. Here's the not-so-satisfying
  result:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/zero-tr1.gif" width="112" height="130" border=
    "0" alt="100 Pixel Square Canvas">
  </div>

  <p>The main problem is that the width of the cut is pencil thin,
  so the robot leaves lots of green behind. Luckily,
  <tt>createLine()</tt> has some options that help.</p>

  <h3>The Canvas Line Item Type</h3>

  <p><tt>createLine()</tt> draws a line between two points. If you
  provide more than two points, it draws a series of joined line
  segments. The line segments can even be smoothed using a Bezier
  spline with the <tt>smooth</tt> parameter, as this code
  demonstrates:</p>
  <pre>
my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
my $canvas = $mw-&gt;Canvas(qw/-width 90 -height 100/)-&gt;grid;
&#13;$canvas-&gt;createLine(qw/10 25 20 55 48 15 80 95 -fill blue/);
$canvas-&gt;createLine(qw/10 25 20 55 48 15 80 95 
                                 -fill red -smooth yes/);
</pre>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/spline.gif" width="108" height="134" border=
    "0" alt="Bezier Spline: spline.gif">
  </div>

  <p>The ends of a single line segment can be adorned in several
  ways - with arrowheads (the <i>widget</i> demo, which Tk installs
  in the same directory as Perl, shows you the arrowheads to choose
  from), or one of these shapes, called a <i>capstyle</i>:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/capstyles.gif" width="178" height="104"
    border="0" alt="Capstyle Line Segments">
  </div>

  <p>Capstyles become important as the width of the line increases.
  In the previous picture the fat lines with capstyles were each 25
  pixels long and 20 pixels wide. The skinny white lines connect
  the same canvas points, but have a width of 1 and no capstyle.
  Notice that the width of the fat items is equally apportioned on
  each side of the connecting line.</p>

  <p>But our mowing program cuts with multiple, fat, and connected
  line segments, so we need to use another attribute called the
  <i>joinstyle</i>.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/joinstyles.gif" width="172" height="100"
    border="0" alt="JoinStyle Line Segments">
  </div>

  <p>The miter's right angle looks ideal. Finally, fat lines can be
  filled with a solid color or a stipple. The next version of
  <tt>mow()</tt> uses graduated fill colors to highlight the
  mower's path.</p>

  <h3>Zero Turning Radius, Take Two</h3>

  <p>Putting everything together gives us the program below, called
  <tt>zero-tr2</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
my $canvas = init; 
<b>mow $canvas, (0, 0), ($SIDE, $SIDE); </b>
<b>MainLoop;</b>
&#13;
sub <b>init</b> { 
    my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
    my $mow_side = $SIDE * $PPF; 
    my $canvas = $mw-&gt;Canvas(-width =&gt; $mow_side,
                            -height =&gt; $mow_side,
                         -background =&gt; $CHLOROPHYLL)-&gt;grid;
    $mw-&gt;waitVisibility; 
    return $canvas; 
} 
&#13;sub <b>mow</b> {         # Recursively mow until done.
    my($canvas, $x1, $y1, $x2, $y2) = @_; 
    return if $x1 &gt;= $x2 or $y1 &gt;= $y2; 
    my $color = sprintf("#ffff%04x%04x", $COLOR, $COLOR); 
    $COLOR -= 0x0800;
    $canvas-&gt;createLine($x1 * $PPF, $y1 * $PPF,  
                        $x2 * $PPF, $y1 * $PPF,       
                        $x2 * $PPF, $y2 * $PPF,       
                        $x1 * $PPF, $y2 * $PPF,       
                        $x1 * $PPF, $y1 * $PPF, 
          -width =&gt; $CUT * $PPF + 0.5, -fill =&gt; $color, 
          -joinstyle =&gt; 'miter');
&#13;    $canvas-&gt;idletasks; 
    $canvas-&gt;after(250);
    <b>mow $canvas, $x1+$CUT, $y1+$CUT, $x2-$CUT, $y2-$CUT;</b>
} # end mow
</pre>

  <p>Four comments:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The variable <tt>$PPF</tt> is the scaling factor, in pixels
    per foot, which enlarges the canvas for better viewing.</li>

    <li>Anywhere a color name like <tt>CadetBlue</tt> or
    <tt>MediumOrchid4</tt> is specified, a hexadecimal RGB number
    can be substituted. The program starts by drawing lines with a
    fully saturated color and darkens it slightly each time
    <tt>mow()</tt> is called.</li>

    <li>The mowing width is a floating point number that must be
    rounded after scaling. Try running <i>zero-tr2</i> without the
    0.5 rounding term and see what happens. For a great primer on
    floating point gotchas, read <i>Unreal Numbers</i> in <a href=
    "../vol2_4/tpj0204-0001.html" target="resource window">TPJ
    #8</a>.</li>

    <li>All line segments are joined with a miter cut.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Rotating Simple Objects in Canvas Space</h3>

  <p>Let's complicate matters and assume our robot is in the shop
  for repairs. We have an older model with a nonzero turning
  radius; that is, it turns with an arc, leaving a small swath of
  green behind. To simulate this, the mowing program could draw
  connected lines and arcs for each side of the mowing area. While
  these eight items are still manageable, it might be easier to
  define one line and one arc, and have <tt>mow()</tt> rotate them
  as required.</p>

  <p>Rotating a line in a Cartesian coordinate space is simple if
  one of the endpoints is at (0, 0). Then the rotation reduces to
  rotating the other endpoint. Given such a point (<i>x,y</i>), we
  can rotate it through the angle q using these equations:</p>
  <pre>
           x' = x cos q &ndash; y sin q 
           y' = x sin  q + y cos q
</pre>

  <p>(<i>x', y'</i>) is the new location of the point.</p>

  <p>Rotating a line about an arbitrary point requires that the
  line be translated to the origin, rotated, and then translated
  back to its original location. The following code rotates
  (clockwise) the line whose endpoints are (0,0) and (20,40) about
  the center point of the canvas, (65,65). It draws a line and then
  creates an invisible <i>bounding rectangle</i>. We'll employ one
  of those shortly to define an oval for the turning radius
  arc.</p>
  <pre>
my $mw = MainWindow-&gt;new; 
my $canvas = $mw-&gt;Canvas(-width =&gt; 130, -height =&gt; 130)-&gt;grid;
$mw-&gt;waitVisibility;
&#13;my $origin = 65;          # origin of canvas
&#13;my($x2, $y2) = (20, 40);  # endpoint of line segment 
rotate $canvas, 0,   $x2, $y2, 'black'; 
rotate $canvas, 90,  $x2, $y2, 'red'; 
rotate $canvas, 180, $x2, $y2, 'green'; 
rotate $canvas, 270, $x2, $y2, 'blue';
&#13;<b>MainLoop;</b>
&#13;sub <b>rotate</b> {
    my($canvas, $theta, $x2, $y2, $color) = @ARG; 
    $theta *= $D2R;            # degrees to radians 
    my $nx2 = $x2 * cos($theta) - $y2 * sin($theta); 
    my $ny2 = $x2 * sin($theta) + $y2 * cos($theta);
&#13;    $canvas-&gt;createLine (0+$origin, 0+$origin, $nx2+$origin,
                        $ny2+$origin, -fill =&gt; $color);
&#13;    $canvas-&gt;createRectangle(0+$origin, 0+$origin,
       $nx2+$origin, $ny2+$origin, -outline =&gt; $color);
&#13;    my $coords = sprintf("(%d,%d)", int($nx2), int($ny2));
&#13;    $canvas-&gt;createText ($nx2+$origin, $ny2+$origin, 
                   -text =&gt; $coords, -font =&gt; 'fixed');
&#13;    $canvas-&gt;idletasks; 
    $canvas-&gt;after(250);
&#13;} # end rotate
</pre>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/rotate.gif" width="148" height="164" border=
    "0" alt="Invisible Bounding Rectangle">
  </div>

  <h3>The Canvas Rectangle and Text Item Types</h3>

  <p>The previous code introduced two new canvas items: rectangle
  and text. Like the mowing area, two diagonally opposed corners
  define a rectangle (here, the endpoints of the rotating line
  segment). You can't do much else with a rectangle other than
  specify the width and color of its outline, or fill it with a
  color or stipple.</p>

  <p>The canvas text item annotates the business end of a line with
  its coordinates (the other endpoint is always (0,0)). These
  floating point values are truncated without rounding, which is
  why some of the numbers are a bit off. Text items can be
  anchored, justified and filled, as you'd expect. There are
  methods to insert and delete characters, too.</p>

  <h3>The Canvas Arc Item Type</h3>

  <p>The tools for the next mowing program are now at hand. We can
  take a line and rotate it through an arbitrary angle and draw it
  anywhere on the canvas. We can also use the two points that
  define a line and draw a rectangle instead, at any angle,
  anywhere on the canvas. And since an arc is defined by an oval
  which is defined by a bounding rectangle, we can rotate and draw
  an arc anywhere on the canvas.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/arcstyles.gif" width="192" height="150"
    border="0" alt="Different Arc Styles">
  </div>

  <p>The three different arc styles were created with the following
  statements. The first four elements represent the bounding
  boxes:</p>
  <pre>
$canvas-&gt;createArc(qw/10 10 50 50 -start 0 -extent 270 
           -style pieslice -fill black -stipple error/)
; 
$canvas-&gt;createArc(qw/70 10 110 50 -start 45 -extent -135 
                                         -style chord/);
&#13;$canvas-&gt;createArc(qw/130 10 170 50 -start -90 -extent -180 
                                          -style arc/);
</pre>

  <p>Each arc has a starting angle and an extent, both in degrees,
  with zero degrees along the x-axis. Positive angles rotate
  counterclockwise and negative angles clockwise. The pie slice arc
  is stipple filled with a Tk built-in bitmap.</p>

  <h3>Nonzero Turning Radius, Take One</h3>

  <p>The new controller code starts by defining two points: an
  endpoint of a line, and one corner of the arc's bounding box. The
  point (0,0) doubles as the line's other endpoint, as well as the
  opposite corner of the arc's bounding box. The bounding box is
  square because the mower's circular turning radius must fit
  inside.</p>
  <pre>
@LINE = ($SIDE, 0); # initial straight line mowing path 
@ARC  = ($TURN, $TURN); # generic turning radius arc
</pre>

  <p>The change to mow(): it now rotates the line and arc, computes
  three points, and then draws the two items (the full program is
  called nz-tr1). Points one and two are the line's endpoints;
  points two and three are the arc's bounding box. Thus, the end of
  the line and the start of the arc coincide. Here's an
  excerpt:</p>
  <pre>
$canvas-&gt;createLine($start[0], $start[1], $end[0], $end[1], 
                     -fill =&gt; $color, -width =&gt; $CUT, 
                 -capstyle =&gt; 'round', -tags =&gt; 'path');
&#13;($x2, $y2) = @ARC[0,1]; 
$nx2 = $x2 * cos($theta) - $y2 * sin($theta); 
$ny2 = $x2 * sin($theta) + $y2 * cos($theta);
&#13;$canvas-&gt;createArc($end[0], $end[1], $end[0]+$nx2, $end[1]+$ny2, 
                   -start =&gt; 270-20-$angle, -extent =&gt; 180+40, 
                   -style =&gt; 'arc', -outline =&gt; $color,  
                   -width =&gt; $CUT, -tags =&gt; 'path');
</pre>

  <p>This simulation produces the same visible results as the zero
  turning radius code.</p>

  <h3>Canvas Tags</h3>

  <p>The previous snippet demonstrates tags, a powerful canvas
  concept. Tags are simply strings used to identify canvas items,
  which you add or delete as needed. A canvas item can have any
  number of tags, and the same tag can be applied to any number of
  items. The mowing program uses the <tt>path</tt> tag to group all
  the lines and arcs that define the mowing path. (Every canvas
  item has at least one tag, the string <tt>all</tt>.)</p>

  <p>Tags are supplied to canvas methods to select which items to
  operate upon; for example, this binding turns all fat lines and
  arcs into skinny lines and arcs. This allows the green canvas
  background to show through:</p>
  <pre>
$canvas-&gt;CanvasBind('&lt;Double-1&gt;' =&gt; sub { 
           $canvas-&gt;itemconfigure('path', -width =&gt; 1)
                                        });
</pre>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/nz-tr1-skinny.gif" width="212" height="260"
    border="0" alt=
    "Turning Fat lines and Arcs into Skinny Lines and Arcs">
  </div>

  <h3>Scaling Canvas Items</h3>

  <p>A canvas can also be scaled to implement a primitive zoom
  function. Scaling adjusts each of the points defining an item by
  changing the points' distance from an origin by the scale factor.
  For example, this code uses the middle of the canvas as the
  origin and doubles the X and Y coordinates of all items tagged
  with the string <tt>path</tt>. Scaling doesn't affect the line
  width, however.</p>
  <pre>
my $origin = $SIDE / 2; 
my $zi = $zf-&gt;Button(qw/-text ZoomIn -command/ =&gt; 
                      [$canvas =&gt; 'scale', 'path', 
                       $origin, $origin, 2.0, 2.0]);
</pre>

  <p>After a few presses of the ZoomIn button we see this
  detail:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/nz-tr1-zoom.gif" width="212" height="260"
    border="0" alt="Zoom In">
  </div>

  <h3>The Real World is Uncertain</h3>

  <p>I can't mow as nicely as the robot. As I turn my tractor it
  continues to move forward, so the turning arc isn't circular but
  almost teardrop in shape. My mowing surface is sloping and bumpy,
  and I don't always start and finish turns at the same time. So no
  two turns are identical. My sloppiness often leads to uncut
  grass, as illustrated here:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="images/nz-tr2-sloppy.gif" width="218" height="264"
    border="0" alt="Uncut Grass">
  </div>

  <p>I realized this was more like reality, and the global view of
  the situation gave me an idea. Modifying the program, I used two
  lines to paint a large X on the canvas, and a few trials later
  found that this code sufficed to cut the remaining grass:</p>
  <pre>
$canvas-&gt;createLine(0, 0, $SIDE, $SIDE, 
           -width =&gt; (2 * $CUT)+0.5, -fill =&gt; 'yellow');
$canvas-&gt;createLine($SIDE, 0, 0, $SIDE, 
           -width =&gt; (2 * $CUT)+0.5, -fill =&gt; 'yellow');
</pre>

  <p>So the magic number was two mower widths, a trip up and back
  each diagonal. Last year I went out and performed the experiment,
  and the results agreed nicely with theory: my magic number was
  three: a trip up, back, and up each diagonal.</p>
