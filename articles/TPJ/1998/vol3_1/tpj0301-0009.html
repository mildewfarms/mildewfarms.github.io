  <h2 align="center">How Regexes Work</h2>

  <h4><i>Mark-Jason Dominus</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  This isn't an article about how to use regexes; you've seen
  plenty of those already. It's about how you would write a regex
  package from scratch, in a language like C that didn't already
  have one.

  <p>I'll demonstrate a new module, Regex.pm, which implements
  regexes from nothing, in Perl. The implementation is very similar
  to the way Perl's own regexes are implemented, so you'll get a
  good idea of how Perl's regexes work on the inside.</p>

  <p>Here's the basic strategy. We'll see a simple kind of
  'machine' that reads some input, one character at a time, and
  then, depending on what's in the input and on the various wheels
  and gears in the machine, says either 'yes' or 'no'. The machines
  are simple, and it turns out that if we have a regex, it's not
  hard to construct a machine that says 'yes' for exactly those
  strings that match the regex, and 'no' for all the other
  strings.</p>

  <p>When our program wants to see if <tt>S</tt> matched
  <tt>/R/</tt>, it'll do something like this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Look at <tt>R</tt>.</li>

    <li>Construct the machine that corresponds to <tt>R</tt>.</li>

    <li>Feed <tt>S</tt> into the machine.</li>

    <li>If the machine says 'yes', then <tt>S</tt> matched
    <tt>/R/</tt>.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, it didn't.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Maybe this sounds bizarre, but bizarre or not, it's what Perl
  does. If you can follow what we do in this article, you'll know
  what Perl is really up to when it performs a regex match.</p>

  <h3>Machines</h3>

  <p>We're on a tight budget here, so our machines will be made of
  circles and arrows instead of wheels and gears. Here's a
  machine:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph1.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 1" border="0" width="375" height="102"></p>

  <p>Let's see if this machine says 'yes' to the string
  "<tt>abaa</tt>". How do we do that?</p>

  <p>We start by putting a penny down on the <b>M</b> circle,
  because the <b>M</b> circle is the 'start circle.' We can tell
  that <b>M</b> is the start circle because it has that arrow
  pointing to it that says 'start'. The letter <b>M</b> could have
  been anything; it's not actually part of the machine. I just put
  it on so you would know which circle I meant.</p>

  <p>Now the machine will read the first character in the string:
  "<tt>a</tt>". There's an arrow leading out of the <b>M</b> circle
  that's labeled "<tt>a</tt>", so we move the penny along the arrow
  from <b>M</b> to <b>J</b>.</p>

  <p>Next the machine will read the "<tt>b</tt>". The penny moves
  back to <b>M</b>. Then the machine reads another "<tt>a</tt>",
  and the penny moves back once more to <b>J</b>. Finally, the
  machine reads the last "<tt>a</tt>", and the penny follows the
  "<tt>a</tt>" arrow that leads from <b>J</b> back to <b>J</b>.</p>

  <p>The penny is finally on <b>J</b>. We're done. So, how do we
  tell if the machine said 'yes'? The rule is this: Some circles,
  like J, are double circles. These are called 'final circles.' At
  the end of the input, if there are any pennies on final circles,
  the machine says yes. If no pennies are on final circles, the
  machine says 'no'. In this case, there's a penny on <b>J</b>, so
  the machine says 'yes'.</p>

  <p>Now, that's not so hard to do, and it's easy to see that this
  machine will say 'yes' to some strings and 'no' to others. It so
  happens that it says 'yes' to any string that is matched by the
  regex <tt>/^(a|b)*a$/</tt>, and 'no' to all the strings not
  matched. We say that the machine is <i>equivalent</i> to the
  regex.</p>

  <p>Soon we'll see how to make machines that are equivalent to any
  regex we like. First, though, we'll add a couple of features to
  the machines that will make this easier.</p>

  <h3>Blank Arrows</h3>

  <p>So far every arrow we've seen has been labeled with a letter.
  But some machines have unlabeled arrows, like this:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph2.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 2" border="0" width="400" height="154"></p>

  <p>The instant a penny arrives in any circle with a blank arrow
  leading out of it, we place <i>another</i> penny on the circle at
  the far end of the blank arrow.</p>

  <p>Let's look at the machine above and see what it says about
  "<tt>ab</tt>". The start circle is <b>V</b>, so we start out by
  putting a penny there. And then, because there's a blank arrow
  from <b>V</b> to <b>W</b>, we immediately put a second penny on
  <b>W</b>. Now the machine is ready to read input. It reads the
  "<tt>a</tt>". The penny on <b>V</b> moves along the arrow to
  <b>V</b>, and the penny on <b>W</b> moves along the arrow to
  <b>X</b>, so we now have pennies on <b>V</b> and <b>X</b>. Now,
  because there's a blank arrow leading from <b>X</b> to <b>Y</b>,
  we place a third penny on <b>Y</b>, and because there's a blank
  arrow from <b>V</b> to <b>W</b>, we place a fourth penny on
  <b>W</b>.</p>

  <p>Next the machine reads "<tt>b</tt>". The penny on <b>Y</b>
  moves to <b>Z</b>. But what happens to the pennies on <b>V</b>,
  <b>W</b>, and <b>X</b>? There's a special rule for this: Pennies
  that have nowhere to go must leave. We take away the pennies on
  <b>V</b>, <b>W</b>, and <b>X</b>. Only the penny on <b>Z</b>
  remains.</p>

  <p>Now the machine is done reading the input. There's a penny on
  <b>Z</b>, which is a final circle, so the machine says 'yes'.</p>

  <p>Sometimes a machine will have two arrows from the same circle
  that also have the same label:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph3.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 3" border="0" width="300" height="184"></p>

  <p>The penny here starts on <b>V</b>. What happens when this
  machine reads the string "<tt>b</tt>"? There's a "<tt>b</tt>"
  arrow from <b>V</b> to <b>W</b> and also from <b>V</b> to
  <b>X</b>. The rule here is simple: The penny clones itself. One
  clone goes one way and the other goes the other way, and we end
  up with pennies on both <b>W</b> <i>and</i> <b>X</b>.</p>

  <p>You'll notice blank arrows from <b>X</b> to <b>Y</b> and from
  <b>X</b> to <b>Z</b>; as soon as the penny arrives at <b>X</b>,
  we put new pennies on <b>Y</b> and <b>Z</b> also. Then, because a
  penny just arrived at <b>Z</b>, we put one on <b>U</b> as
  well.</p>

  <h3>Rules Again</h3>

  <p>Before we see how to turn a regex into a machine, let's re-cap
  the rules for moving pennies:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>To start, put a penny on the circle labeled 'start'.</li>

    <li>If there is a blank arrow leading from <b>X</b> to
    <b>Y</b>, then whenever a penny arrives at <b>X</b>, put
    another penny at <b>Y</b> also.</li>

    <li>Whenever the machine reads an input character <tt>c</tt>,
    move all the pennies. If a penny is on a circle that has an
    outgoing arrow labeled "<tt>c</tt>", move the penny along the
    arrow, and then follow rule 2 if appropriate. If there is more
    than one such arrow, the penny clones itself and one clone
    follows each arrow. If a penny is on a circle with no arrow
    labeled "<tt>c</tt>", remove that penny.</li>

    <li>When all input is read, the machine says 'yes' if any penny
    is on a final circle, and 'no' otherwise.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Perhaps you can imagine that it might not be hard to write a
  program to carry out these four simple rules, to keep track of
  where the pennies are, and to yield the final 'yes' or 'no'.</p>

  <p>And in fact that's exactly how regexes work. Perl turns the
  regex into a machine, simulates the positions of the pennies, and
  at the end of the input reports whether any pennies are on final
  circles.</p>

  <p>Now the only question left is: How can we turn a regex into a
  machine?</p>

  <h3>How To Turn A Regex Into A Penny Machine</h3>

  <p>First, we're going to assume that all our regexes are anchored
  at the front and the back. That is, we're only going to deal with
  regexes that look like <tt>/^P$/</tt>, where <tt>P</tt> might be
  complicated. It turns out that this doesn't give anything away,
  because if <tt>/Q/</tt> is some regex that isn't anchored, then
  <tt>/^.*Q.*$/</tt> is a completely equivalent anchored regex that
  matches the same strings. If someone wanted us to make a machine
  for <tt>/Q/</tt>, we could make one for <tt>/^.*Q.*$/</tt>
  instead, and they'd never be the wiser. From now on I'm going to
  leave out the <tt>^</tt> and the <tt>$</tt>, because it makes the
  examples easier to read.</p>

  <p>There are two kinds of regexes. They're either very simple
  things like <tt>/x/</tt>, or they're more complex things, built
  out of simpler regexes. For example, if <tt>P</tt> is a regex,
  then <tt>P*</tt> is also a regex. That means we're going to have
  to do two things: We'll have to see how to build simple machines
  for the simple regexes, and we'll have to see how to combine
  those simple machines into more complicated machines.</p>

  <p>Here's the machine for the regex <tt>/a/</tt>:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph4.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 4" border="0" width="250" height="64"></p>

  <p>Stare at this a while to convince yourself that it really says
  'yes' only for the string "<tt>a</tt>" and not for any other
  string. What does it say about the empty string? What about
  "<tt>b</tt>"? "<tt>aa</tt>"?</p>

  <p>And here's an even simpler machine. It's equivalent to
  <tt>//</tt>.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph5.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 5" border="0" width="250" height="63"></p>

  <p>Remember that I left out <tt>^</tt> and <tt>$</tt>, so
  <tt>//</tt> really matches only the empty string, and the
  equivalent machine will say 'yes' only for the empty string.</p>

  <p>Now let's suppose we already have machines for <tt>/P/</tt>
  and <tt>/Q/</tt>, and let's try to figure out how to make a
  machine for <tt>/P|Q/</tt>. That's pretty easy.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph6.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 6" border="0" width="400" height="138"></p>

  <p>The penny starts on the left. Clones are immediately created
  and move to the circles that used to be the start circles for
  <b>P</b> and for <b>Q</b>. For the machine to say 'yes', the
  <b>P</b> penny must make its way to what used to be <b>P</b>'s
  final circle, or the <b>Q</b> penny must make its way to what
  used to be <b>Q</b>'s final circle; if either of those things
  happen, that penny will clone itself to the real final circle on
  the far right. If neither of those things happens, no penny will
  escape from either machine <b>P</b> or machine <b>Q</b>. Any
  string that <b>P</b> would have matched will get a penny through
  <b>P</b> to the final circle, and any string that <b>Q</b> would
  have matched will get a penny through <b>Q</b> to the final
  circle. So this machine says 'yes' for any string that either
  <b>P</b> or <b>Q</b> would have said 'yes' to, and not to any
  other strings. That's exactly what we wanted.</p>

  <p>How about if we have machines for <tt>/P/</tt> and
  <tt>/Q/</tt>, and we want to make a machine for <tt>/PQ/</tt>? We
  can do it like so:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph7.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 7" border="0" width="400" height="116"></p>

  <p>It's easy to see that we can chain together as many machines
  as we want this way. For example, here is a machine that is
  equivalent to the regex <tt>/perl/</tt>:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph8.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 8" border="0" width="400" height="42"></p>

  <p>Now let's tackle <tt>P+</tt>, which turns out to be a little
  easier than <tt>P*</tt>.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph9.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 9" border="0" width="400" height="78"></p>

  <p>Once the penny passes through <b>P</b>, it clones itself. One
  clone immediately moves to the final circle, and one moves back
  to the beginning of <b>P</b> to try again, in case there are more
  <b>P</b>s coming up.</p>

  <p>Now that we've seen this, <tt>P*</tt> is easy too; we just
  short-circuit the beginning to the end, so that the penny doesn't
  have to go through <b>P</b> even once.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph10.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 10" border="0" width="400" height="102"></p>

  <p>Oh, now we're done.</p>

  <h3>What Do You Mean, Done?</h3>

  <p>Well, we left out character classes. But [<tt>abc</tt>] is
  just the same as (<tt>a|b|c</tt>), so we can handle that by
  pretending that the user wrote it that way.</p>

  <p>We left out <tt>\d</tt>, <tt>\s</tt>, and all those things.
  But those are just character classes. '.' is also a character
  class if we don't mind writing it as
  (<tt>\000|\001|...|\255</tt>). That makes the machine big and
  inefficient, but hey, it works. We'll see later on how to make it
  better.</p>

  <p>We left out <tt>?</tt>. But <tt>P?</tt> is just the same as
  (<tt>P|</tt>), so it's really there too. And we left out
  <tt>{n}</tt>. But <tt>P{3}</tt> is just the same as <tt>PPP</tt>,
  so we really don't need <tt>{n}</tt>. Similar arguments work for
  <tt>{m,}</tt> and <tt>{m,n}</tt>.</p>

  <p>We left out the non-greedy quantifiers. But those don't change
  <i>whether</i> the regexes will match, only how the regexes
  match, so they don't affect our program. We can ignore them.</p>

  <p>We left out <tt>^</tt> and <tt>$</tt>, but they're in there by
  default; if you want to take them away you can attach <tt>.*</tt>
  at the beginning or the end or both.</p>

  <p>We left out zero-width assertions like <tt>\b</tt> and
  <tt>(?:...)</tt> and <tt>(?!...)</tt>. But this is an
  introductory article, so I made a command decision to leave them
  out. We also left out backreferences, but I'll show how to put
  them in later, just to prove I'm not a slacker.</p>

  <p>By the way, this construction for turning regexes into
  machines was invented in 1968 by a fellow named Ken Thompson. You
  may have heard of Thompson: He and Dennis Ritchie invented Unix
  around the same time.</p>

  <h3>The Regex Module</h3>

  <p>The module has three parts. It has a part for turning strings
  into regexes, a part for turning regexes into machines, and a
  part for shuffling the pennies around. Here's a program that
  looks to see whether the string "<tt>abbbbb</tt>" matches the
  pattern <tt>/^ab+$/</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
use Regex;
&#13;$regex   = Regex-&gt;parse('ab+'); # Parse the string 
$machine = NFA-&gt;compile($regex); # Build the machine 
&#13;# Does "abbbbb" match /ab+/ ?
$result  = NFA_Exec-&gt;match($machine, 'abbbbb'); 
&#13;print "It ", ($result ? "did ": "did not "), "match.\n";
</pre>

  <p>The output, as we would hope, is</p>
  <pre>
	It did match.
</pre>

  <p>Now you can go try it yourself. Regex.pm is at <a href=
  "http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/Regex/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/Regex/</a>.
  You'll find a sample grep program in the directory.</p>

  <h3>Implications for Perl</h3>

  <p>Is this really what Perl does? Pretty much, except Perl's
  regexes are written in C, while Regex.pm is written in Perl. Perl
  parses the regex string into an internal format, and then turns
  the internal format into a machine. Perl's machine works a little
  differently from the ones I showed, but the principle is the
  same.</p>

  <p>Constructing the machine for a certain regex can take a
  relatively long time, but once it's constructed, running an input
  through it is very fast, and you can run lots of different inputs
  through it without reconstructing it. That is just what Perl
  does; when you first run your program, Perl turns all your
  regexes into machines and saves the machines for later. Then it
  can do fast pattern-matching with any of them because the
  machines are already on the shelf waiting to be used.</p>

  <p>Actually, I lied. Perl can't always build the machines as soon
  as you run your program. Consider this program, which reads an
  input, and prints out each line if it happens to contain its own
  line number (<tt>$</tt>. is the line number of the current line
  of input):</p>
  <pre>
        while (&lt;&gt;) { 
            print if /$./; 
        }
</pre>

  <p>Perl can't possibly build the machine for <tt>/$./</tt> as
  soon as your program is run, because <tt>/$./</tt> changes from
  line to line. Perl has to build a new machine every time through
  the loop. That makes this a slow program.</p>

  <p>Let's consider a slightly different program. This one is like
  the Unix <i>grep</i> command: you give it a pattern as the
  command-line argument, and it prints all the lines from its input
  that match that pattern:</p>
  <pre>
        my $pat = shift;
&#13;        while (&lt;&gt;) { 
            print if /$pat/; 
        }
</pre>

  <p>Again, Perl rebuilds the machine every time through the loop.
  It does this because it is afraid that <tt>$pat</tt> might have
  changed since last time, and it is too dumb to see that
  <tt>$pat</tt> never actually changes.</p>

  <p>If only there were a way to tell Perl that <tt>$pat</tt> never
  changes!</p>

  <p>There is a way to tell Perl that <tt>$pat</tt> never changes:
  the <tt>/o</tt> modifier.</p>
  <pre>
 
        my $pat = shift;
&#13;        while (&lt;&gt;) { 
            print if /$pat/o;   
        }
</pre>

  <p>Normally, Perl likes to build its machine when it compiles the
  rest of your program. For regexes with variables in them, it
  rebuilds the machine every time it uses the regex - unless you
  put in <tt>/o</tt>. If you do that, Perl builds the machine for
  the regex exactly once (<tt>o</tt> is for 'once'), the first time
  it uses the regex, and puts it on the shelf for later. After the
  first time, it assumes that the variables are always the same,
  and uses the machine from the shelf instead of making a new one
  every time.</p>

  <p>Beginners are always writing slow programs like this:</p>
  <pre>
   my @pats = ('fo*', 'ba.', 'w+3');
&#13;   while (&lt;&gt;) { 
       foreach $pat (@pats) { 
           print if /$pat/;
       }
   }
</pre>

  <p>Again, Perl has to build a new machine every time
  <tt>$pat</tt> changes. If there are a million lines in the input,
  Perl builds the same three machines a million times each. You can
  make this program much faster by writing it like this:</p>
  <pre>
        my @pats = ('fo*', 'ba.', 'w+3');
  my $pat = join('|', @pats);
&#13;  while (&lt;&gt;) { 
      print if /$pat/o; 
  }
</pre>

  <p>By arranging to have only one pattern that never changes,
  instead of three patterns that are used alternately, we can tell
  Perl to build a regex machine exactly once instead of three
  million times.</p>

  <h3>What About Backreferences?</h3>

  <p>I promised to show you how to do this to prove I wasn't a
  slacker. You can skip this section if you don't care how to do
  backreferences, as long as you agree first that I'm not a
  slacker.</p>

  <p>Just to make things a little easier to discuss, we'll pretend
  that you can have only one backreference in each regex.
  <tt>\1</tt> will work, but <tt>\2</tt> and <tt>\3</tt> won't.
  After you see how to make <tt>\1</tt> work, it'll be easy to see
  how to make the rest work too.</p>

  <p>To do backreferences, we need to add a tape recorder to each
  penny. If the tape recorder is on, it records the input that the
  machine is receiving.</p>

  <p>We also add three new kinds of circles: A 'record' circle; a
  'stop' circle, and 'replay' circle. When the penny enters a
  'record' circle, its tape recorder starts recording. When the
  penny enters a 'stop' circle, it stops recording.</p>

  <p>The 'replay' circle is a little different. It has exactly one
  outgoing arrow. When the penny enters the 'replay' circle, it
  stops and rewinds the tape. Then it waits on the replay circle
  while the machine reads more input, and it compares the input to
  what's on the tape. If the input doesn't match what's on the
  tape, or if the input runs out before the tape does, the penny
  dies. But if the input does match the tape, the penny immediately
  moves off the 'replay' circle along the outgoing arrow, and then
  continues moving normally.</p>

  <p>If <tt>P</tt> is a regex, here's how we build the machine for
  <tt>/(P)/</tt>; it's just like <tt>/P/</tt> except it also
  records the input that matched <tt>P</tt>:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph11.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 11" border="0" width="400" height="63"></p>

  <p>Here's the machine for <tt>/\1/</tt>:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph12.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 12" border="0" width="300" height="67"></p>

  <p>Here's the machine for <tt>/(a+)\1/</tt>:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph13.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 13" border="0" width="400" height="174"></p>

  <p>Let's see what happens when this machine reads the string
  "<tt>aaaa</tt>". We put a penny on <b>S1</b>, the start circle,
  and the penny immediately begins recording on its tape recorder.
  The penny clones itself and its tape recorder, and the clones
  move to <b>U</b> and to <b>V</b>.</p>

  <p>Now, every time the machine reads an "<tt>a</tt>", a penny
  gets through to <b>W</b> with an additional "<tt>a</tt>" written
  on its tape. This penny moves through to <b>E1</b>, which shuts
  off the tape recorder. The first such penny has just "<tt>a</tt>"
  on is tape; it arrives at <b>R1</b>; when the machine reads the
  second "<tt>a</tt>" it moves to <b>Z</b>, and then on the third
  "<tt>a</tt>" it dies. But the second penny to come out at
  <b>X</b> has two "<tt>a</tt>"s on its tape; it gets out of
  <b>R1</b> just after the machine reads the third and fourth
  "<tt>a</tt>"s, and it gets to <b>Z</b> just in time for the end
  of the input. The penny on <b>Z</b> at the end of the input
  signals a 'yes', and the "<tt>aa</tt>" on its tape means
  that<tt>$1</tt> is "<tt>aa</tt>".</p>

  <p>There were two other pennies that came out at <b>X</b>, one
  with "<tt>aaa</tt>" and one with "<tt>aaaa</tt>" on its tape. But
  those pennies stayed stuck in <b>R1</b> waiting for the machine
  to read more "<tt>a</tt>"s.</p>

  <p>Now, if you want to have more backreferences, you just add
  more tape recorders to each penny. And you have one kind of
  'record', 'stop', and 'replay' circle for every backreference.
  <tt>/\3/</tt> becomes a circle that says 'replay tape 3', and the
  fifth ( in a regex becomes a circle that says 'start recording on
  tape 5'.</p>

  <h3>Internals of Regex.pm</h3>

  <p>The module's <tt>NFA-&gt;compile()</tt> method transforms a
  regex into a machine, following pretty much the same steps that
  we did in the article. It starts with the sub-expressions, and
  then combines smaller machines into one large machine. The
  structure for a machine is so simple that I'll just give an
  example:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/graph14.gif" align="center"
  alt="graph 14" border="0" width="250" height="151"></p>

  <p>This has the following representation:</p>
  <pre>
{ 
  A =&gt; { ''  =&gt; B,      # Unlabeled arrow from A to B 
         'x' =&gt; C,      # Arrow labeled 'x' from A to C
       }, 
  B =&gt; { },             # No arrows from B 
  C =&gt; { 'q' =&gt; B },    # Arrow labeled 'q' from C to B
  Symbols =&gt; [ A, B ],  # Start and final circles. 
}
</pre>

  <p>This is convenient because it's easy to look up where a given
  penny should move to when the machine reads a certain character
  in the input.</p>

  <p>The best way to see what the module is really doing is to run
  the test program under the debugger and ask it to print out the
  data structures. Once you know about the machines and the
  pennies, the whole thing should be almost transparent. (Warning:
  The circle names are generated automatically, so they all have
  names like '<tt>Saa01</tt>'.)</p>

  <p>The module performs a very ordinary simulation of where the
  pennies are after each character in the input. Here's a simple
  example: When the input has run out, the simulator just looks to
  see if there is a penny on the final circle, something like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
foreach $s ($self-&gt;circles_with_pennies) { 
    if ($self-&gt;{machine}-&gt;is_final_circle($s)) { 
        # Aha! We win! 
        return 1; 
    } 
} 
# No penny on a final circle; pattern match fails.
return 0;
</pre>

  <p>The real code uses technical jargon, but the code is identical
  except for the jargon. You can find the code in the function
  <tt>NFA_Exec-&gt;final_state()</tt>.</p>

  <p><b>Listing 1:</b> <a href=
  "tpj0301-0009a.html">Terminology</a></p>

  <h3>Lies</h3>

  <p>Perl doesn't really do it exactly the way I showed you. It's
  close, and the principle is the same, but there's one big
  difference. The difference is that Perl never moves more than one
  penny at a time.</p>

  <p>Whenever a penny clones itself, Perl makes a choice about
  which one to move, and saves the locations of the others. If the
  penny that Perl is moving dies, Perl <i>backtracks</i> to one of
  the other pennies, and picks up where it left off.</p>

  <p>This has a number of benefits. If the penny Perl happens to be
  moving ends on the final circle at the end of the input, then
  Perl knows that the input matched, even though it didn't move the
  other pennies, so it was able to save time.</p>

  <p>Alternately, if the programmer asks for a second match, Perl
  just merely to go back and try some more pennies until it finds a
  second one that wins; the path that the second penny took is the
  second match. When you move all the pennies at once, you get all
  the matches at once too, and there's no good way to make use of
  all the information you get.</p>

  <p>When a penny clones itself, Perl has to make a choice about
  which penny to follow and which to save for later. By making the
  decision one way, it gets the greedy operators <tt>*</tt>,
  <tt>+</tt>, and <tt>?</tt>; by choosing the other penny in each
  case, the operators become the non-greedy versions, <tt>*?</tt>,
  <tt>+?</tt>, and <tt>??</tt>.</p>

  <p>The one-penny-at-a-time system that Perl uses is also more
  convenient for handling backreferences. Instead of having to
  associate a set of tape recordings with each penny, Perl only
  needs to have one set of tape recordings for the single current
  penny, and some saved tape recordings for the pennies it might
  have to backtrack to.</p>

  <p>However, the one-penny-at-a-time system also has a terrible
  drawback: For some patterns, the number of saved pennies can get
  huge, and Perl can spend literally hours returning to one saved
  penny after another. For example, consider the pattern
  <tt>/^(\d+)*$/</tt>. For a complete discussion of a similarly
  rotten expression, see Jeffrey Friedl's article in TPJ #2. Here's
  the short summary: Any idiot can see that a string like
  "<tt>1234567890</tt>:" won't match because of the "<tt>:</tt>" on
  the end. But Perl wastes a lot of time trying pointless
  backtracking.</p>

  <p>Perl sees the <tt>*</tt>, and it needs to decide how many
  times to repeat the preceding expression, the (<tt>\d+</tt>).
  This means it gets to use as many <tt>\d+</tt>'s as it wants to.
  First it lets <tt>\d+</tt> match <tt>1234567890</tt>, using only
  one <tt>\d+</tt>, but that doesn't work, because of the ":", so
  Perl backs off and lets <tt>\d+</tt> match just
  <tt>123456789</tt>, and it uses a second <tt>\d+</tt> to match
  the <tt>0</tt>, but that doesn't work either. So it retreats and
  lets the first <tt>\d+</tt> match <tt>012345678</tt>, and the
  second match <tt>90</tt>. That fails, so it tries making the
  second <tt>\d+</tt> match only the <tt>9</tt>, and uses a third
  instance of <tt>\d+</tt> for the <tt>0</tt>. That fails too, so
  it shortens the first <tt>\d+</tt> again to match only the
  <tt>01234567</tt>. And so on. What a disaster.</p>

  <p>The many-pennies-at-once approach scores a huge win here. The
  machine doesn't have very many circles, at most two for every
  symbol in the regular expression, and so there need never be very
  many pennies. Suppose two pennies happen to move onto the same
  circle. The one-at-a-time approach would have dealt with them
  separately, at different times. But the many-pennies-at-once
  approach can replace these two pennies with one penny. (Only if
  we're ignoring backreferences. We can't join pennies if we're
  saving backreferences, because the two pennies probably have
  different recordings on their tapes.) The result: Fewer pennies
  get moved, and there's no backtracking, and the regular
  expression finishes quickly instead of slowly.</p>

  <p>The program at <a href=
  "http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/Regex/demo.pl" target=
  "resource window">http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/Regex/demo.pl</a>
  demonstrates this: It builds and runs the equivalent Regex.pm
  penny machine first, and that takes less than two seconds, even
  on a 75 MHz Pentium. Then it tries using Perl's built-in regular
  expressions, and that takes hours, even on a speedy
  workstation.</p>

  <h3>Other Directions</h3>

  <p>For an easy project, try adding the '.' symbol. You'll have to
  modify the parser a little, and machines will need to have a new
  kind of arrow that indicates a transition on any input at all.
  From there it's only a small step to adding general character
  classes.</p>

  <p>OMAR (Our Most Assiduous Reader) might enjoy adding
  backreferences to the Regex module. Probably the most difficult
  part will be fixing the string-to-regex parser, which is a
  terrible hack; the rest of the code is much more flexible.</p>

  <p>If you're interested in the details of how Perl's internal
  machines work, you might enjoy running</p>
  <pre>
        perl -Dm -ne 'print if /SOMETHING/';
</pre>

  <p>to see what happens. On a Perl compiled with the
  <tt>-DDEBUGGING</tt> flag, <tt>-Dm</tt> displays the details of
  the regular expression machinery, both at the times that the
  machines are constructed and when they're used. Be prepared for
  surprises! For example, the <tt>*</tt> in <tt>/x*/</tt> is
  different from the <tt>*</tt> in <tt>/(xy)*/</tt>. The former is
  a real <tt>*</tt>, but the latter is treated as if you had
  written <tt>/(xy){0,32767}/</tt> instead.</p>

  <p>This column needs a name. What should I call it? It should
  characterize the subject matter (Previous articles: Infinite
  lists; B-Trees) and sound cool. Mail me suggestions; the best one
