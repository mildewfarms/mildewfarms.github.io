              <p><font color="#000000">This is all serious computer
              science in this article, but I didn't want to get
              bogged down by the terminology. It's easy to
              understand what's going on, but it's also easy to get
              lost in a lot of technical jargon, so I took out the
              jargon. Here it is if you want to impress your
              friends:</font></p>

              <p><font color="#000000">The machines are called
              <i>finite automata</i>. 'Automata' is Greek; it means
              'things that go by themselves'. The automata are
              finite because there are only a finite number of
              circles and arrows; this is to contrast them with
              automata that have an infinite amount of memory.
              'Finite automaton' is a mouthful even for a computer
              scientist, so they usually end up abbreviating it to
              'FA'.</font></p>

              <p><font color="#000000">The kind of FA's we've been
              looking at are called 'nondeterministic', or NFA's
              for short. This refers to the fact that pennies
              sometimes get cloned. If there's only one arrow with
              a particular label leading out of each circle, the
              pennies never get cloned, and the automaton is called
              'deterministic' or a 'DFA'.</font></p>

              <p><font color="#000000">When the FA says 'yes',
              computer scientists say it has 'accepted' its input;
              when it says 'no', they say it has 'rejected' its
              input.</font></p>

              <p><font color="#000000">The arrows are called
              'transitions'. Blank arrows are called 'epsilon
              transitions'. The circles are called 'states'. The
              start circle is called the 'start state'. The double
              circles are called 'accepting states' or sometimes
              'final states'. Computer scientists don't talk about
              the pennies, because they are too important to waste
              time playing with pennies. They just talk about the
              'current states', which are the circles that the
              pennies would have been sitting on if there were any
              pennies.</font></p>

              <p><font color="#000000">Computer scientists draw the
              pictures exactly the same as I drew them for you,
              except that they don't actually label the start state
              with 'start'. They do draw that little arrow pointing
              to it, however. Oh, and they sometimes also label the
              blank arrows with e so that they can remember that
              they're e-transitions.</font></p>

              <p><font color="#000000">Now you can talk just like a
              computer scientist.
