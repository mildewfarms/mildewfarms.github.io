  <h4>Lincoln Stein and Doug MacEachern</h4>

  <p>One of the minor miracles of the World Wide Web is that it
  makes client/server network programming easy. With the Common
  Gateway Interface (CGI), anyone can become a network programmer,
  creating dynamic Web pages, front-ends for databases, and even
  complex intranet applications with ease. If you're like many Web
  programmers, you started out by writing CGI scripts in Perl. With
  its powerful text-processing facilities, forgiving syntax, and
  tool-oriented design, Perl lends itself to the small programs for
  which CGI was designed.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately the love affair between Perl and CGI doesn't
  last forever. As your scripts get larger and your server more
  heavily loaded, you inevitably run into the performance wall. A
  thousand line Perl CGI script that runs fine on a lightly loaded
  Web site becomes unacceptably slow when it increases to 10,000
  lines and the hit rate triples. You may have tried switching to a
  different programming language and been disappointed. Because the
  main bottleneck in the CGI protocol is the need to relaunch the
  script every time it's requested, even compiled C won't give you
  the performance boost you expect.</p>

  <p>If your applications go beyond simple dynamic pages, you might
  have run into the limitations of the CGI protocol itself. Many
  interesting things happen deep inside Web servers, such as the
  smart remapping of URLs, access control and authentication, and
  the assignment of MIME types to documents. The CGI protocol
  doesn't give you access to these internals. You can neither find
  out what's going on nor intervene in any meaningful way.</p>

  <p>To go beyond simple CGI scripting, you must use some protocol
  that doesn't rely on launching and relaunching an external
  program each time a script runs. Alternatives include NSAPI on
  Netscape servers, ISAPI on Windows servers, Java servlets,
  server-side includes, Active Server Pages (ASP), FastCGI, Dynamic
  HTML, ActiveX, JavaScript, and Java applets.</p>

  <p>Sadly, choosing among these technologies is a no-win
  situation. Some choices lock you into a server platform for life.
  Others limit the browsers you can support. Many offer proprietary
  solutions that aren't available in other vendors' products.
  Nearly all of them require you to throw out your existing
  investment in Perl CGI scripts and reimplement everything from
  scratch.</p>

  <p>The Apache server offers you a way out. Apache is a freely
  distributed, full-featured Web server that runs on UNIX and
  Windows NT systems. Derived from the popular NCSA httpd server,
  Apache dominates the Web; nearly half of the servers reachable
  from the Internet are Apache. Like its commercial cousins from
  Microsoft and Netscape, Apache has a programmer's API, allowing
  you to extend the server with modules of your own design. Apache
  modules can behave like CGI scripts, (creating interactive pages
  on the fly, or they can make fundamental changes in the operation
  of the server, such as logging Web accesses to a relational
  database or replacing standard HTTP authentication with a system
  integrated with Kerberos, DCE, or one-time passwords. Regardless
  of whether they're simple or complex, Apache modules perform much
  better than even the fastest conventional CGI scripts.</p>

  <p>The best thing about Apache modules, however, is the existence
  of mod_perl. mod_perl is a fully-functional Perl interpreter
  embedded directly in Apache. With mod_perl you simply take your
  existing Perl CGI scripts and plug them in to the server, usually
  without any source code changes whatsoever. Your scripts run
  exactly as before, but many times faster - nearly as fast as
  fetching static HTML pages in many cases. Better yet, mod_perl
  offers a Perl interface to the Apache API, allowing you full
  access to Apache internals. Instead of writing Perl scripts, you
  can write Perl modules that control every aspect of the Apache
  server's operations. Move your existing Perl scripts over to
  mod_perl to get an immediate performance boost. As you need to,
  you can add new features to your scripts that take advantage of
  the Apache API.</p>

  <p>This article will introduce you to mod_perl and show how its
  unique features can speed up your Web site.</p>

  <h3>TRANSACTION HANDLERS</h3>mod_perl code is organized quite
  differently than conventional CGI scripts. Instead of writing
  self-sufficient standalone scripts, you'll create
  <i>handlers</i>, snippets of code that handle one or more of the
  phases of the Apache server's operation. These phases are shown
  in chronological order in <a href="tpj0301-0001a.html">Table
  1</a>.

  <p>To install handlers for any of these phases, you create a Perl
  .pm file and add the appropriate mod_perl directive (shown in
  parentheses) to the server's httpd.conf or .htaccess file. You
  use a different directive for each phase. For example, you
  install a log phase handler with the directive
  <tt>PerlLogHandler</tt> and a content phase handler with the
  directive <tt>PerlHandler</tt> (since the content handler is the
  one installed most frequently, it has the most generic name). So
  to install logging and URI translation handlers for all URI's
  below the virtual directory <tt>/magic</tt>, you could enter
  something like this in <tt>access.conf</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
   &lt;Location /magic&gt;
       PerlTransHandler    Apache::Magic
       PerlLogHandler      Apache::MyLog
   &lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>

  <p>By convention, mod_perl modules are all members of the
  Apache:: namespace. This doesn't mean that they inherit from
  Apache.pm, and you needn't even follow the convention if you
  don't care to.</p>

  <p>Because Apache ordinarily associates content handlers with
  real files on the basis of their MIME types, you need a slightly
  different incantation when installing a content handler:</p>
  <pre>
   &lt;Location /virtual&gt;
       SetHandler         perl-script
       PerlHandler        Apache::Virtual
   &lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>

  <p>All URI's that begin with <tt>/virtual</tt> will now be passed
  through the module Apache::Virtual, regardless of whether or not
  they correspond to physical files on the server. The module will
  be passed the remainder of the URI to do with what it chooses.
  You can turn the remaining components of the URI path into a
  database query, treat them as verbs in a command language, or
  just plain ignore them.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0301-0001e.html">Installing
  <tt>mod_perl</tt></a></p>

  <h3>A TYPICAL CONTENT HANDLER</h3>

  <p>Content handlers are straightforward. A minimal handler looks
  like this:</p>
  <pre>
package Apache::Simple;
use Apache::Constants qw(OK DECLINED);
&#13;sub handler {
    my $r = shift;
    my $host = $r-&gt;get_remote_host;
    $r-&gt;content_type('text/plain');
    $r-&gt;send_http_header;
    $r-&gt;print("Good morning, $host!");
    return OK;
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>We first declare a unique package name. This is very
  important: Because all mod_perl modules live in the same Perl
  process, namespace conflicts became a very real possibility. Next
  we import two constants, <tt>OK</tt> and <tt>DECLINED</tt>, from
  the Apache::Constants module, a standard part of the mod_perl
  distribution. Lastly, we declare a subroutine named
  <tt>handler()</tt>. By default, mod_perl looks for a subroutine
  by this name when processing a handler directive.</p>

  <p>When <tt>handler()</tt> is called, it is passed an Apache
  request object as its single argument. This object contains
  information about the current request, and serves as an interface
  to the Apache server's functionality. You can use it to modify
  the request, to send information to the browser, and to request
  services from Apache such as filename translation. In this
  script, we first have the request object retrieve the DNS name of
  the remote host. Then we create the response, first setting the
  HTTP header to MIME type <tt>text/plain</tt> with a call to
  <tt>content_type()</tt>, and then sending the HTTP header with
  <tt>send_http_header()</tt>. We then create the content by making
  a call to the request's <tt>print()</tt> method and send a
  friendly message to the browser. Finally, we return to Apache a
  result code of OK, indicating that we handled the request. We
  could also return <tt>DECLINED</tt>, indicating that Apache
  should try a different handler.</p>

  <p>Here's how a content handler can redirect the browser to a
  different URI using an HTTP <tt>REDIRECT</tt> instruction:</p>
  <pre>
package Apache::Redirect;
use Apache::Constants qw(OK DECLINED REDIRECT);
&#13;sub handler {
    my $r = shift;
    my $remote_url ='http://www.somewhere.else/go/away.html';
    $r-&gt;header_out(Location=&gt;$remote_url);
    return REDIRECT;
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>In this case, we call the request object's
  <tt>header_out()</tt> method to set the outgoing HTTP Location
  header we are redirecting to. There's no need to invoke
  <tt>send_http_header()</tt> or send a document body. Apache takes
  care of this for us when the return code is something other than
  <tt>DECLINED</tt> or <tt>OK</tt>. In this case, returning
  <tt>REDIRECT</tt> makes Apache generate a <tt>302 Moved
  Temporarily</tt> status code and send the HTTP headers. Normally
  there's no need to send a document body because most clients will
  follow the <tt>Location</tt> header. However, to be
  HTTP-compliant, Apache generates a tiny document with a link to
  the new <tt>Location</tt>. If you're using a decent browser,
  you'll never know.</p>

  <h3>APACHE::REGISTRY</h3>

  <p>Although you can do everything you want with the content
  handlers just described, there are some drawbacks. First, during
  the development and debugging phase, Perl modules are not
  automatically recompiled when you change the source code - unless
  you configure the Apache::StatINC module. Second, as you can see,
  these handlers look nothing like CGI scripts. CGI scripts read
  and write to standard input and output, and get configuration
  information from environment variables. Code written for CGI
  won't run as a content handler without radical alterations.</p>

  <p>Enter Apache::Registry. Apache::Registry is a content handler
  that wraps around other Perl scripts. It emulates the CGI
  environment using a variety of tricks (such as tied filehandles).
  Most CGI scripts written as standalone applications will run
  unmodified under Apache::Registry, while those that know about
  mod_perl can take advantage of its special features. The best
  aspect of Apache::Registry is that it caches the compiled script
  inside a subroutine and executes it when a request comes in. Code
  is recompiled automatically when the source file is updated on
  disk. The handler acts as a registry for subroutines, hence its
  name.</p>

  <h3>A TYPICAL NON-CONTENT HANDLER</h3>

  <p>To demonstrate a handler that doesn't create content, consider
  the log handler. It gets called relatively late in the process -
  stage 13 - after the response has been generated. We can create a
  <tt>LogMail</tt> handler to place watchpoints on particular files
  and directories. Whenever someone accesses a watch-pointed
  directory, the server sends email to some designated address.
  Here's an entry in <tt>access.conf</tt> that places a watchpoint
  on all the files in Lincoln's public directory:</p>
  <pre>
   &lt;Location /~lstein&gt;
       PerlLogHandler      Apache::LogMail
       PerlSetVar          mailto lstein@w3.org
   &lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>

  <p>Note the directive <tt>PerlSetVar</tt>, which allows us to
  send configuration information to the handler. It expects two
  arguments: a key name and a value. In this case, the key name is
  <tt>mailto</tt> and its value is <tt>lstein@w3.org</tt>. Here's
  what LogMail.pm looks like:</p>
  <pre>
package Apache::LogMail;
use Apache::Constants ':common';
&#13;sub handler {
    my $r = shift;
    my $mailto = $r-&gt;dir_config('mailto');
    my $request = $r-&gt;the_request;
    my $uri = $r-&gt;uri;
    my $agent = $r-&gt;header_in("User-agent");
    my $bytes = $r-&gt;bytes_sent;
    my $remote = $r-&gt;get_remote_host;
    my $status = $r-&gt;status_line;
    my $date = localtime;
    unless (open (MAIL,"|/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -t")) {
          $r-&gt;log_error("Couldn't open mail: $!");
          return DECLINED;
    }
    print MAIL &lt;&lt;END;
To: $mailto
From: Mod Perl &lt;webmaster&gt;
Subject: Somebody looked at $uri
At $date, a user at $remote looked at
$uri using the $agent browser.
The request was $request,
which resulted returned a code of $status.
&#13;$bytes bytes were transferred.
END
    close MAIL;
    return OK;
}
&#13;1;
</pre>

  <p>This script calls a bunch of Apache request methods to fetch
  the URI of the request, the remote host, the user agent (browser
  vendor information), the number of bytes transmitted, and the
  status of the response. It bundles everything up into a mail
  message that it submits with the trusty <i>sendmail</i> program.
  Note how we retrieve the value of the "mailto" configuration
  variable with a call to <tt>dir_config()</tt>. The resulting
  email looks something like this:</p>
  <pre>
From: Mod Perl &lt;webmaster@w3.org&gt;
To: lstein@w3.org
Subject: Somebody looked at /~lstein/innocent.html
Date: Tue, 20 Jan 1998 21:42:04 -0500
&#13;At Tue Jan 20 21:42:02 1998, a user at localhost looked at
/~lstein/innocent.html using the Mozilla/3.01Gold (X11; I;
Linux 2.0.30 i586) browser.
&#13;The request was GET /~lstein/innocent.html HTTP/1.0,
which resulted returned a code of 200 OK.
&#13;635 bytes were transferred.
</pre>

  <p>In addition to sending out the message, Apache creates its
  usual log entry.</p>

  <h3>GETTING FANCY: A STATELY SCRIPT</h3>

  <p>Devoted readers of TPJ may remember TPJ #2, in which Lincoln
  bemoaned the difficulties in maintaining state across CGI
  scripting sessions. Because each CGI process exits after
  processing its request, you must resort to awkward workarounds in
  order to maintain the page's state. For example, you can hide
  state information in hidden fields of fill-out forms, or stash
  the data in HTTP cookies (TPJ #3).</p>

  <p>Another difference between mod_perl and conventional CGI
  scripting is that mod_perl scripts are <i>persistent</i>. After
  initial compilation they remain in memory and are executed by the
  server each time they're needed. This means that scripts can
  stash state information in their own global variables to be
  accessed later.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/mod_perl_fig1.gif"><img src=
  "images/mod_perl_fig1_sm.gif" alt=
  "mod_perl figure 1. click to enlarge" hspace="10" border="2"
  width="150" height="135" vspace="10"></a><br>
  <font size="-1">Figure 1</font></p>

  <p>To see how useful this can be, let's consider a longer
  example, <a href="tpj0301-0001c.html"><tt>stately.cgi</tt>
  (Listing 2)</a>. This script implements file paging: When the
  user first accesses the script's URI, it displays a screen like
  the one shown in <a href="images/mod_perl_fig1.gif">Figure 1</a>.
  A textfield prompts the user to type in his name, and a popup
  menu allows him to select from a fixed menu of interesting
  text-only articles. When he presses the "Select Article" button,
  a screen like <a href="images/mod_perl_fig2.gif">Figure 2</a>
  appears. The top of the page displays the user's name and the
  selected article. Beneath it is a yellow block of text containing
  one page of the article (in this case, a page is defined as a
  fixed number of lines). Above and below the text are a row of
  buttons for navigating through the article. You can page backward
  and forward, or jump directly to an arbitrary page. (Does this
  script remind you of paging through an AltaVista search? It ought
  to. The only difference is that AltaVista's buttons are small
  inline images rather than standard HTML buttons. This script
  could be modified easily to use graphical buttons. Just replace
  the appropriate calls to <tt>submit()</tt> with calls to
  <tt>image_button()</tt>. You'll have to provide your own artwork,
  of course.)</p>

  <p>This script has to store a lot of state between accesses. The
  user's name, the article being read, and the page being displayed
  all need to be maintained between accesses. While this could be
  achieved by cleverly using hidden fields, <a href=
  "tpj0301-0001c.html"><tt>stately.cgi</tt></a> uses the simpler
  method of storing all the state information in main memory. This
  has the important advantage of <i>long-term persistence</i>. If
  the user bookmarks the page and returns later, the page will be
  displayed exactly as he left it, even if the browser was shut
  down and restarted in the interim! Furthermore, the server can be
  shut down as well; you can kill the web server, have a pasta
  dinner and a glass of wine, and when you restart the server all
  the session information will be magically restored.</p>

  <p>Before we examine <a href=
  "tpj0301-0001c.html"><tt>stately.cgi</tt></a>, have a look at
  <a href="tpj0301-0001b.html">Listing 1</a>, which implements the
  primary state-saving features. This defines a small utility
  package called PageSession which holds all the state information
  of a particular session. Each session has a unique ID, and fields
  for the user name, the article and the current page. The
  <tt>new()</tt> method (line 10) creates a new PageSession object
  with empty fields, the <tt>fetch()</tt> method (line 22) fetches
  an existing PageSession given its ID, and a <tt>save()</tt>
  method (line 28) saves the modified PageSession object to a
  memory structure for later retrieval. Methods named
  <tt>id()</tt>, <tt>name()</tt>, <tt>article()</tt> and
  <tt>page()</tt> allow you to get and set the object's fields.</p>

  <p>Internally, PageSession objects are stored in
  <tt>%SESSIONS</tt>, a packagewide global hash indexed by the Page
  Session <tt>ID</tt>. The <tt>ID</tt>s are simple integers
  maintained in a global named <tt>$NEXTID</tt>, which is
  incremented every time a new PageSession is requested. In order
  to keep the demands on memory reasonable, the number of stored
  PageSessions is restricted. After the maximum number is reached,
  <tt>$NEXTID</tt> is reset to zero and old session IDs are reused,
  deleting the older sessions to make way for newer ones. Note that
  this isn't the most sophisticated way of maintaining session IDs;
  a more sophisticated scheme would prioritize sessions on the
  basis of how recently they were last used, rather than how
  recently they were created. Also, a real application would choose
  IDs that are a little harder to predict than small numbers,
  perhaps by hashing the ID with the user's IP address. This scheme
  makes it easy for one user to peek at another's session just by
  guessing a valid session ID.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/mod_perl_fig2.gif"><img src=
  "images/mod_perl_fig2_sm.gif" alt=
  "mod_perl figure 2. click to enlarge" hspace="10" border="2"
  width="150" height="138" vspace="10"></a><br>
  <font size="-1">Figure 1</font></p>

  <p>The main script, <a href="tpj0301-0001c.html">stately.cgi</a>,
  represents an interesting hybrid of straight mod_perl scripting
  and CGI scripting. Because it is run under Apache::Registry, it
  can take advantage of routines that depend on the CGI environment
  such as CGI.pm's parameter parsing routines.</p>

  <p>The script starts out by bringing in the modules that it
  needs. It imports some functions from CGI.pm, Apache::Constants,
  and the PageSession package. Because all modules are compiled
  into one Perl interpreter object, chances are that these modules
  are already compiled and ready to be launched, so the
  <tt>use()</tt> statements will execute quickly. (You can even
  have mod_perl compile modules at startup time if you wish.)</p>

  <p>Next (lines 9-17) we define some packagewide global variables,
  including the names of the articles, their location, and the page
  length.</p>

  <p>The fun part begins in lines 19-21. The goal here is to figure
  out whether the request is coming in from a new user or an old
  one. If a new user, we need to generate a unique session ID for
  that user and trick his browser into passing it back to us on
  subsequent requests. If an old user, we need to recover his
  session object. We accomplish this task with one of the older
  tricks of the Web trade: storing the session ID in the script's
  URI. URI's used to access this script should look something like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
   http://your.site/perl/stately.cgi/42
</pre>

  <p>The script's URI is followed by additional path information
  containing the session ID, in this case 42. If a user tries to
  access the script without a session ID, the script assumes that
  it is a new session, generates a new empty session object for the
  user, and redirects the browser to the URI with the session ID
  tacked onto the end. Otherwise it recovers the session ID from
  the additional path information and recovers the corresponding
  PageSession object from memory.</p>

  <p>First we fetch the current request object (line 9). Unlike the
  standard handlers shown before, Apache::Registry scripts don't
  define a <tt>handler()</tt> subroutine. Instead, they ask the
  Apache package for their request object. After recovering this
  object, we use it to recover the session ID by calling the
  subroutine defined in lines 117-121: <tt>get_session_id()</tt>.
  We now call <tt>PageSession::fetch()</tt> to recover the
  corresponding PageSession (which might be undefined).</p>

  <p>If no PageSession object is found, then the script's URI
  either provided no session number at all, or provided an unused
  one. In this case, we generate a new session object and redirect
  the user's browser to our URI plus the ID of the new object
  tacked onto the end. This happens in lines 23 through 33, where
  we call <tt>PageSession::new()</tt> to make a new object,
  synthesize a new URI from the base URI concatenated with the
  session ID, and generate a redirect directive as shown earlier.
  The mess on line 26 handles users who has access the script using
  a URI already containing additional path information. This strips
  the URI down to its base before appending the session ID.</p>

  <p>When the user's browser sees the redirect, it immediately
  bounces back to our script bearing a valid session ID. We can
  then generate an HTML document. Lines 37 through 43 create HTTP
  header and the constant section at the top of the document. To
  emphasize that this is a mod_perl script rather than CGI, we use
  Apache's <tt>content_type()</tt>, <tt>send_http_header()</tt>,
  and <tt>print()</tt> methods - but since we're running under
  Apache::Registry, we could just as easily have called Perl's
  regular <tt>print()</tt> function and used
  <tt>CGI::header()</tt>.</p>

  <p>The next step is to update the session object to reflect
  commands issued by the user. This script recognizes six different
  parameters, each of which affects the state of the page:</p>

  <table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>

      <th>Value</th>

      <th>Comment</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>name</td>

      <td>(textfield contents)</td>

      <td>The user name</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>article</td>

      <td>(popup menu contents)</td>

      <td>The article name</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>action</td>

      <td>Select Article</td>

      <td>Start reading a new article</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>action</td>

      <td>&lt;&lt; Previous</td>

      <td>Page Decrement page number</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>action</td>

      <td>Next Page &gt;&gt;</td>

      <td>Increment page number</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>action</td>

      <td>numeric value</td>

      <td>Go to the indicated page</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Notice that the <tt>action</tt> parameter is used for four
  different commands. That's okay, because only one command can be
  issued at a time. We use the CGI.pm <tt>param()</tt> subroutine
  to recover the CGI parameters, something that is possible only
  when using Apache::Registry. First, if a parameter named name is
  present, we update the session object to contain it (line 47). If
  the parameter is missing, and the session object doesn't already
  contain the user's name, we generate a textfield to request it
  from the user.</p>

  <p>Next, we process the <tt>action</tt> parameter (lines 60-65).
  <tt>action</tt> can be generated by any of the page navigation
  buttons, or by the "Select Article" button. This code detects
  which button was pressed and takes the appropriate action, either
  by changing the value of the session's page field, or by changing
  the contents of its article field.</p>

  <p>We now begin to lay out the rest of the page. In lines 68-73
  we create a popup menu to display the list of articles. This
  example uses a deliberately small list; a real application, might
  generate the list from a directory contents, a database, or a
  keyword search.</p>

  <p>Line 77 calls the <tt>fetch_article()</tt> routine, which
  fetches the article given in the session and divides it into
  pages. The pages are stored in the <tt>@pages</tt> array.</p>

  <p>The complicated-looking code in lines 78 through 110 displays
  the navigation bar and the current page from the selected
  article. To generate the navigation bar, we first generate a list
  of HTML pushbuttons in <tt>@buttons</tt>. We then trim the list
  so they'll all be visible simultaneously. After centering the
  list so that the entry for the current page is always displayed,
  we replace the part of the list that's too far to the left or the
  right with '...' After the trimming operation, we add the
  'previous' and 'next' buttons to the list.</p>

  <p>In lines 98 through 110 we print out this list of buttons with
  the current page of text. To make everything line up nicely, both
  the list of buttons and the text itself are placed in HTML 3.2
  tables. By embedding the article in a table cell, we get the
  added benefit of being able to change its background color.
  Another way to accomplish the same effect would be to use a
  cascading style sheet - but that's a subject for another
  article!</p>

  <p>Although it isn't visible in the screenshot, the script
  actually prints the navigation bar twice: once at the top of the
  article, and once at the bottom. Most users hate to scroll.</p>

  <p>The last bit of work is to print out the end of the HTML page
  and to save the session (lines 112-115).</p>

  <p>Let's look at the subroutines now. <tt>get_session_id()</tt>
  (lines 117- 121) is responsible for retrieving the session ID
  from the browser's request. It extracts the additional URI path
  information from the Apache request object, and looks for a
  numeral, returning the match, if any. <tt>do_select()</tt> sets
  the session article field and zeroes out the page number. This
  displays the new article starting with the first page.</p>

  <p>More interesting is the <tt>fetch_article()</tt> subroutine
  spanning lines 129 through 144. Its turns an article name into a
  physical file path. First, it checks whether the indicated
  article is listed in <tt>%ARTICLES</tt>. If so, it calls the
  Apache request object's <tt>lookup_uri()</tt> function to turn
  the article path (expressed as a virtual URI), into a physical
  path. <tt>lookup_uri()</tt> is actually a callback into the
  current Apache URI translation handler, and illustrates how
  smoothly mod_perl integrates into the Apache API. If this step is
  successful, we open the file, read it into an array, and divide
  it into bite-size pieces of <tt>$LINES_PER_PAGE</tt> size.</p>

  <p>To run this script, you need to make it executable and place
  it in an appropriate directory, such as a <tt>/perl</tt>
  subdirectory below the server root. You'll also need to include a
  section like this in your <tt>access.conf</tt> file:</p>
  <pre>
   &lt;Location /perl&gt;
        SetHandler      Perl-script
        PerlHandler     Apache::Registry
        Options         +ExecCGI
   &lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>SetHandler</tt> and <tt>PerlHandler</tt> directives,
  as we've seen before, tell Apache to use Apache::Registry as its
  content handler for all files inside the <tt>/perl</tt>
  directory. The ExecCGI option is turned on in order to satisfy
  one of Apache::Registry's safety checks. It requires that ExecCGI
  be enabled for any directory under its purview, and that all
  programs in those directories be executable, just like mod_cgi.
  Although the scripts are never run as standalone applications,
  this constraint prevents you from introducing security holes from
  files inadvertently left in the directory, such as from a text
  editor's autosaves.</p>

  <p>You can now test the script by launching a mod_perl-enabled
  Apache launched in single-process mode. Here's how you do
  that:</p>
  <pre>
   # httpd -X -d /home/www
</pre>

  <h3>IMPALED BY THE FORK</h3>

  <p>What is single-process mode? Normally Apache preforks itself
  several times, so that there are a half-dozen or so server
  processes hanging around to handle incoming requests. This tactic
  distributes the load on the Web server and makes the response
  time of heavily-loaded sites noticeably better. The <tt>-X</tt>
  command-line switch suppresses this behavior, forcing Apache to
  run as a single process. The reason we use single-process mode is
  because the script as written <i>will not work correctly</i> in
  prefork mode. The reason becomes clear on reflection. After
  forking, each Apache process has its own independent copy of
  <tt>%SESSION</tt> and <tt>$NEXTID</tt>. When one server process
  assigns a new user an ID and PageSession object, there's no
  guarantee that the user will connect to the same process the next
  time he fetches the page. The user may well contact a new
  process, which will start things over from scratch.</p>

  <p>This is obviously unacceptable, since it precludes the
  benefits of having persistent storage. Fortunately there is a
  simple and almost transparent solution. Benjamin Sugars'
  IPC::Shareable module allows several processes to share Perl
  variables using System V shared memory. You simply <tt>tie()</tt>
  the variables you wish to share, specifying a unique four-letter
  identifier for each variable. After this, each process can share
  data simply by reading and storing to the tied variable.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0301-0001d.html">Listing 3</a> shows the
  PageSession module modified to use IPC::Shareable. The main
  addition is on lines 6 and 7, where we tie <tt>$NEXTID</tt> and
  <tt>%SESSIONS</tt>. The other changes are strategically-placed
  calls to IPC::Shareable's <tt>shlock()</tt> and
  <tt>shunlock()</tt> methods. To avoid the risk of two processes
  trying to update the same variable simultaneously, we lock the
  variable before writing to it, and unlock it when we're through.
  Now the session objects shared across all Apache processes and we
  can safely run the server in normal mode. An added benefit of
  this design is that the persistent information remains in shared
  memory space even after the Apache process terminates. The
  result: we can stop the server, restart it, and all previous user
  sessions will still be available!</p>

  <h3>OTHER MOD_PERL FEATURES</h3>

  <p><b>Startup scripts</b>. You can designate a script to run when
  the Apache server first starts up. This can adjust the library
  search path, set global variables, and compile commonly-used
  modules, avoiding the overhead when individual handlers are first
  called.</p>

  <p><b>Server-Side Includes</b>. The standard Apache mod_include
  module has been integrated with mod_perl, so you can embed
  snippets of Perl code in your HTML pages like this:</p>
  <pre>
Perl is
    &lt;!--#perl sub="sub {for (0..10) {print "very "}}"--&gt;
fun to use!
</pre>

  <p>Two sophisticated server-side packages, Apache::Embperl and
  Apache::ePerl, are built on top of mod_perl.</p>
  <pre>
Perl-Based Server Configuration
</pre>. With mod_perl you can dynamically configure Apache with
<tt>&lt;Perl&gt;</tt> sections inside its configuration files.
These sections can contain any and as much Perl code that you can
use to inspect and change Apache's configuration in every way
conceivable. You can write a configuration file that senses its
environment and autoconfigures itself!

  <p><b>Stacked Handlers</b>. One Perl handler can chain to another
  handler, allowing you, for instance, to build up a chain of
  filters that progressively modify an HTML document.</p>

  <p><b>Persistent Database Connections</b>. mod_perl persistence
  allows you to open up a single database handle when a child
  server starts and use it for all subsequent requests. This avoids
  the overhead of constantly opening and closing connections that
  CGI scripts suffer. The Perl DBI and Apache::DBI modules have
  been integrated to make persistent connections transparent, the
  only change needed in your server configuration file:</p>
  <pre>
PerlModule Apache::DBI
</pre>

  <p>On top of these features, dozens of mod_perl fans have
  contributed to a growing list of useful modules. These
  contributed modules include a traffic analyzer, a module that
  blocks unwanted robots, a module that chooses from multiple
  documents based on the user's language preference, a module to
  compress response data on-the-fly, and a whole slew of user
  authentication packages. See
  <i>CPAN/modules/by-module/Apache/apache-modlist.html</i> for a
  full list of available modules.</p>
