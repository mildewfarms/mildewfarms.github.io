  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  Of all the chatterbots - programs that converse with humans -
  Eliza is the most famous. The original Eliza was written by
  Professor Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT and described in the
  <i>Communications of the ACM</i> in 1967 (Vol. 10, No. 8). This
  program is older than I am - and yet remains fascinating to this
  day. It's one of the all-time classic programs in computer
  science. Eliza pretends to be a Rogerian psychiatrist; whatever
  the human says, it replies - usually with a question - in an
  attempt to encourage the patient to elaborate.

  <p>The Eliza algorithm has been cloned dozens of times in all
  kinds of programming languages, including Fortran, Basic, Pascal,
  C, Java, and JavaScript. The first Eliza was written in a
  Lisp-like language called MAD-Slip, way back in pre-Unix days.
  (Eliza is named after Eliza Doolittle, the cockney-speaking woman
  taught to speak proper English in G.B.Shaw's book Pygmalion.)</p>

  <p>Last year I took a course in Natural Language Processing, and
  was surprised to find that much of the research in the field
  still uses Lisp. Lisp is a fine language, but Perl can do
  anything Lisp can do, and Perl source code is much easier to
  read. I searched the Web for Eliza clones, but I couldn't find
  any written in Perl. So I wrote one.</p>

  <p>The Chatbot::Eliza module is a faithful clone of Weizenbaum's
  Eliza algorithm. It encapsulates Eliza's behavior within an
  object.</p>

  <p>You can install Chatbot::Eliza just like any other Perl
  module. Once installed, this little bit of code is all you need
  to start an interactive Eliza session:</p>
  <pre>

   use Chatbot::Eliza;

   $mybot = new Chatbot::Eliza; 

   $mybot-&gt;command_interface; 

</pre>

  <p>Let's see what this looks like. If you install the module from
  the CPAN, save the three lines of code above to a file, and then
  execute it, here's what the output looks like:</p>
  <pre>

Eliza: Please tell me what's been bothering you. 

you: 

</pre>

  <p>This is an interactive session; type your reply to Eliza after
  the you: prompt. <a href="tpj0301-0002a.html">Listing 1</a>.
  shows a transcript of a sample run. You can set a few parameters
  of your Eliza object, such as its name, or a configuration file
  for it to read:</p>
  <pre>

 $myotherbot = new Chatbot::Eliza "Brian", "myscript.txt";

 $myotherbot-&gt;command_interface; 

</pre>

  <p>In this way, you can customize what the chatterbot says by
  providing your own configuration file. This consists of a list of
  keywords, decomposition rules, and reassemble rules. If you don't
  like Eliza's default rules, you can write your own.</p>

  <p>For instance, the following lines in <tt>myscript.txt</tt>
  would have Eliza (or Brian, as we've called it above) begin with
  one of two otherworldly greetings, chosen at random:</p>
  <pre>

  initial: Greetings Earthling!

  initial: Take me to your leader!

</pre>

  <p>Chatbot::Eliza contains a default configuration file with
  default greetings, salutations, 'quit'-equivalents, and rules for
  determining how Eliza should converse. If you want to want to
  watch Eliza think, you can turn on the debugging output before
  you launch your session:</p>
  <pre>

  $mybot-&gt;debug(1); 

  $mybot-&gt;command_interface; 

</pre>

  <p><a href="tpj0301-0002b.html">Listing 2</a> shows part of the
  same session as Listing 1, with the debugging output turned
  on.</p>

  <p>The Eliza algorithm is actually relatively straightforward. It
  consists of three steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Search the input string for a keyword.</li>

    <li>If we find a keyword, use the list of "decomposition rules"
    for that keyword, and pattern-match the input string against
    each rule.</li>

    <li>If the input string matches any of the decomposition rules,
    then randomly select one of the "reassemble rules" for that
    decomposition rule, and use it to construct the reply.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>So, in <a href="tpj0301-0002b.html">Listing 2</a>, Eliza read
  the input string <tt>He says I am too lazy</tt> and found the
  keyword <tt>i</tt>. It ran through its entire list of keywords,
  but <tt>i</tt> is the only one that matched. The keywords are
  ranked; if more than one keyword matches, it picks the most
  salient.</p>

  <p>Next, it applied all the decomposition rules for the keyword
  <tt>i</tt>, (<tt>* i was *, * i am* @happy *</tt>, and so on) to
  see if any matched. One rule did: <tt>* i am *</tt>. Using this
  rule, we isolate parts of the input string around i am: the two
  phrases He says and too lazy.</p>

  <p>Next we randomly select a reassemble rule: <tt>Is it because
  you are (2) that you came to me</tt>. We use this rule to
  construct the reply. We replace <tt>(2)</tt> with the text that
  matched the second asterisk in the decomposition rule - in our
  example, the string <tt>too lazy</tt>. Finally, Eliza replies
  with, <tt>Is it because you are too lazy that you came to
  me?</tt></p>

  <p>The Eliza algorithm has pre- and post-processing steps as
  well. These handle the transformation of words like <tt>I</tt>
  and <tt>you</tt>; you can read the documentation embedded in the
  module to learn more.</p>

  <p>You can also access all of the module's internal functions
  from your program. For example, using the <tt>transform()</tt>
  method, you can feed a string to Eliza and fetch its
  response:</p>
  <pre>

   $string   = "I'm sad."; 

   $response = $mybot-&gt;transform( $string ); 

</pre>

  <p>The Eliza bot is an object, and its configuration data is
  encapsulated,which means that you can instantiate other Eliza
  bots, each with their own distinct configurations.</p>

  <p>In <a href="tpj0301-0002c.html">Listing 3</a>, we create two
  bots and make them talk to one another. Two bots conversing only
  produces interesting results if we have clever scripts. <a href=
  "tpj0301-0002d.html">Listing 4</a> shows sample output from the
  program, where both bots use the default Eliza script. In
  general, the default Eliza script does not produce any sensible
  conversation when interacting with itself. (In fairness, people
  who talk to themselves often don't make much sense either.)</p>

  <p>One of the reasons the original Eliza was so successful was
  Weizenbaum's clever rules and limited domain; the role of a mock
  Rogerian psychotherapist doesn't require much intelligence, and a
  relatively simple algorithm can pull it off. But as Weizenbaum
  found, even this relatively simple program fooled naive users
  into believing that it understood what they were saying. Scarier
  still, some people actually felt more comfortable talking to
  Eliza than a flesh-and-blood psychiatrist.</p>

  <p><a href="tpj0301-0002e.html">Listing 5</a> shows an
  interactive session, this time with a human deliberately trying
  to expose Eliza's weaknesses.</p>

  <h3>What Now?</h3>

  <p>The CPAN includes many modules which allow a script to
  interact easily with resources on the Internet. For example, it
  is straightforward to write scripts which combine the
  Chatbot::Eliza module with the Net::IRC module or the CGI module.
  (The CPAN distribution of Chatbot::Eliza includes a sample CGI
  script - a Web-based Eliza.)</p>

  <p>I am currently working on alternative rulesets. If I come up
  with one that works reasonably well, I'll include it in future
  releases of the module.</p>
