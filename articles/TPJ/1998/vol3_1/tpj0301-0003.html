  Perl is a language of acceptable subsets. Larry Wall has said,
  many times, that it's okay to not know everything. If you knew
  enough to get the job done, then obviously you knew all you
  needed to.

  <p>The more you know about Perl, though, and the more of its
  features you use, the more you must understand how they work.
  When you put these features together, they can often interact in
  surprising ways. This article explores the interaction between
  context, prototyping, and subroutine calls.</p>

  <p>Tom Christiansen has long been in favor of reducing these
  interactions by dropping context. In fact, he goes so far as to
  call it "cryptocontext," and he came up with the challenge which
  prompted this article.</p>

  <p>Given these:</p>
  <pre>
     sub f($$); 
         
     @a = (5,9); 
</pre>

  <p>Explain what each of these does, and why:</p>
  <pre>
    &amp;f; 
    &amp;f(); 
    f(); 
    f; 
    f(@a); 
    f(@a[0,1]); 
    f(@a, @a); 
    &amp;f(@a); 
    &amp;f(@a, @a); 
    f('ls /bin', 'ls /tmp'); 
    &amp;f('ls /bin', 'ls /tmp');
</pre>

  <p>Frightened that these may not do the obvious? Read on, and
  I'll explain what happens.</p>

  <h3>Context</h3>

  <p>Context is one of the gnarlier pieces of Perl. While Tom is
  anti-context, Larry Wall is a proponent. This is as you'd expect
  - he incorporated it into the language. Larry is a linguist, and
  he tried to adapt some of the features of successful natural
  languages in the hopes of making Perl a successful unnatural
  language. Context was one of those features.</p>

  <p>When compiling and running your program, the Perl interpreter
  associates a context with every expression. There are three types
  of context: void, scalar, and list. Void and scalar are almost
  identical, and we'll be looking at the difference between them
  and list context.</p>

  <p>You may have encountered the importance of context in
  situations like these:</p>
  <pre>
    @list_context   = 'ls'; 

    $scalar_context = 'ls';
</pre>

  <p><tt>@list_context</tt> now holds the output of <tt>ls</tt>,
  one line per list element. <tt>$scalar_context</tt> has the
  output of <tt>ls</tt> as one big string with embedded newlines.
  The backticks know what to return (one big string of many lines,
  or many one-line strings) because of the context they were called
  in.</p>

  <p>You also see context in other situations:</p>
  <pre>
    if (@array) { 
        # the array is not empty 
    }
</pre>

  <p>The if statement needs to test the truth of <tt>@array</tt>,
  and so evaluates it in a scalar context. It just so happens that
  an array in scalar context evaluates to the number of elements in
  the array. Thus:</p>
  <pre>
    @array = ('a', 'b', 'c'); 
    $count = @array + 1;
</pre>

  <p><tt>$count</tt> is now set to four. This is where the
  distinction between arrays and lists becomes important. Lists
  don't behave the same:</p>
  <pre>
    $count = (5, 7, 9) + 1;
</pre>

  <p>This sets <tt>$count</tt> to ten. A list in scalar context
  evaluates to the value of the last element, in this case
  nine.</p>

  <p>You can see why context is confusing. Let's stop talking
  context and consider prototypes.</p>

  <h3>Prototypes</h3>

  <p>Version 5.003 of Perl added support for prototypes. They let
  you tell Perl what type of arguments your subroutines expect;
  Perl can then do some elementary type-checking and optimizations
  with that information.</p>

  <p>A prototyped subroutine looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
    sub add_two ($$) { 
        return $_[0] + $_[1]; 
    }

</pre>The <tt>($$)</tt> is the prototype. It's a shorthand to
identify the types of the arguments that will be passed to your
subroutine. In this case, Perl is told to expect two scalars. You
can prototype your subroutines without defining them:
  <pre>
  sub add_two ($$); # add_two will be defined later
</pre>

  <p>If you then try to call your subroutine without two arguments
  that can be evaluated as scalars, Perl will complain. (However,
  almost everything can be coerced to a scalar. Scalar prototypes
  accept <tt>@arrays</tt> and <tt>%hashes</tt> without warning!)
  All prototype checking is performed during compilation - before
  your program is run. This means that the prototype-checking stage
  of the compiler is necessarily limited in what it can deduce. In
  particular, you can't build up an array of arguments and pass the
  array to a subroutine prototyped to take many scalars:</p>
  <pre>
  sub complain_about ($$$$);

  @args = (0, 1, 2, 3);

  complain_about(@args); # WRONG
</pre>

  <p>The compiler can't know beforehand how big <tt>@args</tt> will
  be when <tt>complain_about()</tt> is called; that's a runtime
  thing. Sure, <tt>@args</tt> was just assigned to, but the
  compiler only built the internal instructions to make that
  assignment - it hasn't actually created the array in memory. That
  won't happen until runtime. So the compiler sees an array where
  it was expecting four scalars, and complains.</p>

  <p>This behavior can be annoying sometimes, so Perl provides a
  way to bypass prototype checking.</p>

  <h3>Calling subroutines</h3>

  <p>You can turn off the prototype checking for a particular call
  by using the <tt>&amp;</tt> notation:</p>
  <pre>
&amp;complain_about(@args); # ALLOWED
</pre>

  <p><tt>&amp;</tt> is also used for another shortcut. If you call
  a subroutine with <tt>&amp;</tt> and give it no argument list,
  Perl will use the current <tt>@_</tt> as the subroutine's
  argument list. That is:</p>
  <pre>
  @_ = ( 4, 6, 8 ); 

  sub count_args { 
      return scalar(@_); 
  }


  $two   =  count_args(3,5); 
  $two   = &amp;count_args(3,5); 
  $zero  = &amp;count_args(); 
  $three = &amp;count_args;
</pre>

  <p>The first two calls to <tt>count_args()</tt> are identical. If
  we had prototyped <tt>count_args()</tt> they might be different,
  but since we didn't, the <tt>&amp;</tt> is redundant. The third
  example also bypasses the nonexistent prototype and calls
  <tt>count_args()</tt> with no arguments. The fourth example shows
  how the <tt>@_</tt> of the caller - that is, (<tt>4, 6, 8</tt>) -
  becomes the <tt>@_</tt> (the argument list) of the subroutine.
  It's the same <tt>@_</tt>, not a copy!</p>

  <h3>Putting them all together</h3>

  <p>Here's the crux of the interaction: when a subroutine is
  prototyped (and isn't bypassed with <tt>&amp;</tt>), the
  prototype specifies the context the arguments will be evaluated
  in. Let's revisit the example at the beginning of the
  article:</p>
  <pre>
   sub f($$);
   @a = (5, 9);
</pre>

  <p>Now let's consider Tom's subroutine calls one by one and see
  what happens to each of them.</p>
  <pre>
    &amp;f;
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>&amp;</tt> bypasses subroutine prototypes, so the
  compiler won't complain about the subroutine call not matching
  its prototype. The call also has no argument list, so <tt>f</tt>
  is called with its caller's <tt>@_</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
    &amp;f();
</pre>

  <p><tt>f</tt> is called with an empty argument list. The compiler
  won't complain because, again, the <tt>&amp;</tt> causes the
  subroutine prototypes to be bypassed.</p>
  <pre>
    f();
</pre>

  <p>No <tt>&amp;</tt> means that the compiler will check the
  subroutine call against its prototype, and when it sees that
  <tt>f</tt> is being called with an empty argument list but was
  prototyped to take two scalars, it will complain. In short, it
  won't compile.</p>
  <pre>
    f;
</pre>

  <p>This is the same situation as above. The only difference
  between <tt>f()</tt> and <tt>f</tt> is that use strict prevents
  <tt>f</tt> from compiling.</p>
  <pre>
    f(@a);
</pre>

  <p>No <tt>&amp;</tt> means that subroutine prototypes are
  checked. The single array argument doesn't match the two scalar
  arguments in the prototype, so the compiler will complain and
  stop the program.</p>
  <pre>
    f(@a[0,1]);
</pre>

  <p>This also won't compile. Although we're taking a two-element
  slice from the array, the compiler sees the array slice and not
  two scalars. If this seems a little odd, consider that we could
  have had <tt>@a[$b..$c]</tt>, the size of which can't be known
  until runtime.</p>
  <pre>
    f(@a, @a);
</pre>

  <p>Alarmingly, this does compile. The compiler knows, from the
  prototype, that f takes two scalars. An array can be evaluated in
  scalar context, so this call is equivalent to <tt>f(2, 2)</tt>
  because <tt>@a</tt> in scalar context evaluates to 2.
  Surprised?</p>
  <pre>
    &amp;f(@a);
</pre>

  <p>This also compiles. The <tt>&amp;</tt> disables prototype
  checking, so <tt>@a</tt> becomes the <tt>@_</tt> of the
  subroutine. This is equivalent to <tt>f(5,9)</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
    &amp;f(@a, @a);
</pre>

  <p>This is equivalent to <tt>f(5,9,5,9)</tt>. The <tt>&amp;</tt>
  turns off prototype checking, and so the list (<tt>@a, @a</tt>)
  is flattened to (<tt>5,9,5,9</tt>).</p>
  <pre>
    f('ls /bin', 'ls /tmp');
</pre>

  <p>This compiles, and calls <tt>f</tt> with two long strings.
  Each string is the complete output of an <tt>ls</tt> command,
  embedded newlines and all. The prototype tells the compiler to
  evaluate the arguments in scalar context, so the backtick output
  results in long strings.</p>
  <pre>
    &amp;f('ls /bin', 'ls /tmp');
</pre>

  <p>By turning off prototype checking with <tt>&amp;</tt>, we
  prevent <tt>f</tt>'s arguments being evaluated in scalar context.
  The function call provides list context for the arguments, which
  means that the backticks yield many strings. On my system, this
  is equivalent to calling <tt>f</tt> with about seventy
  arguments.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>We have two lessons to learn from this (besides "anything can
  be made hard if you think about it long enough").</p>

  <p><b>Context is subtle.</b> If you're having trouble with
  subroutine calls, and you're using prototypes, look at how the
  compiler is behaving as a result of the prototypes. Perhaps
  context is causing your problems.</p>

  <p><b>Prototypes are a mixed blessing.</b> In some relatively
  straightforward situations, prototypes are a useful way to catch
  incorrect subroutine calls. In other situations, though, they may
  be useless. You should probably only use them to mimic the
  behavior of built-in functions like <tt>push()</tt> and
  <tt>splice()</tt>.</p>
