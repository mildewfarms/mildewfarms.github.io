  Summer is in the air, and young hackers' thoughts turn to writing
  gloriously awful code. And yes, despite our editors'
  protestations, despite the restraining order, despite even
  explicit medical advice from our therapists, we're once again
  proud to bring you the infamous, world-renounced <b>Obfuscated
  Perl Contest</b>.

  <p>The objective: to determine who can write the most devious,
  inhuman, disgusting, amusing, amazing, and bizarre Perl code.</p>

  <p>The prizes: a lovingly manufactured trophy made of high
  durability space age materials, suitable for brazen display or
  shameful and secretive night burial. Also <tt>ord 'd'</tt>
  dollars. But wait! Before you rush to your keyboard to craft your
  outr&eacute; &aelig;uvre, here are the categories in which you
  may enter:</p>

  <h3>1. MOST POWERFUL</h3>

  <p>This award is granted to the code which does the most with the
  least. The limit on bytecount is 512 characters, not including
  whitespace.</p>

  <h3>2. MOST CREATIVE</h3>

  <p>This award goes to the most stunningly intriguing or
  ridiculously hilarious combination of obfuscation and
  functionality. The limit is 1024 bytes of Perl code, not
  including whitespace.</p>

  <h3>3. BEST 'THE PERL JOURNAL'</h3>

  <p>In the fine 'just another Perl hacker' tradition, this award
  is given to the best code which generates the text 'The Perl
  Journal'. Case and context are unimpor-tant. The limit is 1024
  bytes of Perl code, not including whitespace. In addition to
  these three categories, the judges will award one applicant the
  coveted and yet feared 'BEST OF SHOW' award.</p>

  <h3>THE RULES</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>All programs must run under Perl 5.004.</li>

    <li>Programs may use only the functionalityincluded in the
    basic Perl distribution. Nothing beyond what's included in the
    standard distribution is available.</li>

    <li>Programs will be run on the judges' choice of platforms.
    The only guarantees about these platforms are that their
    interpreters pass make test, they have at least 4 megabytes of
    available user-space memory, and they have at least 1 megabyte
    of external storage. Programs may use whatever resources they
    find available beyond those limits, however.</li>

    <li>Submitted programs remain the credited property of the
    author, but may be duplicated, quoted, edited for style, and
    disseminated freely by The Perl Journal.</li>

    <li>All programs should be uploaded by anonymous FTP to tpj.com
    in the directory pub/orwant/obfuscated by August 10, 1998. The
    tar (or zip) archive must contain the following items:

      <ul>
        <li>The program.</li>

        <li>A README file providing attribution (including your
        email address) and the category the program is for. Please
        provide <i>no</i> information about how the program works
        or what it does in the README file.</li>

        <li>A SOLUTION file explaining how the program works.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The archive should be named
      <tt>YOURNAME.CATEGORYNUM.ENTRYNUM.tar</tt> or
      <tt>.zip</tt>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The winners and their winning submissions will be announced
    in issue <a href="../vol3_3/tpj0303-0015.html">#11</a> of TPJ,
    in comp.lang.perl.announce, and on tpj.com. The 3rd Annual
    Obfuscated Perl Contest</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>

  <p>As last time, judging will take place in three phases.</p>

  <p>In the first phase, we'll read the README and then examine the
  program carefully in order to assess its aesthetics. Any code we
  actually understand at this point is probably not obfuscated
  enough.</p>

  <p>In the second phase, we'll run the code, examine the output,
  and read the code again in light of its output. In the third
  phase, we will perform unnamed rituals with filters, pretty
  printers, debuggers, and whatever else we can think of to
  determine how the code works. Any code that we don't understand
  at the end of this phase is probably a winner, at which point
  we'll give up in tears and look at the SOLUTIONS file.</p>

  <h3>HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS</h3>

  <p>Judging obfuscation and what's 'cool', 'neat', or 'best' is a
  subjective process. However, here are some general guidelines
  which might help you design your entry.</p>

  <p>Overuse of one particular obfuscation method risks being
  tedious. Entries which demonstrate breadth, range, and knowledge
  are likely to beat entries which rely on repeated parlor
  tricks.</p>

  <p>Being clever and humorous is good. As an example, a past
  winner in the Obfuscated C contest (our pale, weaker cousin)
  formatted his code in the shape of a maze; the program read its
  own source code and implemented an ASCII 3D maze walking
  program.</p>

  <p>Being surprising and deceitful is very good. Bonus points are
  awarded for obfuscated code which is not only syntactically
  obfuscated, but semantically obfuscated - code which appears to
  do one thing but does another is deemed extremely devilish.</p>

  <p>Being poetic is also very good.</p>

  <p>Entries needn't contain a <tt>#!/usr/bin/ perl</tt> (or
  equivalent), unless they use nonobvious command-line switches.
  Neither the <tt>#!/usr/bin/perl</tt> nor the command-line
  switches will count toward the character limits.</p>

  <p>Programs which purposefully crash machines or cause system
  problems tend to be unamusing, so please consider saving them for
  the Perl system destroyers' contest.</p>

  <p>The best examples of quality obfuscation are the winners from
  previous years. Some of the most notorious entries are shown at
  right.</p>

  <h3>SO THERE YOU HAVE IT</h3>

  <p>Please submit early and often, and encourage anyone you know
  who might be interested to do the same.</p>

  <p>Although Perl has taken some hard knocks as being a write-only
  language (and this contest could be construed as an unabashed
  celebration of that fact), the intent of this contest is to
  demonstrate Perl's tersity and power, while at the same time
  giving the creative and demented minds of the Internet's legions
  a fun, intriguing playground. So have fun!</p>

  <p>Although we do not accept entries via e-mail (FTP only, as
  above), questions regarding this contest should be directed to
  contest@tpj.com.</p>

  <p>We look forward with some trepidation to seeing your code!</p>
