  <p>Suppose you're composing a document with Microsoft Word. You
  want to include an Excel spreadsheet. You could save the
  spreadsheet in some image format that Word can understand, and
  import it into your document. But if the spreadsheet changes,
  your document will be out of date.</p>

  <p>Microsoft's OLE (Object Linking and Embedding, pronounced
  "olay") lets one program use objects from another. In the above
  scenario, the spreadsheet is the object. As long as Excel makes
  that spreadsheet available as an OLE object, and Word knows to
  treat it like one, your document will always be current.</p>

  <p>You can control OLE objects from Perl with the Win32::OLE
  module, and that's what this article is about. First, I'll show
  you how to "think OLE," which mostly involves a lot of jargon.
  Next, I'll show you the mechanics involved in using Win32::OLE.
  Then we'll go through a Perl program that uses OLE to manipulate
  Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, and Lotus Notes. Finally, I'll
  talk about Variants, an internal OLE data type.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <h3>THE OLE MINDSET</h3>
  </div>

  <p>When an application makes an OLE object available for other
  applications to use, that's called OLE <i>automation</i>. The
  program using the object is called the <i>controller</i>, and the
  application providing the object is called the <i>server</i>. OLE
  automation is guided by the OLE Component Object Model (COM)
  which specifies how those objects must behave if they are to be
  used by other processes and machines.</p>

  <p>There are two different types of OLE automation servers.
  <i>In-process</i> servers are implemented as dynamic link
  libraries (DLLs) and run in the same process space as the
  controller. <i>Out-of-process</i> servers are more interesting;
  they are standalone executables that exist as separate processes
  - possibly on a different computer.</p>

  <p>The Win32::OLE module lets your Perl program act as an OLE
  controller. It allows Perl to be used in place of other languages
  like Visual Basic or Java to control OLE objects. This makes all
  OLE automation servers immediately available as Perl modules.</p>

  <p>Don't confuse ActiveState OLE with Win32::OLE. ActiveState OLE
  is completely different, although future builds of ActiveState
  Perl (500 and up) will work with Win32::OLE.</p>

  <p>Objects can expose OLE methods, properties, and events to the
  outside world. Methods are functions that the controller can call
  to make the object do something; properties describe the state of
  the object; and events let the controller know about external
  events affecting the object, such as the user clicking on a
  button. Since events involve asynchronous communication with
  their objects, they require either threads or an event loop. They
  are not yet supported by the Win32::OLE module, and for the same
  reason ActiveX controls (OCXs) are currently unsupported as
  well.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <h3>WORKING WITH WIN32::OLE</h3>
  </div>

  <p>The Win32::OLE module doesn't let your Perl program create OLE
  objects. What it does do is let your Perl program act like a
  remote control for other applications-it lets your program be an
  OLE controller. You can take an OLE object from another
  application (Access, Notes, Excel, or anything else that speaks
  OLE) and invoke its methods or manipulate its properties.</p>

  <h4>THE FIRST STEP:CREATING AN OLE SERVER OBJECT</h4>

  <p>First, we need to create a Perl object to represent the OLE
  server. This is a weird idea; what it amounts to is that if we
  want to control OLE objects produced by, say, Excel, we have to
  create a Perl object that represents Excel. So even though our
  program is an OLE controller, it'll contain objects that
  represent OLE servers.</p>

  <p>You can create a new OLE <i>server object</i> with
  <tt>Win32::OLE-&gt;new</tt>. This takes a program ID (a human
  readable string like '<tt>Speech.VoiceText</tt>') and returns a
  server object:</p>
  <pre>
my $server = Win32::OLE-&gt;new('Excel.Application', 'Quit');
</pre>

  <p>Some server objects (particularly those for Microsoft Office
  applications) don't automatically terminate when your program no
  longer needs them. They need some kind of Quit method, and that's
  just what our second argument is. It can be either a code
  reference or a method name to be invoked when the object is
  destroyed. This lets you ensure that objects will be properly
  cleaned up even when the Perl program dies abnormally.</p>

  <p>To access a server object on a different computer, replace the
  first argument with a reference to a list of the server name and
  program ID:</p>
  <pre>
my $server = Win32::OLE-&gt;new(['foo.bar.com',
                                 'Excel.Application']);
</pre>

  <p>(To get the requisite permissions, you'll need to configure
  your security settings with DCOMCNFG.EXE.)</p>

  <p>You can also directly attach your program to an already
  running OLE server:</p>
  <pre>
my $server = Win32::OLE-&gt;GetActiveObject('Excel.Application');
</pre>

  <p>This fails (returning <tt>undef</tt>) if no server exists, or
  if the server refuses the connection for some reason. It is also
  possible to use a persistent object moniker (usually a filename)
  to start the associated server and load the object into
  memory:</p>
  <pre>
my $doc = Win32::OLE-&gt;GetObject("MyDocument.Doc");
</pre>

  <h4>METHOD CALLS</h4>

  <p>Once you've created one of these server objects, you need to
  call its methods to make the OLE objects sing and dance. OLE
  methods are invoked just like normal Perl object methods:</p>
  <pre>
$server-&gt;Foo(@Arguments);
</pre>

  <p>This is a Perl method call - but it also triggers an OLE
  method call in the object. After your program executes this
  statement, the <tt>$server</tt> object will execute its
  <tt>Foo()</tt> method. The available methods are typically
  documented in the application's <i>object model</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Parameters.</b> By default, all parameters are positional
  (e.g. <tt>foo($first, $second, $third)</tt>) rather than named
  (e.g. <tt>foo(-name =&gt; "Yogi", -title =&gt; "Coach")</tt>).
  The required parameters come first, followed by the optional
  parameters; if you need to provide a dummy value for an optional
  parameter, use <tt>undef</tt>.</p>

  <p>Positional parameters get cumbersome if a method takes a lot
  of them. You can use named arguments instead if you go to a
  little extra trouble - when the last argument is a reference to a
  hash, the key/value pairs of the hash are treated as named
  parameters:</p>
  <pre>
$server-&gt;Foo($Pos1, $Pos2, <b>{Name1 =&gt; $Value1,</b>
                            <b>Name2 =&gt; $Value2})</b>;
</pre>

  <p><b>Foreign Languages and Default Methods.</b> Sometimes OLE
  servers use method and property names that are specific to a
  non-English locale. That means they might have non-ASCII
  characters, which aren't allowed in Perl variable names. In
  German, you might see <tt>&Ouml;ffnen</tt> used instead of
  <tt>Open</tt>. In these cases, you can use the <tt>Invoke()</tt>
  method:</p>
  <pre>
$server-&gt;Invoke('&Ouml;ffnen', @Arguments);
</pre>

  <p>This is necessary because
  <tt>$Server-&gt;&Ouml;ffnen(@Arguments)</tt> is a syntax error in
  current versions of Perl.</p>

  <h4>PROPERTIES</h4>

  <p>As I said earlier, objects can expose three things to the
  outside world: methods, properties, and events. We've covered
  methods, and Win32::OLE can't handle events. That leaves
  properties. But as it turns out, properties and events are
  largely interchangeable. Most methods have corresponding
  properties, and vice versa.</p>

  <p>An object's properties can be accessed with a hash
  reference:</p>
  <pre>
$server-&gt;{Bar} = $value;
$value = $server-&gt;{Bar};
</pre>

  <p>This example sets and queries the value of the property named
  <tt>Bar</tt>. You could also have called the object's
  <tt>Bar()</tt> method to achieve the same effect:</p>
  <pre>
$value = $server-&gt;Bar;
</pre>

  <p>However, you can't write the first line as <tt>$server-&gt;Bar
  = $value</tt>, because you can't assign to the return value of a
  method call. In Visual Basic, OLE automation distinguishes
  between assigning the name of an object and assigning its
  value:</p>
  <pre>
Set Object = OtherObject
&#13;Let Value = Object
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>Set</tt> statement shown here makes <tt>Object</tt>
  refer to the same object as <tt>OtherObject</tt>. The
  <tt>Let</tt> statement copies the value instead. (The value of an
  OLE object is what you get when you call the object's default
  method.</p>

  <p>In Perl, saying <tt>$server1 = $server2</tt> always creates
  another reference, just like the <tt>Set</tt> in Visual Basic. If
  you want to assign the value instead, use the <tt>valof()</tt>
  function:</p>
  <pre>
my $value = valof $server;
This is equivalent to
my $value = $server-&gt;Invoke('');
</pre>

  <h4>SAMPLE APPLICATION</h4>

  <p>Let's look at how all of this might be used. In Listing: 1
  you'll see <a href="tpj0302-0008a.html">T-Bond.pl</a>, a program
  that uses Win32::OLE for an almost-real world application.</p>

  <p>The developer of this application, Mary Lynch, is a financial
  futures broker. Every afternoon, she connects to the Chicago
  Board of Trade (CBoT) web site at <a href="http://www.cbot.com"
  target="resource window">http://www.cbot.com</a> and collects the
  time and sales information for U.S. T-bond futures. She wants her
  program to create a chart that depicts the data in 15-minute
  intervals, and then she wants to record the data in a database
  for later analysis. Then she wants her program to send mail to
  her clients.</p>

  <p>Mary's program will use Microsoft Access as a database,
  Microsoft Excel to produce the chart, and Lotus Notes to send the
  mail. It will all be controlled from a single Perl program using
  OLE automation. In this section, we'll go through <i>T-Bond.
  pl</i> step by step so you can see how Win32::OLE lets you
  control these applications.</p>

  <h4>DOWNLOADING A WEB PAGE WITH LWP</h4>

  <p>However, Mary first needs to amass the raw T-bond data by
  having her Perl program automatically download and parse a web
  page. That's the perfect job for LWP, the libwww-perl bundle
  available on the CPAN. LWP has nothing to do with OLE. But this
  is a real-world application, and it's just what Mary needs to
  download her data from the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
  <pre>
use LWP::Simple;
my $URL = 'http://www.cbot.com/mplex/quotes/tsfut';
my $text = get("$URL/tsf$Contract.htm");
</pre>

  <p>She could also have used the Win32::Internet module:</p>
  <pre>
use Win32::Internet;
my $URL = 'http://www.cbot.com/mplex/quotes/tsfut';
my $text =
  $Win32::Internet-&gt;new-&gt;FetchURL("$URL/tsf$Contract.htm");
</pre>

  <p>Mary wants to condense the ticker data into 15 minute bars.
  She's interested only in lines that look like this:</p>
  <pre>
03/12/1998 US 98Mar 12116 15:28:34 Open
</pre>

  <p>A regular expression can be used to determine whether a line
  looks like this. If it does, the regex can split it up into
  individual fields. The price quoted above, <tt>12116</tt>, really
  means 121 16/32, and needs to be converted to 121.5. The data is
  then condensed into 15 minute intervals and only the first, last,
  highest, and lowest price during each interval are kept. The time
  series is stored in the array <tt>@Bars</tt>. Each entry in
  <tt>@Bars</tt> is a reference to a list of 5 elements: Time,
  Open, High, Low, and Close.</p>
  <pre>
foreach (split "\n", $text) {
    # 03/12/1998 US 98Mar 12116 15:28:34 Open
    my ($Date,$Price,$Hour,$Min,$Sec,$Ind) =
         m|^\s*(<b>\d+/\d+/\d+</b>) # " 03/12/1998"
            \s+US\s+\S+\s+<b>(\d+)</b> # " US 98Mar 12116"
            \s+<b>(\d+):(\d+):(\d+)</b> # " 12:42:40"
            \s*<b>(.*)</b>$|x; # " Ask"
    next unless defined $Date;
    $Day = $Date;
	
    # Convert from fractional to decimal format
    $Price = int($Price/100) + ($Price%100)/32;
	
    # Round up time to next multiple of 15 minutes
    my $NewTime = int(($Sec+$Min*60+$Hour*3600)/900+1)*900;
    unless (defined $Time &amp;&amp; $NewTime == $Time) {
        push @Bars, [$hhmm, $Open, $High, $Low, $Close]
                                          if defined $Time;
        $Open = $High = $Low = $Close = undef;
        $Time = $NewTime;
        my $Hour = int($Time/3600);
        $hhmm = sprintf "%02d:%02d", $Hour, $Time/60-$Hour*60;
    }
	
    # Update 15 minute bar values
    $Close = $Price;
    $Open = $Price unless defined $Open;
    $High = $Price unless defined $High &amp;&amp; $High &gt; $Price;
    $Low = $Price unless defined $Low &amp;&amp; $Low &gt; $Price;
}
&#13;die "No data found" unless defined $Time;
push @Bars, [$hhmm, $Open, $High, $Low, $Close];
</pre>

  <h4>MICROSOFT ACCESS</h4>

  <p>Now that Mary has her T-bond quotes, she's ready to use
  Win32::OLE to store them into a Microsoft Access database. This
  has the advantage that she can copy the database to her lap-top
  and work with it on her long New York commute. She's able to
  create an Access database as follows:</p>
  <pre>
use Win32::ODBC;
use Win32::OLE;
&#13;# Include the constants for the Microsoft Access
# "Data Access Object".
&#13;use Win32::OLE::Const 'Microsoft DAO';
&#13;my $DSN      = 'T-Bonds';
my $Driver   = 'Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)';
my $Desc     = 'US T-Bond Quotes';
my $Dir      = 'i:\tmp\tpj';
my $File     = 'T-Bonds.mdb';
my $Fullname = "$Dir\\$File";
&#13;# Remove old database and dataset name
unlink $Fullname if -f $Fullname;
Win32::ODBC::ConfigDSN(ODBC_REMOVE_DSN, $Driver, "DSN=$DSN")
                       if Win32::ODBC::DataSources($DSN);
&#13;# Create new database
my $Access = Win32::OLE-&gt;new('Access.Application', 'Quit');
my $Workspace = $Access-&gt;DBEngine-&gt;CreateWorkspace('',
                                                 'Admin', '');
my $Database = $Workspace-&gt;CreateDatabase($Fullname,
                                           dbLangGeneral);
&#13;# Add new database name
Win32::ODBC::ConfigDSN(ODBC_ADD_DSN, $Driver,
        "DSN=$DSN", "Description=$Desc", "DBQ=$Fullname",
        "DEFAULTDIR=$Dir", "UID=", "PWD=");
</pre>

  <p>This uses Win32::ODBC (described in TPJ #9) to remove and
  create <i>T-Bonds.mdb</i>. This lets Mary use the same script on
  her workstation and on her laptop even when the database is
  stored in different locations on each. The program also uses
  Win32::OLE to make Microsoft Access create an empty database.</p>

  <p>Every OLE server has some constants that your Perl program
  will need to use, made accessible by the Win32::OLE::Const
  module. For instance, to grab the Excel constants, say <tt>use
  Win32::OLE::Const 'Microsoft Excel'</tt>.</p>

  <p>In the above example, we imported the Data Access Object
  con-stants just so we could use <tt>dbLangGeneral</tt>.</p>

  <h4>MICROSOFT EXCEL</h4>

  <p>Now Mary uses Win32::OLE a second time, to have Microsoft
  Excel create the chart shown below.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/ole-t-bond.gif"><img src=
  "images/ole-t-bond_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 1: Screenshot 1" border="0" width="250" height=
  "160"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> T-Bond data
  generated by MicroSoft Excel via Win32::OLE</font></p>
  <pre>
# Start Excel and create new workbook with a single sheet
use Win32::OLE qw(in valof with);
use Win32::OLE::Const 'Microsoft Excel';
use Win32::OLE::NLS qw(:DEFAULT :LANG :SUBLANG);
&#13;my $lgid = MAKELANGID(LANG_ENGLISH, SUBLANG_DEFAULT);
$Win32::OLE::LCID = MAKELCID($lgid);
&#13;$Win32::OLE::Warn = 3;
</pre>

  <p>Here, Mary sets the locale to American English, which lets her
  do things like use American date formats (e.g.
  "<tt>12-30-98</tt>" rather than "<tt>30-12-98</tt>") in her
  program. It will continue to work even when she's visiting one of
  her international customers and has to run this program on their
  computers.</p>

  <p>The value of <tt>$Win32::OLE::Warn</tt> determines what
  happens when an OLE error occurs. If it's 0, the error is
  ignored. If it's 2, or if it's 1 and the script is running under
  <tt>-w</tt>, the Win32::OLE module invokes <tt>Carp::carp()</tt>.
  If <tt>$Win32::OLE::Warn</tt> is set to 3, <tt>Carp::croak()</tt>
  is invoked and the program dies immediately.</p>

  <p>Now the data can be put into an Excel spreadsheet to produce
  the chart. The following section of the program launches Excel
  and creates a new workbook with a single worksheet. It puts the
  column titles ('Time', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Close') in a
  bold font on the first row of the sheet. The first column
  displays the timestamp in <i>hh:mm</i> format; the next four
  display prices.</p>
  <pre>
my $Excel = Win32::OLE-&gt;new('Excel.Application', 'Quit');
$Excel-&gt;{SheetsInNewWorkbook} = 1;
my $Book = $Excel-&gt;Workbooks-&gt;Add;
my $Sheet = $Book-&gt;Worksheets(1);
$Sheet-&gt;{Name} = 'Candle';
&#13;# Insert column titles
my $Range = $Sheet-&gt;Range("A1:E1");
$Range-&gt;{Value} = [qw(Time Open High Low Close)];
$Range-&gt;Font-&gt;{Bold} = 1;
&#13;$Sheet-&gt;Columns("A:A")-&gt;{NumberFormat} = "h:mm";
# Open/High/Low/Close to be displayed in 32nds
$Sheet-&gt;Columns("B:E")-&gt;{NumberFormat} = "# ?/32";
&#13;# Add 15 minute data to spreadsheet
print "Add data\n";
$Range = $Sheet-&gt;Range(sprintf "A2:E%d", 2+$#Bars);
$Range-&gt;{Value} = \@Bars;
</pre>The last statement shows how to pass arrays to OLE objects.
The Win32::OLE module automatically translates each array reference
to a <tt>SAFEARRAY</tt>, the internal OLE array data type. This
translation first determines the maximum nesting level used by the
Perl array, and then creates a <tt>SAFEARRAY</tt> of the same
dimension. The <tt>@Bars</tt> array already contains the data in
the correct form for the spreadsheet:
  <pre>
([Time1, Open1, High1, Low1, Close1],
...
[TimeN, OpenN, HighN, LowN, CloseN])
</pre>

  <p>Now the table in the spreadsheet can be used to create a
  candle stick chart from our bars. Excel automatically chooses the
  time axis labels if they are selected before the chart is
  created:</p>
  <pre>
# Create candle stick chart as new object on worksheet
$Sheet-&gt;Range("A:E")-&gt;Select;
&#13;my $Chart = $Book-&gt;Charts-&gt;Add;
$Chart-&gt;{ChartType} = xlStockOHLC;
$Chart-&gt;Location(xlLocationAsObject, $Sheet-&gt;{Name});
# Excel bug: the old $Chart is now invalid!
$Chart = $Excel-&gt;ActiveChart;
</pre>

  <p>We can change the type of the chart from a separate sheet to a
  chart object on the spreadsheet page with the
  <tt>$Chart-&gt;Location</tt> method. (This invalidates the chart
  object handle, which might be considered a bug in Excel.)
  Fortunately, this new chart is still the 'active' chart, so an
  object handle to it can be reclaimed simply by asking Excel.</p>

  <p>At this point, our chart still needs a title, the legend is
  meaningless, and the axis has decimals instead of fractions. We
  can fix those with the following code:</p>
  <pre>
# Add title, remove legend
with($Chart, HasLegend =&gt; 0, HasTitle =&gt; 1);
$Chart-&gt;ChartTitle-&gt;Characters-&gt;{Text} = "US T-Bond";
&#13;# Set up daily statistics
$Open  = $Bars[0][1];
$High  = $Sheet-&gt;Evaluate("MAX(C:C)");
$Low   = $Sheet-&gt;Evaluate("MIN(D:D)");
$Close = $Bars[$#Bars][4];
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>with()</tt> function partially mimics the Visual Basic
  With statement, but allows only property assignments. It's a
  convenient shortcut for this:</p>
  <pre>
{ # open new scope
my $Axis = $Chart-&gt;Axes(xlValue);
$Axis-&gt;{HasMajorGridlines} = 1;
$Axis-&gt;{HasMinorGridlines} = 1;
# etc ...
}
</pre>

  <p>The <tt>$High</tt> and <tt>$Low</tt> for the day are needed to
  determine the minimum and maximum scaling levels. MIN and MAX are
  spreadsheet functions, and aren't automatically available as
  methods. However, Excel provides an <tt>Evaluate()</tt> method to
  calculate arbitrary spreadsheet functions, so we can use
  that.</p>

  <p>We want the chart to show major gridlines at every fourth tick
  and minor gridlines at every second tick. The minimum and maximum
  are chosen to be whatever multiples of 1/16 we need to do
  that.</p>
  <pre>
# Change tickmark spacing from decimal to fractional
with($Chart-&gt;Axes(xlValue),
    HasMajorGridlines =&gt; 1,
    HasMinorGridlines =&gt; 1,
    MajorUnit =&gt; 1/8,
    MinorUnit =&gt; 1/16,
    MinimumScale =&gt; int($Low*16)/16,
    MaximumScale =&gt; int($High*16+1)/16
);
&#13;# Fat candles with only 5% gaps
$Chart-&gt;ChartGroups(1)-&gt;{GapWidth} = 5;
&#13;sub RGB { $_[0] | ($_[1] &gt;&gt; 8) | ($_[2] &gt;&gt; 16) }
&#13;# White background with a solid border
&#13;$Chart-&gt;PlotArea-&gt;Border-&gt;{LineStyle} = xlContinuous;
$Chart-&gt;PlotArea-&gt;Border-&gt;{Color} = RGB(0,0,0);
$Chart-&gt;PlotArea-&gt;Interior-&gt;{Color} = RGB(255,255,255);
&#13;# Add 1 hour moving average of the Close series
my $MovAvg = $Chart-&gt;SeriesCollection(4)-&gt;Trendlines
      -&gt;Add({Type =&gt; xlMovingAvg, Period =&gt; 4});
$MovAvg-&gt;Border-&gt;{Color} = RGB(255,0,0);
</pre>

  <p>Now the finished workbook can be saved to disk as
  <tt>$i:\tmp\tpj\data.xls</tt>. That file most likely still exists
  from when the program ran yesterday, so we'll remove it.
  (Otherwise, Excel would pop up a dialog with a warning, because
  the <tt>SaveAs()</tt> method doesn't like to overwrite
  files.)</p>
  <pre>
# Save workbook to file my $Filename = 'i:\tmp\tpj\data.xls';
unlink $Filename if -f $Filename;
$Book-&gt;SaveAs($Filename);
$Book-&gt;Close;
</pre>

  <h4>ACTIVEX DATA OBJECTS</h4>

  <p>Mary stores the daily prices in her T-bonds database, keeping
  the data for the different contracts in separate tables. After
  creating an ADO (ActiveX Data Object) connection to the database,
  she tries to connect a record set to the table for the current
  contract. If this fails, she assumes that the table doesn't
  exists yet and tries to create it:</p>
  <pre>
use Win32::OLE::Const 'Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects';
&#13;my $Connection = Win32::OLE-&gt;new('ADODB.Connection');
my $Recordset = Win32::OLE-&gt;new('ADODB.Recordset');
$Connection-&gt;Open('T-Bonds');
&#13;# Open a record set for the table of this contract
{
local $Win32::OLE::Warn = 0;
$Recordset-&gt;Open($Contract, $Connection, adOpenKeyset,
                       adLockOptimistic, adCmdTable);
}
&#13;# Create table and index if it doesn't exist yet
if (Win32::OLE-&gt;LastError) {
    $Connection-&gt;Execute(&gt;&gt;"SQL");
      CREATE TABLE $Contract
      (
        Day DATETIME,
        Open DOUBLE, High DOUBLE, Low DOUBLE, Close DOUBLE
      )
SQL
    $Connection-&gt;Execute(&gt;&gt;"SQL");
      CREATE INDEX $Contract
      ON $Contract (Day) WITH PRIMARY
SQL
    $Recordset-&gt;Open($Contract, $Connection, adOpenKeyset,
                              adLockOptimistic, adCmdTable);
}
</pre>

  <p><tt>$Win32::OLE::Warn</tt> is temporarily set to zero, so that
  if <tt>$Recordset-&gt;Open</tt> fails, the failure will be
  recorded silently without terminating the program.
  <tt>Win32::OLE-&gt;LastError</tt> shows whether the Open failed
  or not. <tt>LastError</tt> returns the OLE error code in a
  numeric context and the OLE error message in a string context,
  just like Perl's <tt>$!</tt> variable.</p>

  <p>Now Mary can add today's data:</p>
  <pre>
# Add new record to table
use Win32::OLE::Variant;
$Win32::OLE::Variant::LCID = $Win32::OLE::LCID;
&#13;my $Fields = [qw(Day Open High Low Close)];
my $Values = [Variant(VT_DATE, $Day),
              $Open, $High, $Low, $Close];
</pre>

  <p>Mary uses the Win32::OLE::Variant module to store
  <tt>$Day</tt> as a date instead of a mere string. She wants to
  make sure that it's stored as an American-style date, so in the
  third line shown here she sets the locale ID of the
  Win32::OLE::Variant module to match the Win32::OLE module.
  (<tt>$Win32::OLE::LCID</tt> had been set earlier to English,
  since that's what the Chicago Board of Trade uses.)</p>
  <pre>
{
    local $Win32::OLE::Warn = 0;
    $Recordset-&gt;AddNew($Fields, $Values);
}
&#13;# Replace existing record
if (Win32::OLE-&gt;LastError) {
    $Recordset-&gt;CancelUpdate;
    $Recordset-&gt;Close;
    $Recordset-&gt;Open(&gt;&gt;"SQL",
                     $Connection, adOpenDynamic);
        SELECT * FROM $Contract
        WHERE Day = #$Day#
SQL
    $Recordset-&gt;Update($Fields, $Values);
&#13;}
&#13;$Recordset-&gt;Close;
$Connection-&gt;Close;
</pre>

  <p>The program expects to be able to add a new record to the
  table. It fails if a record for this date already exists, because
  the Day field is the primary index and therefore must be unique.
  If an error occurs, the update operation started by
  <tt>AddNew()</tt> must first be cancelled with
  <tt>$Recordset-&gt;CancelUpdate</tt>; otherwise the record set
  won't close.</p>

  <h4>LOTUS NOTES</h4>

  <p>Now Mary can use Lotus Notes to mail updates to all her
  customers interested in the T-bond data. (Lotus Notes doesn't
  provide its constants in the OLE type library, so Mary had to
  determine them by playing around with LotusScript.) The actual
  task is quite simple: A Notes session must be started, the mail
  database must be opened and the mail message must be created. The
  body of the message is created as a rich text field, which lets
  her mix formatted text with object attachments.</p>

  <p>In her program, Mary extracts the email addresses from her
  customer database and sends separate message to each. Here, we've
  simplified it somewhat.</p>
  <pre>
sub EMBED_ATTACHMENT {1454;}     # from LotusScript
&#13;my $Notes = Win32::OLE-&gt;new('Notes.NotesSession');
my $Database = $Notes-&gt;GetDatabase('', '');
$Database-&gt;OpenMail;
my $Document = $Database-&gt;CreateDocument;
&#13;$Document-&gt;{Form} = 'Memo';
$Document-&gt;{SendTo} = ['Jon Orwant &gt;orwant@tpj.com&gt;',
                          'Jan Dubois &gt;jan.dubois@ibm.net&gt;'];
$Document-&gt;{Subject} = "US T-Bonds Chart for $Day";
&#13;my $Body = $Document-&gt;CreateRichtextItem('Body');
$Body-&gt;AppendText(&gt;&gt;"EOT");
I\'ve attached the latest US T-Bond data and chart for $Day.
The daily statistics were:
&#13;\tOpen\t$Open
\tHigh\t$High
\tLow\t$Low
\tClose\t$Close
&#13;Kind regards,
&#13;Mary
&#13;EOT
&#13;$Body-&gt;EmbedObject(EMBED_ATTACHMENT, '', $Filename);
&#13;$Document-&gt;Send(0);
</pre>

    <h3>VARIANTS</h3>
  </div>

  <p>In this final section, I'll talk about Variants, which are the
  data types that you use to talk to OLE objects. We talked about
  this line earlier:</p>
  <pre>
my $Values = <b>[Variant(VT_DATE, $Day)</b>,
              $Open, $High, $Low, $Close];
</pre>

  <p>Here, the <tt>Variant()</tt> function creates a Variant
  object, of type <tt>VT_DATE</tt> and with the value
  <tt>$Day</tt>. Variants are similar in many ways to Perl scalars.
  Arguments to OLE methods are transparently converted from their
  internal Perl representation to Variants and back again by the
  Win32::OLE module.</p>

  <p>OLE automation uses a generic <tt>VARIANT</tt> data type to
  pass parameters. This data type contains type information in
  addition to the actual data value. Only the following data types
  are valid for OLE automation:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table width="400" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1">
      <tr bgcolor="#CCCC99">
        <td><i><b>Data Type</b></i></td>

        <td><i><b>Meaning</b></i></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_EMPTY</td>

        <td>Not specified</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_NULL</td>

        <td>Null</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_I2</td>

        <td>2 byte signed integer</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_I4</td>

        <td>4 byte signed integer</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_R4</td>

        <td>4 byte real</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_R8</td>

        <td>8 byte real</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_CY</td>

        <td>Currency</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_DATE</td>

        <td>Date</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_BSTR</td>

        <td>Unicode string</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_DISPATCH OLE</td>

        <td>automation interface</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_ERROR</td>

        <td>Error</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_BOOL</td>

        <td>Boolean</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_VARIANT</td>

        <td>(only valid with VT_BYREF)</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_UNKNOWN</td>

        <td>Generic COM interface</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_UI1</td>

        <td>Unsigned character</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>The following two flags can also be used:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table width="400" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1">
      <tr>
        <td>VT_ARRAY</td>

        <td>Array of values</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_BYREF</td>

        <td>Pass by reference (instead of by value)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p><b>The Perl to Variant transformation.</b> The following
  conversions are performed automatically whenever a Perl value
  must be translated into a Variant:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table width="400" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1">
      <tr bgcolor="#CCCC99">
        <td><i><b>Perl value</b></i></td>

        <td><i><b>Variant</b></i></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Integer values</td>

        <td>VT_I4</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Real values</td>

        <td>VT_R8</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Strings</td>

        <td>VT_BSTR</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>undef</td>

        <td>VT_ERROR<br>
        (DISP_E_PARAMNOTFOUND)</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Array reference</td>

        <td>VT_VARIANT | VT_ARRAY</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Win32::OLE object</td>

        <td>VT_DISPATCH</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Win32::OLE::Variant object</td>

        <td>Type of the Variant object</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>What if your Perl value is a list of lists? Those can be
  irregularly shaped in Perl; that is, the subsidiary lists needn't
  have the same number of elements. In this case, the structure
  will be converted to a "rectangular" <tt>SAFEARRAY</tt> of
  Variants, with unused slots set to <tt>VT_EMPTY</tt>. Consider
  this Perl 2-D array:</p>
  <pre>
[ ["Perl" ],            # one element
  [1, 3.1215, undef]    # three elements
}
</pre>

  <p>This will be translated to a 2 by 3 SAFEARRAY that looks like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
VT_BSTR("Perl") VT_EMPTY      VT_EMPTY
VT_I4(1) VT_R8(3.1415)        VT_ERROR(DISP_E_PARAMNOTFOUND)
</pre>

  <p><b>The Variant To Perl Transformation.</b> Automatic
  conversion from Variants to Perl values happens as follows:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table width="400" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1">
      <tr bgcolor="#CCCC99">
        <td><i><b>Variant</b></i></td>

        <td><i><b>Perl value</b></i></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_BOOL, VT_ERROR</td>

        <td>Integer</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_UT1, VT_U2, VT_U4</td>

        <td>Integer</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_R4, VT_R8</td>

        <td>Float value</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_BSTR</td>

        <td>String</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>VT_DISPATCH</td>

        <td>Win32::OLE object</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p><b>The Win32::OLE::Variant module.</b> This module provides
  access to the Variant data type, which gives you more control
  over how these arguments to OLE methods are encoded. (This is
  rarely necessary if you have a good grasp of the default
  conversion rules.) A Variant object can be created with the
  <tt>Win32::OLE::Variant-&gt;</tt> new method or the equivalent
  <tt>Variant()</tt> function:</p>
  <pre>
use Win32::OLE::Variant;
my $var1 = Win32::OLE::Variant-&gt;new(VT_DATE, 'Jan 1,1970');
my $var2 = Variant(VT_BSTR, 'This is an Unicode string');
</pre>

  <p>Several methods let you inspect and manipulate Variant
  objects: The <tt>Type()</tt> and <tt>Value()</tt> methods return
  the variant type and value; the <tt>As()</tt> method returns the
  value after converting it to a different variant type;
  <tt>ChangeType()</tt> coerces the Variant into a different type;
  and <tt>Unicode()</tt> returns the value of a Variant object as
  an object of the Unicode::String class.</p>

  <p>These conversions are more interesting if they can be applied
  directly to the return value of an OLE method call without first
  mutilating the value with default conversions. This is possible
  with the following trick:</p>
  <pre>
my $RetVal = Variant(VT_EMPTY, undef);
$Object-&gt;Dispatch($Method, $RetVal, @Arguments);
</pre>

  <p>Normally, you wouldn't call <tt>Dispatch()</tt> directly; it's
  executed implicitly by either <tt>AUTOLOAD()</tt> or
  <tt>Invoke()</tt>. If <tt>Dispatch()</tt> realizes that the
  return value is already a Win32::OLE::Variant object, the return
  value is not translated into a Perl representation but rather
  copied verbatim into the Variant object.</p>

  <p>Whenever a Win32::OLE::Variant object is used in a numeric or
  string context it is automatically converted into the
  corresponding format.</p>
  <pre>
printf "Number: %f and String: %s\n",
       $Var, $Var;
</pre>

  <p>This is equivalent to:</p>
  <pre>
printf "Number: %f and String: %s\n",
       $Var-&gt;As(VT_R8), $Var-&gt;As(VT_BSTR);
</pre>

  <p>For methods that modify their arguments, you need to use the
  <tt>VT_BYREF</tt> flag. This lets you create number and string
  Variants that can be modified by OLE methods. Here, Corel's
  <tt>GetSize()</tt> method takes two integers and stores the
  <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> dimensions in them:</p>
  <pre>
my $x = Variant( VT_I4 | VT_BYREF, 0);
my $y = Variant( VT_I4 | VT_BYREF, 0);
$Corel-&gt;GetSize($x, $y);
</pre>

  <p><tt>VT_BYREF</tt> support for other Variant types might appear
  in future releases of Win32::OLE.</p>
