Instead of asking how intelligent a program can be,let's explore the usefulness of impersonating a human. Enter theinfobot: an autonomous program that converses with users.Infobots are an ongoing experiment in how we can interact ascommunities with a common institutional memory. If thatsounds too grandiose, think of it as a study in interactive graffiti.<h3>IRC? WHAT'S THAT?</h3><p>The infobots first appeared on the EFNet (Eris-Free Net) InternetRelay Chat (IRC) in June of 1995. On IRC, people talk to oneanother (typically, to entire groups of people) in <i>channels</i>, eachdevoted to a particular topic. When a user creates a channel, heor she becomes a channel operator, which gives them powersover other users.<p>Some channels are popular; the <tt>#macintosh</tt> channel has about50 users every hour of the day. The <tt>#perl</tt> channel has 74 usersas I write this. EFNet is the largest noncommercial chat network,with about 40,000 users from around the world at anygiven moment.<p>At Carnegie Mellon University, we have operated<i>irc.cs.cmu.edu</i> as an EFNet leaf node since 1996. I've been ableto develop the infobots because I was the administrator of themachine; in general, EFNet doesn't appreciate bots, since theyare often used for abuse. For instance, bots have been used tospam users with advertisements for porn sites or to take controlof other people's channels.<h3>WHOLE LOTTA BOT</h3><p>One popular type of beneficial bot is the Eggdrop, developed byRobey Pointer. Eggdrops are designed for channel protection;they can be linked together to monitor people or programs thatspam users. Unfortunately, they have also been subverted forthe exact behavior they were meant to guard against. (Lest youget the wrong idea, most of IRC is simple chatting, not aboutteenage net.punks and techno-warfare, but there are vandals inevery community.)<p>More benign bots exist as well. Some bots run interactivegames, like chaosbot on <tt>#chaos</tt> or robbot on <tt>#riskybus</tt>. On<tt>#chaos</tt>, people join one of two teams and compete to guessitems in a top-10 list; on <tt>#riskybus</tt>, the users wager with fakemoney in a Jeopardy-like game. Even the IRC server administratorsuse bots to monitor connections and activity.<p>Infobots are different. They exist to collect information andanswer questions. I have been running infobots for over twoyears now, and they have continued to evolve with the help oftheir communities. The bots are missed when they're away - when mine crash and don't respawn, I'll get an immediate"Where's the bot?" when I sign on, even before anyone sayshello.<h3>SO WHAT?</h3><p>Why are infobots so popular? Well, they converse in natural language,they serve as a community memory, and they learn. Theinitial motivation for infobots came from <tt>#macintosh</tt>, wherethe same tired questions were asked again and again. We realizedthat if the answers were recorded, being helpful would beless of a chore, because we wouldn't have to repeat ourselves allthe time. Even if no one on the channel knew the answer, theinfobot could reply. This is an act of hubris and laziness, andthus well-suited to Perl.<p>There are other bots on EFNet: aack on <tt>#unixhelp</tt>, which hasa fixed set of about 150 facts, and <i>Computer</i> and <i>UN</i>, which providecanned answers to questions. They don't learn anythingover time, nor do they take advantage of Perl's wonderful textprocessing. Let's look at some examples of people using one ofmy bots: <i>url</i> (pronounced "Earl").<pre>&lt;calamari&gt; does anyone know where i can get            quicktime 3.0?     &lt;url&gt; somebody said quicktime 3.0 was at http://www.apple.com/quicktime/information/index.html</pre><p>The question here is a permutation of "<tt>Where is X?</tt>", or, moresimply, "X?", to which <i>url</i> responds with a sentence of the form"<tt>X is Y</tt>." The surface forms of the replies ("<tt>somebody said...</tt>")are chosen at random to make <i>url</i> seem less mechanical.<p>My bots don't learn in a deep Artificial Intelligence sense,but they go get more helpful over time. <i>url</i>, like a sponge,soaks up information that it hears on the channel.<h3>ARE YOU SPONGEWORTHY?</h3><p>Yes. Everyone is. Whereas other bots are strictly informationstores loaded by a priesthood of factoid keepers,mine are egalitarian. Here's a demonstration of <i>purl</i>, theinfobot that lives on the EFNet Perl channel, <tt>#perl</tt>, 24hours a day.<pre>&lt;juice&gt; i am not very happy&lt;juice&gt; me?&lt;purl&gt; you are, like, not very happy</pre><p><i>purl</i> has soaked up quite a few factoids, as has her olderbrother <i>url</i>.(It's interesting to note that people often refer to <i>purl</i> as 'she,' while <i>url</i> is almost invariably a 'he'.)She can learn from any declarative statementincluding a verb of being ('<tt>is</tt>', '<tt>are</tt>', '<tt>am</tt>', and so on). <i>url</i> ismore constrained, and requires that the part of the sentence afterthe verb contain a recognizable URL. The '<tt>http://</tt>' isn'trequired; both <i>url</i> and <i>purl</i> infer it when necessary.<p>On <tt>#perl</tt>:<pre>&lt;oznoid&gt; purl, status?  &lt;purl&gt; Since Thu May 21 17:50:02 1998, there have been          327 modifications and 263 questions. I have been          awake for 23 hours, 49 minutes, 8 seconds this          session, and currently reference 32513 factoids.</pre><p>On <tt>#macintosh</tt>:<pre>&lt;oznoid&gt; url, status?   &lt;url&gt; Since Thu May 21 17:50:03 1998, there have been 45         modifications and 509 questions. I have been awake         for 23 hours, 57 minutes, 54 seconds this session,         and currently reference 46159 factoids.</pre><p><i>url</i> is also on the EFNet channels <tt>#macdev</tt>, <tt>#linuxos</tt>, <tt>#avara</tt>,and <tt>#distributed</tt>. There is also a version of <i>url</i> running on theUndernet; their databases were originally synchronized, butthey are now learning and interacting independently. (The datesshown are when the current processes began, not when the botsbegan learning.) A relative of <i>url</i> and <i>purl</i>, called <i>rurl</i>, hangs outon <tt>#robogeeks</tt>. It's less an information repository than a personificationof bad attitude.<p>Sometimes people think they're interacting with an actualhuman being; the excerpt at the beginning of this article is real.I've seen people come into a channel, ask a series of questionsand get pointers to good information, and then thank the bot andsay "Thank God someone was listening!" It's even been hit on.<p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">	<tr>		<th bgcolor="#cccc99">USING IRC AND BOTS</th>	</tr><tr>		<td>To experience these bots in action, sign onto IRC and check them out.You'll need an IRC client, which you can download for free from thesites below.

Admittedly, it picks up manyirrelevant things and occasionally spits out a useless comment,but it doesn't happen often, and when it does it merely adds tothe charm.<p>People on <tt>#macintosh</tt> endured the early development cyclewith great aplomb, providing a lot of feedback. I get feedbackfrom several channels now, but it's still mainly <tt>#macintosh</tt> and,relatively recently, <tt>#perl</tt> that supply the most feedback. Here'san example of a discussion about how the bot should behave on<tt>#macintosh</tt>. (Just to clarify, I go by the nickname <tt>oznoid</tt>, or <tt>oz</tt>for short.)<pre>&lt;tonyola&gt; oz - a suggestion - url should only accept queries          beginning with "url,...."&lt;golgo13&gt; tonyola: No.          * Zebe gives bizzy a botsnack  &lt;bizzy&gt; i hate having to type "url"  &lt;bizzy&gt; :) &lt;durkin&gt; oznoid, do you plan to make his database of facts          available. i mean, i think his large knowledge is          one of the most coveted features..  &lt;barry&gt; give him a preferences window :)&lt;golgo13&gt; Half of url's usefulness is answering questions from          people who don't know to address him.  &lt;barry&gt; url, preferences..then you set what ya like :)&lt;tonyola&gt; but url keeps breaking in when he's not wanted          otherwise &lt;Fatale&gt; is that really that much of an inconvenience,          compared to his usefulness?  &lt;_elle&gt; url is allowed to interrupt anytime :) &lt;Fatale&gt; i often wonder why it's such a problem, when you          have free access to all that information  &lt;bizzy&gt; heh&lt;golgo13&gt; It is ridiculous for for someone to come in and say          "Where is stuffit expander?" and then for a regular          to go "url: Stuffit expander?" &lt;durkin&gt; url, nslookup fall.back.host.net    &lt;url&gt; fall.back.host.net is 205.166.250.10</pre><p>Here are a few design decisions I've made:<ul><li>IRC lets you identify privileged users, but my bots don't usethe information. There are no special people, and everyone hasequal power over the bots. This makes it public property, andpart of the community.<li>If the bots aren't directly addressed, and they don't know anythingabout the question, they keeps quiet. This is how users inlarge channels often act, except that humans sometimes make<i>ad hominem</i> attacks at new users out of boredom. My infobotsare a bit more polite.<li>If the bots are addressed, they always reply, even when theydoesn't know the answer.</ul><pre>&lt;picklehed&gt; purl, where can i find a blue petunia?     &lt;purl&gt; picklehed: bugger all, i dunno</pre><ul><li>The bots support interaction through private messages, as wellas on the public channel. This means people can get informationor teach the bot without annoying the channel. When you senda personal message to the bot, it always replies:</ul><pre>&gt;purl&lt; perl?[purl] well, perl is the Swiss Army Chainsaw of programming,       available at http://www.perl.com/.</pre><ul><li>The bots can tell other people about things. For instance,"tell oznoid about X" would cause it to send oznoid a privatemessage, something like "nick wants you to know: X is Y".</ul><pre>&lt;longhair_&gt; purl, tell johnpc about fish     &lt;purl&gt; okay, longhair_, i did.</pre><ul><li>The bots can volunteer information about things even if thereis no obvious question - as long as the key phrase is longenough. That is, there is a minimum length utterance that it willalways blurt out an answer to.</ul><pre>&lt;humblepie&gt; the perl journal     &lt;purl&gt; it has been said that the perl journal is at            http://www.tpj.com/</pre><ul><li>Anyone can ask the bots to leave the channel at any time, sothat they can be banished when they're not wanted. The requestmust be made in public; a private message is too sneaky. Whenthey leave, they say goodbye to the person in public just beforeleaving. They can be messaged to rejoin by anyone.</ul><pre>&lt;fimmtiu&gt; purl, leave #perl   &lt;purl&gt; goodbye, fimmtiu.          *** purl has left channel #perl</pre><ul><li>The bots are generally polite, replying to '<tt>hello</tt>', '<tt>thanks</tt>',and a few other things with random responses, to avoid seemingmechanical.</ul><pre>&lt;fimmtiu&gt; Hey, purl.   &lt;purl&gt; what's up, fimmtiu&lt;PerlJam&gt; hi purl   &lt;purl&gt; niihau, PerlJam</pre><p>'Niihau' is 'hi' in Mandarin. The bots won't understand allgreetings, however:<pre>   &lt;Murr&gt; yo purl-boy&lt;fimmtiu&gt; What's up, purl?   &lt;purl&gt; up is, like, what's not down or the direction          parallel and opposite the vector sum of all          gravitational forces at a given point &lt;JohnPC&gt; re, purl   &lt;purl&gt; re is short for "rehi", or "hello again". In Perl,          it's an acronym for "regular expression".</pre><ul><li>The bots answer <tt>help</tt> requests by private message only. Thiscan be extended to other functions (like <tt>internic</tt> and<tt>nslookup</tt>) at the option of the bot master.<li>Users can change a bot's definitions with a comment like this:"<tt>No, purl, ...</tt>"). Definitions can be supplemented with "<tt>X isalso ...</tt>" or removed with "<tt>Forget ...</tt>". The bot will confirm theaction when possible.</ul><pre> &lt;oznoid&gt; x?   &lt;purl&gt; x is, like, my friend &lt;oznoid&gt; no, purl, x is y   &lt;purl&gt; okay, oznoid. &lt;oznoid&gt; x is also z   &lt;purl&gt; okay, oznoid. &lt;oznoid&gt; x?   &lt;purl&gt; rumour has it x is y or z&lt;PerlJam&gt; dammit purl, listen to oznoid when he's talking          to you!&lt;PerlJam&gt; ;-) &lt;oznoid&gt; purl, forget x   &lt;purl&gt; oznoid: I forgot x</pre><h3>WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?</h3><p>When someone enters a channel and asks a question, the botwill answer if it understands the question and knows somethingapropos. It parses the question with rules like these:<pre>$finalQuestionMark = (s/\s*\?+$//); # get the "?"s/^\s*does any(one|body) know\s+//i; # remove polite pre-queryif (s/^(who|what|where)\s+//i) {      # we've got a question     $questionWord = $1;}if (s/^(is|are)\s+//i or s/\s+(is|are)$//i) {      # get the verb     $verb = $1;}</pre><p>The bot then checks to see if it recognizes the remainder of thesentence. It does this by reducing the sentence to a <i>canonicalform</i>: a standardized representation for the data that retains onlythe important information. In this case, that means no determiners('<tt>a</tt>', '<tt>an</tt>', or '<tt>the</tt>'), and a few other simplifications. Thiscovers queries such as:<pre>Where is foo?does anyone know where foo is?what are foofoo?</pre><p>The infobots actually have a long list of verbs to check; the codeshown above is for demonstration purposes only. This exampleonly shows portions of the text being eliminated; in reality, thesubstitutions are used later to canonicalize the sentence formore advanced processing.<p>It was easier to do things this way than to have url parse a fullgrammar specified in Backus-Naur Format (BNF). One reasonis that people define new words on the fly, so it's not possible tospecify the complete grammar in advance without using a <tt>/.*/</tt>placeholder to allow for new words. Furthermore, people don'tspeak in well-formed sentences very often, especially on IRC.There are even textual equivalents of filled pauses ('<tt>um</tt>', '<tt>ah</tt>')that are quite communicative, but difficult to parse because theycan appear anywhere and can be spelled in unusual ways.<p>Eating fragments of the input and storing them in variablesallow the infobots to build up the contents of a <i>semantic frame</i>(a data structure containing attribute-value pairs) by eliminatingthe known fragments and judging the significance of theremainder. The approach is quite similar to <i>Phoenix grammars</i>or <i>semantic phrase parsers</i> developed by Wayne Ward and others,which consume chunks of the input to build up a frame.Things like this have been used quite successfully for parsing inspeech recognition tasks such as the ATIS (Airline Travel InformationSystem) systems developed at CMU, MIT, and elsewhere;they continue to be a part of our work at CMU.<p>At a high level, the processing goes like this:<ol><li><b>Is the sentence obviously a question?</b><br><b>Yes</b>: <i>url</i> canonicalizes the question and replies if it hasanswer. Otherwise, <i>url</i> replies that it doesn't know, but onlyif it was directly addressed. Questions also can includemathematical expressions for evaluation or requests forinformation from third parties.<br><b>No</b>: If <i>url</i> recognizes the key (the left-hand-side X of astatement such as "<tt>X is Y</tt>", or the right hand side of a questionlike "<tt>Where is X?</tt>") in the database, it volunteers thefactoid from the database if the key is long enough (e.g.more than 6 characters) or if <i>url</i> was directly addressed.<li><b>Is the sentence an explicitly defined functional form?</b><br>My bots understand commands like <tt>nslookup</tt> (which convertscomputer names to IP addresses) or <tt>internic</tt> (whichperforms an Internic "whois" query)? If so, <i>url</i> executes theexternal command and displays the result.<li><b>Is the sentence parseable as a statement ("<tt>X is Y</tt>")?</b><br><b>Yes</b>: url checks to see whether X is already in the database.If so, it looks to see whether the user was aware of that - ifhe said, "No, url, X is Y" or "X is also Y". In that case,url replies, "ok, <name_of_user>". Otherwise, it says,"...but X is Y..." if it was addressed directly. This preventsthe bots from paying attention to O-dogg below:<pre>   &lt;orwant&gt; bless is a function that tells a reference            that it's now an object.   &lt;O-dogg&gt; bless is cool.</pre><b>No</b>: <i>url</i> admits confusion, but only if it was directlyaddressed.</ol><p>As you can see, <i>url</i> can act very differently depending onwhether it was addressed directly. That happens when a usercalls <i>url</i> by name, or sends a private message. It replies in kind:<pre>&lt;paraquat&gt; purl, do you have a life?    &lt;purl&gt; i haven't a clue, paraquat           A slightly more involved interaction:&lt;paraquat&gt; purl, PDL is at           http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/PDL/    &lt;purl&gt; ...but pdl is Perl Data Language...&lt;paraquat&gt; purl, PDL is also at           http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/PDL/    &lt;purl&gt; okay, paraquat.&lt;paraquat&gt; pdl?    &lt;purl&gt; pdl is probably Perl Data Language or at           http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/PDL/</pre><p>You can see that it's not always as fluid as one would like, but itgets better through use. When an infobot annoys the channel, Ihear about it pretty quickly.<h3>IDIOT SAVANT</h3><p>The infobots grow every day, and some of them have over40,000 factoids. They have to be able to access their informationquickly, and checking every item in the database against theinput would take too long. The infobots use <tt>tie()</tt> and <tt>DB_File</tt>,so that the database appears as a pair of large hashes but actuallyreside on disk, and can be looked up without requiring lots ofRAM. Of course, that means whatever you're looking for has tomatch the hash key exactly. That's why the input must be canonicalized,stripped of irrelevant utterances like '<tt>hmm...</tt>', '<tt>a</tt>','<tt>an</tt>', and '<tt>the</tt>', among others. This canonicalization is performedboth when the item is stored and when the bot tries toanswer a query. This doesn't always work quite the way you'dlike, and so you occasionally get Rainmanesque responses:"<tt>aaaah... i know something about X... aaah... Thatwould be Y, yeah</tt>".<p>Since the entire database resides on disk, and not in memory, therun-time memory requirements are reasonable - on the order of5.5 megabytes for <i>url</i>, the largest bot. Because no explicit databasesearch is required, the bot's responses are nearly instantaneous,which is important for the real-time communication onIRC. Currently, we use one database for singular entries andanother for plurals, so it's quite easy to maintain subject-verbagreement even when the query has no verb. I'm merging theminto a single, unified database in which each entry has anattribute for each case.<h3>A SENSE OF PLAY</h3><p><i>url</i> has an elder brother named <i>hocus</i>, who lacks the frontendfilters that restrict knowledge to URLs. hocus soaked up anythingthat looked declarative - anything at all. When the firstinfobots appeared without this restraint, people quickly becameannoyed by the frivolous responses. <i>purl</i> is actually quite <i>hocus</i>-like,but with more stop expressions. Those reject some queriesand prune others.<p>Once people realize the bot is a bot, they often have a little funwith it, stuffing it with questionable information. The bots aren'tshy about expressing their newfound ideas in public, sometimesto the annoyance of channel curmudgeons.<p>Eventually, those who find the bot annoying at first usuallybegin to appreciate its usefulness. Still, the play continues,sometimes sparked by a random bot comment and leading to thedefinition of a few humorous factoids.<pre>  &lt;hindeur&gt; purl, hinder?     &lt;purl&gt; hmmm... hinder is at http://www.ubertone.ml.org/&lt;q[merlyn]&gt; you need to say "is also" &lt;rootbeer&gt; When debugging regexes, the $&amp; and related            variables can be quite informative.&lt;q[merlyn]&gt; otherwise it won't overwrite a meaning  &lt;hindeur&gt; purl, hinder is also amagosa's friend     &lt;purl&gt; okay, hindeur.&lt;q[merlyn]&gt; there&lt;q[merlyn]&gt; like that&lt;q[merlyn]&gt; purl is also a miss take!  &lt;hindeur&gt; this bot is fun!     &lt;purl&gt; okay, q[merlyn].&lt;q[merlyn]&gt; purl?     &lt;purl&gt; yes, q[merlyn]?&lt;q[merlyn]&gt; purl, purl?     &lt;purl&gt; it has been said that i am the bot that's got            the info that's hot and a lot that's not and all            of that rot or a knut or buggy sometimes. or a            miss take!     &lt;Taer&gt; sorry. wife stole camel 2ed.            * nickm gets funky with purl&lt;q[merlyn]&gt; purl is also funky</pre><p>...time passes...<pre>    &lt;nickm&gt; purl is a commie pinko sympathizer.     &lt;purl&gt; ...but purl is the bot that's got the info that's            hot and a lot that's not and all of that rot or a            knut or buggy sometimes. or a miss take! or funky            or a bit shy or a sweater! or a really really cool            bot....</pre><h3>WHAT? WE ORDERED NO PIZZAS!</h3><p>Bots are a public resource, and as such as susceptible to vandalism.Some people try to break the bots. That's not a bad thing ifthey're just being playful and testing the limits, but sometimesit's an act of malice. For instance, since any user can change ordelete entries, we occasionally find useful nuggets of informationreplaced by phrases like "<tt>Microsoft sucks</tt>" or "<tt>Applesucks</tt>". At least the damage is visible, and rapidly fixed by thechannel.<p>At one point, I allowed people to get a random entry from thedatabase. Soon someone was steadily lobotomizing the bot, byretrieving random entries and having the bot forget them, one byone. Since I maintain logs of the bot's interactions, I was able toback out all the changes from that user, but the experience wasunpleasant.<p>The math handling abilities of the bot use <tt>eval()</tt>, which can beextremely dangerous. Early experience made me check theinput very carefully before evaluating it - this is why it won'thandle all expressions. Even the Safe module isn't adequateprotection; the documentation enumerates some of the sideeffects, such as infinite loops and memory hogging, that mightoccur from certain inputs. I simply reject anything outside of avery limited subset of functions. Even with this precaution,users found and manipulated a bug in the system libraries thatmade the bot crash.<p>The channels get quite defensive of the bots when they see peopletrying to vandalize them, or even when people are merelyrude. This is prevalent on <tt>#macintosh</tt>, where <i>url</i> has been a fixturefor a couple of years.<h3>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h3><p>The infobot code is undergoing substantial revisions; for onething, it is being modularized. Since there are now versions thatwork standalone on the desktop, with IRC, or with Zephyr(another messaging system), the infobot code is being decoupledfrom the communications protocol. Net::IRC, a moduledesigned specifically for manipulating the Internet Relay Chatprotocol, will be integrated into the infobot code. Some of ushave also been talking about connecting several bots together,expanding the types of statements and questions, implementingper-channel 'personalities', and connecting networks of infobots - each an expert on its own topic. We have settled on theBazaar model rather than the Cathedral model of softwaredevelopment, as described in Eric S. Raymond's "The Cathedraland the Bazaar." We want as many people getting the sourceas possible, making interesting modifications to it, and giving itback to the community. Just like Perl itself.<h3>WHERE TO GET IT</h3><p>The code is a mess right now. Fortunately we have a group ofpeople and a mailing list, and we're redesigning it from scratch.By the time this article is published, we are hoping you won'thave to use the collection of barnacles that comprise the currentinfobot. The source has been available for some time now, wartsand all - I had to get over my desire to wait until it was perfect.It's far from perfect now, but it has been improving quicklysince the public release. To get on the mailing list, send me mail.<h3>THANKS</h3><p>People who have been running infobots have been a greatresource, particularly Adam T. Lindley (<tt>abstract</tt> on IRC), whohas done extensive work with <i>script</i> and set up the web site at<i>www.infobot.org</i>. Patrick Cole (<tt>wildfire</tt> on IRC) helpedreplace the IRC client code and the user profiling system. DennisTaylor (<tt>fimmtiu</tt>), who is also involved with Net::IRC, wasalso a great source of ideas and inspiration.<p>All my work is due, in one way or another, to a love of Perlitself. Perl's philosophy appeals to me more than any other programmingmedium. Thanks to <i>p5p</i> and all of the people workingon Perl. We owe ya, bigtime.<h3>REFERENCES</h3><p>Raymond, Eric S. <i>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</i>.http://earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral–bazaar.html.Ward, Wayne.
