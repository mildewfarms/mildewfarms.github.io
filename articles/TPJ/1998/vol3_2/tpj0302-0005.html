  <p>Controlling a computer by typing commands into a shell is
  still the preferred way of working for most programmers. Despite
  the capabilities of modern window systems, working from a shell
  is much faster and less complicated than sequences of mouse
  movements and button clicks - once you know the names of the
  commands and how they work.</p>

  <p>The expressiveness of a command-line program depends on what
  options it supports, and how they're parsed - converted into a
  form that your program can understand. When you execute <tt>ls -l
  /tmp</tt> on Unix, or dir <tt>/w c:\windows</tt> on MS-DOS, or
  <tt>your_program -height=80</tt>, the <tt>-l, /w</tt>, and
  <tt>-height=80</tt> are options. Sometimes the shell handles the
  parsing; that's what happens with the <tt>/w</tt> in DOS. More
  often, the program named by the command (<tt>ls</tt> and
  <tt>your_program</tt>) must handle the parsing itself. In this
  article, I'll show you how your Perl programs can parse their own
  options.</p>

  <h3>OPTION PARSING CONVENTIONS</h3>

  <p>Under modern command shells, including those on Unix and
  Windows, options can be either letters or words. Programs that
  accept single letters might be invoked like program <tt>-a -b
  -c</tt>. Or, they might look be invoked as program <tt>-abc</tt>,
  meaning the same thing. If the options take values, you can
  bundle them together: <tt>-aw80L24x</tt> is equivalent to <tt>-a
  -w 80 -L 24 -x</tt>. With option words, you sacrifice brevity for
  clarity: program <tt>--all --width=80 --length 24
  --extend</tt>.</p>

  <p>In either case, options precede other program arguments (the
  <tt>/tmp in ls -l /tmp</tt>) and the parsing stops as soon as a
  non-option argument is encountered. A double dash by itself
  immediately terminates option parsing.</p>

  <p>These conventions aren't universal. Some programs accept
  option words with a single dash (e.g. <tt>-h</tt> for height);
  some let you mix option letters and option words; some let you
  mix options and regular program arguments. Options can be
  mandatory or optional, case-sensitive or case-insensitive, and
  can expect an argument afterward - or not.</p>

  <p>Parsing options in Perl isn't very hard, but after writing
  eight subroutines for eight programs, you might wonder whether
  there's a better way. There is. In fact, there are several
  ways.</p>

  <h3>THE SIMPLEST WAY</h3>

  <p>Perl directly supports the single-character style of options
  with the <tt>-s</tt> switch. If you start Perl as</p>
  <pre>
perl -s script.pl -foo -bar myfile.dat
</pre>

  <p>Perl will remove anything that looks like an option
  (<tt>-foo</tt> and <tt>-bar</tt>) from the command line and set
  the variables (<tt>$foo</tt> and <tt>$bar</tt>) to true. Note
  that the options are words preceded with a single dash. When Perl
  encounters an argument without the dash, it stops looking for
  options.</p>

  <h3>THE EASY WAY</h3>

  <p>Perl comes with two modules that handle command line options:
  Getopt::Std and Getopt::Long.</p>

  <p>Getopt::Std provides two subroutines, <tt>getopt()</tt> and
  <tt>getopts()</tt>. Each expects a single dash before option
  letters and stops processing options when the first non-option is
  detected.</p>

  <p><tt>getopt()</tt> takes one argument, a string containing all
  the option letters that expect values. For example, getopt ('lw')
  lets your program be invoked as program <tt>-l24 -w 80</tt> (or
  program <tt>-l 24 -w80</tt>), and it will set <tt>$opt_l to
  24</tt> and <tt>$opt_w</tt> to <tt>80</tt>. Other option letters
  are also accepted; for example, program <tt>-l24 -ab</tt> will
  also set both <tt>$opt_a</tt> and <tt>$opt_b</tt> to
  <tt>1</tt>.</p>

  <p>When you don't want global variables defined in this way, you
  can pass a hash reference to <tt>getopt()</tt>. The keys are the
  option letters, and the values will be filled with the values (or
  1 if the option doesn't take a value).</p>

  <p><tt>getopts()</tt> allows a little bit more control. Its
  argument is a string containing the option letters of all
  recognized options. Options that take values are followed by
  colons. For example, <tt>getopts ('abl:w:')</tt> makes your
  program accept <tt>-a</tt> and <tt>-b</tt> without a value, and
  <tt>-l</tt> and <tt>-w</tt> with a value. Any other arguments
  beginning with a dash result in an error. As with
  <tt>getopt()</tt>, a hash reference can be passed as an optional
  second argument.</p>

  <h3>THE ADVANCED WAY</h3>

  <p>Getopt::Long provides the <tt>GetOptions()</tt> function,
  which gives you ultimate control over command line options. It
  provides support for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>single-letter options, with bundling (<tt>-abc</tt>);</li>

    <li>option words, using a single dash, double dash, or plus
    sign (a standard briefly adopted by GNU)</li>

    <li>a mix of the above, in which case the long options
    <i>must</i> start with a double dash.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>option values can be designated mandatory or optional</li>

    <li>option values can be strings or numbers</li>

    <li>full control over where the option value will be
    delivered</li>

    <li>full checking of options and values</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This article describes version 2.17 of the Getopt::Long
  module.</p>

  <p><b>Option Words.</b> In its standard configuration,
  <tt>GetOptions()</tt> handles option words, ignoring case.
  Options may be abbrevi-ated, as long as the abbreviations are
  unambiguous. Options and other command line arguments can be
  mixed; options will be processed first, and the other arguments
  will remain in <tt>@ARGV</tt>.</p>

  <p>This call to <tt>GetOptions()</tt> allows a single option,
  <tt>-foo</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
GetOptions ('foo' =&gt; \$doit);
</pre>

  <p>When the user provides <tt>-foo</tt> on the command line,
  <tt>$doit</tt> is set to <tt>1</tt>. In this call, <tt>-foo</tt>
  is called the <i>option control string</i>, and <tt>\$doit</tt>
  is called the <i>option destination</i>. Multiple pairs of
  control strings and destinations can be provided.
  <tt>GetOptions()</tt> will return true if processing was
  successful, and false otherwise, displaying an error message with
  <tt>warn()</tt>.</p>

  <p>The option word may have <i>aliases</i>, alternative option
  words that refer to the same option:</p>
  <pre>
GetOptions ('foo|bar|quux' =&gt; \$doit);
</pre>

  <p>If you want to specify that an option takes a string, append
  <tt>=s</tt> to the option control string:</p>
  <pre>
GetOptions ('foo=s' =&gt; \$thevalue);
</pre>

  <p>When you use a colon instead of an equal sign, the option
  takes a value only when one is present:</p>
  <pre>
GetOptions ('foo:s' =&gt; \$thevalue, 'bar' =&gt; \$doit);
</pre>

  <p>Calling this program with arguments <tt>-foo bar blech</tt>
  places the string <tt>'bar'</tt> in <tt>$thevalue</tt>, but when
  called with <tt>-foo -bar blech</tt>, something different
  happens: <tt>$thevalue</tt> is set to an empty string, and
  <tt>$bar</tt> is set to 1.</p>

  <p>These options can also take numeric values; you can use
  <tt>=i</tt> or <tt>:i</tt> for integer values, and <tt>=f</tt> or
  <tt>:f</tt> for floating point values.</p>

  <p><b>Using and Bundling Single-Letter Options.</b> Using
  single-letter options is trivial; bundling them is a little
  trickier. Getopt::Long has a <tt>Configure()</tt> subroutine that
  you can use to fine-tune your option parsing. For bundling
  single-letter options, you would use <tt>Getopt::Long::Configure
  ('bundling')</tt>. Now <tt>GetOptions()</tt> will happily accept
  bundled single-letter options:</p>
  <pre>
Getopt::Long::Configure ('bundling');
GetOptions ('a' =&gt; \$all,
            'l=i' =&gt; \$length,
            'w=i' =&gt; \$width);
</pre>

  <p>This allows options of the form <tt>-a -l 24 -w 80</tt> as
  well as bundled forms: <tt>-al24w80</tt>. You can mix these with
  option words:</p>
  <pre>
GetOptions ('a|all' =&gt; \$all,
            'l|length=i' =&gt; \$length,
            'w|width=i' =&gt; \$width);
	       
</pre>

  <p>However, the option words require a double dash: <tt>--width
  24</tt> is acceptable, but <tt>-width 24</tt> is not. (That
  causes the leading <tt>w</tt> to be interpreted as <tt>-w</tt>,
  and results in an error because <tt>idth</tt> isn't a valid
  integer value.</p>

  <p><tt>Getopt::Long::Configure('bundling_override')</tt> allows
  option words with a single dash, where the words take precedence
  over bundled single-letter options. For example:</p>
  <pre>
Getopt::Long::Configure ('bundling_override');
GetOptions ('a' =&gt; \$a, 'v' =&gt; \$v,
            'x' =&gt; \$x, 'vax' =&gt; \$vax);
</pre>

  <p>This treats <tt>-axv</tt> as <tt>-a -x -v</tt>, but treats
  <tt>-vax</tt> as a single option word.</p>

  <p><b>Advanced destinations.</b> You don't need to specify the
  option destination. If you don't, <tt>GetOptions()</tt> defines
  variables <tt>$opt_</tt><i>xxx</i> (where <i>xxx</i> is the name
  of the option), just like <tt>getopt()</tt> and
  <tt>getopts()</tt>. Similarly, <tt>GetOptions()</tt> also accepts
  a reference to a hash (as its first argument) and places the
  option values in it.</p>

  <p>If you do specify the option destination, it needn't be a
  scalar. If you specify an array reference, option values are
  pushed into this array:</p>
  <pre>
GetOptions ('foo=i' =&gt; \@values);
</pre>

  <p>Calling this program with arguments <tt>-foo 1 -foo 2 -foo
  3</tt> sets <tt>@values</tt> to <tt>(1,2,3)</tt>.</p>

  <p>The option destination can also be a hash reference:</p>
  <pre>
my %values;
GetOptions ('define=s' =&gt; \%values);
</pre>

  <p>If you call this program as <tt>program -define EOF=-1 -define
  bool=int</tt>, the <tt>%values</tt> hash will have the keys
  <tt>EOF</tt> and <tt>bool</tt>, set to <tt>-1</tt> and
  <tt>'int'</tt> respectively.</p>

  <p>Finally, the destination can be a reference to a subroutine.
  This subroutine will be called when the option is handled. It
  expects two arguments: the name of the option and the value.</p>

  <p>The special option control string <tt>'&lt;&gt;'</tt> can be
  used in this case to have a subroutine process arguments that
  <i>aren't</i> options. This subroutine is then called with the
  name of the non-option argument. Consider:</p>
  <pre>
GetOptions ('x=i' =&gt; \$x, '&lt;&gt;' =&gt; \&amp;doit);
</pre>

  <p>When you execute this program with <tt>-x 1 foo -x 2 bar</tt>
  this invokes <tt>doit()</tt> with argument <tt>'foo'</tt> (and
  <tt>$x</tt> equal to <tt>1</tt>, and then calls <tt>doit()</tt>
  with argument <tt>'bar'</tt> (and <tt>$x</tt> equal to
  <tt>2</tt>).</p>

  <p><b>Other Configurations.</b> <tt>GetOptions()</tt> supports
  several other configuration characteristics. For a complete list,
  see the Getopt::Long documentation.</p>

  <p><tt>Getopt::Long::Configure ('no_ignore_case')</tt> matches
  option words without regard to case.</p>

  <p><tt>Getopt::Long::Configure ('no_auto_abbrev')</tt> prevents
  abbreviations for option words.</p>

  <p><tt>Getopt::Long::Configure ('require_order')</tt> stops
  detecting options after the first non-option command line
  argument.</p>

  <p><b>Help messages.</b> People often ask me why
  <tt>GetOptions()</tt> doesn't provide facilities for help
  messages. There are two reasons. The first reason is that while
  command line options adhere to conventions, help messages don't.
  Any style of message would necessarily please some people and
  annoy others, and would make calls to <tt>GetOptions()</tt> much
  lengthier and more confusing.</p>

  <p>The second reason is that Perl allows a program to contain its
  own documentation in POD (Plain Old Documentation) format, and
  there are already modules that extract this information to supply
  help messages. The following sub-routine uses Pod::Usage for this
  purpose (and demon-strates how Pod::Usage can be loaded on
  demand):</p>
  <pre>
sub options () {
    my $help = 0;       # handled locally
    my $ident = 0;      # handled locally
    my $man = 0;        # handled locally
	
    # Process options.
    if ( @ARGV &gt; 0 ) {
        GetOptions('verbose'=&gt; \$verbose,
                           'trace' =&gt; \$trace,
                           'help|?' =&gt; \$help,
                           'manual' =&gt; \$man,
                           'debug' =&gt; \$debug)
            or pod2usage(2);
    }
    if ( $man or $help ) {
        <b># Load Pod::Usage only if needed.</b>
        require "Pod/Usage.pm";
        import Pod::Usage;
        pod2usage(1) if $help;
        pod2usage(VERBOSE =&gt; 2) if $man;
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>Pod::Usage is available at <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/authors/Brad_Appleton" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/authors/Brad_Appleton</a>.
  The latest version of Getopt::Long (2.17 as of this writing) can
  be found in authors/Johan_Vromans. This kit also contains a
  script template that uses both Getopt::Long and Pod::Usage.</p>

  <h3>OTHER OPTION HANDLING MODULES</h3>

  <p>A few other option handling modules can be found on the CPAN.
  The following modules can be downloaded from <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-category/12_Option_Argument_Parameter_Processing"
  target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-category/12_Option_Argument_Parameter_Processing</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Getopt::Mixed</b> provides handling option words and option
  letters. It was developed a couple of years ago, when Getopt::Std
  only handled option letters and Getopt::Long only handled option
  words. It's obsolete now.</p>

  <p><b>Getopt::Regex</b> is an option handler that uses regular
  expressions to identify the options, and closures to deliver the
  option values.</p>

  <p><b>Getopt::EvaP</b> uses a table-driven option handler that
  provides help messages in addition to most Getopt::Long
  features.</p>

  <p><b>Getopt::Tabular</b> is another table-driven option handler
  loosely inspired by Tcl/Tk. Powerful, but very complex to set
  up.</p>
