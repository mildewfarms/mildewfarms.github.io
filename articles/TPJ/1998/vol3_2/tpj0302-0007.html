  Beta versions of <b>Perl 5.005</b>, coordinated by Malcolm
  Beattie, continue to be available from the CPAN. Send bug reports
  to perlbug@perl.com or use the perlbug utility bundled with Perl.
  The latest stable release of Perl is 5.004.

  <p>Registration is now open for the <b>1998 O'Reilly Perl
  Conference</b>, which will be held August 17 through 20 in San
  Jose, California. Visit <a href="http://conference.perl.com"
  target="resource window">http://conference.perl.com</a> for
  details.</p>

  <p><img src="images/news1.gif" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0"
  align="left" alt="perl news"></p>

  <p>At the conference, I'll be the emcee of an <b>Internet Quiz
  Show</b>. One-, two-, and three-person teams will compete against
  one another, demonstrating their knowledge of both Perl and the
  Internet. If you have a team, or would like to join a team, send
  mail to contest@ tpj.com. The number of teams will be limited, so
  reserve your spot soon. (Yes, there will be prizes.)</p>

  <p>The Call For Votes to decide whether to create a new Usenet
  newsgroup, <b>comp.lang.perl.moderated</b>, will probably have
  begun by the time you read this. For details, see the CFV
  announcement (which contains the proposed charter) in
  news.announce.newgroups.</p>

  <p>Seven more Perl Users Groups have formed: the <b>Atlanta,
  Chicago, London, Minneapolis, Montreal, Philadelphia</b>, and
  <b>San Francisco Perl Mongers</b>. Visit their web pages at
  <a href="http://www.pm.org" target=
  "resource window">http://www.pm.org</a>. <b>Seattle</b> also has
  a user group: <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/spug" target=
  "resource window">http://www.halcyon.com/spug</a>.</p>

  <p>Solutionsoft released <b>PerlBuilder</b>, an IDE (integrated
  development environment) for Perl on Windows 95 and NT. It
  includes a visual editor and debugger as well as a CGI
  simulator.</p>

  <p>MacJPerl, a version of Perl for the Macintosh that can process
  Japanese characters, is available at <a href=
  "http://world.std.com/~habilis/macjperl" target=
  "resource window">http://world.std.com/~habilis/macjperl</a>

  <p>Finally, there's an <b>Expect</b> module, created by Austin
  Schutz. This lets you automate "conversations" between your Perl
  program and anything else: users, network services, web sites.
  It's the successor to chat2.pl and Comm.pl described in Lincoln
  Stein's article in this issue. It requires <b>IO::Tty</b> and
  <b>IO::Stty</b>.</p>

  <p>Tye McQueen released <b>Win32API::Registry</b>, containing
  low-level functions and constants for the Win32 registry, and
  <b>Win32API::File</b>, which does the same for Win32 files and
  directories.</p>

  <p><b>PDL</b>, the Perl Data Language (fast number crunching in
  Perl), now has a home page: <a href="http://pdl.perl.org" target=
  "resource window">http://pdl.perl.org</a>.</p>

  <p>If you like word finds, try Andrew Johnson's <b>WordFind</b>
  module at <a href=
  "http://www.ualberta.ca/~ajohnson/perl/WordFind.tar.gz" target=
  "resource window">http://www.ualberta.ca/~ajohnson/perl/WordFind.tar.gz</a>.</p>

  <p>Mike Beller created <b>quoteview</b>, a Perl/Tk viewer for
  stock quotes. It runs on Perl 5.004_02 with Perl/Tk 402.002, so
  any-one with Gurusamy Sarathy's binary distribution of Perl for
  Win32 can run it. <a href=
  "http://www.monmouth.com/~beller/perlpub/index.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.monmouth.com/~beller/perlpub/
  index.html</a>. You'll also find <b>ptksh</b> there, an
  interactive Perl/Tk shell.</p>

  <p>Slaven Rezic wrote a version of <b>Tetris</b> for Perl/Tk; you
  can find it at <a href=
  "http://user.cs.tu-berlin.de/~eserte/src/tktetris/" target=
  "resource window">http://user.cs.tu-berlin.de/~eserte/src/tktetris/</a>.</p>

  <p>Byron Brummer released <b>CGI::Validate</b>, a strict CGI form
  parser that validates data types and field names; and
  <b>Tk::MenuHash</b>, which ties a Tk::Menubutton to a hash.</p>

  <p><b>WDB</b>, a Web-database front end by Jeff Rowe, that uses
  <b>DBI</b> (the Perl Database Interface) runs under both CGI and
  <b>mod_perl</b>.</p>

  <p>You can find a list of mod_perl modules at <a href=
  "http://perl.apache.org/src/apache-modlist.html" target=
  "resource window">http://
  perl.apache.org/src/apache-modlist.html</a>. Besides WDB, you'll
  find modules like Andreas K&ouml;nig's <b>Apache::GzipChain</b>,
  which compresses files on the fly, Ask Bj&oslash;rn Hansen's
  <b>Apache::JavaScript</b>, which generates JavaScript, Rob
  Hartill's <b>Apache::AgentDeny</b>, which helps prevent web site
  abuse, and Michael Parker's <b>Apache::RobotLimit</b>, which
  prevents web robots (spiders) from accessing your web site.</p>

  <p>John Heideman released a new version of <b>WWW::Search</b>, a
  module that provides an API to all the major search engines:
  AltaVista, DejaNews, Excite, HotBot, Infoseek, Lycos, Magellan,
  PLweb, SFgate, Verity, WebCrawler, and Yahoo. It requires the
  mainstay of web modules, <b>LWP</b>.</p>

  <p>Tuomas J. Lukka released <b>VRML::Browser</b>, a browser for
  the Virtual Reality Modeling Language. You'll need an OpenGL
  library; Mesa is a free implementation.</p>

  <p><b>Net::Socks</b>, by Clinton Wong, provides Perl with a SOCKS
  client. SOCKS is a protocol for a secure proxy data channel
  between two computers; it's often used in firewalls.</p>

  <p>Jochen Wiedmann released <b>Cisco::Conf</b>, which lets you
  perform Cisco router administration via TFTP;
  <b>SQL::Statement</b>, a small SQL (Structured Query Language;
  see TPJ #9) parser and engine; <b>DBD::CSV</b>, a DBI driver for
  comma-separated-values; and <b>Text::CSV_XS</b>, a module for
  manipulating comma-separated values.</p>

  <p>The <b>Geo::WeatherNOAA</b> module, by Mark Solomon, tells you
  the current weather for U.S. cities. The temperature is 52&deg; F
  and the relative humidity is 93% with 3 mph winds from the north
  as I write this.</p>

  <p>Ian Clatworthy's SDF, the <b>Simple Document Format</b>, is
  available from <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/IANC/" target=
  "resource window">CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/IANC</a>.</p>

  <p>A "readline" library makes it possible for command lines to
  behave like text editors, with keystrokes to move forward, move
  backward, and delete characters or words. Hiroo Hayashi's
  <b>Term::Read-line:: Gnu</b> extension makes the GNU readline
  library available to your Perl programs.</p>

  <p>A <b>PostScript</b> module, by Thomas Riemer, is available at:
  <a href=
  "ftp://apt4g.a3nyc.com/pub/distribute/libraries/postscript/genPS-0.01.tar.gz"
  target=
  "resource window">ftp://apt4g.a3nyc.com/pub/distribute/libraries/postscript/genPS-0.01.tar.gz</a>.</p>

  <p>The <b>RIPE-MD 160 message digest algorithm</b> has been
  encapsulated into a module by Christian Geuer. You can find it at
  ftp://franz.ww.tu-berlin.de/incoming/RIPEMD160-0.1.tar.gz.
  (Message digests are one-way functions: you feed in a document,
  and it generates a shorter string that is hard to falsify.)</p>

  <p>John A. R. Williams uploaded a number of mathematics modules:
  <b>Math::Derivative</b>, which computes first and second
  derivatives, <b>Math::Amoeba</b> and <b>Math::Brent</b>, which
  perform function minimization, <b>Math::Spline</b>, which
  generates cubic splines, and <b>Math::Trig</b>, which provides
  some trigonometric functions not built into Perl, like tan and
  cosh and acos. However, those are also available in the
  <b>POSIX</b> module bundled with Perl.</p>

  <p>Mats Kindahl developed <b>Math::Interpolate</b>, which
  performs polynomial interpolation of data.</p>

  <p>Magic squares are grids of numbers in which all rows, columns,
  and diagonals sum to the same number. Fabrizio Pivari's
  <b>Math::MagicSquare</b> checks whether squares are magic.</p>

  <p>John Macdonald released the <b>Heap</b> bundle, containing
  packages for Fibonacci, Binomial, and Binary heaps. Heaps are
  data structures; in particular, they're a type of binary tree
  (see <a href="../vol2_4/ewtoc.html" target="resource window">TPJ
  #8</a>).</p>

  <p>The <b>MIME-tools</b> bundle, by Eryq, contains ten modules
  and seven programs for doing just about everything you might ever
  want to do with MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
  documents.</p>

  <p>Jeremy Bishop released a number of modules as part of
  <b>Evo-Script</b>, a freeware web application engine written in
  Perl. <b>String::Escape</b> contains backslash, quoting, and
  escape functions; <b>String::Excerpt</b> truncates strings with
  ellipses; <b>String::PropertyList</b> turns data structures into
  text and back again; <b>String::Words</b> parses words and
  phrases and lists and hashes; and <b>String::Format</b> has
  formatting routines for numbers and dates. Not to be confused
  with William Ward's <b>Number::Format</b>, which also formats
  numbers.</p>

  <p>Brian D. Foy's <b>Business::ISBN</b> module manipulates and
  validates International Scholastic Book Numbers.</p>

  <p>Andy Wardley uploaded three new modules: <b>App::Config</b>,
  which helps you with configuration management;
  <b>Text::MetaText</b>, an implementation of a markup language
  that can be used to process text files with embedded directives,
  and <b>Class::Singleton</b>, a base class for objects that should
  only have one instance at a time, like print queues.</p>

  <p>The <b>Convert::Translit</b> module, by Genji Schmeder, lets
  you convert between any of the 8-bit character sets in RFC 1345,
  "Character Mnemonics and Character Sets."</p>

  <p>Just in case you didn't know, the English module bundled with
  Perl lets you use English names for Perl special variables. It
  lets you say <tt>$ARG</tt> instead of <tt>$_</tt>,
  <tt>$MATCH</tt> instead of <tt>$&amp;</tt>,
  <tt>$OUTPUT_AUTOFLUSH</tt> instead of <tt>$|</tt>, and so on.</p>

  <p>Mark-Jason Dominus' <b>Interpolation</b> module lets you
  control what happens when your variables are interpolated into
  strings.</p>

  <p>Rich Bowen's <b>HyperCal</b> is a calendar program for the
  World Wide Web. Rich also has a <b>conference scheduler</b> and a
  <b>postcard program</b> in his author directory.</p>

  <p>New modules should be cleared with the <b>modules@perl.org</b>
  mailing list before uploading to the CPAN. We don't review the
  code so much as ensure that new modules have appropriate names.
  Information about modules and other Perl news should be sent to
  <b>submissions@tpj.com</b>.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the efforts of Kurt Starsinic and others, there is
  now a scripts repository on the CPAN, with an associated e-mail
  address: <b>scripts@perl.org</b>. To upload your script or module
  for everyone to use (thus becoming an Official Perl Developer, if
  there is such a thing) you must first be assigned a PAUSE ID at
  <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/04pause.html" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/04pause.html</a>.</p>

  Network (CPAN).</a></p>
