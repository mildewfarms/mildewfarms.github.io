              <p><font color="#000000">If you have experience with
              other thread implementations, you might find that
              things aren't quite what you expect. It's very
              important to remember when dealing with Perl threads
              that Perl Threads Are Not X Threads, for all values
              of X. They aren't POSIX threads, or DecThreads, or
              Java's Green threads, or Win32 threads. There are
              similarities, and the broad concepts are the same,
              but if you start looking for implementation details
              you're going to be either disappointed or confused.
              Possibly both.</font></p>

              <p><font color="#000000">This is not to say that Perl
              threads are completely different from everything
              that's ever come before--they're not. Perl's
              threading model owes a lot to other thread models,
              espe-cially POSIX. Just as Perl is not C, though,
              Perl threads are not POSIX threads. So if you find
              yourself looking for mutexes, or thread priorities,
              it's time to step back a bit and think about what you
              want to do and how Perl can do it.
