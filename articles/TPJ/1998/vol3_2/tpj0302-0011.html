  You might have learned about Perl's <tt>-d</tt> switch, which
  launches Perl's internal symbolic debugger. If not, read the
  <i>perldebug</i> documentation and get started; it lets you set
  breakpoints and step through your programs line by line. The
  debugger is one of Perl's most attractive tools for developers,
  in part because it's not so much a debugger as a debugging system
  into which you can you place the debugger of your choosing. All
  of those debuggers can be found in the Devel:: category of the
  CPAN, and in this article, I'd like to describe all the modules
  you can find there.

  <p>Not all of these modules are debuggers, but the ones that are
  can be launched as perl <tt>-d: Module</tt>. DProf, SmallProf,
  and Coverage can be used in this way; the rest can't. Many of
  these are currently in early stages of development, so read the
  documentation carefully before using them.</p>

  <h3>RUN-TIME EXAMINATION OF DATA</h3>

  <p><b>Devel::Peek and Devel::Symdump</b> help you examine Perl
  data as your program runs. Devel::Peek, by Ilya Zakharevich,
  uncovers Perl's internal representation for your data, letting
  you verify that XS subroutines are doing the right thing. The
  Devel::Symdump module, by Andreas K&ouml;nig and Tom
  Christiansen, lets you examine your variables&mdash;and entire
  symbol tables. The Devel::Symdump package is used by the Apache/
  Perl project (mod_perl; see <a href="../vol3_1/tpj0301-0001.html"
  target="resource window">TPJ #9</a>) to provide run-time status
  of the Perl interpreter in a running Apache web server. Highly
  recommended.</p>

  <p><b>Devel::TraceFuncs and Devel::DumpStack</b> are handy for
  inspecting the subroutine stack or following the paths to
  subroutines. Devel::TraceFuncs, by Joe Hildebrand, allows
  selective enabling of the tracing of function entry, useful when
  you need to confirm that a subroutine is being called in the
  right sequence with respect to other routines. Jack Shirazi's
  Devel::DumpStack provides neatly-formatted stack traces. it lets
  you tune the depth of the trace and the formatting
  indentation.</p>

  <p>All four of these modules can be brought in on demand from the
  debugger; at any time, you can load them with use.</p>

  <h3>PROFILING AND COVERAGE TESTING</h3>

  <p><b>Devel::DProf and Devel::SmallProf.</b> Profiling tells you
  how much time was spent executing different portions of your
  program. Devel::DProf, by Dean Roehrich, measures time spent by
  the application itself, as well as time spent in individual
  subroutines. Ted Ashton's Devel::SmallProf module profiles
  individual lines, determining how often each was executed and how
  long each line took. Both tools write the profile information to
  an external file. DProf writes it in a binary format, providing a
  utility (<i>dprofpp</i>) to interpret the information. SmallProf
  geneates human-readable ASCII.</p>

  <p><b>Devel::Coverage.</b> One of the newer (and most unstable)
  packages is my alpha version of Devel::Coverage. Coverage
  analysis is similar to profiling, telling you how often lines and
  subroutines are reached, with an eye toward identifying sections
  that are never reached. This helps you develop test suites
  guaranteed to exercise every line of your code. The module writes
  results to an external file (readable with <i>coverperl</i>,
  provided with the module) and can monitor multiple runs of your
  program.</p>

  <h3>REFERENCE MANIPULATION</h3>

  <p><b>Devel::WeakRef.</b> The Devel::WeakRef module, by Jesse
  Glick, enables the creation of "weak references" to data,
  duplicating an existing reference without changing Perl's
  internal reference count. These weak references can still be used
  to access the data, but deleting them poses no threat to the
  data, and deleting the data itself will proceed regardless of how
  many weak references still exist.</p>

  <h3>HELPING C AND C++ PROGRAMMERS</h3>

  <p><b>Devel::CoreStack and Devel::DebugInit</b> aid C and C++
  development. Neither of these is a Perl debugger, and therefore
  should be invoked with <tt>use</tt> or Perl's <tt>-M</tt> switch.
  Jason Stewart's Devel::DebugInit module parses C and C++ header
  files and creates an initialization file for symbolic debuggers
  (currently only <i>gdb</i>) that identify the macro definitions.
  Devel::CoreStack, by Alligator Descartes and Tim Bunce, takes a
  core file from a recent program crash, locates the best available
  debugger and fashions a short command-file to produce a stack
  trace of what the program was thinking when it crashed.</p>

  <h3>ROLLING YOUR OWN</h3>

  <p>Writing your own development tools can be tricky. If the tool
  you are designing is similar to Devel::Symdump or
  Devel::TraceFuncs, then write it as you would any other module.
  If you want a module more like the profilers or Devel::Coverage,
  read on.</p>

  <p><b>The DB:: Namespace.</b> The debugger resides in a special
  namespace called DB. Tools that need to operate on programs
  line-by-line can install themselves into this namespace to get
  the same type of capabilities that the debugger has for
  line-by-line stepping, subroutine breakpoints, and so on. These
  features are enabled by the <tt>-d</tt> switch. By itself,
  <tt>-d</tt> loads Perl's default debugger from <i>perl5db.pl</i>.
  If you combine the switch with a module name (for example,
  <tt>-d:SmallProf</tt>), Perl looks for the module in the
  <i>Devel/</i> directory (e.g. <i>Devel/SmallProf.pm</i>). The
  module is expected to provide certain functions.</p>

  <p>The most basic function is <tt>DB::DB()</tt>, which can called
  for every executable line, just as it's about to be executed.
  Perl's <tt>caller()</tt> function is used to identify the package
  name, file name, and line number; debuggers can use this
  information to prompt for commands if the user is single-stepping
  through the program. (Devel::Coverage uses it to increment the
  hit count for the line.)</p>

  <p>Whenever a subroutine is entered, <tt>DB::sub()</tt> is
  called. <tt>$DB::sub</tt> will have been set to the name of the
  subroutine. The debugger system maintains a hash,
  <tt>%DB::sub</tt>, whose keys are the fully-qualified subroutine
  names, and whose values are of the form <tt>file: startline-
  endline</tt>. The argument list for <tt>DB::sub()</tt> is the
  same argument list passed to the subroutine. Don't modify it
  unless you know what you're doing.</p>

  <p><tt>DB::postponed()</tt> is called whenever a file (either
  program or module) has been compiled. (It can also be called
  after individual subroutines have been compiled, if the
  subroutine names exist in <tt>%DB::postponed</tt>.) When
  <tt>DB::postponed()</tt> is called, the only argument is a
  reference to a glob containing the debugger information for the
  file. The scalar instantiation of the glob is
  <tt>'_&lt;FILENAME'</tt>. Interpreted as a list, the glob
  contains all lines of the file, with a strange and useful
  property: if compared to 0 with <tt>==</tt>, the result is true
  if the line might conceivably have a breakpoint, and false
  otherwise. (You might want to include the statement local <tt>$^W
  = 0</tt> beforehand to suppress warnings.) The profilers and
  Devel::Coverage use this feature to identify lines that needn't
  be tracked. The hash instantiation of the glob contains
  breakpoint information for the file, keyed by line number.</p>

  <p>Whenever a line is reached that might conceivably have a
  breakpoint, <tt>DB::DB()</tt> is called if any of $DB::trace,
  $DB::signal, or <tt>$DB::single</tt> are true.
  <tt>$DB::trace</tt>, if set to true, simulates the user having
  typed the '<tt>t</tt>' command in the debugger.
  <tt>$DB::signal</tt> simulates a conditional breakpoint, and
  <tt>$DB::single</tt> simulates an '<tt>s</tt>' command for
  single-stepping lines. Given the interpreter's name for a file
  (those files located in <tt>@INC</tt> will be full pathnames,
  those that are relative to the process running directory will be
  relative paths), <tt>*{"_&lt;filename"}</tt> will give you access
  to the debugger data for filename.</p>

  <p>For more on this topic, read the <i>perldebug</i>
  documentation, <i>perl5db.pl</i>, and any of Devel::DProf,
  Devel::SmallProf, or Devel::Coverage.</p>

  <h3>WHICH ONES SHOULD YOU USE?</h3>

  <p>If you need to improve run-time performance, use one of the
  profilers. If you are building test suites, use my coverage tool.
  For general debugging, Devel::Peek is invaluable.</p>
