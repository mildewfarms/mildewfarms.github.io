  Today</h2>

  <h4><i>Mark-Jason Dominus</i></h4>

  <p>One of the most important new features in Perl 5 was the
  capability to manage complicated data structures like
  multidimensional arrays and nested hashes. To enable these, Perl
  5 introduced a feature called <i>references</i>, and using
  references is the key to managing complicated, structured data in
  Perl. Unfortunately, there's a lot of funny syntax to learn, and
  the manual is not as clear in this area as it usually is. The
  manual is quite complete, and a lot of people find that a
  problem, because it can be hard to tell what is important and
  what isn't.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, you only need to know 10% of what's in the manual
  to get 90% of the benefit. This article is going to show you that
  10%.</p>

  <h3>WHO NEEDS COMPLICATED DATA STRUCTURES?</h3>

  <p>One problem that came up all the time in Perl 4 was how to
  represent a hash whose values were lists. Perl 4 had hashes, of
  course, but the values had to be scalars; they couldn't be
  lists.</p>

  <p>Why would you want a hash of lists? Let's take a simple
  example: You have a file of city and state names, like this:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
Chicago, Illinois
New York, New York
Albany, New York
Springfield, Illinois
Trenton, New Jersey
Evanston, Illinois
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and you want to produce an output like this, with each state
  mentioned once, and then an alphabetical list of the cities in
  that state:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
Illinois: Chicago, Evanston, Springfield.
New Jersey: Trenton
New York: Albany, New York.
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The natural way to do this is with a hash whose keys are state
  names. Associated with each state name is a list of the cities in
  that state. Whenever you read a line of input, you split it into
  a state and a city, look up the list of cities already known to
  be in that state, and append the new city to the list. When
  you're done reading the input, you can iterate over the hash with
  <tt>keys</tt> or <tt>each</tt>, sorting each list of cities
  before you print it out.</p>

  <p>If hash values can't be lists, you lose. In Perl 4, hash
  values can't be lists; they can only be numbers or strings. You
  lose. You'd probably have to combine all the cities into a single
  string somehow, and then when time came to write the output,
  you'd have to break the string into a list, sort the list, and
  turn it back into a string. This is messy and error-prone. And
  it's frustrating, because Perl already has perfectly good lists
  that would solve the problem - if only you could use them.</p>

  <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>

  <p>Unfortunately, by the time Perl 5 rolled around, we were
  already stuck with this design: Hash values must be scalars. The
  solution is references.</p>

  <p>A reference is a scalar value that <i>refers to</i> an entire
  array or an entire hash (or just about anything else). You're
  already familiar with English names, which are a kind of
  reference. Think of the President: a messy, inconvenient bag of
  blood and bones. But to talk about him, or to represent him in a
  computer program, all you need is the easy, convenient scalar
  string "Bill Clinton".</p>

  <p>References in Perl are like names for arrays and hashes.
  They're Perl's private, internal names, so you can be sure
  they're unambiguous. Unlike common names like "Bill Clinton", a
  reference refers to only one thing, and you always know what it
  refers to. If you have a reference to an array, you can recover
  the entire array from it. If you have a reference to a hash, you
  can recover the entire hash. But the reference is still an easy,
  compact scalar value.</p>

  <p>You can't have a hash whose values are arrays; hash values can
  only be scalars. We're stuck with that. But a single reference
  can refer to an entire array, and references are scalars. So you
  can have a hash of references to arrays, and it'll act a lot like
  a hash of arrays, and it'll be just as useful as a hash of
  arrays.</p>

  <p>We'll come back to this city-state problem later, after we've
  seen some syntax for managing references. There are only two ways
  to make a reference, and only two ways to use it once you do.</p>

  <h3>MAKING REFERENCES</h3>

  <p><b>Make Rule 1</b>. If you put a \ in front of a variable, you
  get a reference to that variable.</p>
  <pre>
  $aref = \@array; # $aref now holds a reference to @array
  $href = \%hash;  # $href now holds a reference to %hash
</pre>

  <p>Once the reference is stored in a variable like <tt>$aref</tt>
  or <tt>$href</tt>, you can copy it or store it just the same as
  any other scalar value:</p>
  <pre>
  $xy = $aref;   # $xy now holds a reference to @array
  $p[3] = $href; # $p[3] now holds a reference to %hash
  $z = $p[3];    # $z now holds a reference to %hash
</pre>

  <p>These examples show how to make references to variables with
  names. Sometimes you want to make an array or a hash that doesn't
  have a name. This is analogous to the way you like to be able to
  print the string "\n" or the number 80 without having to store it
  in a variable first.</p>

  <p><b>Make Rule 2</b>. [ <i>ITEMS</i> ] makes a new, anonymous
  array, and returns a reference to that array. { <i>ITEMS</i> }
  makes a new, anonymous hash. and returns a reference to that
  hash. Remember: Square brackets are for arrays, curly brackets
  for hashes. The kind of bracket you use is the same as you'd use
  if you were subscripting the object.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
$aref = [ 1, "foo", undef, 13 ];
# $aref now holds a reference to an array
&#13;$href = { APR =&gt; 4, AUG =&gt; 8 };
# $href now holds a reference to a hash
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The references you get from rule 2 are the same kind of
  references that you get from rule 1:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
$aref = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
&#13;@array = (1, 2, 3);
$aref = \@array;
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The first line is an abbreviation for the following two lines,
  except that it doesn't create the superfluous array variable
  <tt>@array</tt>.</p>

  <h3>USING REFERENCES</h3>

  <p>What can you do with a reference once you have it? It's a
  scalar value, and we've seen that you can store it as a scalar
  and get it back again just like any scalar. There are just two
  more ways to use it:</p>

  <p><b>Use Rule 1</b>. If <tt>$aref</tt> contains a reference to
  an array, then you can put <tt>{$aref}</tt> anywhere you would
  normally put the name of an array. In the example above, you can
  say <tt>@{$aref}</tt> instead of <tt>@array</tt>.</p>

  <p>Let's see some examples of that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
@a @{$aref}                    # An array
reverse @a reverse @{$aref}    # Reverse the array
$a[3] ${$aref}[3]              # An element of the array
$a[3] = 17; ${$aref}[3] = 17   # Assigning an element
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On each line are two expressions that do the same thing. The
  left-hand versions operate on the array <tt>@a</tt>, and the
  right-hand versions operate on the array that is referred to by
  <tt>$aref</tt>, but once they find the array they're operating
  on, they do the same things to the arrays.</p>

  <p>Using a hash reference is exactly the same:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
%h %{$href}                      # A hash
keys %h keys %{$href}            # Get the hash keys
$h{red} ${$href}{red}            # A hash element
$h{red} = 17 ${$href}{red} = 17  # Assigning an element
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Most often, when you have an array or a hash, you want to set
  or get a single element. <tt>${$aref}[3]</tt> and
  <tt>${$href}{red}</tt> have too much punctuation, so Perl lets
  you abbreviate.</p>

  <p><b>Use Rule 2</b>. <tt>${$aref}[3]</tt> is too hard to read,
  so you can write <tt>$aref-&gt;[3]</tt> instead.
  <tt>${$href}{red}</tt> is also too hard to read, so you can write
  <tt>$href-&gt;{red}</tt> instead.</p>

  <p>If <tt>$aref</tt> holds a reference to an array, then
  <tt>$aref-&gt;[3]</tt> is the fourth element of that array. Don't
  confuse this with <tt>$aref[3]</tt>, which is the fourth element
  of a totally different array, one deceptively named
  <tt>@aref</tt>. <tt>$aref</tt> and <tt>@aref</tt> are unrelated
  in the same way that <tt>$item</tt> and <tt>@item</tt> are
  unrelated.</p>

  <p>Similarly, <tt>$href-&gt;{red}</tt> is part of the hash
  referred to by the scalar variable <tt>$href</tt>, perhaps even
  one with no name. <tt>$href{red}</tt> is part of the deceptively
  named <tt>%href</tt> hash. It's easy to forget to put in the
  <tt>-&gt;</tt>, and if you do forget, you'll get bizarre results
  when your program gets array and hash elements out of totally
  unexpected hashes and arrays that weren't the ones you wanted to
  use. <tt>-w</tt> and <tt>use strict</tt> find these errors for
  you.</p>

  <h3>AN EXAMPLE</h3>

  <p>Let's see a quick example of how all this is useful. First,
  remember that <tt>[1, 2, 3]</tt> makes an anonymous array
  containing <tt>(1, 2, 3)</tt>, and gives you a reference to that
  array.</p>

  <p>Now think about</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
@a = ( [1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9] );
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p><tt>@a</tt> is an array with three elements, and each one is a
  reference to another array.</p>

  <p><tt>$a[1]</tt> is one of these references. It refers to an
  array, the array containing <tt>(4, 5, 6)</tt>, and because it is
  a reference to an array, Use Rule 2 says that we can write
  <tt>$a[1]-&gt;[2]</tt> to retrieve the third element from that
  array. <tt>$a[1]-&gt;[2]</tt> is the 6. Similarly,
  <tt>$a[0]-&gt;[1]</tt> is the 2. What we have here is like a
  two-dimensional array; you can write
  <tt>$a[ROW]-&gt;[COLUMN]</tt> to get or set the element in any
  row and any column of the array.</p>

  <p>The notation still looks a little cumbersome, so there is one
  more abbreviation:</p>

  <p><b>The Arrow Rule</b>. Between two subscripts, the arrow is
  optional.</p>

  <p>Instead of <tt>$a[1]-&gt;[2]</tt>, we can write
  <tt>$a[1][2]</tt>. Instead of <tt>$a[0]-&gt;[1]</tt>, we can
  write <tt>$a[0][1]</tt>.</p>

  <p>Now it really looks like a two-dimensional array!</p>

  <p>You can see why the arrows are important. Without them, we
  would have had to write <tt>${$a[1]}[2]</tt> instead <tt>of
  $a[1][2]</tt>. For three-dimensional arrays, they let us write
  <tt>$x[2][3][5]</tt> instead of the unreadable
  <tt>${${$x[2]}[3]}[5]</tt>.</p>

  <h3>SOLUTION</h3>

  <p>Here's the answer to the problem I posed the the beginning of
  the article of reformatting a file of city and state names:</p>
  <pre>
  1 while (&lt;&gt;) {
  2 chomp;
  3 my ($city, $state) = split /, /;
  4 push @{$table{$state}}, $city;
  5 }
  6
  7 foreach $state (sort keys %table) {
  8 print "$state: ";
  9 my @cities = @{$table{$state}};
 10 print join ', ', sort @cities;
 11 print ".\n";
 12 }
</pre>

  <p>The program has two pieces: Lines 1&ndash;5 read the input and
  build a data structure, and lines 7&ndash;12 analyze the data and
  print out the report.</p>

  <p>In the first piece, line 4 is the important one. We're going
  to have a hash, <tt>%table</tt>, whose keys are state names, and
  whose values are (references to) arrays of city names. After
  acquiring a city and state name, the program looks up
  <tt>$table{$state}</tt>, which holds (a reference to) the list of
  cities seen in that state so far. Line 4 is analogous to</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
push @array, $city;
</pre>
  </blockquote>except that <tt>'@array'</tt> has been replaced by
  <tt>@{$table{$state}}</tt>. The <tt>push</tt> adds a city name to
  the end of the referred-to array.

  <p>In the second part, line 9 is the important one. Again,
  <tt>$table{$state}</tt> is (a reference to) the list of cities in
  the state, so we can recover the original list, and copy it into
  the array <tt>@cities</tt>, by using <tt>@{$table{$state}}</tt>.
  Line 9 is analogous to</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
@cities = @array;
</pre>
  </blockquote>except that the name <tt>'array'</tt> has been
  replaced by the reference <tt>{$table{$state}}</tt>. The
  <tt>'@'</tt> tells Perl to get the entire array.

  <p>The rest of the program is just familiar uses of
  <tt>chomp</tt>, <tt>split</tt>, <tt>sort</tt>, and
  <tt>print</tt>, and doesn't involve references at all.</p>

  <p>There's one fine point I skipped. Suppose the program has just
  read the first line in its input that mentions Ohio. It's on line
  4, <tt>$state</tt> is <tt>'Ohio'</tt>, and <tt>$city</tt> is
  <tt>'Cleveland'</tt>. Since this is the first city in Ohio,
  <tt>$table{$state}</tt> is undefined - in fact there isn't an
  <tt>'Ohio'</tt> key in <tt>%table</tt> at all. What does line 4
  do here?</p>
  <pre>
  4     push @{$table{$state}}, $city;
</pre>

  <p>This is Perl, so it does exactly the right thing. It sees that
  you want to push <tt>'Cleveland'</tt> onto an array that doesn't
  exist, so it helpfully makes a new, empty, anonymous array for
  you, installs it in the table, and then pushes
  <tt>'Cleveland'</tt> onto it.</p>

  <h3>THE REST</h3>

  <p>I promised to give you 90% of the benefit with 10% of the
  details, and that means I left out 90% of the details. Now that
  you have an overview of the important parts, it should be easier
  to read the <i>perlref</i> manual page, which discusses 100% of
  the details.</p>

  <p>Some highlights of the <i>perlref</i> documentation bundled
  with Perl: You can create references to anything, including
  scalars, functions, and other references.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In Use Rule 1, you can often omit the curly braces. For
    example, <tt>@$aref</tt> is the same as <tt>@{$aref}</tt>, and
    <tt>$$aref[1]</tt> is the same as <tt>${$aref}[1]</tt>. I
    usually leave the curly braces in.</li>

    <li>To see if a variable contains a reference, use the
    <tt>ref</tt> function. It returns true if its argument is a
    reference. Actually it's a little better than that: It returns
    <tt>'HASH'</tt> for hash references and <tt>'ARRAY'</tt> for
    array references.</li>

    <li>If you try to use a reference like a string, you get
    strings like <tt>ARRAY(0x80f5dec)</tt> or
    <tt>HASH(0x826afc0)</tt>. If you ever see a string that looks
    like this, you'll know you printed a reference by mistake.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A side effect of this representation is that you can use
  <tt>eq</tt> to see whether two references refer to the same
  thing. (You can also do that with ==, which is faster.)</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can use a string as a kind of reference. If you use the
    string <tt>'foo'</tt> as an array reference, it's taken to be a
    reference to <tt>@foo</tt>. This is called a "soft reference"
    or "symbolic reference".</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You might prefer to proceed to the <i>perllol</i>
  documentation instead of the <i>perlref</i> documentation;
  <i>perllol</i> discusses lists of lists and multidimensional
  arrays in detail. After that, you should move on to the
  <i>perldsc</i> documentation; it's a Data Structure Cookbook that
  shows recipes for using and printing out arrays of hashes, hashes
  of arrays, and other kinds of data.</p>

  <h3>IN SUMMARY</h3>

  <p>Everyone needs compound data structures, and in Perl the way
  you get them is with references. There are four important rules
  for managing references: Two for making references and two for
  using them. Once you know these rules you can do most of the
  important things you need to do with references.</p>
