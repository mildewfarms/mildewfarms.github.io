  <h4><i>Mark-Jason Dominus</i></h4>
  <!-- packages described, if necessary -->
  This issue, we'll look at one of the most flexible and versatile
  methods of rendering three-dimensional images with a computer:
  <i>ray tracing</i>. Suppose you have a model of a
  three-dimensional space, with some three-dimensional objects in
  it, and some light sources. Somewhere in that space is a
  observer, whom we'll call 'you', and we'd like to render your
  view of the space and the objects in it. Ray tracing is a way to
  do it. This is serious stuff, used to render all kinds of
  computer graphics, including special effects in the movies
  <i>Terminator II</i> and <i>Toy Story</i>.

  <p>In order for an object to be visible to you, a ray of light
  must leave one of the light sources, bounce off the object, and
  reach your eye without bumping into anything else along the way.
  The idea behind ray tracing is simple: You can't see any light
  that doesn't enter your eye, so the only light rays that matter
  are the ones that do. To understand what you see, all we need to
  do is follow the path of the light rays <i>backwards</i> from
  your eye, and see if they eventually intersect a light source,
  perhaps after bouncing off of some objects along the way. If so,
  we render the objects appropriately. We'll see what
  'appropriately' means later.</p>

  <p>The important point here is to notice all the zillions of
  light rays that we never had to consider. All sorts of light is
  bouncing around our space, and we ignored most of it, because we
  only followed the rays that came back to your eye.</p>

  <p>I've written a small ray-tracing application called
  <i>tracer</i>. You can download it from <a href=
  "http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/RayTracer/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/RayTracer/</a>.
  In the rest of this article, you'll see how it works.</p>

  <h3>TECHNIQUE</h3>

  <p>We're going to be rendering your view into a rectangular
  'canvas' of pixels. Let's say for concreteness that this canvas
  is 200 pixels tall by 320 wide. The first thing we do is to
  imagine a 'view plane' hanging in space in front of you. The
  picture above shows a rudimentary view plane, used by the artist
  Albrecht D&uuml;rer to help him study perspective and
  foreshortening effects.</p>

  <p>D&uuml;rer's view plane has only 36 divisions, because he
  could fill in all sorts of detail into each of his divisions;
  ours is going to have 64,000 divisions, one for each pixel.
  (We're crossing D&uuml;rer and Seurat here.)</p>

  <p>We'll compute the ray that starts at your eye and passes
  through the appropriate pixel on the screen, and perform some
  computations to see if it intersects any of the objects.</p>

  <p>One tactic we can use to make things a lot simpler, at the
  expense of a little reality, is to just forget about the light
  sources. Instead, we'll just suppose that the entire space is
  uniformly lit from some invisible source. Each object will have a
  color, and if a ray strikes an object, we'll assume that we could
  have traced the reflected ray back to the omnipresent light
  source if we wanted to, and render the appropriate pixel in that
  color without actually following the ray any further.</p>

  <p>How do we decide if the ray intersected an object or not? It
  depends on the object. For example, let's suppose that the object
  is a polyhedron. A polyhedron is made of faces, which are plane
  segments. To decide if the ray has intersected the polyhedron, we
  need to know if it has intersected any of the plane segments that
  contain its faces.</p>

  <p>To do this, we first have to understand rays. The easiest way
  to represent a ray in the computer is with <i>parametric
  equations</i>. Imagine an insect flying along the ray; at each
  moment it has a particular <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>
  position. Each of these depends on the time, so there are three
  functions that depend on the time <i>t: x(t), y(t)</i>, and z(t).
  These tell you the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> coordinates
  of the insect at any given moment. The path of the insect is
  completely determined by these three functions. t is the
  'parameter' that the parametric equations get their name
  from.</p>

  <p>For straight lines such as light rays, the three equations are
  particularly simple. Suppose the ray starts at point
  (<i>O<sub>x</sub> , O<sub>y</sub> , O<sub>z</sub></i> ) and also
  passes through the point (<i>S<sub>x</sub> , S<sub>y</sub> ,
  S<sub>z</sub></i> ). Then the three equations for the line
  are:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/equation.gif" border="0" alt=
  "figure 1"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> Parametric
  equations for a ray.</font></p>

  <p>Mathematicians get tired of writing everything three times, so
  they have a shorthand. They represent points by single boldface
  letters, so that each boldface letter stands for the three
  coordinates of some point.</p>

  <p>For example, we'll write <b><i>O</i></b> instead of
  (<i>O<sub>x</sub> , O<sub>y</sub> , O<sub>z</sub></i> ). For
  triples of functions like <i>(x(t), y(t), z(t))</i>, they use
  ordinary function notation with boldface, so they might write
  <b>P</b><i>(t)</i> as an abbreviation for <i>(x(t), y(t),
  z(t)</i>), and the <i>(t)</i> in <b>P</b><i>(t)</i> means the
  same as in <i>x(t)</i> : the whole thing still depends on
  <i>t</i>.</p>

  <p>Then they play a trick, and call the boldface letters
  'vectors' and say that you can add and subtract them. You don't
  need to worry about what that really means; it's just a
  notational shorthand, so that we can write simply</p>

  <p><b>P</b><i>(t)</i> = <b>O</b> + <i>t</i> &times; (<b>S &ndash;
  O</b>)</p>

  <p>instead of the three equations above. They mean exactly the
  same thing. The boldface tells you that it's standing for three
  equations instead of one; <b>S &ndash; O</b> is shorthand for the
  three expressions that look like (<i>S<sub>x</sub> &ndash;
  O<sub>x</sub></i> ), so <i>t</i> &times; (<b>S &ndash; O</b>) is
  shorthand for the three expressions that look like <i>t</i>
  &times; (<i>S<sub>y</sub> &ndash; O<sub>y</sub></i> ). The
  <i>t</i> isn't in boldface; that tells you that the t is the same
  in all three equations instead of having <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and
  <i>z</i> versions. The whole thing is shorthand for the three
  equations of Figure 1.</p>

  <p>Now let's return to the polyhedron. Each face of the
  polyhedron is defined in terms of two parameters like this:
  <b>F</b>(<i>u,v</i>). We won't see a detailed example of this
  because we won't need it. The ray intersects the sphere if there
  are some values for <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> and some number
  <i>d</i> that satisfy:</p>

  <p><b>P</b>(<i>d</i>) = <b>F</b>(<i>u,v</i>)</p>

  <p>Once we've found the point of intersection,
  <b>P</b>(<i>d</i>), we can figure out how far away from you it
  is; then if there are two points of intersection we just take the
  closer one, and render it; we can ignore the farther point
  because the closer one is in front of it, blocking your view.</p>

  <p>To handle the complete polyhedron, we do the same thing for
  each face. We compute whether or not the ray intersects each
  face, and if it does, we make a note of where; then we find the
  closest of all the intersection points and render it. We can
  ignore the intersection points that are further away; you can't
  see them because the faces with closer intersection points are in
  the way. I'm going to skip the mathematics again.</p>

  <h3>MAKE IT FASTER</h3>

  <p>To compute a low-resolution picture of 320x200 pixels, we need
  to send out 64,000 rays. If the space contains, say seven
  pyramids, nine cubes, and thirteen spheres, that makes 7 x 5 + 9
  x 6 + 13 = 102 objects altogether and that means we have to
  compute 64,000 x 102 = 6,528,000 intersections in all. You can
  see that ray tracing even simple images requires either a very
  fast computer or a lot of time. Sometimes both. (In computer
  graphics, "We took a lot of time with a very fast computer" is
  often the answer. In <i>Toy Story</i>, the character 'Andy' had
  12,384 hairs on his head, and Pixar had to render 114,240 frames
  of animation.)</p>

  <p>Perl is not the best language for ray tracers, either, because
  Perl is pretty slow. For a good ray tracing demonstration that
  draws a reasonable picture before the seasons change, we have to
  cut some corners. We'll use a two-dimensional space instead of a
  three-dimensional space.</p>

  <p>In two dimensions we have to forget about fancy things like
  spheres and pyramids, and restrict ourselves to straight line
  segments. These can represent walls, so we'll be rendering
  pictures of mazes, like this:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/birdseye.gif"><img src=
  "images/birdseye_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 2: Bird's eye view of a maze" border="0" width="200"
  height="140"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2:</b> Bird's eye
  view of a maze</font></p>

  <p>Why is this a win? Observers in two-dimensional spaces have
  one-dimensional retinas, and that means that the view plane,
  which was 320x200 pixels, becomes a view line 320 pixels long.
  Because there's no <b>Y</b> direction any more, instead of 64,000
  rays, we only need to send out 320. That speeds things up about
  200 times.</p>

  <p>The picture that we draw should theoretically be 320 pixels
  wide by 1 pixel high, but unless you actually live in a
  two-dimensional universe you probably haven't learned how to
  interpret such pictures. We'll cheat a little to fake an
  appearance of height without actually having to compute a lot. We
  know that walls look smaller when they're further away, and the
  relationship between how far away they are and how big they look
  is very simple. Each time we trace a ray and find the wall that
  it intersects, instead of drawing one pixel, we'll draw a
  vertical line, and if we draw taller lines for nearer walls and
  shorter lines for farther walls, then the various parts of an
  oblique wall will appear to recede into the distance as the wall
  gets farther away from you. Here is the output of tracer for the
  maze in Figure 2:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/tracer_sm.gif" align="center"
  alt="tracer output for the maze in Figure 2." border="0" width=
  "200" height="54"></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 3:</b> <i>tracer</i>
  output for the maze in Figure 2.</font></p>

  <p>This is an awful cheat, but does make things faster. Don't be
  quick to condemn it, because when the folks at id Software wanted
  to put real-time ray-traced graphics into their game DOOM, this
  cheat is exactly what they did. Nothing in DOOM is ever
  underneath anything else, because DOOM is a two-dimen-sional
  universe, and now you know why. Sometimes things seem lower than
  other things, but that's because they're faking height just the
  way we are. DOOM sold at least 250,000 copies, and you can't
  laugh at that kind of success. (DOOM also uses some other tricks
  that we'll see later.)</p>

  <h3>MATHEMATICS</h3>

  <p>Let's suppose that our program knows where the walls are. A
  wall is just a line segment, and a line segment is completely
  determined by its two endpoints, let's say <b>G</b> and <b>H</b>.
  Remember that boldface letters represent entire points: three
  numbers in a three-dimensional space, or just an x and y
  coordinate in our flat space. The equation for a line segment
  is</p>

  <p><b>P</b>(<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> ) = <b>G</b> +
  <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> &times; (<b>H &ndash; G</b>) (0 <img src=
  "images/lessthan_12.gif" width="9" height="12" border="0" alt="">
  t 1 <img src="images/lessthan_12.gif" width="9" height="12"
  border="0" alt=""> 1)</p>

  <p>This is actually the equation of a line, not a line segment.
  When we find the intersection of our line of sight with
  <b>P</b>(t<sub>1</sub> ), we won't immediately know whether the
  ray actually intersected the wall. But this equation also has
  some other properties that make it easy to decide whether a given
  point is actually on the segment of interest:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>P</b>(0) = G</li>

    <li><b>P</b>(1) = H</li>

    <li><b>P</b>(<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> ) is on the line segment,
    between <b>G</b> and <b>H</b>, when 0 <img src=
    "images/lessthan_12.gif" width="9" height="12" border="0" alt=
    ""> t 1 <img src="images/lessthan_12.gif" width="9" height="12"
    border="0" alt="">11</li>

    <li>If t 1 &lt; 0 or t 1 &gt; 1, then
    <b>P</b>(<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> ) is not in the segment, although
    it is on the line that contains the segment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The ray we want to follow starts at <b>O</b> (for Observer)
  and passes through the point <b>S</b> on the view plane that
  we're going to render. (View line, really.) Its equation:</p>

  <p><b>I</b>(t<sub>2</sub> ) = <b>O</b> + <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>
  &times; (<b>S - O</b>)(<i>t</i><sub>2</sub> <img src=
  "images/lessthan_12.gif" width="9" height="12" border="0" alt="">
  0)</p>

  <p>Again, this is the equation of a line, and that line passes
  through you. Since we'll be finding the intersection of this line
  with other lines, we'll need a way to decide if the intersection
  is in front of you or behind you. Happily, this equation has the
  properties that <b>I</b>(0) = <b>O</b> and <b>I</b>(1) =
  <b>S</b>. So if <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> is positive,
  <b>I</b>(<i>t</i><sub>2</sub> ) is in your line of sight, and if
  <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> is negative then
  <b>I</b>(<i>t</i><sub>2</sub> ) is behind you.</p>

  <p>Computing an intersection between
  <b>P</b>(<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> ) and <b>I</b>(<i>t</i><sub>2</sub>
  ) requires finding two parameters, <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and
  <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> , such that <b>P</b>(<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> )
  = <b>I</b>(<i>t</i><sub>2</sub> ). There are two unknowns here,
  <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> , and even though
  it looks like there's only one equation, the equation has
  boldface letters in it. That means it's shorthand for two
  equations, one involving <i>x</i> and one involving <i>y</i>, so
  finding the appropriate values for <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and
  <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> is a simple exercise in high school algebra
  which we'll omit because it's tedious, just like everything else
  in high school.</p>

  <p>If you think you might enjoy the tedium, examine the program's
  <tt>Intersection()</tt> subroutine. My advice is to solve the
  problem on paper first, and then look at the code, because that's
  what I did to write it. This is an important general strategy for
  writing programs that need to do calculations: Don't try to have
  the program actually do any mathematics, because mathematics is
  hard, and programming it is ten times as hard. Instead, do the
  mathematics yourself, until you get a totally canned solution
  that only requires that the numbers be plugged in, and then
  implement the canned solution.</p>

  <p>The interesting part of the equations is the special cases.
  The equations for <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>
  turn out to be quotient of two quantities, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>,
  and <i>B</i> turns out to be zero only when the wall is parallel
  to your line of sight. In this case the equations have no
  solution because they're going to see what part of the wall you
  see, and if your line of sight is parallel to the wall you can't
  see any of it. (In the code, <i>B</i> is stored in the variable
  <tt>$DEN</tt>.)</p>

  <p>If <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> turns out to be negative, the wall is
  actually behind you. and you can't see it, like this:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/neg_t2.gif"><img src=
  "images/neg_t2_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 4: t2 is negative, so the wall must be behind you."
  border="0" width="150" height="96"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 4:</b>
  <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> is negative, so the wall must be behind
  you.</font></p>

  <p>If t 1 &lt; 0, or if t 1 &gt; 1, then your line of sight
  misses the wall entirely, and you'll see past it to something
  else, like this:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/neg_t3.gif"><img src=
  "images/neg_t3_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 5: A missed ray." border="0" width="150" height=
  "79"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 5:</b> A missed
  ray.</font></p>

  <p>In these cases we shouldn't render part of the wall. But if
  <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> &gt; 0 and <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> &sup3; 0 and
  <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> <img src="images/lessthan_12.gif" width="9"
  height="12" border="0" alt=""> 1, then we have a real
  intersection, and your line of sight will intersect the wall if
  it hasn't intersected something else closer.
  <tt>TrueIntersection()</tt> checks for these special cases.</p>

  <h3>THE PROGRAM</h3>

  <p>The main part of the program is structured like this:</p>
  <pre>
for $p (0 .. 319) {
    <b><i>Compute the appropriate point S on the view plane
    Compute the line of sight ray through S</i></b>
    foreach <b><i>wall (all the walls)</i></b> {
         if (<b><i>the lines of sight intersects the wall</i></b>) {
             <b><i>find the intersection point X</i></b>
             if (<b><i>X is nearer to you than N</i></b>) {
                 N = X; W = <b><i>wall</i></b>;
             }
        }
    }
    # W is now the nearest wall in the line of sight,
    # and N is the point that you see
   <b> <i>Figure out what color W is
    Figure out how far away N is
    Render this part of W appropriately</i></b>
}
</pre>

  <p>There's some code up front that reads a configuration file
  that says where the walls are, and some code at the end to print
  out the rendered image in a suitable format, but the important
  part is right there.</p>

  <p>The only interesting part of this that we haven't seen yet is
  'render appropriately'. What that means is this: Objects get
  smaller in proportion to how far away they are, so compute <i>h =
  1/d</i>, where <i>d</i> is the distance that the wall is at.
  Multiply <i>h</i> by an appropriate constant scaling factor, and
  the result is the apparent height of the wall, in pixels. In this
  program, the scaling factor we use arranges that a wall at
  distance 1 exactly fills the canvas; a wall at distance 2 fills
  half the canvas, and so on. Then 'render appropriately' means to
  color the pixels from <img src="images/h_over_2_12.gif" width=
  "11" height="38" border="0" align="middle" alt=""> to 200 &ndash;
  <img src="images/h_over_2_12.gif" width="11" height="38" border=
  "0" align="middle" alt=""> in whatever color the wall is.</p>

  <h3>THE INPUT</h3>

  <p>Input is simple. The file you provide contains descriptions of
  walls, one on each line. Each line should have the <i>x</i> and
  <i>y</i> coordinates for each of the wall's two endpoints, and a
  fifth number that says what color the wall is; these colors go
  from 0 to 360, with 0=red, 120=green, and 240=blue. Blank lines
  are ignored, and comments begin with a #, just like in Perl. You
  can find some samples files on my site.</p>

  <p>The program understands a number of command-line options:
  <tt>-X</tt> and <tt>-Y</tt> set the size of the output picture,
  in pixels, and default to 320 and 200, respectively. Normally,
  the observer is at position (0,0), facing north; to change this,
  use <tt>-P</tt> <i>X,Y,F</i> where <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are the
  <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates you want, and <i>F</i> is the
  facing you want, with north=0 and east=90. For example, to
  position the observer at <i>x</i>=3, <i>y</i>=5, facing
  northwest, use <tt>-P 3,5,315</tt>.</p>

  <p>Figure 6 illustrates the meaning of some other command-line
  parameters. You are at <b><i>P</i></b>, looking in the direction
  of the arrow. The view plane is the perpendicular segment from
  <i>S</i><sub>l</sub> to <i>S</i><sub>r</sub>. The <tt>-d</tt>
  command-line argument controls the distance between
  <i><b>P</b></i> (you) and the view plane; the default is 1.
  Object heights are computed relative to this distance, so if you
  make it too close, everything else will look really far away in
  relation. The <tt>-a</tt> option sets your range of vision. In
  the picture, that's the angle<img src="images/angle_12.gif"
  width="17" height="14" border="0" alt=""><i>S</i><sub>l</sub>
  <i>PS</i><sub>r</sub> . The default is 90 degrees, so that you
  will be able to see 1/4 of the space. You can set this parameter
  to any value larger than zero and less than 180&deg;. Making it
  smaller will give you tunnel vision, and making it larger will
  turn you into a frog that can see on both sides of its head at
  once. Zero would mean that the view plane would have zero length,
  and 180&deg; would give the view plane infinite length. Both are
  hard to divide into pixels, so tracer won't let you choose such
  extreme values.</p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 6:</b> d, the
  distance between you and the view plane.</font></p>

  <h3>THE OUTPUT</h3>

  <p>I had a conundrum in designing the output routine. The ray
  tracer has to emit graphics in some format. GIF was an obvious
  choice, but GIF files are complicated, and I would have needed to
  use the GD library to write them. I didn't want to make everyone
  get GD just to run my ray tracer, so I made what might turn out
  to be a bad decision. I had <i>tracer</i> write its output as
  PPM.</p>

  <p>PPM is an extremely simple 24-bit color graphics format; it
  was designed to be used as an interchange format, which means
  that if you need to convert from weird format <i>X</i> to weird
  format <i>Y</i>, you probably don't have an appropriate converter
  program - but you might very well have a program for converting
  <i>X</i> to PPM and another from PPM to <i>Y</i>. PPM is simple
  and fairly common; many popular image display programs can
  display it. For example, if you have the X Window System program
  <i>xv</i>, just say <tt>tracer | xv -</tt> . If your program
  can't display PPM files, get <i>netpbm</i> from <a href=
  "ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/" target=
  "resource window">ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/</a>. It
  includes programs to convert PPMs into nearly every graphics
  format imaginable.</p>

  <h3>INTERNALS</h3>

  <p>There are two important sets of data in this program. One of
  these is the rendering canvas that the program draws on; the
  other is the collection of lines and vectors used to compute what
  you see.</p>

  <p><b>The rendering canvas</b> is a 320x200 array of pixels,
  where each pixel has three numbers from 0 to 255 representing the
  red, green, and blue intensities at that point. This is stored as
  an array of 200 strings, each with 320 x 3 = 960 characters. To
  set the color of the pixel in row <tt>$y</tt> and column
  <tt>$x</tt>, you just use a simple assignment:</p>
  <pre>
substr($canvas[$y], $x*3, 3) = "j4K";
</pre>

  <p>To make it black, you assign the string "<tt>\x0\x0\x0"</tt>;
  to make it bright green, assign "<tt>\x0\xff\x0</tt>".
  (<tt>ff</tt> is the hexadecimal code for 255, the maximum
  possible value.) Assigning to <tt>substr()</tt> can be slow,
  because if the assigned-to string changes length, Perl has to
  copy the end part of it to a new position. But we don't care,
  because our strings always have exactly three characters.</p>

  <p>It so happens that these 320 strings are already in
  <b><i>PPM</i></b> format (I told you it was simple), so the
  output function is about two lines long. Another win for
  <i>PPM</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Points and vectors</b> in the program are represented as
  references to lists with two elements: <tt>[$x, $y]</tt> is the
  point (<i>x, y</i>). There are a bunch of utility functions for
  adding vectors, scaling them, and so on; most of these are pretty
  simple. Here's an example: the <tt>Partway()</tt> subroutine. It
  take three arguments: two points and a number <i>t</i>, and
  computes a third point partway between the two points, <i>t</i>
  of the way from the first to the second. If <i>t</i> = 0, you get
  the first point back; if <i>t</i> = 1/2 it finds the point
  halfway between the two points; if <i>t</i> = 2/3 you get the
  point 2/3 of the way from the first point to the second.</p>
  <pre>
sub Partway {
    my ($p1, $p2, $t) = @_;
    [($p1-&gt;[0] * (1-$t)) + ($p2-&gt;[0] * $t),
    ($p1-&gt;[1] * (1-$t)) + ($p2-&gt;[1] * $t)
];
}
</pre>

  <p><b>Lines, rays, and line segments</b> are also references to
  arrays. Each array has three elements; the third is a string
  identifying the type: either <tt>SEGMENT</tt>, <tt>RAY</tt>, or
  <tt>LINE</tt>. The first two items in each array are two points.
  For segments, they are the two end-points; for rays they're the
  endpoint and any other point; for lines they're just any two
  points on the line. All lines in this program are assumed to be
  parameterized in terms of these two points. That is, if the
  program needs a parametric equation for the line <tt>[$p1, $p2,
  WHATEVER]</tt>, it just uses <b>P</b>(<i>t</i>) =
  <b><i>p</i></b><sub>1</sub> + <i>t</i> &times;
  (<i><b>p</b></i><sub>2</sub> &ndash; <i><b>p</b></i><sub>1</sub>
  ) which, as we've seen, has convenient properties.</p>

  <h3>OTHER DIRECTIONS</h3>

  <p>Ray tracing is such a useful and flexible idea that there are
  a lot of directions you can go. Here are just a few.</p>

  <p><b>Sorting the Objects.</b> If there are a lot of objects in
  the space, you can get a big performance win by sorting the
  objects into a list with the nearest objects first. Then when
  you're looking for intersections, you can try them in order from
  nearest to farthest. Near objects are likely to occlude farther
  objects, so doing this can save you from having to check a lot of
  far-away objects for intersections if you can decide that they'd
  be invisible anyway. Good-quality ray tracing software always
  does this.</p>

  <p><b>Mirrors.</b> One fun and easy feature that this program
  omits is mirrors. Mirrors are awfully easy to handle in ray
  tracing software: when the line of sight intersects a mirror, you
  just change direction as appropriate and keep following it to its
  final destination. Ray tracing was invented in the early 1980's
  and caused an immediate outpouring of computer-generated pictures
  of stacks of ball bearings, Christmas tree ornaments, chrome
  tea-pots, and other shiny items. An excellent beginning project
  would be to add reflective walls to this ray tracer.</p>

  <p><b>Light Sources.</b> We made the simplifying assumption that
  there were no specific sources of light, and that the whole space
  was uniformly lit from all directions. That was convenient, but
  not realistic. OMAR (Our Most Assiduous Reader) might like to try
  to add real light sources to this ray tracer. One complication:
  When the line of sight hits a wall, it scatters, and you have to
  follow every scattered ray to see how many of them make it back
  to the light source. You can tackle this head-on, if you have a
  big enough computer, or you can devise some clever ways to
  cheat.</p>

  <p>If you're going tackle the problem head-on, you end up
  following a lot of useless rays, and at some point you're doing
  so much work that it makes more sense to just start at the light
  source and follow the rays forward instead. Rays start out with a
  certain intensity when they leave the source, and every time they
  reflect, you compute how far they've travelled and how much was
  absorbed in being reflected, and follow the new, dimmer rays,
  until you find the ones that reach the observer's eye. This is
  called <i>radiosity modeling</i>. It wasn't popular as long ago
  as backwards ray tracing, because it requires so much more
  computer power. As computers have gotten better, radiosity
  methods have become more common.</p>

  <p><b>Stereoscopic Images.</b> One nifty trick you can play for
  cheap is to render the same space from two slightly different
  positions, and then put them in a stereoscope. A stereoscope is a
  gadget that presents one picture to each eye at the same time; if
  the two pictures depict the same scene from slightly different
  positions, your brain will be fooled into seeing the scene in
  three dimensions. Details vary depending on what kind of
  stereoscopic equipment you have. If you have red-and-green 3-D
  glasses, then run the ray tracer in grayscale mode with the
  <tt>-G</tt> option, use image modification software to make the
  left one pink and the right one green, and superimpose them.</p>

  <p>If you don't have a stereoscope or 3-D glasses, you can make a
  cheap stereoscope with a small pocket mirror. Reverse one of the
  images left-to-right, print them out, and arrange the two
  pictures side by side on a table. Hold the mirror perpendicular
  to the table, between the pictures, silvered side facing left.
  You should see the right image with your right eye, and the
  reflection of the left image with your left eye. Adjust the
  mirror, the pictures, and your head until the left and right-eye
  images are superimposed.</p>

  <p><b>Texture Mapping.</b> The walls drawn by <i>tracer</i> are
  single-colored. But it's quite easy to render walls covered with
  arbitrarily complicated wallpaper. The intersection computation
  knows how far along the wall the intersection with the line of
  sight is, and from that we can compute what point of the
  wallpaper you're looking at, and so what color to draw. This is
  quick and easy, and it's the second big trick that DOOM uses to
  get good-looking pictures. This wallpapering technique is called
  <i>texture mapping</i>.</p>

  <p><b>More Interesting Objects.</b> In this program, everything
  is a wall, and all the walls are the same height. That makes it
  easy to draw the picture, because walls are simple, and if
  they're all the same height, you can't see over one to what's
  behind it. But the pictures are pretty dull. OMAR might like to
  modify this ray-tracer to support variable-height walls. With
  walls of uniform height, we just computed the intersection with
  the nearest wall, rendered that wall, and threw away the other
  intersection points. Now we have to retain all the intersection
  points, and render all the visible walls, starting from the
  furthest and working toward the nearest, overwriting older walls
  with nearer ones as appropriate.If you do this, walls don't have
  to start at the ground and go up; they could start in the air, or
  they could be very tall walls with horizontal slots in them, or
  whatever you like; you get all that for free. DOOM does this
  too.</p>

  <h3>NOTES FROM LAST TIME</h3>

  <p>OMAR didn't materialize this time, so I had to be OMAR. I made
  some changes to the Regex.pm module to add the . metachar-acter;
  that only took eight lines! I was encouraged by that, so I added
  general character classes. These patches, a few errata, and
  anything else will be available at <a href=
  "http://www.plover.com/~mjd/Regex/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.plover.com/ ~mjd/Regex/</a>.</p>

  <p>It's not too late to suggest a name for this column, and I
  really need one, so please do send suggestions to
  <i>mjd-tpj@plover.com</i>. Suggestions should characterize the
  subject matter (so far: Infinite Lists, B-Trees, How Regexes
  Work, Ray Tracing) or sound cool.</p>
