  <p>I like to keep my CGI scripts puny and weak, and you should
  too. CGI scripts are a gateway into your system from the
  Internet, and are, unfortunately, all too often exploited by
  unscrupulous people for nefarious ends. The more access a CGI
  script has to your system, the more dangerous it becomes when
  used for unintended purposes.</p>

  <p>To keep CGI scripts under control, most webmasters, myself
  included, run the web server under an unprivileged user account.
  On Unix systems, this is often an account called 'nobody'. On
  Windows NT, it is an anonymous account with guest logon access.
  On correctly configured systems, the web server user account has
  even fewer privileges than an ordinary user. It doesn't own a
  home directory, have a shell, or even have the ability to log in
  as a normal user.</p>

  <p>Under most circumstances you'll never notice the fact that CGI
  scripts run as an unprivileged user. However, sometimes this fact
  becomes inconvenient. For example, what if you want to give
  remote users read/write access to their home directories from
  across the web, allow web access to a database that uses account
  privileges for access control, or perform administrative tasks
  that require superuser privileges? When you face challenges like
  these, your only choice is to give the script a little more power
  than usual. In this article I'll show you how to accomplish this
  without creating a monster.</p>

  <h3>THE EXAMPLE SCRIPT</h3>

  <p>The example I use here lets Unix users change their login
  passwords remotely via a web page. When the user first accesses
  the script, the screen shown in Figure 1 prompts him for the
  account name, old password, and new password (twice). After
  pressing the 'Change Password' button, the script verifies the
  input and then attempts to make the requested change. If the
  change is successful, the user is presented with a confirmation
  screen.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/stein-fig1.gif"><img src=
  "images/stein-fig1_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 1. Changing your system password." border="0" width="200"
  height="138"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 1:</b> Changing your
  system password.</font></p>

  <p>Otherwise, an error message (in large red letters) is
  displayed, and the user is prompted to try again, as shown in
  Figure 2.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="images/stein-fig2.gif"><img src=
  "images/stein-fig2_sm.gif" align="center" alt=
  "Figure 2. An unsuccessful attempt." border="0" width="200"
  height="138"></a></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="-1"><b>Figure 2:</b> An
  unsuccessful attempt.</font></p>

  <p>Note that this password changing script is designed to change
  not the user's web access password, but his system login
  password. An Internet service provider might use something like
  this to allow users to change their POP (Post Office Protocol),
  NNTP (Net News Transfer Protocol), or dialup passwords with-out
  bothering the system administrator or accessing a shell.</p>

  <h3>DESIGNING THE SCRIPT</h3>

  <p>An ordinary CGI script has a snowball's chance in hell of
  accomplishing this password changing task. It can't modify the
  system password file directly, because write access to the file
  is off-limits to anyone but the superuser. It can't even run the
  system <i>passwd</i> utility on the remote user's behalf, because
  <i>passwd</i> prevents one user from changing another's password,
  and will detect the attempt by the web server account to do so as
  a security violation. To get around these problems, we have
  several choices:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Launch the CGI script as the superuser (with <i>suid</i>),
    and modify the system password files directly.</li>

    <li>Launch the CGI script as the superuser (with <i>suid</i>),
    and run the system <i>passwd</i> utility to change the user's
    password.</li>

    <li>Launch the CGI script as the superuser (with <i>suid</i>),
    immediately change to the remote user's access privileges, and
    run the system <i>passwd</i> utility to change the
    password.</li>

    <li>Launch the CGI script normally, and call the <i>su</i>
    program to run the <i>passwd</i> utility under the privileges
    of the remote user.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The first solution is by far the worst. Running a CGI script
  as the superuser, and then using its far-reaching powers to
  modify essential system files, is an invitation to disaster. The
  solution is also extremely non-portable, since many Unix systems
  use shadow password systems or Network Information System (NIS)
  databases to hold user account information.</p>

  <p>The second solution is somewhat more appealing. Instead of
  modifying system files directly, we call the system <i>passwd</i>
  utility to change the user's password on our behalf. This avoids
  many of the portability problems because the <i>passwd</i>
  program presumably knows all about the fiddly details of the
  system password database. However, it still requires that the
  script be run as root, and this makes me nervous.</p>

  <p>The next solution isn't very different The CGI script is again
  launched with root privileges, but it quickly changes its
  identity to run as the remote user. With the remote user's
  account privileges, it then invokes <i>passwd</i>. This is an
  improvement because the script gives away its superuser
  privileges as soon as possible. However, the script is still
  launched as root, and this is a Bad Thing.</p>

  <p>I like the last solution the best. The script isn't run as
  root at all. Instead, after parsing the CGI parameters and
  deciding what to do, it calls the <i>su</i> program to change its
  identity to that of the remote user. In order to run <i>su</i>,
  the script needs the remote user's password, which, conveniently
  enough, he has already provided. Provided <i>su</i> grants the
  request, the script then calls the <i>passwd</i> program to
  change the user's password. Not only does this solution avoid the
  problem of becoming root, but it works with systems that have
  disabled <i>suid</i> scripts and even with servers that don't run
  CGI scripts as separate processes, such as Apache equipped with
  mod_perl (see <a href="../vol3_1/ewtoc.html" target=
  "resource window">TPJ #9</a>).</p>

  <p>This is the design we use here.</p>

  <h3>THE CHAT2.PL LIBRARY</h3>

  <p>Unfortunately there's one little problem. Both <i>su</i> and
  <i>passwd</i> are interactive programs. They read their input
  directly from the terminal rather than from standard input, so
  you can't just send them input via a pipe. Instead, you have to
  trick them into thinking they're talking to a human typing at a
  terminal rather than to a Perl script.</p>

  <p>Happily, there's a ready-made solution. The chat2.pl library,
  part of the standard Perl 5.004 distribution, allows you to open
  up a pseudo tty to any program on the system and hold an
  interactive conversation with it. All we have to do is to figure
  out what prompts the program produces and what inputs to
  provide.</p>

  <p>In preparation for writing a script that uses chat2.pl, it's
  good to run the desired program from the command line a few times
  and provide it with a range of inputs so that you can see all the
  possible outcomes. Here's a transcript of the session that I used
  to design the password changing script:</p>
  <pre>
1&gt; <b>su -c /usr/bin/passwd impostor</b>
su: user impostor does not exist
&#13;2&gt; <b>su -c /usr/bin/<i>passwd</i> wanda</b>
Password: <b><strike>wrong_password</strike></b>
su: incorrect password
&#13;3&gt; <b>su -c /usr/bin/<i>passwd</i> wanda</b>
Password: <b><strike>llamas2</strike></b>
Changing password for wanda
Enter old password: <b><strike>wrong_password</strike></b>
Illegal password, impostor.
&#13;4&gt; <b>su -c /usr/bin/<i>passwd</i> wanda</b>
Password: <b><strike>llamas2</strike></b>
Changing password for wanda
Enter old password: <b><strike>llamas2</strike></b>
Enter new password: <b><strike>zebras</strike></b>
The password must have both upper- and lowercase
letters, or non-letters; try again.
Enter new password: <b><strike>zeBrAs</strike></b>
Re-type new password: <b><strike>zeBras</strike></b>
You misspelled it. Password not changed.
&#13;5&gt; <b>su -c /usr/bin/<i>passwd</i> wanda</b>
Password: <b><strike>llamas2</strike></b>
Changing password for wanda
Enter old password: <b><strike>llamas2</strike></b>
Enter new password: <b><strike>ZeBrAs</strike></b>
Re-type new password: <b><strike>ZeBrAs</strike></b>
Password changed.
</pre>

  <p>In each attempt, I called <i>su</i> with the <tt>-c</tt> flag
  to make it run the <i>passwd</i> program with the privileges of
  the indicated user. In the first attempt, I deliberately gave
  <i>su</i> the name of a bogus user, and it replied with an error
  message. In the second attempt, I gave <i>su</i> the name of a
  legitimate user of the system, but deliberately mistyped her
  password.</p>

  <p>In the third try, I gave <i>su</i> the correct password; it
  accepted the password and passed me on to the <i>passwd</i>
  program, which printed <tt>Changing password for wanda</tt>. I
  then deliberately entered the incorrect password at this point,
  to see the message <tt>Illegal password</tt>.</p>

  <p>Continuing to work my way through the possibilities, I invoked
  the program again, this time giving the correct password both
  times. This got me to the <tt>Enter new password:</tt> prompt.
  When I typed in <tt>zebras</tt>, however, the <i>passwd</i>
  program rejected it because it was too easy (my system rejects
  passwords that are too short or consist only of lowercase
  letters; other systems may have even more stringent rules). The
  system accepted <tt>ZeBrAs</tt> as a password, but when I
  confirmed it, I made a spelling error and was booted out.</p>

  <p>Finally, on trial 5, I was able to work my way through the
  pass-word changing process, getting to the final confirmation
  <tt>Password changed</tt>.</p>

  <p>Armed with this information, we can design a series of calls
  to chat2.pl that automate the password changing operation.</p>

  <h3>OOPS</h3>

  <p>But not quite yet. Soon after I began writing this script I
  discovered that the chat2.pl library, which was originally
  written for Perl 4, hasn't been brought up to date for a long
  time. As a result it's not as portable as other parts of Perl
  5.004. chat2.pl uses a number of system-specific constants for
  creating sockets and pseudo ttys. Some of the constants are
  obtained from .ph files (system include files that have been run
  through the <i>h2ph</i> converter), while others are,
  unfortunately, hard coded. <i>h2ph</i> is notoriously difficult
  to run correctly, and the .ph files it produces often have to be
  tuned by hand. Worse, the hard-coded value for one essential
  constant, <tt>TIO-CNOTTY</tt>, was just plain wrong for my Linux
  system, causing chat2.pl to fail miserably.</p>

  <p>To get things working, I patched my copy of chat2.pl slightly
  to bring it up to date. The patch replaces hardwired and .ph
  con-stants with ones imported from the Socket.pm and Ioctl.pm
  modules. You can find a copy of this patch file on the TPJ web
  site.</p>

  <p>Although Socket.pm is a standard part of the 5.004
  distribution, Ioctl.pm is not. You'll have to download it from
  CPAN. Be warned that installing Ioctl.pm is not as
  straightforward as most other modules. After the standard
  <tt>perl Makefile.PL</tt> and make steps, you must open a file
  named <i>Ioctl.def</i> and define a comma-delimited list of those
  constants you wish to make available. A good list can be found in
  the autogenerated file <i>genconst.pl</i>, where it is,
  inexplicably, commented out. I created an Ioctl.def for my system
  by cutting and pasting between the two files. After this, you
  must <tt>make</tt> again and then <tt>make install</tt>.</p>

  <p>Recently, Eric Arnold (<i>eric.arnold@sun.com</i>) wrote an
  alternative to chat2.pl called Comm.pl. Its advantages over
  chat2.pl include a more intuitive interface that resembles Tcl's
  expect program, and includes some extra goodies like an
  <tt>interact()</tt> function for interactively getting input from
  the user. However, Comm.pl is still a Perl 4 library with lots of
  hard-coded system-specific constants. Until Comm.pl is updated to
  use Perl 5's Socket and Ioctl modules, I'll continue to use my
  patched copy of chat2.pl. For those who want to investigate
  Comm.pl further, it can be found at <a href=
  "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/authors/id/ERICA/" target=
  "resource window">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/authors/id/ERICA/</a>.
  [Editor's note: after Lincoln wrote this article, the Expect
  module was announced. See <a href="tpj0302-0007.html" target=
  "resource window">page 37</a>. -Jon]</p>

  <h3>THE CGI SCRIPT</h3>

  <p>The complete password-changing script is shown in <a href=
  "tpj0302-0006a.html">Listing 1</a>. We'll focus first on lines 58
  through 110, where the subroutine named <tt>set_passwd()</tt> is
  defined. This is the core of the script, where the password is
  actually changed.</p>

  <p>Our first step is to bring in chat2.pl, which we do using an
  old-fashioned <tt>require()</tt>, because chat2.pl is still a
  Perl 4 library file. It's not a real module, so we can't use use.
  We also define some constants: <tt>$passwd</tt> and <tt>$SU</tt>
  give the absolute path to the <i>passwd</i> and <i>su</i>
  programs respectively, and <tt>$TIMEOUT</tt> specifies a timeout
  of two seconds for our conversation with the <i>su</i> and
  <i>passwd</i> programs. If an expected output is not seen within
  this time, the subroutine aborts.</p>

  <p>On line 64, we recover the name of the account to change as
  well the old and new passwords. We then call the
  <tt>chat::open_proc()</tt> function to open up a pseudo tty to
  the command <tt>su -c /usr/bin/passwd username</tt>. If
  successful, the <tt>chat</tt> package returns a filehandle that
  we use for the subsequent conversation. Otherwise, we abort with
  an error message.</p>

  <p>Next, we wait for <i>su</i> to prompt for the original
  password (lines 69 through 73) by calling the function
  <tt>chat::expect()</tt>. This function takes the pseudo tty
  filehandle, a timeout value, and a series of pattern/expression
  pairs, and scans through the opened program's output looking for
  a match with each of the provided patterns. When a match is
  found, its corresponding expression is <tt>eval()</tt>'d and the
  result is returned. If no pattern is matched during the specified
  timeout period, an <tt>undef</tt> value is returned.</p>

  <p>In the first call to <tt>expect()</tt>, we're looking for two
  possible patterns. The first pattern is the string
  <tt>"Password:"</tt> indicating that <i>su</i> is prompting for
  the user's current password. The second possible pattern is
  <tt>"user \w+ does not exist"</tt>, which indicates that the
  account name we are attempting to <i>su</i> to is invalid. In the
  first case, we return the string "<tt>ok</tt>." In the second
  case we return the string "<tt>unknown user</tt>." Notice that
  because these expressions will be passed to <tt>eval()</tt>, we
  must enclose them in quotes in order to prevent Perl from trying
  to execute them as functions or method calls.</p>

  <p>Next, in lines 74 to 76, we examine the return value from
  <tt>chat::expect()</tt> and act on it. If there's no return value
  at all, we return an error indicating that we timed out before
  seeing one of the expected patterns. If the return value is the
  "<tt>unknown user</tt>" string, we abort with an appropriate
  error message. Otherwise, we know that <i>su</i> is waiting for
  the password. We oblige it by calling <tt>chat:print()</tt> to
  send the old password to <i>su</i>.</p>

  <p>We now repeat this <tt>chat::expect()</tt> and
  <tt>chat::print()</tt> sequence several times. First we await
  confirmation from <i>su</i> that the password was correct (lines
  78-83). Next we provide <i>passwd</i> with the old and new
  passwords (lines 85-106) and wait for confirmation that they were
  acceptable. When done, we close the pseudo tty by calling
  <tt>chat::close()</tt> (line 107).</p>

  <p>The only trick worth noting here is the call to
  <tt>chat::expect()</tt> on lines 95 to 98, where we provide
  <i>passwd</i> with the user's new password. With my version of
  <i>passwd</i>, there's a chance of the new password being
  rejected for being too simple. Sometimes the password is rejected
  for being too short, sometimes for being composed of lower-case
  letters only, and sometimes for other reasons. In addition to
  detecting the fact that the password has been rejected, we'd like
  to capture the reason given by <i>passwd</i>. We do this using
  parentheses in the regular expression match to create a
  backreference. The matched string is then returned from
  <tt>expect()</tt> when the expression "<tt>$1</tt>" is
  evaluated.</p>

  <p>The return value from <tt>set_passwd()</tt> is a two-element
  array. The first element is a numeric result code, where a true
  value indicates a successful outcome. The second element is a
  string that gives the reason for failure, if any.</p>

  <h3>THE REST OF THE SCRIPT</h3>

  <p>Changing the password was the hard part. Let's step back now
  and walk through the rest of the script. At the top of the script
  we invoke Perl with the <tt>-T</tt> switch to turn taint checks
  on. Taint checks cause Perl to abort if we attempt to pass
  unchecked user input to external programs or shells. Since we
  invoke the <i>su</i> and <i>passwd</i> programs, it is a good
  idea to include these checks. We'd use the <tt>-w</tt> warning
  switch too, but chat2.pl generates many noise warnings about
  unused variables.</p>

  <p>Lines 2 through 4 are there to make the taint checks happy.
  Explicitly setting the <tt>PATH</tt> and <tt>IFS</tt> environment
  variables prevents programming practices that rely on unsafe
  assumptions about the environment. We turn off I/O buffering on
  line 7, to avoid conflicts between the standard I/O buffering
  used by Perl and the external programs we launch.</p>

  <p>On line 9 we load the standard CGI library and import the
  stan-dard and HTML3 sets of functions. The HTML3 set gives us
  access to HTML table definition tags. We now print the standard
  HTTP header, and begin the HTML page (lines 11 through 14).</p>

  <p>Line 16 calls <tt>CGI::import_names()</tt> to import all the
  current CGI parameters into like-named Perl variables in the
  <tt>Q::</tt> namespace. This script expects five different CGI
  parameters:</p>

  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <td><tt>user</tt></td>

      <td>the name of the user</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><tt>old</tt></td>

      <td>the user's old password</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><tt>new1</tt></td>

      <td>the user's new password</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><tt>new2</tt></td>

      <td>confirmation of the user's new password</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><tt>referer</tt></td>

      <td>the URL of the page that originally linked to the
      script</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>After <tt>import_names()</tt> is called, there will be
  variables named <tt>$Q::user</tt>, <tt>$Q::old</tt>, and so
  forth.</p>

  <p>Lines 18 through 33 define a block labeled <tt>TRY</tt>. In
  <tt>TRY</tt> we attempt to recover the user's information and set
  the password. If we encounter an error during this process, we
  call <tt>last TRY</tt> to fall through to the bottom of the block
  immediately (this is essentially a <tt>goto</tt> written in a
  structured manner). First we test whether the <tt>$Q::user</tt>
  parameter is defined at all. If it isn't, we just jump to the end
  of the block. Otherwise, we call a routine named
  <tt>check_consistency()</tt> to check whether all the other
  parameters are present and are in the expected format. If
  <tt>check_consistency()</tt> fails, we print out an error message
  and exit the block.</p>

  <p>If we pass the consistency check, we call the
  <tt>set_passwd()</tt> routine that we looked at in detail above.
  If <tt>set_passwd()</tt> is successful, we print an
  acknowledgment message and set the variable <tt>$OK</tt> to
  <tt>true</tt>.</p>

  <p>The actual call to <tt>set_passwd()</tt> is on line 27. The
  mess above and below it are a workaround for an error message
  that I found appearing in my server's error log: <tt>"stty:
  standard input: Invalid argument"</tt>. This error message is
  issued when <i>su</i> tries to suppress the terminal's echo of
  the user's typed password. Since this error is irrelevant, we
  suppress it by temporarily redirecting standard error to
  <i>/dev/null</i>.</p>

  <p>Outside the <tt>TRY</tt> block, line 35 calls
  <tt>create_form()</tt> to generate the fill-out form. We do this
  when <tt>$OK</tt> is false, causing the form to be displayed the
  first time the script is called, and regenerated if any errors
  occur during the <tt>TRY</tt> block. Because CGI.pm generates
  "sticky" fill-out forms automatically, the values the user
  previously typed into the form fields are retained.</p>

  <p>Lines 37 through 42 generate the end of the page, a hypertext
  link labeled <tt>"EXIT SCRIPT"</tt> that takes the user back to
  the page that originally linked to the script, and a link to the
  site's home page. The URL for the <tt>EXIT SCRIPT</tt> link is
  generated from a CGI parameter named "referer." If that isn't
  defined, it uses the value returned by the <tt>referer()</tt>
  function. The rationale for this is discussed in: <a href=
  "tpj0302-0006a.html">The Unix Pasword Changing Script.</a>.</p>

  <p>Finally, let's look at the definitions of
  <tt>check_consistency()</tt> and <tt>create_form()</tt>. The
  <tt>check_consistency()</tt> subroutine, defined in lines 44 to
  56, performs various sanity checks on the username and other CGI
  parameters. First it checks that the <tt>$Q::user</tt>,
  <tt>$Q::old</tt>, <tt>$Q::new1</tt> and <tt>$Q::new2</tt> fields
  are all present, and returns a warning message if any are
  missing. Next it checks that the <tt>$Q::new1</tt> and
  <tt>$Q::new2</tt> passwords are identical. If not, it warns the
  user that the new password and its confirmation don't match. The
  routine now verifies that the username has only printable
  non-whitespace characters only, and is no longer than 8
  characters (this is the limit on my Linux system; it may be
  different on yours). Passwords must be no more than 30 characters
  in length. Finally, the routine uses <tt>get-pwnam()</tt> to
  check that the username provided is a valid account name on this
  system. If <tt>getpwnam()</tt> returns an empty list, the name is
  unknown and we return an error message to that effect. If the
  user name corresponds to the root user (user ID equals 0), we
  also return an error. It's not a good idea to let anyone change
  the superuser password via the web!</p>

  <p>Lines 112 to 130 define <tt>create_form()</tt>, the routine
  responsible for creating the fill-out form. Using CGI's HTML
  shortcuts it generates a straightforward 2 row by 4 column table
  that prompts the user for her account name, and old and new
  passwords. We use call <tt>textfield()</tt> to generate the field
  that prompts the user for her account name, and call
  <tt>password_field()</tt> to create input fields for the
  passwords. (Password fields differ from ordinary text fields in
  that the letters the user types in are displayed as stars.)</p>

  <p>The only trick in this form appears on line 127, where we
  create a hidden field named referer. This field stores the value
  returned by <tt>CGI::referer()</tt>, the URL of the page that
  linked to the script. We use the hidden field to turn this value
  into an invisible CGI parameter the very first time the script is
  called, which we later retrieve and use to generate the link
  labeled "<tt>EXIT SCRIPT</tt>." We have to store this value when
  the form is first generated because later, after the form has
  been submitted and the script reinvoked, <tt>referer()</tt> will
  return the URL of the script itself rather than the original
  page. The stickiness of CGI form fields guarantees that the
  original value of <tt>referer</tt> will be maintained through all
  subsequent invocations.</p>

  <p>Lines 132 to 135 define <tt>do_error()</tt>, which creates a
  standard error message. The call to <tt>CGI::font()</tt> creates
  an HTML tag that causes the text within it to be enlarged and
  colored red.</p>

  <h3>CAVEATS</h3>

  <p>Before you install this script on your own system, you may
  need to make a few changes. Your versions of <i>su</i> and
  <i>passwd</i> may not behave exactly like mine. You may need to
  experiment a bit and change the prompt strings that
  <tt>chat::expect()</tt> scans for. This is particularly likely to
  be true if you use NIS or a shadow password system.</p>

  <p>You should also be aware that web communications are not, by
  default, encrypted. When the remote user fills out the form and
  sends in her account name and passwords, this information could,
  theoretically, be intercepted by someone armed with a packet
  sniffer who had somehow gained access to one of the computer
  systems on the link between the remote user and the web server.
  If this bothers you, you can avoid the risk by installing the
  script on a server that uses the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
  encryption protocol, and configuring the server so that users can
  only access the page when SSL is active.</p>

  <p>If you run an NT-based system, this script won't work at all
  because, gratefully, the Windows NT interfaces to user account
  databases are quite different from their Unix counterparts.
  Thanks to David Roth's excellent Win32::AdminMisc module, you can
  change Windows NT passwords simply by replacing the
  <tt>set_passwd()</tt> routine with this much simpler piece of
  code:</p>
  <pre>
sub set_passwd ($$$) {
    use Win32::AdminMisc;
    use Win32::NetAdmin;
    my $DOMAIN = "NT Domain";
    my $CONTROLLER = '';
	
    my($user,$old,$new) = @_;
    return (undef,
            "Couldn't get primary domain controller name.")
      unless
        Win32::NetAdmin::GetController('','',$CONTROLLER);
    return (undef,
             "Couldn't log in as $user.")
      unless
        Win32::AdminMisc::LogonAsUser($DOMAIN,$user,$old);
    return (undef,
             "Couldn't change password for $user.")
      unless
         Win32::AdminMisc::SetPassword($CONTROLLER,$user,$new);
    return (1,"Password changed successfully for $Q::user.");
}
</pre>

  <p>You'll need to change <tt>$DOMAIN</tt> to contain the correct
  domain for your Windows NT system.<br>
