<p>You can convert a Perl script into a self-contained executable in more than one way. One way is to use <i>LibZip</i>, which I've already discussed in Part I of this article last month. <i>LibZip</i> builds an external self-contained library that you distribute along with your compiled Perl script. Another approach is to use <i>PAR</i>&#151;the Perl Archive Toolkit.</p>

<p>As in <i>LibZip</i>, you need a working C compiler to compile Perl scripts. A sample Perl script, sample1.pl (shown in <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing 1</a>), is provided with this article. This script will be compiled to showcase the capabilities of <i>PAR</i>. You may also need to install <i>Win32::Autoglob</i> before you can use sample1.pl.</p>

<p>Also, although the entire discussion here focuses on building executables for the Windows system, the steps presented here apply to other nonWindows platforms, too.</p>
<h3>The Perl Archive Toolkit</h3>

<p><i>PAR</i> is the tool to use if you dislike having to bundle an executable with a separate library and prefer, instead, to have just a single executable. <i>PAR</i>, which is always available from http://par.perl.org/ index.cgi, requires the following modules: <i>File::Temp</i>, <i>Compress::Zlib</i>, <i>Archive::Zip</i>, <i>Module::ScanDeps</i>, and <i>PAR::Dist</i>. Apart from these prerequisite modules, the <i>PAR</i> maintainers also recommend the following modules: <i>Parse::Binary</i> and <i>Win32::Exe</i>, if you're on a Windows system.</p>

<p>Assuming you have installed all the prerequisite modules, using <i>PAR</i> is easy.</p>
<h3>Compiling Scripts Using the Command Line </h3>

<p>If you prefer using the command line, the following command will compile the sample Perl script, sample1.pl, into a Windows executable:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
pp -o sample1.exe sample1.pl

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>The resulting executable will be named sample1.exe, as specified by the  <i>-o</i> option to the Perl Packer, <i>pp</i>. <i>pp</i> converts the source script, sample1.pl, into Windows native code.</p>

<p>If you want to compress the executable, you can invoke the -z option with a mandatory integer argument, from 0 to 9. 9 will use the maximum possible compression. If <i>-z</i> is not specified, the compression level defaults to 6.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
pp -o sample1.exe -z 9 sample1.pl

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>You can also eliminate more excess baggage by using the filter option (<i>-f</i>), which requires an argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
pp -o sample1.exe -z 9 -f PodStrip sample1.pl

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>This filter strips away all POD sections from the executable.</p>
<h3>GUI-based Script Compilation</h3>

<p>If you hate command lines, there is <i>tkpp</i>, a GUI-based version of <i>pp</i>. When you use <i>tkpp</i>, you must first set up some important paths: the locations of your Perl interpreter and <i>pp</i>. To set these, click on "File" and then choose "Preferences."</p>

<p>On the "Source file" text box, type the complete path to your script, or click on the icon beside the text box. In doing so, a file browser will pop up, where you can choose your script. On the "Output file" text box, type the name of the executable you want to create. Leave all other buttons in their default states. At the bottom center of the GUI, there is a "Build" button. Click this button to proceed with the compilation of your script. You should see the message "Building..." while your script is being processed. When compilation is finally completed, you should see the message "Ready."</p>

<p>You can also build an executable without a console window by clicking on the "GUI" checkbox. This is ignored, however, on nonWindows systems. The command-line version of this is the <i>-gui</i> option:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
pp -o sample1.exe -z 9 -f PodStrip -gui sample1.pl

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>That's it!</p>
<h3>Obfuscation </h3>

<p>Like LibZip, PAR can also hide your source code from casual snooping by turning your script into comment-free Perl code with mangled variable names. Of course, this is not the same as encryption and surely will not discourage a determined cracker. Obfuscation cannot offer 100-percent protection of your Perl code.</p>

<p>To obfuscate your code, use the <i>-f</i> filter with Obfuscate as argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
pp -o sample1.exe -z 9 -f PodStrip \
  -f Obfuscate sample1.pl

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>A harmless message will be displayed during compilation, which looks something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\6mBQIYqCex 
  syntax OK

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Just ignore it.</p>

<p>But before you can use obfuscation, you must first install <i>B::Deobfuscate</i>, and before you can do that, you need to install <i>B::Keywords</i> and YAML, as well. Be sure to use Version 0.35 of YAML, and not the latest development release, or else you won't be able to install <i>B::Deobfuscate</i>.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p><b>Using the diagnostics Module.</b> Just like my experience with <i>LibZip</i>, I found out that having <i>use diagnostics</i> in my scripts will compile fine, but the resulting executables will not run properly. I often get error messages similar to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
No diagnostics? at diagnostics.pm line 408.
Compilation failed in require at 
  xxxx/sample1.pl line 8.
BEGIN failed&#151;compilation aborted at 
  xxxx/sample1.pl line 8.

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I recommend that you remove or uncomment out diagnostics from your script prior to building its native code equivalent.</p>

<p><b>Using Obfuscation.</b> One ugly problem with using obfuscation is that the generated executable is not always guaranteed to run. If I compile my script like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
pp -o sample1.exe -f Obfuscate -z 9 \
  -f PodStrip sample1.pl

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and run the resulting executable on the current directory,</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
sample1.exe . &#151;recursive &#151;all

</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>I sometimes get this error:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Undefined subroutine &amp;main::performance called 
  at sample1.pl line 41.

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Even weirder is when I rearrange the order of arguments I feed to <i>pp</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
pp -o sample1.exe -f PodStrip -z 9 \
  -f Obfuscate sample1.pl

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In which case I get a very different error:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
String found where operator expected at 
script/hash.pl line 10, near 

"GetOptions 'digest=s'"
        (Do you need to predeclare GetOptions?)
syntax error at script/hash.pl line 10, near 
"GetOptions 'digest=s'"

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But I don't get these errors if I run the original Perl script!</p>

<p>It looks like <i>pp</i> itself gets confused when obfuscation is performed. I have informed the <i>PAR</i> maintainers about this. Let's hope this problem goes away in the next release of <i>PAR</i>.</p>

<p>What can we learn from this? Aside from offering minimal source-code protection, use of obfuscation is also problematic. So, I discourage you from employing it, at least in its present state.</p>

<p><b>Using UPX.</b> In the previous article where I discussed <i>LibZip</i>, I used UPX to compress the library and executable even more. This time, I attempted to use UPX on the executable generated by <i>PAR</i>. It compressed the executable all right, but when I ran the executable, I got a partial error:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
IO error: reading header signature :
 at -e line 830
IO error: reading header signature :
 at -e line 830

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But despite this imperfection, the executable still managed to proceed as usual.</p>

<p><b>Compiling Scripts For Linux.</b> <i>PAR</i> works equally well on Linux. As a matter of fact, <i>PAR</i> also runs on FreeBSD, AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, NetBSD, and Mac OS. From the <i>PAR</i> FAQ: "The resulting executable will run on any platform that supports the binary format of the generating platform.''</p>

<p>The steps enumerated here also apply to nonWindows systems without the slightest modification.</p>
