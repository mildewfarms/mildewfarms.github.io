But while things are nicely layered in Windows, it's different on the device side. Usually, USB devices are embedded systems without layers of drivers&#151;and there's no concept of a pipe handle. For example, the TI USB device simply generates an interrupt whenever a packet is received on a specific endpoint&#151;that's it. A pipe handle is really a Windows abstraction of a USB device endpoint.</p><p>&#151;D.A.G.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><a href="0404j.htm#rs1">Back to Article</a></body></html>
