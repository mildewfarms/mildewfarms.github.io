For more than 20 years, P.J. Plauger has played an integral role in the definition, design, and implementation of the C and C++ programming languages. </p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>Throughout the 1980s, Plauger was Secretary of X3J11, the ANSI-authorized committee responsible for the development of the original ANSI C Standard. This was followed in the early 1990s by a stint as Convener of ISO JTC1/SC22/WG14, the committee responsible for the development and maintenance of the ISO C Standard. For the past decade, he has been an active participant in the development of the C++ Standard. During all of this, Plauger earned his living as a member of the technical staff at Bell Labs, a vice president for Yourdon Inc., president of Whitesmiths Ltd., a vendor of an early commercial C compiler, and chief engineer at Intermetrics. Currently, Plauger is president of Dinkumware Ltd., a company he launched to license standard-conforming C and C++ libraries and online documentation. Further contributing to the growth of C/C++, Plauger served for more than 10 years as senior editor of <i>The C/C++ Users Journal </i>and contributing editor to <i>Embedded Systems Programming</i>, both <i>DDJ</i> sister publications. He is currently <i>The C/C++ Users Journal'</i>s senior contributing editor. </p><p>In all of his spare time, Plauger managed to write or coauthor dozens of books and short stories, technical and otherwise. Along with Brian W. Kernighan, for instance, he wrote <i>Elements of Programming Style and Software Tools in Pascal.</i> Plauger also wrote <i>The Standard C Library; Programming on Purpose</i>, a set of books based on columns he wrote for <i>Computer Language </i>magazine; <i>The Draft Standard C++ Library; Standard C: A Reference </i>(cowritten with Jim Brodie); and <i>The Standard Template Library</i> (cowritten with Alexander Stepanov, Meng Lee, and David Musser); among others. Throughout all this, Plauger has been acknowledged as "a clear and stirring writer and a programmer's programmer" (http://www.sbw.org/).</p><p>Moreover, Plauger has been a published science-fiction writer for more than 30 years, with short stories appearing in publications ranging from <i>Analog</i> and <i>Galaxy</i>, to anthologies such as <i>Analog Annual</i> (edited by Ben Bova). In 1991, Plauger was a Visiting Fellow at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.</p><p>Plauger earned a Bachelor's Degree in Physics from Princeton University and a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from Michigan State University. At his request and in his name, <i>Dr. Dobb's Journal </i>is pleased to make a grant of $1000.00 to the Concord-Carlisle Regional School Committee in Plauger's hometown of Concord, Massachusetts. Please join us in honoring P.J. Plauger's contribution to the art and science of software development. </p><p><b>DDJ</b></p></body></html>
