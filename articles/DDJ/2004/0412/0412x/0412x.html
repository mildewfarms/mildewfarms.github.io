<p>Visual Numerics' IMSL C# Numerical Library adds mathematics extensions such as the ability to handle complex numbers to the C# language. You can write applications in Visual C# .NET or Visual Basic .NET and use the IMSL C# Library as the analysis engine. The library includes algorithms for common analytics such as profit maximization, product-design optimization, supply chain efficiency optimization, and demand forecasting, and the algorithms interact with charting and visualization packages including Excel, .NET Framework utilities, and those from third-party vendors. </p>
