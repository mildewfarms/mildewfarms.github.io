<h2>Where to Get Whidbey C++</h2>

<p>The May Community edition of Visual Studio .NET 2005 is available free to MSDN subscribers, and to nonsubscribers for a small fee from http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/get/default.aspx.</p>

<p>In addition, the full C++ compiler is available through the "express" version of Visual C++; this version does not include the unmanaged MFC or ATL libraries. See http://lab.msdn.microsoft .com/express/visualc/default.aspx.</p>

<p>This site requires that you have a .NET passport and that you provide registration information. After registration, you are sent a confirmation e-mail with a link to the download site.</p>
