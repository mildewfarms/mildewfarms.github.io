<h2>Open-Source Eclipse Validators</h2>

<p>I have worked on several Eclipse validators that are now available in two open-source projects. Use these validators as examples when creating your own.</p>

<p>     </p>

<ul>
  <li>	The Eclipse Web Service Validation Tools (WSVT) Project. The WSVT project contains a WSDL validator that works in a similar way to the one developed in this article but contains more features, such as an XML catalog for storing schemas locally, an extensible URI resolver that can perform custom resource location for referenced resources, and an extension for adding specific WSDL validators for extension namespaces (such as SOAP bindings). The project also contains a SOAP message validator, which can be used to analyze the conformance of your web service SOAP traffic to the Web Services Interoperability Organization's Basic Profile 1.0. Find out more and check out the source of these validators at http://www.eclipse.org/wsvt/.</li>
  <li>	The Eclipse Web Tools Platform Project. The Web Tools Platform project is the newest top-level project at Eclipse. In July 2004, this project received a large initial code contribution from IBM, which included Eclipse validators for document type definition (DTD), XML, and XML Schema documents. These plug-ins extend a core validation plug-in and show how to wrap existing validators; in this case, from the Apache Xerces project. Find out more and check out the source of these validators at http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/.</li>
</ul>
