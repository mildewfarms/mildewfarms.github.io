<p>With any application release, users always want more features, and developers always need to patch bugs and extend functionality. One way of extending software and providing more capabilities is by implementing a plug-in framework for applications. A plug-in is a software component that is loaded by an application rather than being run independently. The plug-in extends the application by providing new functionality or resources. For example, the Netscape browser uses plug-ins to provide Apple Quicktime and Macromedia Flash support. Plug-ins let you write applications and release plug-in APIs, letting other developers provide new plug-ins without having access to your original source code or needing to recompile the entire application. Developing with plug-ins also lets you upgrade single plug-ins as bugs are fixed, security holes are patched, or new implementations become available.</p>

<p>Even though the Java spec does not directly deal with plug-ins, Java has simplified many of the problems associated with developing plug-in-based applications found in other programming languages. Through the runtime interpretation of bytecodes, Java-based plug-ins are easy to manage, cross platform, and, straightforward to implement. In this article, I introduce design patterns and concepts to assist in the development of a Java plug-in framework, including discovery and initialization of extension modules and dynamically extending the application classpath. The complete source code for a framework is available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 5.</p>
<h3>Giving Plug-Ins an Interface</h3>

<p>In order to load plug-ins, applications need to initialize and talk to them. To keep things simple, I assume that the plug-in has already been loaded by the application and that the application has determined the name of the class to use as the entry point into the plug-in. The application needs to instantiate the plug-in class and initialize the plug-in. To accomplish this, the plug-in and application need to share a common interface. The plug-in interface defines an API that is implemented by a class in the plug-in module and used by the application. In its simplest form, the interface needs to define two methods&#151;<i>start </i>and <i>stop</i>. The application can call <i>start</i> when the plug-in is loaded, and <i>stop</i> before the plug-in is unloaded. Java supports true interfaces, so creating a plug-in API requires defining the interface, and making it publicly available to all plug-in developers. <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a> shows the basic interface definition.</p>

<p>You may have noticed in the example plug-in interface that the <i>start</i> takes a context parameter. This parameter can be any data the application wants to pass to the plug-in. For the plug-in to be useful, it may need to access internal application data at runtime. One way to allow access is to provide the plug-in with hooks into the application through the context. When designing a plug-in-based application, the most difficult decision can be determining what data should be shared and how it should be shared with the plug-in. One good strategy is to create a context class that can be extended to contain more data as you find that the requirements of the application change. Another option is to create more interfaces that plug-ins can implement besides just the basic interface, which would let the application pass exact information to the plug-in based on the interfaces the plug-in implements. I don't present multiple interfaces here, but they are simple enough to implement once you understand the concepts.</p>
<h3>Packing the Plug-In for Production</h3>

<p>Once you have defined and implemented the API for a plug-in, the class files needs to be packaged for distribution to users. For any plug-in that provides real functionality, it requires more than the single class that implements the plug-in interface. To bundle all of these classes into a single file, you can use a JAR. The primary reason for choosing the JAR file format for plug-in packaging is that the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) contain classes to support processing JAR files in your application. </p>

<p>Again, the application had already determined the name of the plug-in class. There are a couple of simple ways for the application to do this using the JAR utility classes in the JFC. The method I use here is to include the name of the class in the manifest file of the JAR. According to the Java documentation, "The manifest is a special file that can contain information about the files packaged in a JAR file. By tailoring this metainformation that the manifest contains, you enable the JAR file to be used for a variety of purposes" (http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jar/basics/ manifest.html). For a plug-in, the manifest needs to contain the class name of the class that implements the plug-in interface that you defined previously. To do this, add a line to the manifest, such as <i>Plugin-Class:org.ddj.plugin.HelloWorldPlugin.</i> <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a> presents the simple implementation of HelloWorldPlugin, while <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a> presents the manifest file for the JAR. The final JAR can be created using the jar command: <i>jar -cfm helloworld-plugin.jar HelloWorldPlugin.mf org/ddj/plugin/*.class.</i> By using the manifest file, you have a well-documented file format and utility classes in the JFC to process the file.</p>
<h3>Locating and Loading</h3>

<p>Turning attention back to the application, you need to add support for locating and loading the plug-in JAR files. The first step&#151;locating the JAR files&#151;is accomplished by using the standard <i>java.io.File</i> class to list all of the files in a directory. I assume that the directory is known beforehand and that all the files ending in the JAR extension (.jar) are plug-ins. Using a <i>java.io.FileFilter</i> object and the <i>File.listFiles(FileFilter)</i> method, obtaining a list of all of the plug-in JAR files in a directory is trivial. The first half of <a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a> does this. This listing assumes that all of the plug-ins will be stored in a directory passed into the method. Also notice that Java is hiding all of the cross-platform issues that may arise, letting a single implementation be used on any Java-supported operating system.</p>

<p>The next step is to determine the name of the plug-in class to instantiate from that JAR, which you placed in the manifest file. The standard JFC class <i>java.util.jar.JarFile</i> lets you examine the internals of the JAR file. To get the manifest file from the <i>JarFile</i>, use the <i>JarFile.getManifest()</i> method, which returns a <i>java.util.jar.Manifest</i> object. The <i>Manifest</i> object can then be queried for attributes using the <i>Manifest.getMainAttributes()</i> method. After a few method calls, you can ask the <i>java.util.jar.Attributes</i> object for the <i>Plugin-Class</i> attribute, which returns the name of the plug-in class. The second half of <a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a> presents an implementation of the attribute discovery algorithm. One thing to remember is that the <i>JarFile</i> class automatically opens the JAR upon construction, so be sure to call <i>JarFile.close()</i> after you get the attribute.</p>
<h3>Choosing the Right Classpath</h3>

<p>For classes to be loaded at runtime, Java defines the <i>java.lang.ClassLoader</i> class, which is responsible for loading classes for the application. In most situations, an instance of a class loader is created by the Java Virtual Machine when the application starts executing and this bootstrap class loader includes all of the classes in the application's classpath. The bootstrap class loader presents a problem when writing a plug-in-based application since the plug-ins are not discovered until after the application is executing and the classpath has been established. Java does not provide any direct way of modifying the original application classpath; however, it does allow for new class loaders to be created and used at runtime. Creating new class loaders is the approach you are going to take to actually create the classes in the plug-in JAR.</p>

<p>The JFC provides the <i>java.net.URLClassLoader</i> class that can be used to load classes from JAR files by providing the class loader with the name of the JAR file in the form of a URL. You use the <i>File.toURL()</i> method to create a <i>java.net.URL</i> to represent the plug-in JAR file. Java class loaders use a delegation model for class discovery; therefore, you want to be sure to give the JVM's class loader to the plug-in class loader as the parent. Using the JVM's class loader as the parent ensures that the plug-in will be able to find any application classes that it may need. Using the instance of the <i>URLClassLoader</i>, you can now instantiate the plug-in class using the <i>ClassLoader.loadClass(String)</i> method. Using the plug-in class object returned from <i>loadClass(),</i> you can instantiate an instance by calling <i>java.lang.Class.newInstance().</i> Java defines that the class loader of the new instance will be the class loader that loaded the class. Therefore, the class loader for the plug-in object that you just instantiated will be the <i>URLClassLoader</i>, allowing the plug-in to create any other classes from the JAR that it may need by simply instantiating the objects as it normally would. <a name="rl5"></a><a href="#l5">Listing Five</a> presents an implementation of creating a class loader and instantiating the plug-in.</p>

<p>Java class loaders are flexible, but that flexibility introduces complexity. The example I present here only touches on the possibilities of what can be done with class loaders and plug-ins. One important note: The application is only able to instantiate classes from the plug-in JAR using the explicit <i>URLClassLoader,</i> which loads from that JAR. For more information on class loaders, see the J2SDK API documentation.</p>
<h3>Plugging the  Plug-Ins In</h3>

<p>To bring everything together, you implement a <i>PluginService</i> that is responsible for the plug-in lifecycle, including discovery, loading, initialization, and disposal. The <i>PluginService</i> is composed of the methods already discussed and written to this point. The application can now use the <i>PluginService</i> to simplify plug-in management. It is important to keep the plug-in framework generic so that it can be used in many different applications without having to change by making generous use of interfaces. I have already presented the plug-in interface used by the framework to instantiate, initialize, and dispose of the plug-in. Another interface to consider is the application context interface. Earlier, I mentioned that the application could use a context strategy to provide the plug-in access to application data. Because the data will most likely be application dependent, it is easy for the framework to accidentally become tied to a single application. To prevent this coupling, implement an interface for the context data that the application can realize. The context interface lets only the application and plug-in implementation be coupled to the concrete application context class, while the framework remains generic. <a name="rl6"></a><a href="#l6">Listing Six</a> is an implementation of the <i>PluginService</i>, as well as a simple application that uses the plug-in framework. <a name="rf1"></a><a href="0412ff1.html">Figure 1</a> presents an overview of the dependencies of the plug-in framework with respect to the application and plug-in implementation.</p>
<h3>Extending the  Framework</h3>

<p>Although useful in this simple form, a plug-in framework can provide much more. With any large application, the issue of dependency management is likely to arise. It would be possible to help document and maintain dependency management using the plug-in framework. The metainformation (the information about the plug-in that you placed in the manifest file) could be extended to include dependency information such as other required plug-ins or services that this plug-in can provide to the application.</p>

<p>Many applications also need to design methods for integrating the plug-ins into the application. In this framework, the application simply provides some form of a context, which presumably contains the necessary hooks for the plug-in to provide its functionality. The context design, however, may not be flexible enough once plug-ins start providing services that need to be used by other plug-ins or when plug-ins want to tie into a GUI. The plug-in framework could be extended to support all of these features with some clever interfaces.</p>

<p>It is possible to manage plug-ins by using metainformation, and to extend the framework to support multiple versions of the same plug-in. That effort makes upgrades and new features available to users who want them while ensuring backward compatibility at the same time. The plug-in approach also makes patching a single feature of an application easy. Simply replace the plug-in JAR file on the user's installation and the patch is complete. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>One notable application that's based on a plug-in framework is the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment project (http://www.eclipse.org/), which implements the core application as just the plug-in loading framework. All of the application functionality is shipped via plug-ins. This lets vendors such as IBM repackage Eclipse with different plug-ins as their commercial WebSphere developer product. This application versatility is only possible using a well-designed plug-in architecture. </p>
