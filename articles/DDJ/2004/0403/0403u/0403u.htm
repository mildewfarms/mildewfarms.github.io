Oh yeah?</BLOCKQUOTE><p>Sir Lancelot Spratt swept into the surgical ward, a magnificent and majestic cruise liner with a fleet of lesser vessels in his wake: the registrar, an SHO, an anesthetist complete with a <i>Daily Telegraph</i> folded to present the half-completed cryptic crossword, Sister and her double escort of a staff nurse, and the nursing assistant (whose sole task was to carry Sir Lancelot's PDA), and last, and also very much least, the group of medical students that included me. I bobbed timidly at the rear of the group, hoping to achieve invisibility by association. "Do keep up, Mr. Gordon," said Sister, undermining my attempt to hide.</p><p>There was an empty bed by the door. Sir Lancelot pointed to it. "What happened there? Man. Operated Monday. Gall bladder."</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>Unfazed by this vague description, Sister consulted her clipboard. "Died last night, Sir Lancelot."</p><p>"Dead?" said Sir Lancelot in a tone of incredulity, as though death were an unknown occurrence in a hospital. "Dead? Damn it, are you sure, Sister?"</p><p>Sister didn't much like having her word questioned. "Quite sure, Sir Lancelot."</p><p>"I wasn't impugning your accuracy, Sister. It's just that made a particularly neat job. I remember saying to you, 'Fred, I've done a particularly neat job there.'"</p><p>The anesthetist, scorning to join the rest of the crowd grouped around the Chief, was leaning on a corner of the nurses' station, his eyes focused on the middle distance in search of 17 Down's particularly elusive anagram. He made a grunting noise that might have been an affirmative. There was an awkward silence.</p><p>"We could look it up in the system," suggested the SHO, craftily setting up a situation where she, at least, could relax.</p><p>"Good idea, Marianne. You there. Mr. Grimsdyke. At the back. Bring up the patient's details on my PDA."</p><p>"My name's not 'Grimsdyke,' it's 'Gordon,' sir," I said stupidly.</p><p>"Who cares what your name is? Plug it in here, so we can all watch."</p><p>With sinking heart, I took the PDA from its bearer and plugged it in to the ward's big display screen, enabling everybody to track my keyboard clumsiness one keystroke at a time. I managed to log in and fire up the search application, but before I could get anywhere, I heard the words I dreaded the most.</p><p>"No, no, no, no. We'll have none of your wafty, GUI interfaces in this ward, thank you. Do it properly, man. Do it in SQL."</p><p>Regretting very much the hours I hadn't spent with the classic textbooks of Joe Celko&#151;time I had instead idly frittered away with Gray's <i>Anatomy</i> and back numbers of <i>The Lancet</i>&#151;I found and started the SQL client and nervously managed to type on the teeny keys of the PDA:</p><blockquote><p>SELECT * FROM VASC_PATIENTS WHERE LNAME =</p></blockquote><p>"Um, what was the name of the patient, Sir Lancelot?"</p><p>"Name? Something like Mainwaring or Higson or Simmonds I should think. How the blazes would I know?"</p><p>I froze, struggling to frame a WHERE clause string that would encapsulate this bewildering range of monikers. Even with liberal use of LIKE and the % wildcard, it was quite beyond me. Fortunately, Sister took pity on me and consulted her clipboard again. "The cholecystectomy patient was 'William Clark,' without an 'e.'" </p><p>"Just as I said," said Sir Lancelot complacently. I altered the SQL </p><blockquote><p>WHERE LNAME="Clark" AND FNAME="William"</p></blockquote><p>and was just about to hit the Enter key, when...</p><p>"Take you filthy hands off my machine!" thundered Sir Lancelot. I complied with more speed than dignity. "Can anybody tell me what he's doing wrong?"</p><p>"Doesn't he need a JOIN?" A fellow student took advantage of my confusion to score brownie points. Sandra Lomas had no difficult at all with SQL, and was a genius with imperative languages like Java, too. She would definitely go far. There was already talk of her being surgeon material.</p><p>"That's correct, Miss Lomas. The VASC_PATIENTS table contains nothing of interest to us. Of course he needs a join to the OP_OBSERVATIONS table. That's where we'll find if Mr. Clark's SATS dropped below 50 per centum. And what sort of join?" He swung back to me.</p><p>"Um..." In my panic, there suddenly seemed to be dozens of different types of joins in SQL: inner and outer and left and right and full. Nothing for it but to guess. "Is it a CROSS JOIN?"</p><p>Sir Lancelot looked as if he were going to burst his bow tie. "'Is it a CROSS JOIN?' he says! I have never heard anything like it in my life. No, it is bloody well not a CROSS JOIN. The only time, boy, that you will ever need a CROSS JOIN is when you self-join the list of teams while preparing the fixtures list for the rugby club." He got a sycophantic laugh. "Can you help us, Miss Lomas?"</p><p>"An inner join with an additional restriction in the WHERE clause to limit the observations to the last two days?"</p><p>"Quite right, Miss Lomas. Perhaps you had better take over at the keyboard. Boy, while she does that, can I have a word in your shell-like." He beckoned me away from the group, into the corridor by the sluicing room, and addressed me in a faux whisper that could easily be heard in geriatrics:</p><p>"Are you sure medicine is the right career for you, boy? You don't really seem to have the aptitude..."</p><p><b>DDJ</b></p></body></html>
