The acronym SSEWBA stands for "someday soon everything will be acronyms." In this puzzle, that day has arrived. Your job is to match the acronyms (used in chat, e-mail, and elsewhere) in the first list with the names in the second list. Uh, no, the acronyms don't stand for the names. That would be too easy. But each acronym is related to one of the names in some way. The connection may be obvious or obscure, fair or devious, but there is a connection. The hints at the bottom of the page may help, or they may not. It's strictly FYA, so GA and HF!</p><p>A.	AWOL	1.	Alexander B.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>B.	DEC	2.	Berkeley B.</p><p>C.
