The Madrid Platform plugs into Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) and provides native XML document management, user management, collaboration (asynchronous and synchronous), and workflow models. You can create applications using a collection of Java classes for managing security, presence, versioning, presentation, and user extensible schemas. The Madrid Platform is available under the LGPL open-source license.</p><p>Akiva Corp.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>1901 Camino Vida Roble, Suite 115</p><p>Carlsbad, CA 92008</p><p>http://www.madrid-project.org/</p><p>ActiveState has released the Tcl Dev Kit 3.0, including enhanced code coverage for thoroughly testing applications; true time-based code profiling ensures that code bottlenecks are easily identified for optimal performance; and a new static analysis cross-reference tool for revealing code dependencies. The standard deployment mechanisms for Tcl now have a new cross-platform Virtual File System Explorer that enables the visual inspection of Starkits and Starpacks contents, ensuring the existence of correct components and versions while saving time and avoiding deployment problems.</p><p>ActiveState</p><p>#400 - 580 Granville Street</p><p>Vancouver, BC</p><p>Canada V6C 1W6 </p><p>604-484-6800</p><p>http://www.activestate.com/</p><p></p><p>Python 2.3.3 has been released, fixing several bugs including errors with weakrefs and the cyclic garbage collector. No new features have been added.
