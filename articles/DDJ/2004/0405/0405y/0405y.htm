Understand is a suite of tools that parse source code to reverse engineer, automatically document, calculate code metrics, and help you understand, navigate, and maintain source code that has grown too large for one person to know. Understand for Java offers code navigation using a detailed cross reference, a syntax-colorizing smart editor, and a variety of graphical reverse engineering views.</p><p>Scientific Toolworks Inc.</p><p>321 N.

Previously available only to Delphi/C++Builder developers, the suite has been rewritten in Microsoft Visual C++, and is now available to any development environment including Microsoft VisualBasic, Microsoft Visual C++, Microsoft Visual C#, Borland Delphi/C++Builder, Sybase PowerBuilder, and Intel C++ for Windows. A built-in BSD Packet Filtering engine boosts performance.</p><p>MicroOLAP Technologies LLC</p><p>208 West State Street</p><p>Trenton, NJ 08608-1002</p><p>http://www.microolap.com/</p><p>JNetDirect has introduced JSQLMapper, a bidirectional data mapping tool that eliminates the need to construct custom code in order to bring relational data into XML format. Through a graphic interface, you can access immediate support for create, read, update, and delete operations. JSQLMapper provides a data-mapping editor that lets you visually design the relational data to XML mappings that are executed by a runtime engine. The mapping editor allows the creation of arbitrarily complex mappings that can be used to express intricate relationships between relational tables and XML schemas.</p><p>JNetDirect Inc.</p><p>12801 Worldgate Drive, Suite 500</p><p>Herndon, VA 20170</p><p>571-203-7275</p><p>http://www.jnetdirect.com/</p><p>CGIScripter 1.73 from .com Solutions aims to improve developer productivity for heterogeneous database installations by generating Perl CGI scripts for six database servers: MySQL, Oracle, Access, SQL Server, Sybase, and DB2. Perl CGI scripts are generated for IIS web servers running on Windows and Apache web servers running on UNIX, Linux, or MacOS X. CGIScripter also now supports HTML checkboxes on HTML web forms, letting you create web survey forms that write data directly into database tables for any supported database.</p><p>.com Solutions Inc.</p><p>3984 Washington Boulevard, #334</p><p>Fremont, CA 94538</p><p>510-490-3482</p><p>http://www.cgiscripter.net/</p><p>JetBrains has released Version 4.0 of its IntelliJ IDEA Java IDE. Highlights of the new release include new productivity features such as on-the-fly local code inspection during error analysis, enhanced code completion, and intention actions; a new GUI Designer with intelligent runtime layout positioning and automated internal UI code; integrated CVS source code management; BEA WebLogic Server integration; an open API for the Program Structure Interface; enhanced code editing; and support for Java Generics.</p><p>JetBrains</p><p>1670 So.

Document! X 4.0 automatically produces technical documentation and online help for Microsoft .NET Framework assemblies, COM components, Visual Basic .NET, Visual Basic for Applications source code, and XSD Schemas. Document! X 4.0 introduces full-page-edit and visual comment designers for Visual C# .NET and Visual Basic .NET source code that lets you directly edit source comments within a preview of the generated documentation. Also new in the current release is documentation of XSD Schemas, including full graphical schema diagrams.</p><p>Innovasys Ltd.</p><p>Westowe, Chelston Road,</p><p>Torquay, Devon, </p><p>United Kingdom TQ2 6PU</p><p>+44-1803-690340</p><p>http://www.innovasys.com/</p><p>Shoptalk Systems' Liberty BASIC 4.0, a Windows BASIC programming language that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. Liberty BASIC has a text editor with pull-down menus, color-coded syntax highlighting, and a "run" button for executing programs immediately after they're written. Liberty BASIC also includes an integrated debugger that lets you step through each program instruction and pinpoint any logic problems. The program's debugger includes an expression evaluator. Liberty BASIC comes with a tutorial and reference guide.</p><p>Shoptalk Systems</p><p>P.O.

This technique is useful whenever a program is modified during the development process or ported to a different environment, such as moving the program to a new platform or during system upgrades. VSGuard tests whether the program performs the same task as a previous version, and provides tools to isolate any differences, down to an individual line in the source code. VSGuard does not require large trace files, and is fully integrated with Visual Studio .NET.</p><p>GuardSoft Pty Ltd.</p><p>2 Alfred Street </p><p>South Caulfield, Victoria, </p><p>Australia, 3162</p><p>+61-3-990-51183</p><p>http://www.guardsoft.com/</p><p><b>DDJ</b></p><hr></body></html>
