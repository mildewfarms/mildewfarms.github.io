<h2>Heron</h2>

<p>The method of using AOP to declare new types and the crosscut macro came about as a proof of concept for the inclusion of AOP techniques in the Heron programming language. Heron is a multiparadigm, general-purpose language influenced heavily by Pascal and C++, which is designed to make it easier and faster to develop correct, scalable, and efficient software. The Heron specification is available online at http://www.heron-language.com/. I am currently building a Heron-to-C++ translator written in Heron.</p>
