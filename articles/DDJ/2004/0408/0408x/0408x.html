<p>Visual Numerics is offering the IMSL Thread Safe Fortran Numerical Library for application development in high-performance computing organizations. Complete thread safety lets you call the same routine multiple times in the program and have multiple instances of the routine running on multiple threads, improving performance and simplifying programming. The IMSL Thread Safe Fortran Numerical Library is currently available on Sun Solaris (32 and 64 bit) and IBM AIX (64 bit).</p>

<p>Innovartis has launched DB Ghost 3.0, a database change-management system for SQL Server users. The DB Ghost process involves scripting out your entire production database's schema and static data into individual scripts, using the DB Ghost Scripter, and adding these into your source-management system. From that point on, to make a change, you check out the relevant script, make the amendments, execute it against your development database, do unit testing/bug fixing, and check it back in when you're finished. DB Ghost then verifies that all the scripts compile with no dependency errors, and makes the necessary changes to the target database to ensure that it matches the scripts.</p>

<p>N8 Systems has debuted N8 Archetype, which lets business analysts describe requirements in English text and see them represented as UML use case and activity diagrams. Provided as a subscription-based online service, Archetype offers a dual-view interface that uses Microsoft's Word and Visio. Text in Word describing business processes is transformed into Visio diagrams of an existing or desired system, filtering out ambiguities in the process.</p>
