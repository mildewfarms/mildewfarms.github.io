      <td>The same WEP key is installed at every mobile client for
associating with an AP. In other words, every mobile client is using
the same password to authenticate themselves.<br>
WEP key management due to staff attrition or lost of mobile clients
requires updating the WEP key on each mobile client and AP. This is a
network administration nightmare.</td>

understood by eavesdroppers?</td>
      <td>The Initiation Vector (IV) used in the RC4 cipher in WEP is
sent as plain text and is repeated in a busy WLAN every few hours. By
capturing frames containing the same IV, one can use XOR to deduce the
WEP key and then gain illegal access to the network.<br>
There are open source software such as WEPCrack and AirSnort that can
monitor WLAN traffic and deduce the WEP key Temporary Key Integrity
Protocol (TKIP) automatically.</td>

      <td rowspan="1">Data integrity is provided by a 4-byte Integrity
Check Value (ICV) that is appended to the 802.11 payload and encrypted
with WEP.<br>
Although the ICV is encrypted, one can use cryptanalysis to change bits
in the encrypted payload and update the encrypted ICV without being
detected by the receiver.</td>
