<h1>Building a Lightweight  JMS Provider</h1>
<p><i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i> June, 2004</p>
<h2>Here's a JMS provider that works in a single Java Virtual Machine</h2>

<h3>By Eric J. Bruno</h3>

<hr>


<p>When writing Java applications, I often need a messaging system, even if the application runs within a single Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Almost any application can improve its design by taking advantage of named message queues or the anonymity of publish/ subscribe messaging, both of which are supported by the Java Message Service (JMS). Unfortunately, most JMS providers are bundled as part of a J2EE application server, making them big, difficult to setup and administer, and potentially expensive. This is neither practical nor efficient for use in standalone Java applications, never mind applets.</p>

<p>In this article, I present a JMS provider that is both lightweight in size and overhead&#151;but not in features. Because of its small size (41 KB), it is useful within both Java applets and applications. </p>

<p>Full-featured JMS Providers are implemented as enterprise servers. This means they support reliable, guaranteed, message delivery across LANs, WANs, and even the Internet. Most JMS providers support two-phase commit transactions, meaning they can take part in distributed ACID transactions involving databases and other remote transaction systems.</p>

<p>This industrial strength messaging comes with a price in the form of cost, size, and complexity, all of which are reasonable for projects with enterprise requirements. However, any one of these characteristics makes JMS infeasible for more straightforward standalone Java applications and applets. Unfortunately, this means that your application or applet misses out on the object-oriented characteristics of communication that JMS offers. </p>
<h3>The Lightweight JMS Provider </h3>

<p>Most applications can make use of JMS's publish/subscribe and point-to-point messaging without requiring support for persistent messages and transactions. For instance, JMS-Light, the lightweight JMS provider I present here, supports JMS 1.1 features such as publish/subscribe, point-to-point message queues, synchronous and asynchronous messaging, request reply, durable subscriptions, queue browsers, all JMS message types (<i>TextMessage</i>, <i>ObjectMessage</i>, <i>MapMessage</i>, <i>ByteMessage</i>, <i>StreamMessage</i>), and multithreaded clients.  </p>

<p>JMS-Light doesn't support enterprise features, such as persistent messages, transactions, message selectors, client-based message acknowledgment, inter-JVM messaging, or JNDI. </p>

<p>The most convenient feature of JMS-Light is that it requires no administration. Your application simply imports the 41-KB JAR file and creates topic and queue destinations on the fly. No installation or prior destination setup is required.</p>

<p>A true JMS provider is implemented as a process accessible through a JNDI server either built-in or separate. JNDI lets applications connect to the JMS provider at runtime, eliminating compile-time dependencies. <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a> illustrates the use of JNDI to connect to a JMS provider.</p>

<p>JMS-Light does not support JNDI, as it would add too much overhead. Instead, the singleton class <i>JMSLight </i>simulates JNDI to make the connection code similar. Being a singleton, it provides a central point for the creation and lookup for destinations within a process. <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a> shows how to connect to JMS-Light.</p>

<p>The code to get the <i>ConnectionFactory</i> object is similar in both listings. For JMS-Light, the lookup method is called on the <i>JMSLight </i>Singleton object instead of the JNDI <i>Context</i> object of a true JMS provider. This design is intentional as it is easier to migrate the application code to a true JMS provider in the future.</p>
<h3>JMS Destinations</h3>

<p>With full-featured JMS providers, destinations can be created in advance, or on-the-fly at runtime. For destinations created in advance, JMS applications use JNDI to locate them. Since JMS-Light doesn't support JNDI, destinations must be created on-the-fly, like this:</p>

<blockquote>
import javax.jms.*;<br>

import com.LJMS.*;<br>

JMSLight ljms = JMSLight.getInstance();<br>

// ...<br>

// Create the "Orders" Queue<br>

Queue q1 = session.createQueue("Orders");<br>

// ...<br>

// Lookup the "Orders" Queue<br>

Queue q2 = (Queue)ljms.lookup("Orders");
</blockquote>


<p>JMS-Light stores the destinations in two <i>HashMaps</i>&#151;one for queues and another for topics. Since <i>JMSLight</i> is a Singleton, the lookup method returns the same destination objects to all classes that call it. When the lookup method is called, both <i>HashMaps</i> are checked for the existence of the requested resource. Therefore, the name must be unique for both destination types; there cannot be both a queue and topic of the same name. </p>
<h3>Domain-Specific Versus  Generic JMS Classes</h3>

<p>JMS defines generic interfaces and those specific to the message domain being used. <a name="rt1"></a><a href="0406gt1.html">Table 1</a> lists the generic and domain-specific JMS interfaces.</p>

<p>The use of the generic interfaces was introduced with JMS 1.1. Before that, these interfaces existed, but JMS apps had to use the domain-specific interfaces. This change results in application code that's more object oriented, as it hides the implementation details of the message domain.</p>

<p>JMS 1.1 specifies that providers must support generic interfaces and domain-specific interfaces equally, providing backward compatibility. JMS-Light uses a combination of inheritance and static methods to provide this support. </p>

<p>The classes that implement the domain-specific interfaces extend the classes that implement the generic interfaces. When domain-specific methods need to be called, the base classes call static methods on the domain-specific subclasses. These methods are safely accessible from the base class and no down-casting needs to be done. <a name="rf1"></a><a href="0406gf1.html">Figure 1</a> is a class diagram for JMS-Light's <i>Session</i> and <i>TopicSession</i> implementation classes. <a name="rf2"></a><a href="0406gf2.html">Figure 2</a> is a sequence diagram that contrasts the use of the generic JMS interfaces versus the domain-specific JMS interfaces.</p>
<h3>Implementing Connections</h3>

<p>The JMS <i>Connection</i> interface is a thread-safe entry point to the JMS provider used in creating JMS Sessions. The<i> JMSLightConnection</i> class implements the <i>Connection</i> interface in JMS-Light. Each <i>JMSLightConnection</i> object maintains a list of its active <i>Session</i> objects (those created by that <i>Connection</i>) within a <i>Vector.</i> The <i>Session</i> objects are created and added to this list when the <i>createSession</i> method is called. </p>

<p>The class <i>JMSLightTopicConnection</i> extends the <i>JMSLightConnection</i> class and implements the <i>TopicConnection</i> interface. This interface defines two methods&#151;<i>createConnectionConsumer</i> and <i>createTopicSession</i>&#151;in addition to the base <i>Connection</i> interface. The <i>createConnection- Consumer</i> method differs from the base interface's method only in that it takes a <i>Topic</i> as opposed to a generic <i>Destination</i> object as its first parameter. This method calls the base class's implementation via the keyword <i>super</i>. The base class implementation checks the type of the <i>Destination</i> object  because it can be called from either a topic or queue connection; see <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>createTopicSession</i> method creates a domain-specific <i>TopicSession</i> object and adds it to the list of Sessions. This method cannot defer to the base class implementation of <i>createSession</i> because it must return a <i>TopicSession</i> object.</p>

<p>The implementation of <i>JMSLightQueueConnection</i> is similar to that of <i>JMSLightTopicConnection</i>. The only differences lie in the creation of the domain-specific <i>QueueSession</i> objects, as opposed to <i>TopicSession</i> objects. </p>
<h3>Implementing Sessions</h3>

<p>The <i>JMSLightSession</i> object implements the single-threaded <i>Session</i> interface. The main purpose of this class is to create <i>MessageProducer</i>, <i>MessageConsumer</i>, and <i>Message</i> objects. </p>

<p>A JMS client calls the <i>createProducer</i> and <i>createConsumer</i> methods with a generic <i>Destination</i> parameter, among others. The destination type is checked using the <i>instanceof</i> keyword, and the correct domain-specific static method is called. </p>

<p>For example, if the <i>createProducer</i> method is called where the destination object is a <i>Topic</i> instance, the static method <i>_createPublisher</i> is called on the <i>JMSLightTopicSession</i> class.</p>

<p>The <i>JMSLightTopicSession</i> class implements the domain-specific <i>TopicSession</i> interface. This class inherits most of its base implementation from the <i>JMSLightSession</i> class, and implements the publish/subscribe-specific methods: <i>createPublisher</i>, <i>createSubscriber</i>, <i>createTopic</i>, <i>createTemporaryTopic</i>, <i>createDurableSubscriber</i>, and <i>unsubscribe</i>.</p>

<p>For each method, except for <i>unsubscribe</i>, the implementation is deferred to the base class. The base class then calls the correct static methods on the domain-specific class, determined by the type of destination passed to it. When the <i>_createPublisher</i> or <i>_createSubsciber</i> static methods are called on <i>JMSLightTopicSession</i>, a <i>JMSLightTopicPublisher</i> or <i>JMSLightTopicSubscriber</i> object is created, respectively. </p>

<p>The <i>createDurableSubscriber</i> and <i>unsubscribe</i> methods work as a pair. A durable subscriber is one that receives all published messages for a given topic, even if that subscriber is not listening when the messages are sent. </p>

<p>In addition to creating a normal <i>TopicSubscriber</i> object, the <i>createDurableSubscriber</i> method sets the object's subscription name to that provided, and the durable property to True. A call is then made to the <i>Topic</i> object's method, <i>addDurableSubscriber</i>, and the <i>Topic</i> is added to a list of durable subscriptions within the <i>TopicSession</i> object.</p>

<p>The durable subscription can be terminated via a call to the <i>JMSLightTopicSession.unsubscribe</i> method, at which time missed messages will no longer be saved for this subscriber. Internally, this method performs these steps:</p>



<ol>
  <li><i>TopicSubscriber</i> is located within the Session's list of consumers. </li>
  <li>The<i> Topic</i> is located from the Session's list of durable subscriptions.</li>
  <li>The <i>TopicSubscriber</i>'s durable property is set to False.</li>
  <li>The <i>TopicSubscriber</i> is removed from the <i>Topic</i>'s list of durable subscribers.</li>
</ol>



<p>The <i>JMSLightQueueSession</i> class is similar to <i>JMSLightTopicSession</i> except:</p>



<ul>
  <li>There is no support for durable subscriptions. Because of the nature of a message queue, where each message is stored until delivered to a consumer, there is no need for a special, durable consumer.</li>
  <li>There is the addition of a browser component. The <i>QueueBrowser</i> is a special consumer that peeks at messages that exist on a queue without removing them. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementing Producers</h3>

<p>The <i>JMSLightMessageProducer</i> class implements the JMS <i>MessageProducer</i> interface. This class implements the various send methods for sending messages to a topic or a queue. Clients can use this interface to send messages to destinations without needing to know if the destination is a topic or queue.</p>

<p>JMS-Light supports nonpersistent messages, and all messages are sent with the same priority. Messages can be given a "time to live" value that indicates when the message expires. If a message expires before delivery to a consumer, the message is destroyed and not delivered.</p>

<p>The <i>send</i> method is where all the action takes place in the <i>JMSLightMessageProducer</i> class. When called, this method sets the given message's properties, such as a message timestamp, and ensures that stream-based messages (such as a <i>BytesMessage</i> or <i>StreamMessage</i>) are reset.</p>

<p>Once the message is ready to be delivered, its destination type is checked. If the destination is a <i>Topic</i>, the <i>JMSLightTopicPublisher</i> class's static <i>_publish</i> method is called. If the destination is a <i>Queue</i>, the <i>JMSLightQueueSender</i> class's static <i>send</i> method is called. The domain-specific semantics of message delivery are handled in these static methods.</p>

<p>The static <i>_publish</i> method of the <i>JMSLightTopicPublisher</i> class defers all the work of publishing a message to the <i>Topic</i> destination class. The <i>_publish</i> method is called regardless of whether clients call send on the <i>MessageProducer</i> interface, or publish on the <i>TopicPublisher</i> interface. </p>

<p>As with the <i>JMSLightTopicPublisher </i>class, the <i>static _send</i> method on the <i>JMSLightQueueSender</i> class defers the message delivery to the <i>Queue</i> destination class itself. The <i>_send</i> method is called regardless of whether clients call send on the <i>MessageProducer</i> interface, or send on the <i>QueueSender</i> interface.</p>
<h3>Implementing Consumers</h3>

<p>The <i>JMSLightMessageConsumer </i>class implements the generic JMS interface, <i>MessageConsumer</i>. This class implements the receive methods to support synchronous client message delivery. It also stores a client's <i>MessageListener</i> object, if provided, to support asynchronous message delivery. Both domain-specific classes, <i>JMSLightTopicSubscriber</i> and <i>JMSLightQueueReceiver</i>, defer to this base class for client message delivery.</p>

<p>When a message is to be delivered, the domain-specific destination class calls the <i>onMessage</i> method on the <i>consumer</i> class. The method, <i>onMessage</i> (<a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a>) checks to see if the JMS client has provided a <i>MessageListener</i> for asynchronous message delivery. If there is no <i>MessageListener</i>, this method checks for a blocked client thread awaiting synchronous message delivery. </p>

<p>When a client calls the synchronous method, receive, the call blocks until a message arrives or the call times out, as specified by the caller. The calling thread is blocked via the Java Thread synchronization method, <i>System.wait</i>. The thread is signaled via a call to <i>System.notify </i>when a message arrives or a time out occurs. The domain-specific <i>JMSLightTopicSubscriber</i> and <i>JMSLightQueueReceiver</i> classes perform the thread signaling. <a name="rf3"></a><a href="0406gf3.html">Figure 3</a> illustrates the sequence of calls for synchronous message delivery.</p>

<p>Asynchronous message delivery is straightforward. When a message arrives, the <i>JMSLightMessageConsumer</i> class calls the <i>onMessage</i> method on the JMS client's <i>MessageListener</i> object. <a name="rf4"></a><a href="0406gf4.html">Figure 4</a> illustrates the sequence of calls for asynchronous message delivery.</p>
<h3>Implementing Destinations</h3>

<p>The <i>JMSLightDestination</i> class implements the <i>Destination</i> interface and defines two nested classes, <i>ProducerNode</i> and <i>ConsumerNode</i>. The <i>Vector</i> member variables&#151;producers and consumers&#151;hold references to these classes, which in turn hold references to actual <i>MessageProducers</i> and <i>MessageConsumers</i> for the destination. <a name="rf5"></a><a href="0406gf5.html">Figure 5</a> shows the relationship between the destination, and its producers and consumers.</p>

<p>A reference to the <i>Connection</i> object for each producer and consumer is stored to check if the connection has been started. A consumer's connection must have been started, or no messages are delivered to it. The domain-specific destination classes, <i>JMSLightTopic</i> and <i>JMSLightQueue</i>, handle the actual message delivery to each client of the destination. </p>

<p>The <i>JMSLightTopic</i> class extends <i>JMSLightDestination</i>, and contains code specific to <i>Topic</i>-based message delivery. Durable subscribers are stored within the "consumers" member variable, but are also tracked within a <i>HashMap</i> named <i>durableSubscriptions</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>JMSLightTopic</i> class defines a nested class, <i>Notifier</i>, which extends the Java <i>Thread</i> class. With each message that is published on a topic, an object of type <i>Notifier</i> is created. This object runs in its own thread and attempts delivery of the message to every <i>Topic</i> subscriber via the following steps:</p>



<ol>
  <li><i>Notifier</i> calls the <i>JMSLightTopic.notifySubscribers</i> method, which iterates through all of the destination's subscribers within the vector.</li>
  <li>Each subscriber's connection is checked to see if it is started. If so, a call is made to <i>JMSLightTopicSubscriber.onMessage</i>. If this call succeeds, processing continues with the next subscriber. If the <i>onMessage</i> call fails due to an exception, redelivery is attempted two more times before moving on to the next subscriber.</li>
  <li>After all of the current subscribers have received the message, the thread terminates.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Durable Subscriptions</h3>

<p>When the <i>Notifier</i> object has completed message delivery, the message must be stored for each durable subscriber that is not currently listening. The <i>JMSLightTopic </i>class defines a nested class, <i>DurableSubscriberNode</i>, to store these messages along with other durable subscription data. The method, <i>saveDurableMessage()</i>, stores the published message for each durable subscription whose subscriber is not currently listening. </p>

<p>Saved messages are delivered to a durable subscriber when it becomes active again, which occurs when the subscriber calls <i>addDurableSubscriber</i>. An object of class <i>DurableNotifier</i> is created to handle the delivery of all missed messages to this subscriber.</p>

<p>The durable subscription is maintained until that subscriber calls the <i>unsubscribe </i>method on the <i>Topic</i> class. When the call is made, the destination clears out any trace of the durable subscriber, including any undelivered messages.</p>

<p>The <i>JMSLightQueue</i> class extends <i>JMSLightDestination</i>, and leverages the storage of producers and consumers from that base class. This domain-specific class stores the actual messages sent to it in an object of class <i>LinkedList</i>, which works like a FIFO queue itself.</p>

<p><i>JMSLightQueue</i> defines the nested class <i>Notifier</i>, just as the <i>JMSLightTopic</i> class does. However, only one <i>Notifier</i> object is created for the lifetime of the queue. This differs significantly from the <i>JMSLightTopic</i> implementation, where a <i>Notifier</i> object is created with each message that is sent.</p>

<p>The queue's <i>Notifier</i> object is told to sleep by calling the method <i>Object.wait</i>. When a producer sends a message, it's placed within the <i>LinkedList </i>of messages for that queue and the <i>Notifier</i> thread is signaled. </p>
<h3>Implementing JMS Messages</h3>

<p>JMS defines many message interfaces, all of which extend the base <i>Message</i> interface. The base interface defines a JMS message's header and properties, as well as the acknowledge method for client-based message delivery acknowledgment. In general, the message header properties are used for message routing. The message data or payload, as it is referred to, is defined by the more-derived message interfaces. Message properties and payload data can only be set before the message is sent.</p>

<p>The two most commonly used message interfaces are <i>TextMessage</i> and <i>ObjectMessage,</i> which define a Java <i>String</i> or <i>Object</i> as the message payload, respectively. The remaining three message interfaces are <i>Stream</i> based, meaning their methods are based on the <i>java.io.DataOutputStream</i> and <i>java.io.DataInputStream</i> classes.</p>

<p>The <i>JMSLightMessage</i> class implements the <i>Message</i> interface and defines the message states, types, header, and properties. The JMS-Light message header consists of: Message ID (unique per message); message type (pub/sub or queue); message state (pending, sent, or delivered); message priority (JMS-Light does not support varying message priorities and defaults to the JMS "normal" priority of four); <i>Destination</i> (<i>Queue</i> or <i>Topic</i> object); optional reply-to <i>Destination</i> for request/reply support; message delivery mode (JMS-Light supports only nonpersistent message delivery); optional correlation ID to link one message to another; message timestamp and expiration values, and a flag that indicates whether the message is being redelivered due to a potential failure on a previous delivery attempt</p>

<p>A JMS client can define application-specific message properties, which are name-value pairs. This provides a way for clients to customize a message's header. Each message property can be <i>boolean</i>, <i>byte</i>, <i>short</i>, <i>int</i>, <i>long</i>, <i>float</i>, <i>double</i>, or <i>String</i>. </p>

<p>JMS-Light defines a class named <i>CollectionContainer</i>, which stores the message properties. This class stores all properties in a Java <i>Hashtable,</i> which supports name-value pairs. JMS defines rules for message property retrieval, such as being able to retrieve any property as a <i>String,</i> regardless of what type it was when added to the <i>Hashtable</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>JMSLightTextMessage</i> class extends the <i>JMSLightMessage</i> class, implementing the <i>TextMessage</i> interface. This class leverages all of the base class functionality and adds the ability to set <i>String</i> as the message payload. The <i>JMSLightObjectMessage</i> class lets clients set any Java object that implements the <i>java.io.Serializable</i> interface as the message payload. </p>

<p>The <i>JMSLightBytesMessage</i> class extends <i>JMSLightMessage</i> and implements the <i>BytesMessage</i> interface. Because of the similarities in the interfaces, the <i>JMSLightStreamMessage</i> class extends the <i>JMSLightBytesMessage</i> class. <a name="rf6"></a><a href="0406gf6.html">Figure 6</a> shows this relationship.</p>

<p>The <i>JMSLightBytesMessage</i> class exists mainly for compatibility with external systems such as databases. The data is written and then read as one blob of bytes, all at once. Therefore, this class does not maintain a cursor-like position variable for every read.</p>

<p>For the <i>JMSLightStreamMessage</i> class, a cursor-like position variable is strictly maintained. With the <i>StreamMessage</i> interface, clients typically make multiple calls to write data into the stream, and later read data from the stream. Because of the ability to read and write raw bytes in the middle of the stream, a variable is maintained that tracks the byte position within the stream for each read.</p>

<p>In the end, the <i>JMSLightStreamMessage</i> class overrides all of the <i>readX</i> methods of the <i>JMSLightBytesMessage</i> class, simply to increment the position variable by the number of bytes read. The bulk of the implementation is leveraged from the base class.</p>

<p>The <i>MapMessage</i> class is different from the other <i>Message</i> interfaces in that data is stored as name-value pairs. This should sound familiar; it's identical to the way the <i>Message</i> interface stores application-defined header properties. Because of the similarities, the <i>JMSLightMapMessage</i> class leverages the <i>CollectionContainer</i> class for its payload, as well as its properties.</p>
<h3>Using JMS-Light</h3>

<p>To use JMS-Light, simply import the file, ljms.jar (available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 3) and call <i>getInstance</i> on the Singleton <i>JMSLight</i> class. <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a> outlines the code needed to connect to JMS-Light. JMS-Light simulates JNDI to make transitioning your client code to a real JMS provider relatively easy.</p>

<p>The sample JMS order-system application I present here (available electronically) shows how to use JMS-Light. The application consists of a main class, <i>OrderSystem</i>, with two nested classes&#151;<i>Supplier</i> and <i>Customer</i>. Both nested classes extend <i>Thread</i> and run in their own threads when created.</p>

<p><a name="rl5"></a><a href="#l5">Listing Five</a> shows that the <i>OrderSystem</i> class creates two destinations&#151;a sales notification topic and order queue. These destinations exist within the Singleton <i>JMSLight</i> object and are used by both the <i>Supplier</i> and <i>Customer</i> classes.</p>

<p>Working with <i>Topic</i> destinations in JMS-Light is almost exactly the same as with a real JMS provider. Again, the only difference is the lack of JNDI support. In the order-system application, the <i>Supplier</i> class creates a publisher for the sale notification topic using code similar to this:</p>

<blockquote>
salesTopic = (Destination)ljms.lookup  	       ( SALES_TOPIC_NAME );<br>

connFact   = (ConnectionFactory)<br>

	ljms.lookup("ConnectionFactory");<br>

Connection conn = <br>

               connFact.createConnection();<br>

Session session = conn.createSession    		                                  (false,Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
</blockquote>

MessageProducer saleProducer =  	session.createProducer(salesTopic);
</blockquote>


<p>The topic is looked up through the Singleton <i>JMSLight</i> object, and from there, a JMS connection and session is established as with any JMS provider. A publisher component is created for the topic by calling the <i>createProducer</i> method on the JMS session.</p>

<p>In this code, a <i>TextMessage</i> object is created via the JMS session and then published via a call to <i>send</i> on the <i>MessageProducer</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
// The sale notification is a JMS TextMessage<br>

TextMessage msg = <br>

                session.createTextMessage();<br>

msg.setText( saleItems[ item++ ] );<br>

saleProducer.send( msg );
</blockquote>


<p>In the order-system app, the <i>Customer </i>class subscribes to the sale notification topic for asynchronous message delivery. As seen in <a name="rl6"></a><a href="#l6">Listing Six</a>, the <i>Customer</i> class implements the <i>MessageListener</i> interface by defining the <i>onMessage</i> method. A call is then made to <i>setMessageListener</i> on the <i>MessageConsumer</i> object. </p>

<p>The order-system application uses a JMS <i>Queue</i> to handle new order requests. I chose a queue for two main reasons: First, the order requests are stored until received; second, one (and only one) receiver processes each order. If I opted for a pub/sub topic and multiple subscriber threads were created for performance reasons, a single order would be processed multiple times. A queue ensures that this behavior will not occur.</p>

<p>In the sample code, the <i>Supplier</i> class creates a queue consumer and the <i>Customer</i> class creates a queue producer. The code for both the order producer and consumer is almost identical to the code for the sale notification topic. Both classes create producers and consumers using the generic JMS interfaces and, therefore, have no hard-coded knowledge of the destination types. This means, for example, the sale notification topic can be changed to a queue in the future without requiring changes to producer or consumer code.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Most Java applications will benefit from the lightweight-messaging infrastructure that JMS-Light provides. Using the messaging features of JMS-Light can improve the design of your applications.</p>
