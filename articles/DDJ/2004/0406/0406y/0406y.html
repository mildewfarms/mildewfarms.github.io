<h1>The Italian Job </h1>
<p><i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i> June, 2004</p>

<p>"First there was that whole <i>Godfather</i> thing," Gianni complained, "then HBO comes up with an Italian-American mobster who's seeing a psychiatrist, and now Dreamworks is developing some animated movie about gangster sharks with Italian names and accents."</p>

<p>"That's clearly gratuitous," I agreed. "Sharks aren't Italian."</p>

<p>"Plus, the characters all have big noses."</p>

<p>"Well, sharks do have big noses."</p>

<p>"That's not the point."</p>

<p>I thought of a good comeback about pointed noses, but a look at Gianni's noble Roman proboscis, not to mention the suspicious bulge under the armpit of his sharkskin suit, made me reconsider. I was talking with Gianni Mustacchi, director of the Marconi Action Front for Italian-Americans, a group organized to confront anti-Italian propaganda in the computer and electronics industries. But somehow he had slipped off into a diatribe on popular entertainment. I tried to pull him back in.</p>

<p>"Just exactly where is this anti-Italian propaganda in the tech industries?" I asked. "I'm not sure I've seen any."</p>

<p>"Where?" He looked aghast. "How about the shameful ignoring of the great Guglielmo Marconi? A Nobel prize winner, the father of radio, the godfather of wireless telegraphy, but does he get any recognition?"</p>

<p>I objected that a Nobel prize was pretty good recognition. "Besides, wasn't there some evidence that he didn't invent some of the things he claimed?"</p>

<p>He pounded his fist on the checkered tablecloth, making the lit candle in the fat chianti bottle rock menacingly. "Here's a guy, in 1901, he transmitted a Morse Code 'S' across the Atlantic, bouncing it off the ionosphere twice. He had to send an S; at that distance, he could only send dits, there wasn't enough power for dahs."</p>

<p>"Maybe so, but radio expert Jack Belrose has pretty convincingly argued that Marconi was just picking up dits of static," I said, "and the Supreme Patent Court of the U.S. concluded that Tesla was the true inventor of radio."</p>

<p>"Tesla!" His mustache quivered, and he forked a peevish mouthful of spaghetti.</p>

<p>"Have any Italians made more recent contributions to high tech?" I asked, sensing that if I didn't get him off the Marconi-Tesla theme, I might be making a personal visit to the transatlantic cable.</p>

<p>"Ha! How about Dan Stanzione of Bell Labs, or Mario Mazzolo of Cisco, or the crew at Logitech? And you have heard of Carly Fiorina, maybe?"</p>

<p>"The Michael Eisner of personal computers?" I quipped injudiciously.</p>

<p>"See what you do?" He aimed a loaded fork at me. "Here's a highly successful Italian-American woman, running HP, one of the biggest tech companies, turned her company around, managed a difficult merger, last year launched 158 new products. Why you gotta pick on the lady?"</p>

<p>"I admit she's impressive."</p>

<p>"Plus, she wears Armani. Italians rule. And they know their stuff when it comes to technology. It was an Italian writer, Umberto Eco, who first said, 'the Internet IS democracy.' Italian-born race-car driver Mario Andretti first identified the necessary management philosophy for high-tech companies: 'Se tutto &egrave; sotto controllo, stai andando troppo piano.'"</p>

<p>"Which means?"</p>

<p>"If it's not out of control, it's too slow. And Italian-American writer Edward DeBono really nailed the web-surfing experience when he wrote, 'Sto cercando, ma non voglio sapere che cosa finch&eacute; non l'ho trovata.'"</p>

<p>"Translation?"</p>

<p>"I'll know what I'm searching for when I find it. And 'La stupidit`a comunica in tempo reale,' which means 'Only the stupid communicate in real time': that was from Italian writer Giovanni Mariotti."</p>

<p>"Of course, we are communicating in real time," I pointed out.</p>

<p>"I don't feel any respect here," he said, pushing back his chair. "Watch yourself, Swaine. A clever paisano named Julius once said, 'Io non dimentico mai un volto, ma nel tuo caso, far˜ un'eccezione,' and that's what I say to you." And he left in an Italian huff.</p>

<p>After I got that translated, I was offended.</p>

<blockquote>
Lest any reader be offended: This was all in fun. The real Italian quotes are from <i>Webdixit</i> by Gianroberto Casaleggio (Il Sole 24 ORE S.p.A.; 2003); the bad English translations are by Google and me. Gianni Mustacchi and the Marconi Action Front for Italian-Americans do not exist, and there is, of course, no anti-Italian propaganda in the technology industries. I'm just trying to fill that gap.<br>
