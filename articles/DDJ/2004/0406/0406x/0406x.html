<p>Catalyst Systems has announced the release of its application build management tool, Openmake 6.3. The primary goal of Openmake is to remove the requirement for developers to perform any scripting at all&#151;no makefiles, no XML scripting for Ant, and no special Java classes are needed to perform builds within the IDE or externally by a build master. The new version includes a plug-in for the Eclipse IDE; the ability to dynamically generate Ant build scripts at build time; and integration with Visual Studio .NET.</p>

<p>The Numerical Algorithm Group's NAGWare f95 Compiler for Windows 4.2 supports the Fortran 95 language in its entirety, High Performance Fortran, legacy Fortran 77 code, and Fortran 2003 Standards for allocatable components and for IEEE Floating Point Exception Handling. The NAGWare f95 Compiler includes optional runtime checking of array bounds, pointer association, and procedure arguments. Automatic garbage collection is available as an option. Built-in modules provide an interface to Posix system calls such as GETARG and SYSTEM. To achieve portability, the NAGWare f95 Compiler uses C as its intermediate language, automatically invoking the host compiler to produce object code.</p>
