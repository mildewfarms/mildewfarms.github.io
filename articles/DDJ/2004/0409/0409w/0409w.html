<p>stake has developed the SmartRisk Analyzer, an automated solution for identifying security vulnerabilities in software applications. Using deep static analysis of the application binary code, SmartRisk Analyzer can map application control and data flow paths into a comprehensive security model. Scans are designed to find flaws related to improper use of programming languages and standard libraries, flaws that may result from the deployment platform on which the application runs, and other vulnerabilities such as input validation, command and script injection, and backdoors and malware.</p>

<p>JGsoft has introduced RegexBuddy, a Windows and Linux utility designed to help you learn, create, understand, test, use, and save regular expressions. With RegexBuddy, instead of typing regex tokens directly, you pick what you want from a descriptive menu. A tree of regex tokens keeps track of the pattern you have built, and the RegexBuddy tester and debugger lets you step through the search matches and get detailed reports about each match. The Windows version of RegexBuddy provides both a command-line interface and a COM automation interface. The Linux version has an API that uses standard input/output to provide the same functionality as the COM interface on Windows.</p>
