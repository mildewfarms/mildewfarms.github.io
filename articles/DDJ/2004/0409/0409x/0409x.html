"You're dressed for success, Bernie," I told myself, first because my name is Bernie and second because I was, in fact, outfitted with everything the successful 21st century B&amp;E artist needs for a night's work. B&amp;E: That's breaking and entering, a hobby of mine. How does the successful B&amp;E artist outfit him- (or her-; don't want to be sexist) self these days? De rigueur is plastic film gloves, flushable in an emergency, and a penlight flashlight of the sort that anyone might carry. I add a perfectly ordinary Palm handheld with a not-so ordinary program, four inches of two-strand insulated copper wire under the leather label on the beltline of my jeans, and something that looks like a credit card if you overlook the electrical contacts on the edge.

<p>In jeans, T-shirt, and hightops, I could pass for a jogger, say, or a programmer. From where I dropped off the car three blocks away, I was that jogger, taking advantage of the cool night air. Standing in front of the door at Blindside Enterprises, fitting my card in the slot, I was the programmer arriving for his 2am stint, obsessively tapping away at his Palm even as he unlocked the door.</p>

<p>The door clicked open and I slipped inside, returning card, wire, and Palm to their respective homes. I had officially entered the magic kingdom of Felonyland.</p>

<p>I wasn't sure how much time I had, so I didn't bother with corporate data as I shuffled through the CEO's desk and hard disk files. For personal data, e-mail and browser history are obvious places to check, as well as cookies from sites your target has visited. I had my hand in the cookie jar, so to speak, when things got all too personal.</p>

<p>"Hey! What are you doing in here?"</p>

<p>I forced my heart back down out of my nasal cavity and sized him up. In his sweatshirt, floppy hippie pants, and sandals with socks, I suspected that he was not the CEO, nor was he likely to be security. Still, he was brandishing a cell phone in an ominous way.</p>

<p>"I'm a burglar," I said. "I'm going through the boss's files to get some dirt on him."</p>

<p>He blinked twice and didn't press any buttons on the phone. Good so far.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to know how I got past the security system?" I didn't wait for an answer. "If you call it a security system. I've hacked way better card systems than this outfit's, let me tell you."</p>

<p>His pupils contracted. I had engaged his professional attention.</p>

<p>"Before you turn me in, maybe you'd like to know how I hacked it? You know that the security guard and the cops aren't going to be able to understand what I'm saying."</p>

<p>"Yeah. You better tell me all about it." He pointed at me sternly with his phone hand and sat down on the arm of a chair.</p>

<p>I showed him the card, the wire, and the Palm, and how they worked. He slid into the chair and started to launch the key program, but I stopped him.</p>

<p>"You're a hacker, I can see that," I said, and saw the look of pride he tried to conceal. "You know what I mean if I say this is Mission Impossible code?"</p>

<p>"You mean self destructing?"</p>

<p>"Affirmative." I thought that sounded Mission Impossiblish.</p>

<p>"So there's a password, right?"</p>

<p>I gave it to him.</p>

<p>It took him a few seconds to tire of trying out the program and then he was into the source code.</p>

<p>Source code. On a Palm.</p>

<p>"This is Lisp," he said incredulously. "You're running a Lisp interpreter on this thing."</p>

<p>"No other language could do what I want on this platform." I set the hook and prepared to tug it. "You know Paul Graham and Robert Morris wrote the first e-commerce toolkit in Lisp."</p>

<p>I could see the jolt as he took the hook. "Robert Morris? The legendary hacker?"</p>

<p>It took another 10 minutes to get safely out the back door, but I was really home free when he said that. Home free&#151;but without any revealing facts about the guy who had bought Foo Bar. What was I going to tell Swaine?</p>

<p>Continued next month.</p>
