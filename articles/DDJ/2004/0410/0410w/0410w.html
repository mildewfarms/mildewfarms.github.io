<p>Electric Cloud is shipping Electric Cloud 2.1, designed to speed software builds and improve network efficiency through peer-to-peer network communication, file compression, and support for multiCPU machines in the build cluster. At the core of Electric Cloud 2.1 is Electric Make, which is plug-compatible with existing Make-based build infrastructures so it can be deployed with little or no change to existing tools or environments. In order to ensure that parallel builds will not break, Electric Cloud has developed a dependency management system that monitors all files accessed during a build. Electric Cloud 2.1 records and reuses build dependency information, minimizing the Makefile maintenance required to achieve and maintain build performance.  </p>

<p>LPSolver (Linear Programming Solver) is a Solver Add-on for OpenOffice.org and StarOffice. LpSolver can be used to solve complex linear, mixed integer, and binary optimization problems. It consists of linear programming libraries at the back end and spreadsheet documents at the front end. It is tailored for handling large, complex, one-of-a-kind problems that may require many revisions to establish an accurate model. By eliminating the need to think about purely technical machine-specific problems such as address calculations, storage assignments, subroutine linkage, and input-output and flow control, LPSolver increases the time available for conceptualizing and running the model, and analyzing the results.</p>

<p>M7 is introducing NitroX for JSP, an Eclipse plug-in for Java developers building JSP-based web applications. When you begin new development or import an existing web application, NitroX scans the Java application logic, JSP files, Struts artifacts, web and configuration XML files, and resource bundles, building a database that is incrementally updated as you make changes to the web application. NitroX then provides the ability to debug all application layers starting with the JSP page, to step over JSP instructions in the page itself, to step into the code of a tag and debug into the Java layers used by the tag, to step into Struts artifact code, and to step back out to the page. </p>
