<h2>Dr. Ecco Solution</h2>
<h3>Solution to "Occam's Ringleaders," DDJ, September 2004.<b></b></h3>

<p><b></b></p>

<p>1. Liane showed that conspirators 2, 3, 6, and 11 could be the ringleaders. The responses of conspirator 1 involve ANDing all the inputs. No ODD function is applied. We represent this by:</p>

<blockquote>
C1: AND(C2, C3, C6, C11)<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The same holds for conspirators 5 and 9. Conspirator 4 performs an AND of 2 and 6 before ODDing that result with the inputs from 3 and 11. We could represent this by writing:</p>

<blockquote>
C4: ODD(C3, C11, AND(C2, C6)).<br>
C7: ODD(C3, C6, AND(C2, C11)).<br>
C8: ODD(C2, C3, C6, C11)<br>
C10: ODD(C6, AND(C2, C3, C11))<br>

</blockquote>

<p><b>2.</b> The ringleaders are: 3, 5, and 6. Here are the ways the others are derived:</p>

<blockquote>
C1: AND(3, 5, 6).<br>

</blockquote>

<p>This is also true for C2 and C11.</p>

<blockquote>
C4: ODD(3, 5, 6).<br>

</blockquote>

<p>This also holds for C7, C8, and C9.</p>

<blockquote>
C10: ODD(3, AND(5, 6)).<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Most of these use only one circuit element. This could be a sign of carelessness.</p>
