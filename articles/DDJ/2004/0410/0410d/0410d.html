<p>In recent years, international committees have been formed to produce Standards for C#, a new dialect of C++, and Microsoft's .NET Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) execution environment (a subset of the Common Language Runtime, or CLR). All three efforts are being conducted under the auspices of Ecma International (http://www.ecma-international.org/). These standards are being produced to encourage innovation, multiple implementations, and industry support. In this article, I report on the status of each effort and present an overview of the technical features involved.</p>
<h3>C# (Ecma TC39/TG2) </h3>

<p>Designed by Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde, C# debuted as part of a prerelease of Microsoft's .NET technology in July 2000. Although Microsoft's implementation of C# relies on the CLI for library and runtime support, other implementations of C# need not, provided they support an alternate way of getting at the minimum features required by the C# Standard. (In other words, as written, the C# Standard does not require the CLI.)</p>

<p>TG2 met monthly from November 2000 through September 2001. The resulting Standard is known as <i>ECMA-334, 2nd Edition-December 2002</i> and <i>ISO/IEC 23270:2003(E)</i>; see http://www.plumhall.com/ecma/index.html. (The Japanese national Standards body, JIS, has subsequently translated this Standard to Japanese.) In January 2003, work began on the next edition, and a revised Ecma Standard is expected in June 2005 with the ISO/IEC version to follow in September 2006. At least one beta implementation containing most (if not all) of the features in this became available in July. The main features of the C# (Ecma TC39/TG2) Standard are:</p>



<p><b>Generics.</b> C#'s generics feature allows classes, structs, interfaces, delegates, and methods to be parameterized by the types of data they store and manipulate. (Users of generics in Eiffel or Ada, or users of C++'s templates, should easily be able to understand generics in C#.) The most obvious kind of type to parameterize is that of a collection class (such as a stack); see <a name="re1"></a><a href="0410de1.html">Example 1</a>(a). To use this generic class, you specify the actual type of the elements you want, as in <a name="re1"></a><a href="0410de1.html">Example 1</a>(b). And given a user-defined type <i>Transaction</i>, you can create a stack of those, too; see <a name="re1"></a><a href="0410de1.html">Example 1</a>(c). It is important to note that a specific instantiation of a generic type is done at runtime.</p>

<p>The set of types that can be used to instantiate a generic type or method can be constrained. For instance, in <a name="re1"></a><a href="0410de1.html">Example 1</a>(d), the class has a constraint containing two <i>where</i> clauses. The first requires that the type provided for <i>KeyType</i> must implement the interfaces <i>IComparable</i> and <i>IEnumerable</i>, while the second requires that the type provided for <i>ElementType</i> be of type <i>Transaction</i> or a derived type thereof. Failure to match any constraint requirement results in a compilation error.</p>

<p>Like types, methods also can be generic. In <a name="re1"></a><a href="0410de1.html">Example 1</a>(e), for instance, this method lets you push multiple items onto a <i>Stack</i> of any kind, as in <a name="re1"></a><a href="0410de1.html">Example 1</a>(f). In many cases, the compiler can deduce the type of the method based on the types used in the argument list, allowing the &lt;...&gt; notation on the method call to be omitted.</p>

<p><b>Static Classes.</b> It is occasionally useful to define a class that is simply a home for a family of static methods and fields (<i>System.Math</i> is one such example). However, such a class must be made sealed and given a private "do-nothing" constructor to prevent instantiation. This can now be achieved by declaring the class to be static. A static class (<a name="re2"></a><a href="0410de2.html">Example 2</a>) is quite restricted and cannot: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Have an explicit base class (it implicitly inherits from type <i>object</i>).</li>
  <li>Implement any interfaces.</li>
  <li>Contain any operators.</li>
  <li>Contain <i>protected</i> or <i>protected internal</i> members.</li>
  <li>Contain anything other than static members.</li>
  <li>Be used as a base class.</li>
  <li>Be instantiated.</li>
</ul>



<p>A static class can be a member of a nonstatic class and vice versa.</p>

<p><b>Partial Declarations. </b>At times, the declaration of a type can grow to be large, making it difficult&#151;if not impractical&#151;to keep it in a single source file. (Programs that generate C# source certainly can face this problem.) By splitting a type declaration into multiple source files, each file can concentrate on one or more semi-independent concerns; see <a name="re3"></a><a href="0410de3.html">Example 3</a>. All of the parts of <i>Window</i> must be compiled together, and the member set is the union of all the members in all the parts.</p>

<p><b>Anonymous Methods.</b> In certain situations, you need a small method that will only be called once, at most. Rather than defining that method with a name, when that name is really unimportant, you can define it as an anonymous method, directly in-line, in the place in which it is needed. You do this by creating a delegate to an unnamed method. In <a name="re4"></a><a href="0410de4.html">Example 4</a>(a), you define an anonymous method that takes one argument of type <i>int</i> and returns a <i>bool</i>. In <a name="re4"></a><a href="0410de4.html">Example 4</a>(b), the anonymous method is created, and that creation expression is used as an argument in a call to the method <i>F</i>. Note that the body of the anonymous method can access the parameters and local variables of the method that encompasses it.</p>

<p><b>Iterators.</b> C# builds on the Clu programming language's notion of iterators via the <i>foreach</i> statement, which iterates over the elements of an enumerable collection. However, to be enumerable, a collection must have a parameterless <i>GetEnumerator</i> method that returns an enumerator. Enumerators can be difficult to implement, but with the help of iterators, the job can be significantly simplified.</p>

<p>An iterator is a statement block that yields an ordered sequence of value. <a name="re5"></a><a href="0410de5.html">Example 5</a> prints a simple multiplication table of the integers 1 through 10. Although the <i>FromTo</i> method is invoked only once to generate the enumerable <i>e</i>, <i>e.GetEnumerator()</i> is invoked multiple times (by the <i>foreach</i> statements) to generate multiple equivalent enumerators. These enumerators all encapsulate the iterator code specified in the declaration of <i>FromTo</i>. </p>

<p>Likewise, you can write <i>GetEnumerator</i> methods more easily for (generic and nongeneric) collection types such as stacks and linked lists.</p>
<h3>C++/CLI (Ecma TC39/TG5) </h3>

<p>When the first version of .NET was released in 2000, Visual C++ supported it via "Managed Extensions." These extensions involved the introduction of S-type string literals; numerous keywords starting with a double underscore; and support for the .NET's reference and value types, interfaces, properties, and delegates. Users of these extensions provided lots of feedback, so much so, that the second incarnation of this CLI binding looks quite different.</p>

<p>TG5 formed in September 2003 and began meeting every six weeks starting in November 2003; see http://www.plumhall.com/ecma/index.html. Its first Ecma Standard is expected in June 2005, with the ISO/IEC version to follow in September 2006. At least one beta implementation containing most (if not all) of the features in this new version became available in July. </p>

<p>Among the changes from Managed Extensions are: </p>



<ul>
  <li>S-style string literals are not needed (nor are they supported). The compiler handles the task of converting C-style string literals into strings of type <i>System::String</i>.</li>
  <li>Pointers into the garbage-collected heap are now known as "handles," and they now have a notation separate from pointers. For instance, in <a name="re6"></a><a href="0410de6.html">Example 6</a>, the "^" punctuator is used to indicate a handle. There is no implicit conversion between a pointer and a handle and vice versa. However, there is no corresponding unary operator "^"; to dereference a handle, you use the unary "*" operator, as with pointers. (Actually, this is advantageous when writing templates and generics that need to work with both pointer and handle types.)</li>
  <li>As users of Managed C++ did not like the double-underscore-style keywords, after much debate, it was agreed to introduce as few new keywords as possible, to spell them without leading underscores, and to avoid conflicting with common naming idioms as much as possible. These new keywords are:  <i>enum class</i>, <i>enum struct</i>, <i>for each</i>, <i>gcnew</i>, <i>interface class</i>, <i>interface struct</i>, <i>nullptr</i>, <i>ref class</i>, <i>ref struct</i>, <i>value class</i>, and <i>value struct</i>. (Note that some of these contain white space.)</li>
  <li>Other facilities that were previously accessed via keywords are now accessible via "context-sensitive keywords"; that is, by identifiers that carry special meaning only in certain contexts. These identifiers are: <i>abstract</i>, <i>delegate</i>, <i>event</i>, <i>finally</i>, <i>generic</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>initonly</i>, <i>literal</i>, <i>override</i>, <i>property</i>, <i>sealed</i>, and <i>where</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the main features of C++/CLI are: </p>



<p><b>Null Literals.</b> The <i>nullptr</i> keyword was added to represent the null value constant. This value can be converted to any handle type, with the result being a null handle. It can also be converted to any pointer type, with the result being a null pointer.</p>

<p><b>Managed Arrays.</b> An array that is allocated on the garbage-collected heap is a "managed array." It is declared using a pseudotemplate notation; see <a name="re7"></a><a href="0410de7.html">Example 7</a>.</p>

<p>In the case of subscripting a multidimensional managed array, you use a set of comma-separated index values rather than multiple sets of [] each with one index. For this to work, the grammar for expressions inside [] was changed so that commas inside brackets are treated as punctuators rather than operators.</p>

<p><b>Literal and Initonly Fields.</b> A literal field represents a compile-time constant <i>rvalue</i>. This value can depend on the value of other literal fields within the same program as long as they have been previously defined; see <a name="re8"></a><a href="0410de8.html">Example 8</a>. (Of course, Standard C++ I/O can be used instead.)</p>

<p>Literal fields are only permitted in <i>ref</i>, <i>value</i>, and <i>interface class</i>es.</p>

<p>An initonly field is an <i>lvalue</i> only within the <i>ctor</i>-initializer (that is, after the optional colon following a constructor definition's parameter list) and the body of a constructor, or within a static constructor; otherwise, it's an <i>rvalue</i>. It lets an object be initialized during object construction or class initialization only.</p>

<p>Initonly fields are only permitted in <i>ref</i> and <i>value</i> <i>class</i>es.</p>

<p><b>Class and Function Modifiers.</b> A class can have either of two modifiers: <i>abstract</i> or <i>sealed</i>; see <a name="re9"></a><a href="0410de9.html">Example 9</a>(a). By declaring a class abstract, you avoid the need to declare any pure virtual functions; however, both approaches result in the same behavior. A sealed class cannot be used as a base class.</p>

<p>A member function can have the following modifiers: <i>abstract</i>, <i>new</i>, <i>override</i>, and <i>sealed</i>. A function with any of these modifiers must also be explicitly declared <i>virtual</i>; see <a name="re9"></a><a href="0410de9.html">Example 9</a>(b).</p>

<p>An abstract function is an alternate way of saying it's a pure virtual function. The modifier <i>new</i> declares that the function does not override a function in the base class. (This helps with versioning, especially when new functions are added to existing base classes.) The <i>sealed</i> modifier declares that the function cannot be overridden in a derived class. </p>

<p>The <i>override</i> modifier not only allows a function to override a function having the same name in a base class, it also lets the names be different. An alternate way to achieve the same thing is to use an override specifier; see <a name="re9"></a><a href="0410de9.html">Example 9</a>(c).</p>

<p><b>for each</b> <b>Statements.</b> The <i>for each</i> statement enumerates the elements of a collection, executing a given statement for each element of that collection. For instance, the output of <a name="re10"></a><a href="0410de10.html">Example 10</a>(a) is shown in <a name="re10"></a><a href="0410de10.html">Example 10</a>(b). The simplest way for a type to be a collection is for it to implement the interface <i>System::Collections::IEnumerable</i>. All the standard collection classes do this, as does the pseudotemplate type <i>array</i>.</p>

<p><b>try/finally</b> <b>Statements.</b> A <i>try</i> block can have an optional<i> finally</i> block, provided it follows all <i>catch</i> blocks. The <i>finally</i> block is executed after its corresponding <i>try</i> block terminates normally or abnormally, even in the presence of exceptions that are thrown up the function call tree past the function containing the <i>finally</i> block.</p>

<p><b>Enums.</b> There are now two forms of <i>enum</i>: native and CLI, the latter being declared using <i>enum</i> <i>class</i> (or <i>enum struct</i>). For both forms, the underlying type can be stated explicitly and they can be made public or private with respect to their parent assembly. Additionally, both forms are derived from <i>System::Enum</i>, allowing access to a variety of interesting member functions. For instance, <a name="re11"></a><a href="0410de11.html">Example 11</a>(a) produces the output in <a name="re11"></a><a href="0410de11.html">Example 11</a>(b). Why have two different forms of <i>enum</i> when they seem to support the same capabilities? The CLI form allows interoperability with other CLI-based languages, whereas the native form does not.</p>

<p><b>Generics.</b> The generics feature allows classes, structs, interfaces, delegates, and methods to be parameterized by the types of data they store and manipulate, much like templates. However, with generics, a specific instantiation of a generic type is done at runtime rather than at compile time; see <a name="re12"></a><a href="0410de12.html">Example 12</a>(a). The set of types that can be used to instantiate a generic type or method can be constrained. In <a name="re12"></a><a href="0410de12.html">Example 12</a>(b), the class has a constraint containing two <i>where</i> clauses. The first requires that the type provided for <i>KeyType</i> must implement the interfaces <i>IComparable</i> and <i>IEnumerable</i>, while the second requires that the type provided for <i>ElementType</i> be of type <i>Transaction</i> or a derived type thereof. Failure to match any constraint requirement results in a compilation error.</p>

<p>Like types, functions also can be generic. With <a name="re12"></a><a href="0410de12.html">Example 12</a>(c), you can push multiple items onto a <i>Stack</i> of any kind, as in <a name="re12"></a><a href="0410de12.html">Example 12</a>(d). In many cases, the compiler can deduce the type of the function based on the types used in the argument list, allowing the &lt;...&gt; notation on the function call to be omitted.</p>

<p>The ... notation preceding the <i>array</i> parameter is new, indicating that the parameter following it is a "parameter array," the CLI type-safe equivalent of <i>varargs</i>.</p>
<h3>Liaison with the  Standard C++ Committee</h3>

<p>As C++/CLI is specific to the CLI, its Standard is being produced by a sibling to the Ecma committee that is standardizing the CLI itself. However, the C++ Standard is maintained by committee ISO/IEC JTC 1/WG 21. C++/CLI is not being defined in isolation from Standard C++; quite the contrary. All TG5 documents are made available to WG21 members, a joint TG5-WG21 e-mail reflector handles technical discussions, and WG21 members are invited to attend TG5 meetings. A number of C++/CLI's innovations have been submitted to WG21 for its consideration as additions to a future version of the C++ Standard.</p>
<h3>CLI (Ecma TC39/TG3) </h3>

<p>The CLI programming environment consists of three main parts: a Virtual Execution System (VES), metadata having a portable format, and an extensive library. (Not all of the .NET library types have been standardized as part of CLI. For example, serialization, database access, and GUI support are not included.) From the programmer's viewpoint, CLI (and .NET) is simply the "engine under the hood," which manifests itself via programming language extensions and runtime library support.</p>

<p>TG3 met monthly from November 2000 through September 2001. The resulting Standard is known as <i>ECMA-335</i>, <i>2nd Edition-December 2002</i> and <i>ISO/IEC 23271:2003(E)</i>. A companion Technical Report is <i>Ecma Technical Report TR/84, 2nd Edition-December 2002</i> and <i>ISO/IEC 23272:2003(E)</i>. (JIS is working on a Japanese translation.) In January 2003, work began on the next edition. A revised Ecma Standard is expected in June 2005 with the ISO/IEC version to follow in September 2006. At least one beta implementation containing most of the features in this new version became available in July. </p>

<p>TG3 has been working on a number of issues: editorial improvements, tightening of terminology and technical specification, and the addition of new features. The main features are:</p>



<p><b>Generics.</b> TG3 generics allows types and methods to be parameterized by the types of data they store and manipulate, much like generics in Eiffel or Ada and templates in C++. The set of types that can be used to instantiate a generic type or method can be constrained. (For examples of generic types and methods, and examples of constraints, refer to the previous C# and C++/CLI discussions.)</p>

<p>The addition of support for generics required new virtual machine instructions, new metadata tables, and an extensive set of new library types and new methods on existing types. The new library types include support for the following kinds of collections: dictionary, list, queue, and stack.</p>

<p><b>Debugging Information Interchange. </b>A Debugging Information Interchange specification for portable CILDB files provides a standard way to interchange debugging information between CLI producers and consumers. This specification serves to fill in gaps not covered by metadata, notably the names of local variables and source-line correspondences.</p>

<p><b>Imprecise Faults.</b> Some Common Intermediate Language (CIL) instructions perform implicit runtime checks that ensure memory and type safety. Originally, the CLI guaranteed that exceptions were precise, meaning that program state was preserved when an exception was thrown. However, enforcing precise exceptions for implicit checks makes some important optimizations practically impossible to apply. You can now declare, via a custom attribute, that a method is "relaxed," which says that exceptions arising from implicit runtime checks need not be precise. Relaxed methods preserve verifiability (by preserving memory and type safety) while permitting optimizations that reorder instructions.</p>

<p><b>Parallel Library.</b> The purpose of the parallel library is to provide easy parallelism for nonexpert programmers so that multithreaded CPUs can be exploited. The profile stresses simplicity over large scalability. To use this facility, a CLI-based language must support delegates.</p>
