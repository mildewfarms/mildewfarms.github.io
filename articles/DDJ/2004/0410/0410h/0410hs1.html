<h2>To Learn More</h2>

<p>Kevin Burton's <i>.NET Common Language Runtime UNLEASHED</i> (Sam's Publishing, 2002) offers in-depth coverage of dynamic compilation and reflection. SharpDevelop (http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/ Default.aspx) is a free IDE for C# and VB.NET projects on Microsoft's .NET platform. Because it's open sourced, you can read the source code to find out how to do syntax highlighting, Ctrl+Space code completion, IntelliSense, and so on. But note: Because SharpDevelop is subject to the GPL (General Public License), if you use SharpDevelop code in your application, your application must be open sourced, too.</p>
