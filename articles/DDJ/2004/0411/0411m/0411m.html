<p>If you are working on a sizable C, C++, Objective-C, or Objective-C++ project and compilation time is an issue, you should consider building a compile farm and running a distributed compile on several machines simultaneously. distcc (http://distcc.samba.org/) is a tool that lets you do just this. With distcc, you can set up a cluster of machines to compile a single source-code tree, dramatically reducing compilation times. Your particular speed improvement depends, of course, on the number of available machines on the network. Essentially, all you do is install the distcc daemon on each of these machines, thereby building a "compile farm." When you compile from a client machine, it distributes the work (per source file) to multiple machines in the farm.</p>

<p>distcc works as a wrapper around the compiler. It passes source files through the preprocessor (thus eliminating all local dependencies) and sends the resulting preprocessed source to one of the build farm machines over the network via TCP. The build machine compiles the received files and sends back resulting object files to the client. Since the files are already preprocessed, the build farm compiler does not need to have any header files or know any macro definitions that you might need to compile the original source. Consequently, you don't need to install third-part libraries and header files on each compile farm machine&#151;you only need them on your client machine.</p>

<p>All linking is done on the client machine. To parallelize the build process, it is generally recommended that you use the GNU make -<i>j</i> option. When -<i>j</i> is specified, GNU make tries to compile several files in parallel (assuming there are no dependencies among them). With distcc, these files are sent to different compile farm machines and compiled in parallel.</p>
<h3>Automating Build Farms </h3>

<p>Unfortunately, simple distcc deployments require that you know the names of all machines in the compile farm. Usually, you need to list them in the DISTCC_HOSTS environment variable. If some hosts become unavailable or new hosts are added, you need to update your local configuration accordingly. In larger organizations, this little problem quickly turns into a big one. </p>

<p>As it turns out, Apple provides a distributed build feature with its development tools. In particular, Apple automatically populates the list of machines in a compile farm via its OpenTalk (formerly known as "Rendezvous") technology, which provides automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks. In this article, I show how to implement an Apple-like distributed build in Linux, giving you all the benefits of a distributed build farm with automatic discovery but using inexpensive hardware and free software. In doing so, I use Red Hat Linux 9, although with minimal changes, the setup could be used with other Linux and UNIX platforms as well.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Compilation Servers</h3>

<p>First, you must enable OpenTalk on your Linux boxes. There are several implementations of OpenTalk for Linux, including one from Apple (http://developer.apple.com/macosx/). OpenTalk is, in fact, Apple's name for zero-configuration networking Zeroconf (http://www.zeroconf.org/). For this project, I'm using an open-source, cross-platform implementation of Zeroconf for Linux called "Howl" from Porchdog Software (http://www.porchdogsoft.com/ products/howl/).</p>

<p>Start by installing Howl; I use the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) provided by Porchdog. The Howl distribution includes several daemons, but only one&#151;mDNSResponder (dynamic publication and service discovery daemon)&#151;is of interest here. After it is installed, make sure it automatically starts on boot:</p>

<blockquote>
chkconfig &#151;add mDNSResponder<br>
chkconfig &#151;level=345 mDNSResponder on<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Note that howl-0.9.5-1.i386.rpm has a bug in the file /etc/init.d/mDNSResponder that specifies the wrong path to the mDNSResponder binary. Also, it does not specify the configuration file's location. Consequently, you should apply the patch in <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a> to /etc/init.d/mDNSResponder after installation. </p>

<p>Next, you need to create a configuration file with a list of the services on this machine, which you want to advertise via OpenTalk. For example, /etc/mDNSResponder.conf might look like <a name="re1"></a><a href="0411me1.html">Example 1</a>, which advertises SSH and DISTCC services on this machine. Also in <a name="re1"></a><a href="0411me1.html">Example 1</a>, <i>rover</i> is a local machine name; replace it with the actual name of your host. Since all machines in a distcc compile farm must have the same architecture and name for the compiler, I called my service _<i>distcc-RH9 </i>to show that it is a Red Hat 9 I386 machine. You can run several farms in the same organization by using different names, for example "_distcc-Solaris8," "_distcc-FreeBSD5," and so on.</p>

<p>Start <i>mDNSResponder</i> with:</p>

<blockquote>
service mDNSResponder start<br>

</blockquote>

<p>If you have a Mac OS X machine on the local network, you can test how this works by using a Terminal application. (Go to "File-&gt;Connect To Server" menu and you should see the name of your Linux machine in the list of SSH hosts; see <a name="rf1"></a><a href="0411mf1.html">Figure 1</a>.)</p>

<p>At this point, you need to install distcc-server. (Again, I used Red Hat Linux 9 RPMs.) Make sure it starts on boot:</p>

<blockquote>
chkconfig &#151;add distcc<br>
chkconfig &#151;level=345 distcc on<br>

</blockquote>

<p>and start it with:</p>

<blockquote>
service distcc start<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Repeat these steps for each compilation farm machine.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Compilation Clients</h3>

<p>To use OpenTalk on clients, you need to install and run the mDNSResponder daemon. Follow the same steps as in the previous section; but this time, do not include the configuration line for distcc in mDNSResponder.conf unless your client machine also acts as a compilation server.</p>

<p>Next, compile a small program that looks up distcc servers using OpenTalk. To compile it, you need to install the Howl development libraries and headers on one machine (you can do this on one machine and copy the resulting binary to all others). I used the howl-devel RPM package to install the Howl libraries. <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a> is the program you need to compile. You then compile mDNSlookup.c with the command:</p>

<blockquote>
cc -I/usr/include/howl mDNSlookup.c  -o mDNSlookup -lhowl -lpthread -lrt<br>

</blockquote>

<p>and install it in your executable path (for example, to /usr/local/bin). Finally, you can test to see what machines you can discover:</p>

<blockquote>
[root@rover root]# mDNSlookup _ssh._tcp 500<br>
rover _distcc-RH9._tcp. local. 192.0.2.140 3632<br>
zembla _distcc-RH9._tcp. local. 192.0.2.139 3632<br>

</blockquote>

<p>In this case, the system found two machines: <i>zembla</i> and <i>rover</i> with IP addresses <i>192.0.2.139</i> and <i>192.0.2.140</i>, respectively. Both machines are offering compilation services using distcc on Red Hat 9, listening on TCP port 3632.</p>
<h3>Setting Up  The Compiler</h3>

<p>The final step involves making use of discovered hosts. While there are several ways to do this, I've chosen the compiler shell wrapper approach because, on multiuser systems, users can control individually when distcc should be used. There is no need to modify project Makefiles to take advantage of distributed builds. Users can easily switch distributed builds off and on (some tools, imake, for example, do not work well when distcc use is enabled).</p>

<p>You need to install the scripts in <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a> in some directory, which is in the binary executable path of all users (for example, /usr/local/bin). You may want to tweak the scripts in <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>(a) and Three(b) (distcc_nhosts and distcc_wrapper), adjusting the variables at the beginning. MDNS_TIMEOUT defines how long to wait (in milliseconds) for OpenTalk responses. ADD_HOSTS_BEFORE and ADD_HOSTS_AFTER let you add some nonOpenTalk-enabled compile farm hosts to list hosts that will be used. The value of SERVICE_NAME should match the one you set earlier in /etc/mDNSResponder.conf on the compile farm hosts. To verify that it works, you may temporarily uncomment the line, setting the DISTCC_VERBOSE variable. This produces compilation-time debug output from distcc, showing what hosts are used. CCACHE (http://ccache.samba.org/) is another tool that could be used together with distcc to speed up compilation even more. It works well together with distcc and provides a noticeable compilation speed up, even when using a compilation farm. If you have it installed (you need to install it just on the client machine), replace this line in <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>(e) (distcc_wrapper): </p>

<blockquote>
exec distcc /usr/bin/c++ $*<br>

</blockquote>

<p>with</p>

<blockquote>
exec ccache distcc /usr/bin/c++ $*<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Now you're set. To start your first distributed compile, just enter:</p>

<blockquote>
make -j `1distcc_nhosts`<br>

</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion </h3>

<p>Once set up, no changes need to be made on the client side when new machines are added to or removed from a farm. If some machine becomes temporarily unavailable (for instance due to network connectivity issues), this will be immediately discovered and clients will make no attempt to use it.</p>

<p>If a number of machines in the compile farm&#151;as well as a number of client machines&#151;are noticeable, it might make sense to prepare RPM packages for both the client and server, which eliminates any manual configuration except RPM installation. mDNSResponder.conf could be generated automatically by the RPM post-install script (with the name of the machine taken from the hostname command and the service name built from the machine architecture name and gcc version).</p>

<p>A minor limitation to this approach is that distcc service is advertised whenever a machine is up, regardless of whether the distcc daemon is running or not. This can be corrected by a simple modification of the distcc daemon to register mDNSResponder on startup and unregister on exit. Howl provides an example of such code in the source code for the mDSNPublish example.</p>
