<p>ASNA is now shipping its DataGate Component Suite (DCS) for .NET, providing VB.NET and C# programmers with access to the iSeries platform. Performance gains are realized by using ASNA's own OS/400-based host server program rather than the OS/400-provided server program that OLE DB uses. The DataGate host server respects all server-side facilities, such as referential integrity and triggers, and obeys all OS/400-imposed user authorities and security. The DCS client component is 100 percent managed MSIL .NET assemblies and runs on either individual Windows desktops or Windows servers. Although DCS is targeted at VB.NET and C# programmers, it works with other .NET languages such as Delphi or C++. </p>
