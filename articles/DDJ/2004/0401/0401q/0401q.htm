The thread toolkit lets thread tasks accommodate resource synchronization without reducing readability of source code, while the helper toolkit supports reuse of object-oriented function pointers without the limitation of plain function pointers. Recursion has also made available a prerelease Math &lt;ToolKit&gt; that supports high-level math functions.</p><p>Recursion Software Inc.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>2591 N.

DTT automatically designs a suite of functional test cases from a model of the system requirements, generates all test documentation, and creates ready-to-run automated test script files. DTT supports automated scripting for automated execution tools such as Seque Silk, Mercury Interactive's WinRunner, and generic XML and UNIX scripts.</p><p>Software Prototype Technologies</p><p>851 Burlway Road, Suite 506</p><p>Burlingame, CA 94010</p><p>650-343-4524</p><p>http://www.softprot.com/</p><p>Adienta's Browsio, an add-in for Visual Studio .NET, is designed to give you a complete picture of where and how a variable, function, or class is used. This makes it possible to get an overview of the consequences of changes in larger projects with code written by different developers. The Browsio Tree lists all locations where an identifier is used in the currently open C/C++ project. Clicking in the tree brings the Visual Studio .NET editor to that location. If you look up a name used in more than one context, these contexts are shown in different branches. Other features include hierarchies of calls and call-bys ("who calls X") for functions and for classes, and hierarchies of derived and base classes.</p><p>Adienta</p><p>Groesbeekseweg 128</p><p>6524 DM Nijmegen</p><p>The Netherlands</p><p>31-(0)24-3737550</p><p>http://www.browsio.com/</p><p>Crownwood Consulting has announced DotNetMagic 1.0, a Windows-based user-interface library for the .NET Framework. DotNetMagic is written in C# and is designed to add the Visual Studio .NET look-and-feel to any Windows Forms Application. Features include a docking windows system similar to Visual Studio .NET, including the AutoHide capability.</p><p>Crownwood Consulting Ltd.</p><p>5 Haxey Grange, Haxey</p><p>Near Doncaster, North Lincolnshire </p><p>DN9 2PW</p><p>United Kingdom</p><p>http://www.dotnetmagic.com/</p><p>The latest version of Topologi's Collaborative Markup Editor for SGML and XML publishing production environments features support for very large file handling. Using memory profiling techniques, users can make final edits to million-line (50 MB) files without performance problems. Other improvements include improved diagnostics of markup syntax errors; Schematron 1.1.6 compliance; better internationalization; a built-in hex and image previewer; a simpler API for running external processes such as Perl scripts; and improved look-and-feel on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.</p><p>Topologi Pty.

Visual XSLT 2.0 ships with ActiveState's JIT debugger. Also new is the Visual Schema Mapper, which provides a drag-and-drop interface for building transformations of XML files without writing code or employing XML schemas.</p><p>ActiveState</p><p>#400-580 Granville Street</p><p>Vancouver, BC</p><p>Canada V6C 1W6</p><p>604-484-6400</p><p>http://www.activestate.com/</p><p>TheKompany.com has released BlackAdder 1.0, a Windows and Linux graphical development environment for Python, based on Qt. BlackAdder combines a visual design environment with debugging, syntax highlighting, ODBC interfaces, and HTML documentation. The debugger allows class instance objects to be displayed, and no restrictions are placed on the types of files that can be included in a project. Project management capabilities and integrated CVS support are also included.</p><p>TheKompany.com</p><p>P.O.

Using the Media Center SDK, you can create new applications that integrate with television, audio, video, and remote control services. Because Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004 is based on Windows XP, developers can use tools such as Visual Studio .NET 2003 and FrontPage, and existing code written for other versions of Windows can be reused in Media Center applications.</p><p>Microsoft Corp.</p><p>One Microsoft Way</p><p>Redmond, WA 98052-6399</p><p>425-882-8080</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/</p><p>Wind River has launched a series of platforms for safety-critical environments, offering certification evidence supporting international safety standards such as RTCA DO-178B and IEC61508. Wind River has also extended its debug and run-control product, VisionPROBE II, to support Linux as well as VxWorks. VisionPROBE II features system-level debugging of the target processor; JTAG capabilities; kernel-level debugging of scheduling, memory allocation, and the interrupt handler; and support for breakpoints in virtual memory.</p><p>Wind River</p><p>500 Wind River Way</p><p>Alameda, CA 94501</p><p>510-748-4100</p><p>http://www.windriver.com/</p><p><b>DDJ</b></p><hr></body></html>
