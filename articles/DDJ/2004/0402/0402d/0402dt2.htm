The *** denotes the system selected the CNC. Subscripts denote where the selected team placed in the combined weighted average of the AP and coaches poll if it wasn't #1. Most abbreviations are reasonably obvious, except perhaps Penn State (PSU) and Ohio State (OSU). The last row is a quantitative evaluation for the years from 1975-2001. The total for The New York Times's system is asterisked because it didn't begin until 1979, and so that total would probably be 17 given how well the other systems matched the polls during those years, as listed in the rightmost column in this table.</h4><a href="0402d.htm#rt2">Back to Article</a></body></html>
