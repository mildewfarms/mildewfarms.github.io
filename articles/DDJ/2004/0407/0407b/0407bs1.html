<h2>When to Use float or double, 
When to Use BigDecimal</h2>

<p>As well as being able to hold decimal fractions exactly, <i>BigDecimal</i> has a number of capabilities that are absent from the primitive binary floating-point types <i>float</i> and <i>double</i>. First, a <i>BigDecimal</i> can hold very big values, both in terms of exponent range and in terms of the number of digits; in contrast, the primitive floating-point types have a fixed precision and limited exponent range; see <a name="rt2"></a><a href="0407bt2.html">Table 2</a>.</p>

<p><i>BigDecimal</i> arithmetic operations allow full control over both the rounding mode and precision of the result. Operations on <i>float</i> and <i>double</i> always use the round to the nearest even rounding mode and the precision of the result is fixed. The string representation of a <i>BigDecimal</i> transparently denotes the number's value. Printing out <i>float</i> and <i>double</i> numbers is more subtle. The <i>double</i> floating-point value that prints out as "0.1" is not actually equal to 1/10; it is just the <i>double</i> value closest to 1/10.</p>

<p>The primitive floating-point types have their own advantages. Expressions on those types can be written with infix operations such as "+", "*", and "/". Today, binary floating-point enjoys near-ubiquitous hardware support, so operations should be quite fast. The primitive types also take up less space than <i>BigDecimal</i> objects.</p>

<p>In summary, if raw performance and space are the most important factors, primitive floating-point types are appropriate. If decimal values need to be represented exactly, high-precision computation is needed, or fine control of rounding is desired, only <i>BigDecimal</i> has the needed capabilities.</p>
