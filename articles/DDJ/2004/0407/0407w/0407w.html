<p>DRLX 1.0 from Devicelogics is a DR-DOS-based Linux loader that loads a complete Linux kernel while preserving DR-DOS in memory so that, upon Linux session completion, the system returns to DR-DOS. Also from Devicelogics, KDeBUG 1.0 is built upon the KDB Linux kernel patches supplied by SGI, but provides an enhanced interface and feature-set upgrade. And the DR-DOS operating system itself has been upgraded to Version 8.0, with new FAT32/large partition support.</p>
