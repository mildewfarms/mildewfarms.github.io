<p>Java Management Extensions (JMX) technology provides the architecture, design patterns, APIs, and services you need to manage resources in distributed applications. In this article, I discuss the JMX architecture and show how to create Managed Beans (MBeans), which are the objects you use to instrument resources so as to render them suitable for management. In the process, I present a television broadcast simulation application that uses the JMX API.</p>

<p>The Java Management Extensions architecture (http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement/) is comprised of instrumentation, agent, and adaptors levels. The components in these three levels form an entity called a JMX Agent, shown inside the dotted line in <a name="rf1"></a><a href="0407af1.html">Figure 1</a>.</p>

<p>At the instrumentation level, you find those resources that have been instrumented for management. They can include software entities such as queues, servlets, JavaServer Pages, Enterprise JavaBeans, and even nonJava legacy applications, provided they have been suitably wrapped. Software that interacts with hardware resources (such as printers) can also be instrumented for management. The mechanism used for instrumentation is the MBean.</p>

<p>MBeans representing manageable resources are registered in a repository owned and managed by an <i>MBeanServer</i>, which is an interface in the package javax.management.MBeanServer. <i>MBeanServer</i> is the core of the JMX agent and is found at the agent level in <a name="rf1"></a><a href="0407af1.html">Figure 1</a>. MBeans managed by the <i>MBeanServer</i> are identified by unique identifiers called "object names." An object name, represented by the class <i>javax.Management.ObjectName</i>, consists of the domain name and an unordered set of one or more key/value pairs; for example, <i>DrDobbs:name=ourfirstbean,level=simple</i>. The domain is separated from the key properties by a colon. To avoid naming conflicts, use a domain name according to the convention used by Java packages; for instance, the reverse DNS name of your organization (I use <i>ca.tremblett</i>). The <i>ObjectName</i> class defines methods for testing object names for equality, extracting the components of the name, and performing pattern matching.</p>

<p>Besides providing a managed repository, the <i>MBeanServer</i> acts as a proxy through which all operations performed on MBeans are routed. If you want to query or change an attribute of an MBean or invoke one of the operations it exposes, you cannot do so directly. All such actions must be done through <i>MBeanServer</i>.</p>

<p><i>MBeanServer</i> is an interface that you typically do not implement; rather, you obtain an object that implements the interface by invoking one of the methods in the <i>javax.management.MBeanServerFactory</i> class.</p>

<p>At the adaptors level, you find protocol adaptors and/or connectors. Protocol adaptors provide a management view of JMX agents through a given protocol. Two of the more common protocol adaptors are the HTTP and SNMP adaptors. An alternative to adaptors are connectors, which consist of a connector server and connector client. The server is attached to an MBean server and listens for connection requests from clients. A connection client, which typically runs in a different JVM and often on a different computer, establishes a connection to the server and communicates with the remote MBeans via the remote JMX agent using the management interface provided by the distributed services on the manager side. The difference between applications that manage via protocol adaptors and applications that manage via connectors is that the former are aware of the underlying protocol, which is transparent to the latter. The JMX specification defines a Remote Method Interface (RMI) connector that can use either the Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP) or Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP). It also defines an optional generic connector that uses the JMX Messaging Protocol (JMXMP), which is based on TCP sockets. The specification also provides for user-defined protocols.</p>
<h3>Creating Simple MBeans</h3>

<p>The simplest kind of MBean is the Standard MBean. <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a> is a standard MBean called "TrivialExample." This is an implementation class that implements a management interface. The relationship between the name of the implementation class and the name of the management interface follows a pattern. If the name of the implementation class is <i>Widget</i>, then the name of the management interface is <i>WidgetMBean</i>. Using this convention, it follows that the management interface implemented by <i>TrivialExample</i> is <i>TrivialExampleMBean</i> (<a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a>). </p>

<p>In <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a> are a number of <i>getters</i> and <i>setters</i> like those in regular JavaBeans. There isn't a 1:1 relationship between the number of <i>getters</i> and <i>setters</i>. If an attribute is both readable and writeable, it has a <i>getter</i> and <i>setter</i>. If it is read-only, it only has a <i>getter</i>. In addition to the <i>getters</i> and <i>setters</i>, the interface defines other methods that represent operations that can be performed on the MBean.</p>

<p>The <i>MBeanServer</i> uses introspection and reflection to discover and expose attributes and operations for management. This introspection and reflection relies on proper naming conventions being observed in the management interface.</p>
<h3>Observing an MBean in Action</h3>

<p>To facilitate working with the MBeans, the program SimpleAgent.java (<a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>): </p>

<ul>
    <li>Invokes the static method <i>createMBeanServer()</i> of the <i>MBeanFactory</i> class. This method returns an instance of an object that implements the <i>MBeanServer</i> interface.</li>
  <li>Creates an <i>HTMLAdaptorServer</i>, which lets an HTML browser manage all MBeans in the agent. <i>HTMLAdaptorServer</i> is itself an MBean.</li>
  <li>Registers the <i>HTMLAdaptorServer</i> with the <i>MBeanServer</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you start the agent by typing "java SimpleAgent," the program displays a message indicating that it is accepting connections on port 8787. If you access the URL http://localhost:8787 from a browser, you see something like <a name="rf2"></a><a href="0407af2.html">Figure 2</a> that lists registered MBeans by domain. In SimpleAgent.java, you see this code:</p>

<blockquote>
private static final String ADAPTOR_NAME_BASE = "Adaptor:name=<br>
					      html,port=";<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The MBean that represents the <i>HTMLAdaptorServer</i> is identified by an <i>ObjectName</i> I created using a string resulting from the concatenation of ADAPTOR_NAME_BASE and the variable <i>port</i>, which is either the default port of 8787 or a value passed as a command-line argument. Remember that the domain is that part of the object name that appears before the colon; therefore, the adaptor instance is listed under the domain <i>Adaptor</i>. Click on "name=html,port=8787" and you see a list of the attributes of the adaptor exposed for management.</p>

<p>Whenever an <i>MBeanServer</i> object is instantiated, an <i>MBeanServerDelegate</i> is created. This delegate is an MBean that represents the <i>MBeanServer</i> from a management point of view. In this agent, it is registered in the <i>JMImplementation</i> domain. Click on "type=MBeanServerDelegate" and you see a list of the attributes of the <i>MBeanServer</i> exposed for management. They are read only.</p>

<p>To create an instance of the TrivialExample MBean in <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a>, click on the Admin button. After you fill in the resulting form (<a name="rf3"></a><a href="0407af3.html">Figure 3</a>) and click the Send Request button, the browser displays the message "The MBean [DrDobbs:name=ourFirstMBean,id=1] was successfully instantiated and registered." When you click on "Go To MBean View," the view of the MBean (<a name="rf4"></a><a href="0407af4.html">Figure 4</a>) is displayed. You can see the attribute named <i>anAttributeYouCanOnlyRead</i> has read-only (RO) access. If you examine <i>TrivialExampleMBean</i> (<a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a>), you see that it only has a <i>getter</i> method. Even though it is read-only from a management point of view, it is writeable by the MBean itself. In TrivialExample.java, you see that the <i>getAnAttributeYouCanOnlyRead()</i> method sets the value of the variable <i>anAttributeYouCanOnlyRead</i> each time it is invoked. To demonstrate this, enter a value of 10 into the entry field labeled "Reload period in seconds" and watch the display. You see the date/time updated each time the screen is refreshed. The attribute <i>anAttributeYouCanReadAndWrite</i> has both a <i>getter</i> and <i>setter</i> method, so it has RW (read-write) access. You can experiment with changing its contents by typing a new value in the entry field and clicking the Apply button.</p>

<p>In addition to the <i>getters</i> and <i>setters</i>, <i>TrivialExampleMBean</i> defines methods representing operations (<a name="rf4"></a><a href="0407af4.html">Figure 4</a>) that can be carried out by the MBean. If you enter a value into the entry field to the right of the first operation and click the invokeMethodArgument button, you see that it changes the value of the attribute named <i>anAttributeYouCanSetByInvokingSomeMethod</i>. If you click on the button associated with the second operation, it resets the attribute <i>anAttributeYouCanReadAndWrite</i> to the default value of "Change me."</p>

<p>While TrivialExample doesn't do much, it does provide the mechanisms you need to perform more advanced management. To manage a printer queue, for example, you could expose a read-only attribute that displays values such as DRAINED, QUEUEING, STOPPED, ERROR, and CRITICAL. If you saw that ERROR was displayed for successive screen refreshes, you could check the value of another read-only attribute that displays messages such as "paper jammed," "out of paper," "ink cartridge empty," and take the appropriate action. If CRITICAL is displayed, you might determine that print jobs are being delivered to the queue faster than they can be printed. You could examine the current job and, if you saw it contained complex graphics were taking a long time to print, you could change the value of a read-write attribute named <i>maxAllowablePrintJobs</i>. The <i>setter</i> method for that attribute could then grow the queue to accommodate more jobs. You could reset the value after the large job finished printing. MBean operations might include hold, resume, and drain.</p>
<h3>Dynamic MBeans</h3>

<p>The TrivialExample MBean is static. The attributes and operations exposed were defined when I wrote the code and remain constant for the life of the MBean. Another kind of MBean, the DynamicMBean (DynamicTrivialExample is an example of DynamicMBean and is available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 3), defines attributes and operations at runtime. The interface implemented by this MBean is <i>AnInterfaceYouMightNotExpect</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
public interface AnInterfaceYouMightNotExpect {<br>
}<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The relationship between <i>AnInterfaceYouMightNotExpect</i> and <i>DynamicTrivialExample</i> does not follow the pattern <i>Widget/WidgetMBean</i>. Moreover, it defines no <i>getters</i>, <i>setters</i>, or operations. </p>

<p>In spite of this, if you use the <i>Admin</i> function specifying <i>DrDobbs</i> as the domain, <i>name=anotherExample</i> as the key, and <i>DynamicTrivialExample</i> as the class name, the browser displays the message: "The MBean [DrDobbs:name=anotherExample] was successfully instantiated and registered." When you navigate to the MBean View, two attributes and one operation have been exposed for management. Furthermore, instead of the rather generic MBean description "Information on the management interface of the MBean," you see a description that is clearly specific to this MBean. If you click any of the hyperlinks in the list of attributes and operations, a popup window containing a description is displayed. Finally, if you perform the <i>turnMeOff</i> operation by clicking the button bearing that label, not only does the <i>Status</i> attribute change to "I am turned off," but <i>turnMeOff</i> is replaced by <i>turnMeOn</i> in the list of MBean operations. </p>

<p>How was all this accomplished starting with an interface that defined no <i>getters</i>, <i>setters</i>, or operations? The fact that DynamicTrivialExample contains 200 lines of code compared to 30 lines of code in TrivialExample should give a hint&#151;it's all done by code at runtime.</p>

<p>There are several ways you can create a DynamicMBean. If you examine the javadocs for <i>javax.management.DynamicMBean</i>, you see that DynamicMBean is an interface and one of its known implementing classes is <i>StandardMBean</i>. The javadocs for <i>StandardMBean</i> show that it does provide implementations of all six methods defined by the DynamicMBean interface. These implementations return generic values. If you want to return values specific to your application, you can subclass <i>StandardMBean</i> and provide your own implementations of these methods. That is the approach I take with DynamicTrivialExample. </p>

<p><i>StandardMBean</i> has a constructor reserved to subclasses that takes an <i>MBean</i> interface class as an argument. I use this constructor and pass <i>AnInterfaceYouMightNotExpect.getClass()</i> as an argument. After I invoke the constructor of the superclass, I create arrays containing <i>MBeanConstructorInfo</i> and <i>MBeanAttributeInfo</i> objects. </p>

<p><i>getMBeanInfo()</i> checks if the instance variable <i>mbInfo</i> is null; if it is, I create an array containing a single <i>MBeanOperationInfo </i>object that defines the <i>turnMeOff</i> operation. I then create an <i>MBeanInfo</i> object by passing the class of my MBean (<i>ca.tremblett.ddj.DynamicTrivialExample</i>) a description of the MBean, the arrays of <i>MBeanConstructorInfo</i>, and <i>MBeanAttributeInfo</i> objects I created in the constructor, the array containing the <i>MBeanOperationInfo</i> object and a zero-length array of <i>MBeanNotificationInfo</i> objects to the constructor of the <i>MBeanInfo</i> class. I store the reference to this <i>MBeanInfo</i> object in <i>mbInfo</i> and my <i>getMBeanInfo()</i> method always returns this reference.</p>

<p>I also provide an implementation of <i>getAttribute(),</i> which returns the value of a single specified attribute and <i>getAttributes(),</i> which returns the values of several attributes. Since both attributes in my MBean are read only, I do not implement the <i>setAttribute()</i> or <i>setAttributes()</i> methods, but rely on the implementation inherited from the superclass.</p>

<p>Finally, I provide an implementation of <i>invoke(),</i> which invokes either <i>turnMeOn()</i> or <i>turnMeOff()</i> depending on the name of the operation it receives as an argument. Both <i>turnMeOn()</i> and <i>turnMeOff()</i> invoke <i>toggleOnOff(),</i> passing <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>, respectively, as an argument. If <i>toggleOnOff()</i> receives <i>true</i> as an argument, it creates an array containing a single <i>MBeanOperationInfo</i> object that defines the operation <i>turnMeOff</i>; otherwise, the array contains an <i>MBeanOperationInfo</i> object that defines the operation <i>turnMeOn</i>. The <i>invoke()</i> method then creates an <i>MBeanInfo</i> object using all of the arguments that <i>getMBeanInfo()</i> used to create <i>mbInfo,</i> with the exception of the fifth argument. For this argument it uses <i>newOps</i>. I store the newly created <i>MBeanInfo</i> object in <i>mbInfo</i> so the next time this method is invoked, you see the new operation. This explains why the contents of the MBean operations list changes each time you perform an operation.</p>

<p>The attributes I defined in the code can also be read from an XML file that users create and pass to the agent at runtime. This provides even greater flexibility and is easy for users if they utilize a tool that generates the XML.</p>
<h3>Creating MBeans  From Programs</h3>

<p>While I used the JMX agent to create instances of both MBeans, you can also create MBeans programatically. TelevisionReceiver (available electronically) is a program that creates an MBean. This class represents a receiver that is capable of detecting a broadcast stream from network and cable television transmitters. For testing purposes, I use a <i>BroadcastSimulator</i> (available electronically) to generate a broadcast stream. Since only a single instance of <i>BroadcastSimulator</i> is needed, my <i>getBroadcastSimulator()</i> method in TelevisionReceiver uses the <i>MBeanServer'</i>s <i>queryMBeans()</i> method to determine if such an MBean is already registered with the server. If the server reports that no such MBean is registered, I create one. I do this by passing two arguments to the<i> MBeanServer'</i>s <i>createMBean()</i> method. The first argument is the class name of the MBean I want to create (<i>ca.tremblett.BroadcastSimulator</i>). The second argument is the <i>ObjectName</i> used to identify the MBean. I create the <i>ObjectName</i> using the string "DrDobbs:name=BroadcastSimulator." </p>

<p>I determined if a <i>BroadcastSimulator</i> MBean was registered by iterating over the elements of the <i>Set</i> returned by the <i>queryMBeans()</i> method. The JMX API provides another mechanism that can accept queries in the form of expressions. The API also provides the ability to define relations and roles, and you can use a <i>RoleInfo</i> object to define the minimum and maximum number of MBeans that can assign a role. Queries, relations, and roles are beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<h3>Interacting with the Registration Process</h3>

<p>I want to ensure that every instance of TelevisionReceiver has a property list of the form <i>name=TelevisionReceiver,id=n</i>, where <i>n</i> is an integer that identifies the receiver. If my MBean implements the <i>MBeanRegistration</i> interface and I provide implementations of<i> postDeregister(), postRegister(), preDeregister(), </i>and <i>preRegister(),</i> I can interact with and control the registration process. In this case, my implementation of <i>preRegister()</i> contains code that examines any domain or keys users might enter using web browsers and adjusts them to conform to the syntax I require. I provide empty implementations of the other three methods. </p>
<h3>MBean Notifications</h3>

<p>Polling a resource to determine its status is inherently evil. The better way is to be notified when some condition in the resource in which you have expressed an interest requires your attention. MBeans can emit notifications as described by the <i>javax.management.Notification</i> class. A <i>Notification</i> object contains the fields in <a name="rt1"></a><a href="0407at1.html">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>An MBean that is intended to emit notifications must implement the <i>javax.management.NotificationBroadcaster</i> interface. This interface defines three methods: <i>addNotificationListener(),</i> <i>removeNotificationListener(),</i> and <i>getNotificationInfo().</i> The notification mechanism used by JMX is the same as the one you have used from the JSDK, so you are already familiar with the first two methods. The third method returns an array of <i>MBeanNotificationInfo</i> objects, each of which describes the characteristics of a kind of notification emitted by an MBean.</p>

<p>An example of an MBean that emits notifications is BroadcastSimulator. At a specified interval, it generates and emits notifications with user data objects that contain information corresponding to a television commercial that has been steganographically encoded in a manner suitable for detection by a tuner with specialized hardware. It maintains its listeners in an <i>ArrayList</i> and each time it generates a <i>Notification</i> object with user data that is a <i>BroadcastStreamEvent</i> (available electronically), it iterates through the listeners. When listeners register themselves with the <i>NotificationBroadcaster</i>, they specify a <i>NotificationFilter</i> object to which the <i>NotificationBroadcaster</i> should send notifications by invoking the filter's <i>isNotificationEnabled()</i> method. If this method returns <i>false</i>, the <i>NotificationBroadcaster</i> takes no further action; otherwise, it invokes the listener's <i>handleNotification()</i> method passing the <i>Notification</i> object as an argument.</p>

<p>The broadcast stream events generated by BroadcastSimulator are detected by instances of Tuner (available electronically). A TelevisionReceiver can have a Tuner for each frequency it needs to monitor. My <i>Tuner</i> class implements <i>NotificationListener</i> and provides an implementation of the <i>handleNotification()</i> method defined by this interface. In my case, I simply extract data from the <i>Notification'</i>s user data and use it to update attributes in the Tuner MBean. My <i>Tuner</i> class also implements <i>NotificationFilter</i> and provides an implementation of the <i>isNotificationEnabled()</i> method defined by this interface. </p>
<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>

<p>The management of the resources involved in the broadcast simulation application uses a sufficient number of the classes and interfaces from the JMX API to provide a good idea of how it all works. If you want to experiment, you could use the web interface to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a BroadcastSimulator MBean. Specify <i>DrDobbs</i> as the domain name, <i>name=BroadcastSimulator</i> as the key, and <i>ca.tremblett.ddj.BroadcastSimulator</i> as the class.</li>
  <li>Try to create another BroadcastSimulator MBean using a different domain and a different key. You will receive an MBean Failure message stating that multiple instances of BroadcastSimulator are not permitted. If you examine BroadcastSimulator's constructor, you see code that prevents multiple instances.</li>
  <li>Create a TelevisionReceiver MBean. Specify any domain name you wish. Use <i>id=1</i> as the key and <i>ca.tremblett.ddj.TelevisionReceiver</i> as the class name. After the MBean has been created, note that no matter what you used as a domain, the MBean ends up in the <i>DrDobbs</i> domain. Examine the TelevisionReceiver's <i>preRegister()</i> method and you see code that makes the adjustment to the object name. The TelevisionReceiver MBean locates and uses the instance of <i>BroadcastSimulator</i> just created.</li>
  <li>Create several other TelevisionReceiver MBeans using<i> id=2, id=3, </i>and so on as keys.</li>
  <li>Create several Tuner Mbeans. The key for each Tuner takes the form "<i>receiver=n,slot=m,"</i> where <i>n</i> is the ID of the TelevisionReceiver in which the Tuner is located and <i>m</i> the slot it occupies. When a Tuner MBean is first created, its status is "unconfigured." As you create each Tuner, configure it by setting the call letters to the name of a television station (WABC, for example), the channel to a number between 1 and 32, and the frequency to any double since it is not used in this version. When all configuration values have been entered, the status changes from "unconfigured" to "suspended." Start the tuner by performing the "resume" operation.</li>
  <li>Add <i>System.out.println</i> statements at those points in the code where you want to learn more about what it is doing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The importance of resource management cannot be overstated. As you develop a new resource, you should ask yourself whether it should participate in resource management. You should make this determination early in the development process. If the answer is "yes," MBeans and the JMX API provide everything you need to accomplish the task. </p>
