A glass of the house Pinot Gris?"<P><P>"It is a comfort," journalist Larry Wilde said as he settled onto his customary stool, "to end a long day in a saloon where the bartender knows your preferences."<P><P>I poured. Larry watched. The tomato ticked.<P><P>"Rough day?" I asked, "Or just a long one?"<P><P>"Productive but inconclusive," he said between sips. "I'm researching computer languages for a piece I'm doing on spec for a new online magazine about Silicon Valley lifestyles. Silicon Valley lifestyles. I must say I have my doubts about a publication premised on an oxymoron, but there's not a lot of work out there for a beat journalist."<P><P>I tsked sympathetically. I could think of three possible meanings for "beat journalist," two of which fit Larry these days. I enjoyed serving drinks at Foo Bar for the tips I got from working journalists, but fewer and fewer journalists were actually working. "Computer languages, eh?"<P><P>"Yes, the question the article asks is, when programming languages grow old, what happens to the programmers using them?"<P><P>"Do programming languages really grow old?"<P><P>"Oh, yes. Think of Pascal. Once it was all hip and structured and stylish, like Danish Modern furniture. Now it's dated and quaint and inconvenient -- "<P><P>"Like Danish Modern furniture?"<P><P>"Or Ada, which went from being not your father's Oldsmobile to being your grandfather's Edsel."<P><P>"Where are you getting these characterizations of languages, anyway?"<P><P>"From my Twitter followers. What a marvelous research instrument Twitter is, Michael! You just throw out a question and in minutes you have dozens of answers."<P><P>"Yes, but -- "<P><P>"Or consider Forth. In its youth, Forth was punk, but now it's bluegrass."<P><P>"But I don't think these characterizations make any sense."<P><P>"Fine, Forth was Ska, but now it's techno. That was another tweet I got. The point is, languages age; they cease to fill the role they once filled, and search for a new role, usually one that involves taking a nap in mid-afternoon. By the way, are you aware that there is a ticking tomato on the bar?"<P><P>"It's a Pomodoro," I explained.<P><P>"That's simply the Italian for tomato, I believe." He frowned at me but smiled as I refilled his glass.<P><P>"The Pomodoro Technique is an agile methodology for a single individual," I explained. "It was invented by Francesco Cirillo and requires the use of a five-dollar kitchen timer. You work for 25 minutes and then break for three to five minutes. Each such time period is also called a Pomodoro. If you're being really true to the plan, you use a timer shaped like a tomato."<P><P>"So that's your pomodoro. I see. And what is it ticking for?"<P><P>"I'm using the Pomodoro Technique to organize my work."<P><P>He snorted. "What work? Excuse me, Michael, but all you do here is schmooze with the customers."<P><P>Ding!<P><P>"Your tomato just dinged."<P><P>"Sorry," I said, "I have to stop schmoozing for the next three to five minutes." I set the Pomodoro for five minutes, put my feet up on a nearby stool, my back to the bar, and opened the Merc.<P><P>"Ah, I get it. Schmoozing is your work, and you've just done your 25-minute spell of it, so now you get a break. Clever."<P><P>"La la la. Can't hear you."<P><P>He kept talking and I continued to ignore him. I also ignored the yuppie couple who walked in and sat at the chair next to Larry.<P><P>"You'll just have to wait," Larry told them. "He's on Pomodoro break."<P><P>A little later the Pomodoro dinged, I reset it for 25 minutes, and I saked what I could do for them. After filling their order, I picked up my conversation with Larry, first recapping, in proper Pomodoro Technique, what had been accomplished in the preceding Pomodoro.<P><P>"You were telling me about your magazine article, but not making any sense. Continue."<P><P>"I was too making sense. Anyway, the point of the article is, what happens to the programmer in such cases? <P><P>If you are a long-time Java programmer, you were once cutting-edge and cool. What are you now if you're still using Java? Have you actually changed and become a dinosaur, or are you still the risk-taker you once were, but strapped to a moribund language?"<P><P>"Well, people do change."<P><P>"Yes, but does the language you use dictate that you change? When it gets old, does it drag you along with it?"<P><P>I waited on a couple other customers and pickeed up the conversation again.<P><P>"I'm still skeptical about this article of yours, Larry. What other languages are you looking at?"<P><P>"I'm asking if Haskell programmers turn into absent-minded professors, or Ruby programmers into grumpy old men. Do you have a programming language that you're particularly interested in these days?"<P><P>"Yes," I said. "Subleq. And I think it'll serve me well when I get so senile that I can only remember one instruction."<P><P>Ding! <P>
