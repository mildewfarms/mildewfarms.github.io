<p>It goes without saying that times are tough and finding the perfect job is even tougher.&nbsp; Chicago-based technologist and author Andy Lester offers no-nonsense job search and interview advice in his recent Pragmatic Bookshelf title, <i>Land the Tech Job You Love</i>.&nbsp; Read on to find out if the tips he shares are worth the book&#39;s cover price.</p>

<p>Unlike the pile of job search and interview tip books on the market, Land the Tech Job You Love is a book exclusively optimized for the devoted IT professional looking to improve their chances of landing the ideal job (or, at the very least, *a* job) in the highly competitive and job-constrained technology sector.&nbsp; Keenly written especially for the highly intelligent yet often introverted technical crowd, Andy Lester has distilled a number of excellent reminders for readers seeking out what jobs they desire and what they qualify for, as well as customizing their resume for the targeted employer, ace&#39;ing the interview and negotiating the job offer.<br />

<p>Having been on both sides of the hiring fence, I can attest to many of Andy&#39;s recommendations for interviewees.&nbsp; I can also relate to some of the horror stories he relates in the book, since I have interviewed some of the very character types Andy uses as worst-case scenario examples. 

<p>The book itself can be read in an hour or two, but putting into practice all the suggestions will take days or even weeks to refine.&nbsp; Like most Pragmatic Bookshelf titles, this book takes a very pragmatic approach to the resume and interview process.&nbsp; Strongly opinionated do&#39;s and don&#39;ts are punctuated with real world examples and continued emphasis on what it will take to honestly impress hiring managers and interviewers.&nbsp; I appreciated Andy&#39;s honest, take-it-or-leave-it approach to getting serious about the job search, coupled with the real-world realities of the current economic and job availability climate.&nbsp; The book is devoid of rah-rah feel good pep talks.&nbsp; Instead, the author tackles the reality of the current tech job market head-on, dealing with tough interview questions, avoiding clich&eacute;s and generally telling it like it is - very refreshing.<br />

<p>While most tech managers and executives will probably not discover any new insights shared in the book, <i>Land the Tech Job You Love</i> supplies an excellent distillation of all the &#39;best of&#39; job search tips amassed over a successful IT professional&#39;s career.&nbsp; For those seeking a change in their current tech employment situation, this book is definitely worth its asking cover price.&nbsp; Given the author&#39;s welcome knack for hard truths combined with real-world examples, I&#39;d like to see him follow up this book with a sequel, possibly titled &quot;<i>Keep the Tech Job You</i> Love&quot; to carry forward the successful practices of people who make themselves invaluable participants to their organizations.
