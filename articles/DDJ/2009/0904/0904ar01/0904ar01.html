One-fourth of companies are deploying CRM to handhelds, a recent <I>InformationWeek Analytics</I> survey finds, showing it's a growing business priority. What started as a tool for managing personal information is now seen by more companies as a key computing platform in their overall IT strategy. These organizations believe in the promise of mobile computing to streamline business processes, enable round-the-clock access to enterprise applications, even increase customer satisfaction.<P><P>Business technology leaders embracing mobility face a lot of difficult decisions as they drive mobile platform decisions. For a company that uses Lotus Notes, for example, it may make sense to standardize on the BlackBerry, because of its Lotus support. However, if that shuts down POP support in the process, employees won't be able to retrieve e-mail on their iPhones, because Notes doesn't support that platform. More complicated are the questions around whether the application development tools are sufficient for companies to develop the internal applications we want, and which tools fit our needs.<P><P>Many of the benefits companies expect from mobile devices are derived from a blend of the platform and operating system they use as well as the hardware running it. Is there one best mobile device platform? The answer is no, as each platform has its strengths and weaknesses.<P><P>There are two major steps in charting a mobile development strategy. First is to consider what ways your company plans to use the platform. Second is to assess which platforms best fit those needs.<P><P>Gartner offers a useful grouping into three usage patterns seen most often:<P><ul><li>The "appliance profile" is the simplest and lowest cost, and it fits a company that limits device and application choices, does little application development, and focuses on moderate security capabilities such as passwords and remote device wipe.<li>The "platform profile" allows development of feature-rich applications and the broad use of third-party apps with robust security features, but limits the device choice.<li>The "concierge profile" allows for custom application development and permits broad device choices. It's the most costly -- Gartner estimates it's twice the total cost of the appliance approach.</ul><P><P>For companies developing in-house mobile applications, the platform choice is the most challenging. Each major platform has evolved its development tools into broad application development toolkits focused on single-platform development not multiplatform work. Since each vendor's development tools require a different set of skills, deploying the same team that developed a RIM BlackBerry application to work on iPhone applications will require some retooling.<P><P>Many companies first venture into mobile technology is providing BlackBerry e-mail access. Next, they often look to appplications for sales and other field employees, CRM, and business intelligence, such as performane dashboards. In short, mobile applications are integrating with corporate systems and other programs on a much more complex level.<P><P>One challenge involves the goal of limiting the amount of coding our developers have to do. The solution is to architect mobile applications to take advantage of cloud-based computing and Web services for the heavy lifting, and writing code only to provide user interface and feedback. This approach limits the amount of device-specific code that needs to be ported to other devices. Companies also can consider portable technologies such as Adobe's Flash Lite, which makes it possible for the same application to run on BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, or any other mobile OS that has the Flash Lite environment running in the target OS.<h3>Platform Trade-Offs</h3><P><P>After settling on these strategic development questions, business technology leaders must settle on which platform best meets those needs. Here's perspective on several leading choices. We don't cover Palm in depth, since it's slipped to 2% of the smartphone market, says Gartner, while Symbian has half the world market, and the BlackBerry and iPhone make up about 70% of North America.<P><ul><li>Nokia's Symbian OS-based S60 platform has something for everyone -- C, C++, Java, Python, WRT widgets, and Flash-but the APIs require some getting used to. Symbian C++ and Open C/C++ (a C programming interface with runtime Posix libraries) programs are packaged as metadata files that must be digitally signed for security checks or the application won't execute. IT can therefore use security certificates to monitor and control in-house mobile applications.<P><li>iPhone uses Objective-C -- challenging even for experienced C, C++, and C# programmers. Developers coming from other languages face an even steeper learning curve. The Cocoa Touch programming interface and proprietary XCode integrated development environment (IDE) provide a powerful environment that includes a WYSIWYG interface builder. For Web-based apps, the SDK includes the HTML/JavaScript-based Dashcode framework. Everything in the iPhone runs at root level -- and every process executing with root privileges can be a security threat. Additionally, the iPhone permits only one third-party app to run at a time. IPhone apps also must be digitally signed before they can execute.<P><li>Android applications are written in Java, but not Java ME. Instead, the Android SDK is a combination of standard Java SE and Java ME methods and classes, as well as nonstandard ones. This means that there's a learning curve, even for seasoned Java developers. The Android Development Tools plug-in lets developers use Eclipse to write and debug applications. Again, Android apps must be signed or they won't run. The SDK does provide a developer key, but a private key is required for public distribution.<P><li>BlackBerry applications can be developed several ways: a Java-based IDE that provides access to RIM APIs and an Eclipse plug-in; a rapid application development approach that focuses on Web services using Visual Studio or Eclipse plug-ins and supports any .Net or Java language choice; or a Web-based app approach referred to as Browser Development, which lets developers create apps using existing BlackBerry browser software. The downside to writing apps using BlackBerry API extensions is that it ties the application to a particular device. Still, that's no different than using the Android's unique Java classes.<P><li>Windows Mobile uses the .Net Compact Framework, which makes development relatively straightforward for developers familiar with .Net languages such as C#, Visual Basic .Net, and (for native code) Visual C++. Because the .Net Compact Framework is a subset of the .Net Framework, components from .Net-based desktop clients, application servers, and Web servers are available. The upside is companies that have standardized on Microsoft platforms and developer tools can jump into mobile development. The downside is the the apps run on a single platform -- Windows Mobile OS. <P>
