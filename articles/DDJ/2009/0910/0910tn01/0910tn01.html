The project aims to facilitate the development of cloud applications that can access services on all major cloud platforms. Zend, IBM, Microsoft, Nirvanix, Rackspace and GoGrid are co-founding contributors to this community project.<P><P>The Simple Cloud API project empowers developers to use one interface to interact with a variety of cloud application services, enabling them to more easily access new technologies from cloud vendors. The first deliverables will include interfaces for file storage, document database, and simple queue services from platforms like Amazon Web Services, Windows Azure, Nirvanix Storage Delivery Network and Rackspace Cloud Files.  As a result, developers can deploy software applications to access services in these environments without making time consuming and expensive changes to their source code.<P><P>"Cloud computing offers irresistible value to enterprises of all sizes, but the lack of portability across cloud application services for even the most basic operations has been an impediment to broader adoption of cloud services," said Andi Gutmans, CEO at Zend Technologies.<P>"The Simple Cloud API combines the benefits of open source community processes with the active participation of the cloud vendors themselves," continued Gutmans. "With early participation and support from industry leaders and the Zend Framework community, we anticipate that this important project will continue to grow, serving a wide range of application developers and businesses building modern Web applications for the cloud."<P><P>The Simple Cloud API project is designed to encourage widespread participation and contributions from the open source community, resulting in the availability of Simple Cloud API adapters for virtually all major cloud providers.<P><P>Although led by Zend, the largest corporate contributor to the PHP programming language, the Simple Cloud API can be translated to any object-oriented language for the Web. The PHP implementation will be available in the widely adopted open source Zend Framework project as a new component, called "Zend Cloud." PHP developers can take advantage of this new component to utilize existing client libraries available in Zend Framework in a uniform way.<P><P>Zend Cloud adapters will be available for services such as:<P><ul><li>File storage services, including Windows Azure blobs, Rackspace Cloud Files, Nirvanix Storage Delivery Network and Amazon S3<li>Document Storage services, including Windows Azure tables and Amazon SimpleDB<li>Simple queue services, including Amazon SQS and Windows Azure queues</ul><P><P>Zend Cloud will also provide adapters for local services to make offline coding and testing against cloud services as easy as connected development.
