This is the second in a series of articles that explores an innovative build system for complicated projects. <a href="http://www.ddj.com/architect/218400678">Part 1</a> discussed build systems in general, problems with existing build systems in particular, and presented an ideal/invisible build system -- ibs. In Part 2, I dive into the internals of ibs and explain how it works. 
<P>

<P>
To recap: Ibs is an invisible build system that doesn't require any build files. It relies on a regular directory and conventions to infer build rules and it detects dependencies automatically. It generates build files for other IDEs or build systems like Makefiles, Visual Studio solutions, and NetBeans projects. It is focused on C/C++ projects, but can be extended to additional languages and other projects types.  
<P>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<P>

<P>
Ibs has a generic core, an object model, and build-system-specific code (helper modules and templates). There is a clear separation between the common generation code and the build-system-specific parts. The object model includes the following classes:
<P>
<ul>
<li><b>Project</b>. The <b>Project</b> class is the unit of work. Each software system is just a list of projects with some dependencies between them. In the ibs world, a project always has an associated project directory and contains files that reside under its root directory, and possibly subdirectories too. <b>Project</b> maintains information such as the project name, its root directory, its dependencies, and its templates (see below). The files are discovered automatically.
<P>
<li><b>Template</b>. Ibs can generate build files for multiple build systems. Each build system has its own set of build files. In some cases, it is just a single file such as a Visual Studio .vcproj file, and in other cases such as NetBeans nbproject, it can be a build directory that contains multiple files. Each project is associated with a set of templates that can be used to generate all the necessary build files.
<P>

<P>
The <b>Template</b> class has a skeleton text file with placeholders and a substitution dictionary that can be applied to generate the target build file.
<P>
<li><b>BaseHelper</b>. The generic part of ibs doesn't know anything about the particular build systems it can generate, but it knows what it needs to know. <b>BaseHelper</b> is a base class that encapsulates this meta-knowledge. For each build system you want to support, you need to write a proper helper subclass that can provide the necessary information along with specific build file templates.The helper is responsible for getting all the necessary templates, preparing the substitution dictionary, and collecting files for each project.
<P>
<li><b>Generator</b>. The generator is the engine of ibs. It understands the regular directory structure and knows how to build every top-level directory and all its subdirectories. Once it populates a project list and generates proper build files for each project, it maintains a map of top-level directories to project &#91;template&#93; types.
<P>
<li><b>Dependency Analyzer</b>. The dependency analyzer module is C/C++-specific. It analyzes <b>#include</b> files and calculates the dependency graph of the various projects. In general, the only dependencies (at the C/C++ level) are static libraries that must be built before they can be linked with executables and dynamic libraries that depend on them. 
</ul>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>
<P>

<P>
It's time to look at the implementation of the core ibs. Let's examine the build_system_generator.py script that contains most of the object model, the DependencyAnalyzer.py module that contains the dependency analyzer, and the various project templates.
<P>
<h4>build_system_generator.py</h4>
<P>

<P>
Let's start with the <b>main</b> function. Its job is to parse command-line arguments and hand them over to the <b>generate_build_files()</b> function. There is currently only one command-line argument -- <b>root_dir</b>. The <b>root_dir</b> is the directory that contains ibs and the source tree. It defaults to the parent directory, which works if you run it from the ibs directory (where the script is located). In addition, the <b>save_projects</b> argument is passed. If it's True, the generated build files are saved. If it's False, the build files are generated but not saved, which is useful during development and debugging.
<P>
<pre  class="code">
<P>
def main(argv):
  """Parse command-line arguments and call generate_build_files()
<P>
  """
  import getopt
  optionSpec = &#91;'root_dir='&#93;
<P>
  save_project_files = True
<P>
  root_dir = os.path.join(script_dir, '..')
<P>
  try:
    opts, args = getopt.gnu_getopt(argv, '', optionSpec)
  except Exception, e:
    print "Error parsing command line: %s" % e
    usage()
<P>
  if len(args) &gt; 0:
    usage()
<P>
  for (option, val) in opts:
    if option == '--root_dir':
      root_dir = val
<P>
  # Convenience. Allows use of "~" in pathnames and other things.
  root_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.normpath(os.path.expanduser(root_dir)))
<P>
  generate_build_files(root_dir, save_project_files)
<P>
if __name__=='__main__':
  main(sys.argv&#91;1:&#93;)

</pre>
<P>

<P>
The <b>generate_build_files()</b> function calls its nested <b>get_platform()</b> function to figure out what platform it is running on (using the Python "platform" standard library module). Based on the platform, it decides what build system to target (Visual C++ 2008 or NetBeans 6). In your build system you may want to employ different logic to determine the target build system or pass it from the outside as a command-line argument.
<P>

<P>
After the target build system has been determined, the appropriate helper module is instantiated. All the helper modules reside in the 'helpers' subdirectory and are named &lt;build system&gt;_helper.py. For example, the Visual C++ 2008 helper is "ibs/helpers/VC_2008_helper.py". Future articles will take a closer look at these helper modules and drill into specific build systems. This article stays at the generic build-system level. 
<P>

<P>
The proper helper is imported dynamically via the <b>__import__</b> statement. This is a useful Pythonic technique to implement plug-ins. Note that additional target build systems can be easily added by moving the build system selection code outside and by simply adding more helper modules for the new build systems.
<P>

<P>
The next step is to select the project template's directory. The project templates for each build system reside in a sub-dir of 'project_templates' and are named after the build system. For example, the NetBeans 6 templates dir is: "ibs/project_templates/NetBeans_6".
<P>

<P>
A helper module is instantiated using an unusual syntax:
<P>
<pre  class="code">
<P>
helper = getattr(helper_module, 'Helper')(templates_dir)

</pre>
<P>

<P>
The <b>getattr()</b> call gets the <b>Helper</b> attribute from the current helper module. Every helper module contains a class called <b>Helper</b> that implements the helper interface. Then, the retrieved <b>Helper</b> class, which also doubles as a factory function/constructor, is invoked with the templates dir as an argument, resulting in an instantiated <b>Helper</b> object.
<P>

<P>
The helper is used to create a <b>Generator</b> object <b>g</b>. Several generator methods are now invoked in a sequence: <b>generate_projects()</b>, <b>save_projects()</b>, and <b>generate_workspace_files()</b>. 
<P>
<pre  class="code">
<P>
def generate_build_files(root_dir, save_project_files):
  def get_platform():
    arch = platform.architecture()&#91;0&#93;&#91;:2&#93;
    operating_system = platform.system().lower()
    processor = platform.processor()
<P>
    if operating_system == 'darwin' and arch == '32' and processor == 'i386':
      return 'darwin86'
    elif operating_system == 'linux':
      return 'linux' + arch
    elif operating_system == 'windows':
      return 'win' + arch
    else:
      raise Exception('Unsupported platform: ' + platform.platform())
<P>
  title()
  # Dynamically import the build system specific helper module
  p = get_platform()
  build_system = 'VC_2008' if p.startswith('win') else 'NetBeans_6'
  helper_name = build_system + '_helper'
  sys_path = sys.path&#91;:&#93;
  sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(script_dir, 'helpers'))
  helper_module = __import__(helper_name)
<P>
  templates_dir = os.path.join(script_dir, 'project_templates', build_system)
  # Instantiate the Helper class
  helper = getattr(helper_module, 'Helper')(templates_dir)
<P>
  g = Generator(root_dir, p, helper)
  g.generate_projects()
  g.save_projects(save_project_files)
  g.generate_workspace_files()

</pre>
<P>

<P>
Let's examine the <b>Generator</b> class. The constructor stores the root_dir, the platform, and the helper module. The helper module is used to execute all the steps that require specific build-system knowledge. This is sort of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy pattern</a>,  if you will. The final line calls the internal <b>_populate_project_list()</b> method.
<P>
<pre  class="code">
<P>
  def __init__(self, root_dir, platform, helper):
    self.root_dir = root_dir
    self.libs_dir = os.path.join(root_dir, 'src/hw')
    self.platform = platform
    self.helper = helper
    self.ignore = helper.get_ignore_string()
    self.projects = {}
    self._populate_project_list()

</pre>
<P>

<P>
The <b>_populate_project_list()</b> method gets the template objects for various project types from the helper (this is build-system-specific) and create a mapping between each top-level directory (hw, dlls, apps, and test) and its template object.
<P>

<P>
Then it starts drilling down the source tree starting from each top-level dir (aka parent dir) using the <b>os.walk()</b> function. It ignores .svn directories and sub-dirs that contain the special <b>helper.skip_dir</b> string. For each found sub-dir, a <b>Project</b> object is created and added to the project's list. This process demonstrates the flexibility of the build system generator. You can freely add new projects as long as they belong to one of the known project types and reside under the proper parent dir.

</pre>
<P>

<P>
Now let's take a look at the <b>Project</b> class -- a simple container to hold the project information. The most exciting thing it does is call the <b>DependencyAnalyzer</b> to get its dependencies and sort them.
<P>
<pre  class="code">
<P>
class Project(object):
  """The project class stores all build information of a single project
<P>
  A project has a name, a directory, a list of project templates
  and dependencies (other projects) that must be built before the project itself.
  """
  def __init__(self, path):
    self.path = path
    self.name = os.path.basename(path)
    self.templates = {}
    dependencies = \
      DependencyAnalyzer.get_project_dependencies(path,                                                                                  
                                                  'hw', 
                                                  &#91;source_dir&#93;)
    self.dependencies = sorted(dependencies)

</pre>
<P>

<P>
What's next? Generating the build files for all the projects. This is done by the <b>Generator</b>'s <b>generate_project()</b>, which iterates over all the projects and builds them one after the other by calling <b>_generate_project()</b>:
<P>
<pre  class="code">
  def generate_projects(self):
    title()
    for p in self.projects.values():
      self._generate_project(p)

</pre>
<P>

<P>
But what about the dependency graph? The projects are built in the order they were inserted into the list. In fact, the <b>_generate_project()</b> method is a pretty smart cookie and it builds all its dependencies before embarking on building the project it was asked to build. This method does the heavy lifting, so I'll review it piece by piece. First, it determines if the project was already generated. <b>project.generated</b> is a Boolean attribute initialized to False; when <b>_generate_project()</b> is called for the first time on a project, it is set to True. The check ensures that a given project will only be generated once. This is necessary because any given project may be a dependency of multiple projects.
<P>
<pre  class="code">
<P>
  def _generate_project(self, project):
    title(additional=os.path.basename(project.path))
    if project.generated:
      return
<P>
    project.generated = True

</pre>
<P>

<P>
In the next stage, all the source and header files associated with a project are collected. This process is build-system-specific, so the helper is invoked to perform it. If the project has no source files or header files, there is nothing to do and it bails out. Then the path separators (either \ or /) are replaced with the helper's separator character.
<P>
<pre  class="code">
<P>
    # Collect source and header files
    project.header_files, project.source_files = self.helper.collect_files(project.path)
<P>
    # Bail out on projects with no source and/or header files
    if project.header_files == &#91;&#93; and project.source_files == &#91;&#93;:
      return
<P>
    # Make sure the paths are correct
    project.source_files = self._fix_path_separators(project.source_files)
    project.header_files = self._fix_path_separators(project.header_files)

</pre>
<P>

<P>
The next stage ensures all the dependencies have been generated and iterates over them. If a dependency project hasn't been generated yet, the <b>_generate_project()</b> method is invoked recursively to generate it. The code doesn't detect circular dependencies at the moment, but it will not get stuck in an infinite loop because of the "generated" check. This is more an issue of code hygiene and might point to other bugs.
<P>
<pre  class="code">
<P>
    # Make sure all the dependencies are in the project list
    for d in project.dependencies:
      assert d in self.projects
<P>
    dependencies = &#91;self.projects&#91;d&#93; for d in project.dependencies&#93;
<P>
    # Make sure all dependencies have been generated
    # This is recursive. It terminates as long as we have no circular
    # dependencies
    # @todo detect circular dependency
    for dep in dependencies:
      if dep.generated:
        continue
      self._generate_project(dep)

</pre>
<P>

<P>
Finally, the project itself is generated. This means iterating over the project templates (there may be multiple build files per project, each with its own template), asking the helper to prepare a substitution dictionary based on various project parameters, its source and header files, and its dependencies list, and then applying the substitution dictionary to the template. The end result is that each template object now contains a textual build file.
<P>
<pre  class="code">
<P>
    # Generate the project build files by creating a substitution dict
    # and applying it to each template file
    h = self.helper
    for t in project.templates:
      #print t.relative_path
      d = h.prepare_substitution_dict(project.name,
                                      t.template_type,
                                      t.template_file,

                                      project.header_files,
                                      self.platform)
<P>
      d&#91;'Name'&#93; = project.name
      d&#91;'name'&#93; = project.name.lower()
      d&#91;'Platform'&#93; = self.platform
<P>
      t.substitution_dict = d
      t.apply()

</pre>
<P>

<P>
The ultimate goal of the project generation is to apply the substitution dictionary with all its values to the template object. Let's see how it works using the <b>Template class</b>. The <b>__init__()</b> method stores all the information, reads its template file, and stores it as a string. The <b>apply()</b> method uses Python's <b>string.Template</b> object to actually perform the substitution. We will examine what a template file looks like in the next installment.
<P>

All the projects have been generated and the template objects contain all the generated build files. It's time to save the files via the <b>Generator</b>'s <b>save_projects()</b> method. The method iterates over all the projects and within each project, it iterates over all the templates. It compares the generated build file against the exiting build file (if one exists), and if it's different and the <b>save</b> argument is True, it writes the new/modified build file.

If <b>save</b> is False and the build file was modified, the method goes into debugging mode and compares the existing build file against the generated file line by line and prints the results.

Last but not least is generation of the workspace files. A workspace is just a collection of projects. It's called a Solution in Visual Studio and project group. It may or may not be trivial depending on the particular build system. The helper is doing all the work here.

As you can see, the generic build system has a lot of logic that can be used to generate build files for any build system. The specific work for each build system is nicely encapsulated in the helper modules.


    

    <h4>DependencyAnalyzer.py</h4>

<P>
Let's examine the DependencyAnalyzer.py module. The entry point is the <b>get_project_depenencies()</b> function. It accepts a project_dir, the static libraries dir, the include search path, and a list of extensions. It returns a list of projects that the current project depends on. The algorithm is pretty simple: Get the dependencies of each file in the project (that has the right extension) and prune duplicates.

How do you find the dependencies of a file? Via a recursive scan of its <b>#include</b> statements. There is a little bit more going on, but the whole point of the exercise is to figure out what projects you depend on so you can build them. Various system <b>#include</b>s that have already built libraries are irrelevant. So, the prefix serves as a filter to limit the search to <b>#include</b> statements that include the prefix.

The <b>get_file_dependencies()</b> function uses the helper function <b>get_file_includes()</b> to get all the relevant <b>#include</b> statements. It uses a regular expression to match every line in the file. The regular expression is compiled using Python's <b>re</b> module and works with both double quotes (") and angled brackets (&lt; &gt;) around the included file. It can also handle leading whitespace and any following whitespace or comments. The regex also uses groups -- the parts in the expression surrounded by braces as in (.*). This allows the extraction of the interesting parts directly without further parsing of each line.
<P>

<P>
The entire function is a nice example for using regular expressions in Python. The result of a successful match is an object that contains a list of groups that are stored as a 3-tuple in the results and filtered according to the prefix.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<P>

<P>
This article discussed the architecture and implementation of the generic core of the ibs. It explored the implementation and demonstrated several interesting aspects of the architecture and the code: separating generic logic from custom logic using lightweight plug-ins (dynamically loaded helper modules), using templates (object can manage text files with placeholder and substitution dicts) to generate build files, and automatic discovery of dependencies using regular expressions to match <b>#include</b> statements.  The next article will delve into the implementation of a specific build system (NetBeans 6) within ibs and demonstrate how the sage development manager Isaac and the dedicated Bob "the Builder" use it to build their enterprise "Hello, World!" system.
