<h3><a href="9311a/9311a.htm">PERFORMANCE TUNING: SLUGGING IT OUT!</A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael R. Dunlavey</i><P>
When you think of performance tuning, what comes to mind? Handcoding in assembly language? Profiling? Fancy data structures? How about a process called &quot;deslugging&quot; for tracking down correct, but slow, code. In addition, Mike Armistead discusses profiler evolution.<P>
<h3><a href="9311b/9311b.htm">HEAP CHECKING</A></h3><P>
<i>by Steve Oualline</i><P>
Heap errors are among the most frustrating programming bugs you'll run up against. Steve presents libraries for intercepting heap-related calls and generating message logs.<P>
<h3><a href="9311c/9311c.htm">FINDING RUN-TIME MEMORY ERRORS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Taed Nelson</i><P>
Taed examines the problems arising from array-bounds violations--stack corruption, segmentation violations, and ultimately, programmer insanity. Although focusing on Purify 2.0, he also  looks at Insight, Sentinel, MemCheck, and Bounds-Checker.<P>
<h3><a href="9311d/9311d.htm">EAVESDROPPING ON INTERRUPTS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Rick Knoblaugh</i><P>
Rick's interrupt-monitoring program traps and logs interrupt activity, enabling your debugger or other program to gain control when specified interrupts occur.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9311e/9311e.htm">PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION</A></h3><P>
<i>by Roger Crooks</i><P>
Designers of high-performance embedded systems look for performance gains wherever they can be found. Roger examines why debugging RISC-based systems is complex, especially when caches are involved.<P>
<h2>NETWORK COMPUTING</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9311f/9311f.htm">A NETWARE CHAT UTILITY</A></h3><P>
<i>by Eduardo M. Serrat</i><P>
This utility lets you chat interactively with other users across Novell networks. You can call other users, accept or reject incoming calls, and even set up a conference chat via individual-user viewports.<P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9311g/9311g.htm">EXAMINING OPTLINK FOR WINDOWS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Matt Pietrek</i><P>
Optlink for Windows, a high-performance replacement for Microsoft's LINK.EXE and Borland's TLINK.EXE, provides optimizations that increase execution speed while reducing application size.<P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9311h/9311h.htm">DEBUGGING WINDOWS APPLICATIONS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Ray Valdes</i><P>
Ray discusses the tools and techniques he uses when figuring out what went wrong with his Windows apps. Ivan Gerencir adds his multi-application message trace facility for Windows.<P>
<h2>COLUMNS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9311i/9311i.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Swaine</i><P>
Michael puts forth this examination of why the Forth language is still a good choice for many applications, and how Forth relates to cellular automata, genetic algorithms, artificial life, and the game of Life.<P>
<h3><a href="9311j/9311j.htm">C PROGRAMMING</A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens</i><P>
Al unchains version 2.0 of is D-Flat++ library--a CUA-compliant library for DOS text mode implemented as a C++ class library. D-Flat++ applications run from a virtual desktop that contains a screen, a keyboard, a mouse, a clock, and a speaker, represented by classes in the library.<P>
<h3><a href="9311k/9311k.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY</A></h3><P>
<i>by Tom Swan</i><P>
From the year 1661 to today, palindromes are tit-4-tat backwards and forwards. When examining Windows file structures recently, Tom discovered that palindromes are the bases of a data-encryption method.<P>
<h3><a href="9311l/9311l.htm">UNDOCUMENTED CORNER</A></h3><P>
<i>edited by Andrew Schulman</i><P>
This month, Pawel Szczerbina looks at undocumented aspects of Novell's NetWare Core Protocol (NCP). When examining the so-called &quot;F2 interface,&quot; Pawel found hundreds of NCP functions, although Novell only documents the NCP Erase Files function.<P>
<h3><a href="9311m/9311m.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF</A></h3><P>
<i>by Peter D. Varhol</i><P>
Fuzzy logic is something to think about, and Bart Kosko's new book <I>Fuzzy Thinking</I> is a good place to start mulling it over.<P>

<h2>NEXT MONTH</h2><P>
Can we talk? Interoperability means that computer systems must be able to communicate with each other safely, efficiently, and securely. In December, we'll examine these issues--and more!<P>
