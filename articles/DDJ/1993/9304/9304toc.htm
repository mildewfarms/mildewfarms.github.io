<h2>FEATURES</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9304a/9304a.htm">ALGORITHMS FOR STEREOSCOPIC IMAGING by Victor J. Duvanenko and W. E. Robbins</A></h3><P>
Stereoscopic, or true 3-D, images take into account depth information that's  lost when conventional 3-D images are projected onto a PC's 2-D screen.  In  addition to discussing hardware and software stereoscopic requirements, our  authors present and implement algorithms for generating left- and right-eye  views fundamental to stereoscopic viewing.<P>
<h3><a href="9304b/9304b.htm">GENETIC ALGORITHMS AND DATABASE INDEXING by Joe Celko</A></h3><P>
Genetic algorithms mirror the natural selection process and just may be one  solution to the thorny problem of finding near-optimal indexes for database  applications.  Joe describes how this works and speculates on how existing  systems might use this genetic-algorithm technology.<P>
<h3><a href="9304c/9304c.htm">TEXT EDITORS: ALGORITHMS AND ARCHITECTURES by Ray Valdes</A></h3><P>
From Stallman's GnuEmacs to Microsoft's Word, text editors are one of the  most taken-for-granted, yet most often used, applications around.  When done  right, however, the choice of core algorithms and how they're implemented in  the overall architecture can make the difference between a good editor and a  great one.<P>
<h3><a href="9304d/9304d.htm">DIFFERENTIAL COMPRESSION ALGORITHMS by James H. Sylvester</A></h3><P>
At first glance, differential image compression suggests some degree of  graphics dependence. As James points out, however, a close look at  source-code implementations reveals that data need not be graphics related at  all.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9304e/9304e.htm">A WAVELET ANALYZER by Mac A. Cody</A></h3><P>
The wavelet analyzer is a variation of the spectrum analyzer, which uses fast  wavelet transforms rather than FFTs to analyze signals.  Mac implements the  fast wavelet transform as a recursive routine on a DSP board, then displays  the input signal and wavelet-transform coefficients as they're generated in  real time.<P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9304f/9304f.htm">ROUTING ALGORITHMS FOR INTERNETWORKING by William Stallings</A></h3><P>
When LANs and other networks are joined in an internet for distributed  processing, proper routing of packets from source to destination can become a  problem.  Bill examines Dijkstra's algorithm and describes how routing  protocols make use of it.<P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9304g/9304g.htm">MEASURING FRAGMENTATION by James Harrington</A></h3><P>
As a program dynamically allocates memory, available memory is subdivided and  fragmented into blocks - often leading to program failure.  James examines how  some popular compilers and memory managers handle fragmentation, then presents  a method for quantifying the degree of fragmentation.<P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9304h/9304h.htm">PROGRAMMING FOR THE OS/2 2.0 WORKPLACE SHELL by Joel Barnum</A></h3><P>
Joel details what you'll need to do to convert OS/2 1.x programs to work with  OS/2 2.0's Workplace Shell, the user-interface replacement for Presentation  Manager.  The datacentric Workplace Shell lets users manipulate data directly,  rather than first launching an executable and opening a data file.<P>
<h2>COLUMNS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9304i/9304i.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS by Michael Swaine</A></h3><P>
Is virtual reality in its various forms -- sight, sound, and touch -- the  psychedelic technology of the 90's?  Is it useful?  Is it addictive?  Or is it  just another white rabbit in a purple haze trying to sell more boxes?  Michael  dusts off his tie-dyed thinking cap to ponder these and other important  questions.<P>
<h3><a href="9304j/9304j.htm">C PROGRAMMING by Al Stevens</A></h3><P>
The D-Flat++ menu system is a hierarchical organization of related classes at  the top of which is the Application window.  After messing with MIDI, Al  presents this hierarchy of objects along with a D-Flatt++ application that  shows how an application program defines a menu.<P>
<h3><a href="9304k/9304k.htm">STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING by Jeff Duntemann</A></h3><P>
As the shower curtain falls on Jeff's column, he reflects on the world of  software development, how it has changed over the years, and where it all  might be heading.<P>
<h3><a href="9304l/9304l.htm">UNDOCUMENTED CORNER edited by Andrew Schulman</A></h3><P>
Andrew presents Mike Shiels's analysis of the underlying interface Microsoft  uses to implement the resident LAN Manager API, named pipes, and mailslot  interfaces, focusing on the &quot;undocumented&quot; interrupt 21h and interrupt 2Fh  function calls.<P>
<h3><a href="9304m/9304m.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF by Ray Duncan</A></h3><P>
Ray continues his travels over, under, and through the Internet and books  about it.  This month he examines The Internet Companion, Exploring the  Internet, and Internet: Mailing Lists.<P>
