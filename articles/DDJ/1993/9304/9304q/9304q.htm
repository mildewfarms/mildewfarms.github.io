<a name="011a_0002">Symmetric Research has announced three new high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) boards with 32-bit floating-point performance.  Each includes software for developing DSP applications.<P>
The DSP_400 and DSP_MOD coprocessor boards feature a 25-Mflop AT&amp;T DSP32C CPU. They have up to eight Mbytes of zero wait state on-board memory, ideal for applications that require large amounts of high-speed memory.  The DSP_400 uses individual memory chips, and the DSP_MOD board uses memory modules.  Both boards come with 12.5-MHz 32-bit parallel ports that allow direct data transfers to on-board memory.  The DSP_MUL multiple DSP32C board has four 50-MHz 32-bit DSP32C and 100-Mflop performance that combine multichannel data acquisition and number-crunching power.<P>
The software included in each package includes an assembler/compiler, symbolic debugger, C and Fortran utility and math libraries, and a 1024x768, 256-color graphics library for displaying time series and 2-D color images.<P>
The DSP_400 and DSP_MOD cost $950.00; the DSP_MUL sells for $1400.00.  All packages include source code.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

The <a name="011a_0009">Microsoft Windows Sound System, a set of software applications and an add-in sound board, allows you to add audio features such as voice annotation, proofreading, and voice recognition to your applications using Windows' Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). The system consists of several utilities and three applications: Quick Recorder, ProofReader, and Voice Pilot.<P>
Quick Recorder generates and adds voice annotations to documents and files.  Using OLE, it inserts sound objects into a file.  To add voice annotation to a document, you record a message, then drag and drop its icon into the document.  You can customize the message icon and edit the annotations.  Quick Recorder automatically selects a recording sample rate and compression appropriate to voice recordings to help conserve harddisk space.  It also works with external devices such as audio CD players and cassette decks, which let you add other sounds to your recordings.<P>
ProofReader provides audible proofing of numbers and common spreadsheet terms with a high-quality human voice.  ProofReader works with Microsoft Excel and Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows and can be customized in several ways, including adjusting the speed and adding your own dictionary of terms.<P>
Voice Pilot lets you execute commands by voice, navigating through the Windows OS via limited voice recognition.  It controls customized commands, allowing you to insert standard text into a document upon command.  A training mode is also available to adapt to different accents or pronunciations.  Voice Pilot comes with a predefined vocabulary for 15 Windows-based applications<P>
Additional utilities include: SoundFinder, for locating and modifying audio files from various formats, recording control, volume control, a sound-control panel, a sound and icon library, and more.<P>
The Sound System costs $289.00; bundled with Windows, it's $349.00.  Reader service no. 27.<P>

The Btrv++ class library from <a name="011a_000a">Classic Software is an access library for use with the Novell Btrieve Record Manager that provides C++ class encapsulation of Novell Btrieve.  Included with Btrv++ is Btrvgen++, its database code generation system.  Btrv++ gives you access to the complete functionality of Btrieve 5.1 and incorporates many extensions to Btrieve such as memory management and event-logging facilities.<P>
Btrvgen++ is a Windows-hosted program for building a data dictionary that describes the tables, columns, keys, and relationships in their databases and then generates source code for C++ classes that encapsulate the tables and the database schema.  The generated classes for a typical small database contain hundreds of functions that support the database.  For each table, Btrvgen++ generates a class containing record and column access functions, keyed get-data functions, utility functions, file open and close functions, and functions that support the table's relationships.  Utility functions are included for cascading delete, record-count, and full-file iteration, and relationship functions are generated for most common relationship access needs.<P>
Also new from Classic is the VBtrv Custom Control Library, an access library for use under Visual Basic.  VBtrv's features are accessible either through a custom Toolbox control or through library function calls.  The custom control interface and the library interface can be used in the same VB program.<P>
With VBtrv, commonly used structures and constants are predefined in the declarations file, startup and shutdown protocols required by Btrieve under Windows are automated, and Btrieve's single-function-call interface is replaced by an easy-to-understand interface that defines a separate event handler for each operation.  All take standard VB data types as arguments. VBtrv provides controls on the Visual Basic toolbar that represent Btrieve itself and a Btrieve file.  Btrieve access is through predefined methods associated with the control.<P>
Btrv++ sells for $349.00, Btrvgen++ for $229.00.  VBtrv costs $249.00.  Reader service no. 28.<P>

Now shipping from <a name="011a_000b">Reasoning Systems is version 1.2 of REFINE/FORTRAN, a reverse-engineering workbench for UNIX workstations.  REFINE/FORTRAN can analyze Fortran code and generate design information for StP, an analysis and design toolset from IDE.  With REFINE/FORTRAN you can use StP to document and maintain Fortran systems as if they had been developed using StP. StP's C development environment (CDE) uses the design information from REFINE/FORTRAN to automatically generate StP design diagrams and populate the StP shared repository.  You can then use CDE's design editors to browse and edit the design and navigate between design and code.  This simplifies system maintenance and makes the code more understandable.  You can also use CDE to generate complete documentation for FrameMaker and Interleaf5 automatically and to synchronize the Fortran source with StP's design information. This lets work be done incrementally, ensuring that all changes or additions to the code are automatically reflected in StP and that the previous design is preserved.  CDE also lets you search part or all of StP's shared repository and generate C code templates.<P>
The price is $4900.00 per user on Sun SPARC stations and servers.  You'll also need IDE's Structured Design, C Navigator, and Design Generator for C that sell for $5000.00, $2000.00, and $6000.00, respectively.  Reader service no. 29.<P>
