<a name="011c_0002"><a name="011c_0000">Hey, guys!  I'm home!<P>
It's me, HyperCard!  I'm back at Apple!  Hyper days are here again!  Is this my desk?  Whoa, the work's really been stacking up.  Stacking up, get it?  Is there any coffee?<P>
Tell Danny Goodman to call off the telethon.  Tell Bill Atkinson it's okay to come home now.  The old Wild Card is back and the good times are gonna scroll.  Boogaloo down Bandley.  Yow, lotta messages here.  Right off the top of the screen, even with my new large card size. Later for that.  Can somebody show me around?  I know there have been some changes since I went to Claris.  I want to get up to speed.<P>
So let me see if I've got this straight.  Centris and Quadra and Performa and PowerBook are lines of Macintoshes.  A Quadra 800, say, is a model in a line.  A Centris 650 8/230 E CD is a configuration of a model in a line.  It's sort of like species, genus, family, order, and so forth, isn't it?  So where does the Apple II fit in?  Is it sort of like a fungus?<P>
This is Newton?  Are you telling me this is the Newton everybody's been talking about?  Hey, I know this kid!  We were in adjacent cribs back in the nursery!  Atkinson thought we'd get together when we grew up.  Maybe we will, if he ever does grow up.  What a shrimp.  Hey, homeboy!<P>
Doesn't say much, does he?  Still in beta?<P>
System software, right.  I heard that Apple was turning into a system software company.  No, wait.  That was Next.  Sorry.  I've been a little out of touch over at Claris.  So show me some system software.  I'm stoked.  Let's book.<P>
Could you run that one by me again?  What you said about AppleScript?  I didn't quite get it.<P>
When you say, &quot;integrated with AppleScript,&quot; just exactly what do you have in mind?  I mean, don't you think that's a little vague?  &quot;Integrated with?&quot;  If I'm going to work with AppleScript, I want it clear who's working for whom, and there's only one right answer to that.  I hope you know that I don't like to throw my weight around, but I didn't lose my seniority during my sojourn at Claris, okay?  'Nuff said.<P>
Where are we now?  What is this place?  This isn't Apple.  The sign outside said Taligent. What's a Taligent?<P>
I'm sorry I asked.  Apple is working with IBM?  That's about as spooky as if the head of system software were to defect to Microsoft, or Apple started pricing its machines to compete with Dell and Compaq.<P>
You don't say?<P>
Hey, what's this box?  Now I call that a nice looking Mac.  I particularly like the latch  with the Frog design on it.  But what's that label say?  INTEL INSIDE!?!?<P>
Whew.  Had me going there for a minute.  It wasn't until I tried to touch that &quot;Intel Mac&quot; and my hand went right through it that it even occurred to me that it might all be a virtual reality model.  Nice work.  The gang in ATG, right?  Took me in completely.  Good job, guys.<P>
So--just how much of it was real, anyway?<P>
