A group of eight companies including Borland, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, SCO, Watcom, MetaWare, and Lotus has formed a new consortium called the Tools Interface Standards (TIS) committee and will publish the TIS 1.0 specification.  The committee was formed to define a standard set of 32-bit tool interfaces across multiple platforms that include UNIX, 32-bit Windows, and OS/2 in order to improve portability and interoperability among development tools.<P>
The 1.0 specification standardizes the first linkable, loadable, and debug formats, an area considered by industry observers to be highly fragmented.  The formats, which are considered to be both portable and widely used, include the relocatable object-module format (OMF), the executable linkable format (ELF), and DWARF, a debug information format originally developed at AT&amp;T.  The TIS committee has also agreed upon Microsoft's PE and Symbol and Type Information (STI) for the Windows environment.  Future directions for the TIS committee include a look at the transition to 64-bit environments as well as object-oriented interface standards.<P>
Copies of the TIS specification are available from the Intel Literature Center (order number 241597) or through Intel ACCESS on CompuServe.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

Orion Instruments is making available, free of charge, a 55-page booklet entitled &quot;Real-Time Debugging Techniques,&quot; authored by Orion founder Thomas R. Blakeslee.  The booklet covers numerous techniques that enable developers to efficiently debug embedded systems.  These techniques are particularly important in a real-time environment where a breakpoint can have undesirable effects.  The booklet covers real-time monitoring, analyzer traces, and symptom triggering.  While most, if not all, of the techniques described in the booklet are features in Orion's Emulator/Analyzer product family, the techniques are general enough to be useful in other development environments that integrate in-circuit emulation with (unintrusive) real-time tracing.  Reader service no. 22.<P>

SLR Systems has announced OPTLINK 4.0 for Windows.  OPTLINK, a drop-in replacement for either Microsoft's Link or Borland's TLink.  It supports any compiler or assembler that generates standard .OBJ files as well as Phar Lap and Rational's 286 DOS extenders.  OPTLINK can generate 16-bit DOS, OS/2, and Windows executables and DLLs.  DOS-extended executables can also be targeted.  Version 4.0 features high-capacity linking, faster link times, and an extended set of link directives to build smaller executables that can load faster.  OPTLINK also supports both Turbo Debugger and Codeview debug formats.  OPTLINK 4.0 features a switch that supports &quot;exepacking&quot; for Windows executables.  Exepacking reduces both the load time and file size of the executable while eliminating the linker's second RC pass.  Other switches packcode and farcalltranslation combine data segments and convert intrasegment calls to near calls.<P>
In a related announcement, SLR has begun shipping their OPTLIB Superfast Library Manager. OPTLIB, which specifically supports Visual C++, features time-based module replacement, an enhanced cross-reference output that lists all module references, as well as where public symbols are defined and referenced.  OPTLINK is available for $350.00 and OPTLIB is priced at $199.00.  Reader service no. 23.<P>

Intel and Nestor have delivered to DARPA samples of the Ni1000, a jointly developed, 1024-neuron, neural-network chip.  With more than 3 million transistors, the Ni1000 can perform 20 billion integer operations per second.<P>
The companies claim that Ni1000-based character recognition can achieve recognition rates of up to 10,000 characters per second, far greater than the 10 to 100 characters per second typical of most PC-based recognition software.  The chip uses a large block of Flash memory so that learned patterns can be memorized and quickly recalled for real-time pattern-recognition applications.  Learning capability is implemented on-chip in the form of a 16-bit microcontroller.  Reader service no. 24.<P>

OnTime Marketing recently announced the release of RTKernel 4.0, a real-time multitasking kernel that runs under DOS.  RTKernel, which supports most popular Pascal and C compilers including Microsoft, Borland, and Stony Brook, is a library that when linked to a host application allows it to run in parallel with an arbitrary number of tasks.<P>
RTKernel also supports Borland Pascal 7.0's protected-mode capability, under which tasks can use the full 16 Mbytes of memory.  Additionally, more than 2000 tasks can run concurrently and have unrestricted access to DOS for things like file I/O.  RTKernel transparently resolves re-entrancy problems without degrading system performance.<P>
RTKernel features a priority-and event-driven scheduler.  Task switches can be initiated by the exchange of messages, interrupts triggered by hardware, or optionally, by time-slicing. The task-switch time is independent of the number of tasks running.  Intertask communication is handled by using semaphores, message-passing, and mailboxes, and tasks can be activated in, for example, a fixed time frame by the scheduler.<P>
RTKernel also comes with drivers for the timer, serial ports, printer, keyboard, screen, Novell LANs.  All drivers come with complete source code.  Additionally, existing drivers supplied by the hardware vendor can be used, or custom drivers can be implemented using the Kernel's open API.  RTKernel-Pascal is priced at $445.00 with source code available for an additional $375.00.  RTKernel-C is available for $495.00 (add $445.00 for source).  Reader service no. 25.<P>

RUNOS2, recently released by Flashtek, lets programmers convert certain 32-bit OS/2 2.0 applications into self-contained, dual-mode executables that operate under either OS/2 2.0 or DOS.  A special stub executable that contains a DOS extender attached to the text-mode OS/2 EXE file makes this possible.<P>
When executing under DOS, the stub executable supports a subset of approximately 50 OS/2 function calls.  It will support up to 2.5 gigabytes of virtual memory; 80387 emulation is available for floating-point applications.  RUNOS2 also supports all DOS extended-memory allocation standards, including DPMI, VCPI, XMS, and INT 15.  In addition to supporting approximately 50 OS/2 functions, RUNOS2 supports all ANSI and POSIX 1003.1 functions in the runtime libraries of supported compilers.<P>
RUNOS2 is being incorporated into Flashtek's X32VM DOS Extender, which sells for $250.00. Reader service no. 26.<P>

Exceptions for C, a C library that provides Ada-like exception handling, has been released by Koyn Software.  The library lets programmers provide a separate exception handler for a block of code and raise exceptions from within the block or from functions called from the block. When an exception is raised, control passes to the exception handler of the most-recently entered block providing one.  Exceptions may be passed up the function call stack with a reraise operation.  The library is compatible with any ANSI-standard-compliant C compiler. Single copies of the library sell for $29.95; site licenses are available for an additional $5.95.  Reader service no. 31.<P>
