<a name="02a2_0001"><a name="02a2_0000">Microway has released NDP Fortran-90, a 32-bit Fortran-90 compiler for protected mode DOS, OS/2, DesqView, and UNIX. NDP Fortran-90, optimized for Intel 32-bit processors (386, 486, Pentium, and i860), supports ANSI X3J3 specifications for array syntax and operations, pointers (alias techniques similar to C++'s reference operator), free formatted source code, CASE and DO statements, improved I/O, dynamic storage, and user-defined types. NDP Fortran-90 also provides C-like functions, recursion, and module definitions enabling you to encapsulate logic and functionality.<P>
Additionally, Microway is shipping NDP Lapack, a linear algebra library package used for analysis and solution of systems of simultaneous linear algebraic equations, linear least-squares problems, and matrix Eigenvalue problems. In all, NDP Lapack, which is a complete rewrite of Linpack, contains over 1000 routines, including support for single- and double-precision, complex, and complex*16.<P>
NDP Fortran-90 sells for $295.00 while NDP Lapack costs $150.00 for either the royalty-free binary library or source-code distribution, or $250.00 for both. Microway is offering a white paper which details the Fortran-90 improvements, and includes code examples and optimization tips. Reader service no. 20.<P>

If you're looking for lots of low-cost storage capabilities, but CD-ROM doesn't meet your read/write needs, low-cost digital-audio tape (DAT) may be the solution to your problems. To this end, DataImage has released Sail-SDK, a C library that allows programmers to integrate high-storage capacities and direct retrieval capabilities of digital data storage 4mm DAT drives into DOS or Windows applications. One unique aspect of the DataImage approach is that, although the data is stored sequentially, users can retrieve information by direct access via a DLL (for Windows) or run-time library (for DOS).<P>
The SDK provides an interface that supports a maximum of seven DAT SCSI drives. The 36 functions supported by the API include those for system initialization, backup/restore operations, read/write, querying the hardware, and the like. The current generation of reusable DAT cassettes provide 4 Gigabytes of storage and sell for about $20.00 each. The SDK sells for $750.00. Reader service no. 21.<P>

A Windows-compatible version of the Prime Factor Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) subroutine library has been announced by Alligator Technologies. Prime Factor uses the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform, and a DFT to allow analysis of any data-set size. The package can also be used to transform any data-type array, including floating-point data types from 4 to 10 bytes as well as integer data types from 2 to 8 bytes. With an added DLL, Prime Factor supports compilers such as Visual Basic, Visual C++, Turbo C++ for Windows, and Borland C++ for Windows.<P>
Prime Factor FFT performs one- and two-dimensional FFTs on arrays up to the allocatable, protected-mode extended-memory space. It optimizes execution by automatically detecting math processor type, and subroutines are handcoded in assembly language for speed and accuracy. Sample programs are provided in Basic and C. Prime Factor FFT sells for $395.00. Reader service no. 22.<P>

CS-MAP 5.0, a system-mapping library from Mentor Software, now supports multiple regression for conversion of international geographic coordinates between any of the 48 geodetic data supported. Version 5.0 adds six more features, such as enabling applications to convert NAD27-based (North American Datum of 1927) grid coordinates to HARN-based (High Accuracy Reference Network) grid coordinates in one pass through the data. CS-MAP supports the Canadian National Transformation for converting Canadian coordinates based on NAD27 to NAD83. It computes the grid-scale factor, convergence angle, and calculates the actual geodetic azimuth and distance defined by two geographic locations. CS-MAP 5.0 sells for $450.00.

TAPI, the Telephony Applications Programming Interface, will provide a standard set of functions for developing phone-control applications in Windows. TAPI, which was proposed by Intel and Microsoft, effectively provides a standard way to integrate the telephone and PC. Among the type of products TAPI will likely spawn are: visual call control for call forwarding, conference and call transfer; integration of e-mail, voice mail, and fax; desktop audio and video conferencing; and wide area networking that allows PCs to use the telephone network for both voice and data transmission.<P>
Version 1.0 of the specification is available on CompuServe in the Intel Access Forum (type GO INTELACCESS). Alternatively, you can get a copy by FAXing the Windows Telephony Coordinator at Microsoft (206-936-7329), or by sending e-mail to <I>telephon@microsoft.com</I>. Reader service no. 31.<P>
