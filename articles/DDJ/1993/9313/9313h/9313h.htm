<a name="03aa_0002"><a name="03aa_0000">Whenever you see Microsoft and Borland on the same playing field, the first thought that comes to mind is that &quot;it's war.&quot;  This time, however, the so-called &quot;battle&quot; over whose API will bridge the gap between PC databases and the rest of the relational world may be nothing more than a short-lived skirmish.  At the front lines of this alleged battle are Microsoft's Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) API and Borland's Integrated Database Application Programming Interface (IDAPI).  Both claim to be extensions of the Call Level Interface (CLI), a standard proposed by a group of some 40 vendors calling themselves the SQL Access Group.  Both companies are members of this consortium and both are proposing extensions to CLI.<P>
For the record, the mission of the SQL Access Group is to allow developers (and users) to get at data stored in different for mats that resides on disparate platforms.  CLI, which uses SQL to access various database environments, is that common denominator.  Microsoft's ODBC extends CLI's 22 core functions with an additional 29 functions to support things like large data objects, asynchronous requests, and scrollable cursors.  By writing a single driver that supports ODBC, the database vendor can effectively create a software IC that plugs into an ODBC socket.  According to Microsoft, the ODBC specification and feature set are documented and openly available to developers and DBMS providers.  Worthy of note is that the specification, which comes in the form of a Windows SDK, is available free of charge from Microsoft.  (For details, call 206-936-2655.)<P>
Borland counters that although the ODBC specification is publicly available, its current implementation is in Windows.  Therefore, it's up to operating-system suppliers to support ODBC on their specific platform.  IDAPI, on the other hand, will support a heterogeneous environment and rely on a common API to communicate with various servers, database engines, and drivers.  Borland claims that this will result in less code redesign for database implementors going from one platform to another.  IDAPI also features a request/responder mechanism to cooperate in a (Novell) network environment, and it will integrate ODBC, which will allow developers to automatically hook into ODBC drivers.<P>
When it's available, IDAPI will initially support OS/2 2.x, Windows, DOS, and Netware.  But unlike ODBC, an IDAPI SDK has yet to hit the streets.  Borland plans to deliver an early SDK to partners in the second quarter of '93, with final shipment expected in July.<P>
<h3><a name="03aa_0004">It's Who You Know<a name="03aa_0004"></h3><P>
When Microsoft speaks out, it's worth listening.  Ultimately, though, what counts is who falls into line--and on that score, Microsoft is doing quite well.  For example, Digital Equipment Corporation announced that it is jointly developing an ODBC client driver for DEC's Rdb/VMS database.  This follows an earlier announcement between the two companies to align DEC's Network Application Support (NAS) with Microsoft's Windows Open Services Architecture (WOSA). NAS includes APIs, toolkits, and the like so developers can port their software to other platforms including UNIX, Sun, OpenVMS, and OS/2.<P>
In addition to DEC, Apple announced in the second half of '92 that it would provide ODBC services within their Data Access Manager (DAM).  Apple also plans to build a Macintosh ODBC client that translates ODBC calls into its SQL-based language called Data Access Language (DAL).  DAL, part of Apple's VITAL integration framework, currently accesses 12 different relational databases.  And as if that weren't enough, Apple will additionally develop an ODBC/DAL client for Windows that Microsoft will distribute.<P>
In Borland's corner are some well-known partners such as IBM (which hopes to promote its OS/2 product as a viable database platform) and Novell (which is throwing Netware and Btrieve into the fray).  Wordperfect has also announced support of IDAPI, but then, both Wordperfect and Novell have said they'll support ODBC, too.  In answering the question of why, however, it's unlikely that these two are just covering their bases.  That's because Pioneer Software, another company that has announced support of both CLI extensions, will be providing the glue between these two interfaces.  Pioneer, which already provides connectivity products that support nearly 20 database formats, has developed its Idapter technology that will permit ODBC database drivers to be used with IDAPI-enabled applications.<P>

Interoperability is now the name of the game.  It's the thing that deals are made of, and it's the stuff that forges alliances between the likes of Apple and Microsoft.  And no matter how you see it, we stand to benefit anytime Microsoft and Borland match up.  In this case, developers will be able to support more platforms, operating systems, and networks with fewer changes to their source code, while users get what they want: heterogeneous data access and interoperability amongst database plat forms.  But, is it war?  Only as long as competing vendors think opposing each other is more important than helping users.  Are ODBC and IDAPI mutually exclusive?  Not as long as CLI continues to gain momentum.  Will you miss out because you've invested too much in the wrong technology?  Not necessarily.  This looks to be one instance where the stakes are so high that rumors of war remain just that, and competing technologies and vendors agree to a peaceful middle ground.<P>
