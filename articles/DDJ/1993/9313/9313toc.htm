<h3><a href="9313a/9313a.htm"> OBJECT-ORIENTED DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS</A><br>by Al Stevens</h3><P>
Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMSs) are coming of age,  even though, as Al finds out, there's no agreed upon definition of what they  really are.  Al explores the world of  OODBMSs by examining three toolsets  from the developer's perspective--Code Farms' C/C++ Libraries 3.2, Raima's  Object Manager 1.1, and BKS's POET 2.0.<P>
<h3><a href="9313b/9313b.htm">PROTOTYPING AND PROGRAMMING DATABASE  SYSTEMS</A><br>by Miles Dempsey</h3><P>
It's a cold war out there, as Miles discovered when implementing a client/server  application for a major steel company.  Miles describes the manufacturing  process he had to automate, the architecture of that system, the software tools  used, the application prototyping and coding process, and the database  implementation.<P>
<h3><a href="9313c/9313c.htm">BUILDING A DATABASE FILE VIEWER</A><br>by Michael Floyd</h3><P>
DDJ's executive editor presents a data-file viewer--built with Borland's Paradox  Engine 3.0 database engine and Borland Pascal 7.0 with Objects--that reads  and displays just about any Paradox database table in its current state.<P>
<h3><a href="9313d/9313d.htm">DATABASE TUNING: PRINCIPLES AND SURPRISES</A><br>by Dennis Shasha</h3><P>
Dennis presents a principled foundation for tuning database systems using  techniques based not only on his own experiences, but on the expertise of  tuning consultants affiliated with companies such as Oracle, IBM, Sybase,  Ingres, Servio, and O2 Technology.<P>
<h3><a href="9313e/9313e.htm">EXTENDING FOXPRO</A><br>by Michael Brachman</h3><P>
The FoxPro API lets you add functions and features that can improve  performance and provide support for graphics, serial communications,  encryption, compression, network, and more. Michael examines the API and  shows you how to make the most of it.<P>
<h3><a href="9313f/9313f.htm">HYPERCARD DATABASE TUNING</A><br>by Jeff Elliott</h3><P>
HyperCard's built-in database doesn't need to be slow.  Jeff shows you how to  speed up searches on your Macintosh using linked lists implemented in  HyperCard's scripting language.<P>
<h3><a href="9313g/9313g.htm">EVENT-DRIVEN DATABASE PROGRAMMING IN  C++</A><br>by Dirk Bartels</h3><P>
Dirk argues that event-driven environments are making information storage  and retrieval demands that today's relational database model can't meet.  It's his  premise that object-oriented database systems (OODBMSs) do meet these new  demands by providing special features for concurrence control.<P>
