<h3><a href="9307a/9307a.htm">MORPHING IN 2-D AND 3-D</A></h3><P>
<i>by Valerie Hall</i><P>
From music videos to graphics software, <I>morphing</I> is changing the face of computer graphics. Valerie examines the major approaches to shape-changing software, covering both 2-D and 3-D techniques. We also describe George Wolberg's C implementation of his 2-D warping algorithm and Richard Goedeken's Rmorf, a DOS-based morphing program.<P>
<h3><a href="9307b/9307b.htm">VGA PALETTE MAPPING USING BSP TREES</A></h3><P>
<i>by Mark Betz</i><P>
Simultaneously displaying multiple images--each of which uses a different VGA video color palette--requires a process known as &quot;best-fit color matching.&quot; Mark presents a best-fit approach that's based on a data structure known as a &quot;binary space-partitioning&quot; (BSP) tree, then uses C++ to build a BSP tree to remap the colors in PCX files.<P>
<h3><a href="9307c/9307c.htm">COLOR MODELS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Bruce Schneier</i><P>
RGB isn't the only game in town, at least when it comes to color models. Bruce examines alternatives to RGB, including CMY, HSV, HLS, and YIQ, and discusses how you get from one to another. Harry Smith adds insight on the HVC color model.<P>
<h3><a href="9307d/9307d.htm">IMAGE PROCESSING USING QUADTREES</A></h3><P>
<i>by Raj Kumar Dash</i><P>
When it comes to raster-image processing, quadtrees provide reasonable storage savings while retaining an image's hierarchical information without loss of detail. This means you can perform image-processing operations and transfer the results when converting the quadtree back into a raster image. These characteristics are particularly useful when you're processing several images too large for storage in main memory.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9307e/9307e.htm">DEBUGGING REAL-TIME SYSTEMS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Joseph M. Newcomer</i><P>
When building complex real-time systems, there are a number of analysis and programming techniques that guarantee correct performance, among them informative breakpoints, in-core event traces, and timer dividing.<P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9307f/9307f.htm">DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING NOW: DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Lowell S. Schneider</i><P>
Last month, Lowell discussed the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and the Earth Data System (EDS), applications typical of emerging distributed computing systems. This month, he looks under the hood and examines tools and techniques required to build large-scale distributed systems.<P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9307g/9307g.htm">EXTENDING STANDARDS FOR CD-ROM </A></h3><P>
<i>by Lynne Greer Jolitz</i><P>
Although ISO-compliant CD-ROMs are interchangeable and usable on any type of system, the minimalism that made the ISO-9660 standard successful is sometimes too minimal. Consequently, the Rock Ridge Group and others have developed extensions to give new life to CD-ROMs.<P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9307h/9307h.htm">A MULTIMEDIA CLASS LIBRARY FOR WINDOWS</A></h3><P>
<i>by John Musser</i><P>
John enhances the Windows Media Control Interface to multimedia devices by designing and implementing a comprehensive C++ class library that provides object support for multimedia. The result is a set of objects that make programming multimedia easier and more robust, concise, and maintainable.<P>
<h2>COLUMNS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9307i/9307i.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Swaine</i><P>
You'd think they'd know better. After themselves suffering the barbs of philosophical arrows, Bayesian statisticians turned on fuzzy logic and its proponents with much the same fury that they were originally attacked.<P>
<h3><a href="9307j/9307j.htm">C PROGRAMMING </A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens</i><P>
Before filling in some gaps in the history of C, Al examines C++ templates--generic classes that take on meaning when they are compiled to support objects of some other concrete class.<P>
<h3><a href="9307k/9307k.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY</A></h3><P>
<i>by Tom Swan</i><P>
Despite advances in data-compression techniques, more often than not it's the combination of selected algorithms--along with knowledge of a data file's contents--that produces optimal results.<P>
<h3><a href="9307l/9307l.htm">UNDOCUMENTED CORNER</A></h3><P>
<i>edited by Andrew Schulman</i><P>
Mike Maurice looks under the Windows hood to explore undocumented aspects of the Program Information File (PIF) format. PIF files contain information--flags, byte quantities, and the like--that guides the operating environment in starting and running DOS applications.<P>
<h3><a href="9307m/9307m.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF</A></h3><P>
<i>by Ray Vald&eacute;s</i><P>
Ray examines two recently released, graphics-related books: <I>Graphics Gems III</I>, edited by David Kirk, and <I>Fractal Image Compression</I>, by Michael Barnsley and Lyman Hurd.<P>
