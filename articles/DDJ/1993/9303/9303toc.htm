<hr>
<h2>FEATURES</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9303a/9303a.htm">THE FLIC FILE FORMAT by Jim Kent</A></h3><P>
As their name suggests,  flic files are a sequence of still frames which can  be rapidly flipped through to achieve the illusion of movement  - the software  equivalent of movies. Among the applications and tools that support the flic  file format are the Autodesk's Animator, IBM's Ultimedia Tool Series, and  Microsoft's Video for Windows.<P>
<h3><a href="9303b/9303b.htm">FILE CONVERSION USING C++ TEMPLATES by Timothy Butterfield</A></h3><P>
Tim shows how C++ templates can be used to build parser-based &quot;black box&quot;  conversion class that allows you to use various data types and processes  without having to rewrite the basics of the conversion engine for each new  combination.<P>
<h3><a href="9303c/9303c.htm">COMPOUND DOCUMENTS by Lowell Williams</A></h3><P>
Compound documents contain a mixture of different data - text, line art,  raster graphics (images), tabular data, and even audio and video.  Lowell  makes the case that the now-familiar ASCII can no longer fulfill its role as  a universal document-interchange standard and that we should begin examining  compound ASCII alternatives like ODL, SGML, and CDA.<P>
<h3><a href="9303d/9303d.htm">DESIGNING COMPLEX DATACENTRIC APPLICATIONS by Paul Bonneau</A></h3><P>
Paul discusses the data structures and client/server architecture of  HyperChem, a molecular modeling tool that runs on PCs and Silicon Graphics  workstations.  Implemented in about 500,000 lines of C code, HyperChem lets  you create three-dimensional atomic structures, visualize and manipulate their  structural relationships, and perform classical and semi-empirical, quantum  mechanical calculations.<P>
<h3><a href="9303e/9303e.htm">A DOS REDIRECTOR FOR SCSI CD-ROM by Jim Harper</A></h3><P>
Getting data from CD-ROM to where your application can use it isn't  straightforward under MS-DOS.  Jim examines how this process works under DOS,  then presents the code for an MSCDEX-like extension to MS-DOS that allows  access to either High Sierra or ISO-9660 CD-ROMs.  This redirector works in  conjunction with a TSR-based driver for SCSI devices.<P>
<h3><a href="9303f/9303f.htm">JULIAN AND GREGORIAN CALENDARS  by Peter J.G. Meyer</A></h3><P>
Peter presents a C function which converts any date within an 11-million-year  period in either the Gregorian calendar or the Julian calendar into a unique  number in the range of approximately -2,000,000,000 through 2,000,000,000.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9303g/9303g.htm">TOOLS FOR EMBEDDED-SYSTEMS DEBUGGING by Christopher Perez</A></h3><P>
Tools such as microprocessor in-circuit emulators, microprocessor on-chip  debug circuitry, an logic analyzers can make the tough job of embedded-systems  designers easier.  Chris focuses on the JTAG specification and techniques for  getting the most of logic analyzers.<P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9303h/9303h.htm">INSIDE BTRIEVE FILES by Douglas Reilly</A></h3><P>
Knowing something about Btrieve's undocumented features can make the  difference between success and failure when it comes to recovery of damaged  Btrieve-compressed records.<P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9303i/9303i.htm">EXAMINING PC AUDIO by John W. Ratclif</A></h3><P>
There's a lot of noise being made about the need for software support for  sound.  John examines the options available to PC programmers, then presents  a sound driver that produces high-quality digitized sound without requiring  any extra hardware.<P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9303j/9303j.htm">PROXY: A SCHEME-BASED PROTOTYPING LANGUAGE by Burt Leavenworth</A></h3><P>
Proxy, a Scheme-based interactive language with a C-like syntax, provides all  the high-level data structures - sets, maps, sequences, and objects - useful  for software design and prototyping.  In addition to showing you how the  language can be used in a typical prototyping session, Burt gives you the  Proxy interpreter.<P>
<h2>COLUMNS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9303k/9303k.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS by Michael Swaine</A></h3><P>
The basic idea behind visual programming is , &quot;What you see is what you'll  make.&quot;  Michael examines the this paradigm, using Serius's development tools  for the Macintosh.<P>
<h3><a href="9303l/9303l.htm">C PROGRAMMING by Al Stevens</A></h3><P>
More D-Flat++ control classes are presented this month, in particular those  that provide support for pop-down menus, dialing boxes, radio and command  buttons, the check box, and the base class for buttons.<P>
<h3><a href="9303m/9303m.htm">STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING by Jeff Duntemann</A></h3><P>
Jeff looks at client/server database management and examines the APIs ranging  from SQL to DLLs.  He then speculates on what kind of database support Pascal  vendors should begin thinking about.<P>
<h3><a href="9303n/9303n.htm">UNDOCUMENTED CORNER edited by Andrew Schulman</A></h3><P>
In his inaugural column, Andrew presents Joe Newcomer and Bruce Horn's  analysis of the undocumented RGNOBJ structure in Microsoft Windows.  The  region feature, which is maintained by the Windows GDI, is an arbitrarily-bounded area that can be used for filling, outlining, and clipping.<P>
<h3><a href="9303o/9303o.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF by Ray Valdes</A></h3><P>
Ray examines books that focus on artificial life: Artificial Life II, Emergent  Computation, and John Holland's 1992 edition of Adoption on Natural and  Artificial  Systems.<P>
