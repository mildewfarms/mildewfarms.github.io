Now available from Q/Media is Q/Media for Windows, a multimedia presentation program.  Both the regular and professional versions integrate video, animation, audio, imaging, graphics, and text from Windows, DOS, and Macintosh applications to create presentations on PCs running Windows 3.1.<P>
Q/Media for Windows supports Microsoft's Video for Windows digital video software; the professional version also supports Microsoft's Modular Windows.  The MCI device driver lets you embed Q/Media Pro movies into other applications.<P>
Using Q/Media for Windows, you can create presentations or add video, animation, and audio to presentations already created in other programs.  With Q/Media Pro, developers can create interactive presentations and multimedia titles.<P>
The key to Q/Media for Windows' ability to transparently integrate any file brought onto its screen, regardless of the program in which it was created, lies in Q/Media's proprietary media player engine, which seamlessly integrates all major file formats and even increases the imported file's playback performance.<P>
The package also includes a timeline to synchronize objects, a slide sorter outliner to organize presentation flow, and over ten Mbytes of animation, digital video, wave audio, and MIDI and graphic images.  Q/Media for Windows costs $99.00; Q/Media Pro sells for $495.00. Reader service no. 20.<P>

Lynx Real-Time Systems' LynxOS UNIX/POSIX-compatible operating system for real-time applications now offers an integrated DOS operating environment: VP/ix for LynxOS.  Using this new option, you can operate in a real-time environment and still run non-real-time DOS and UNIX apps.<P>
VP/ix lets single or multiple users run DOS and UNIX applications in a paged virtual-memory environment on a single system without additional hardware.  Each session executes in its own virtual-address space.<P>
You can initiate DOS commands from within the LynxOS environment and run DOS apps from the LynxOS prompt.  The reverse is also possible: UNIX commands can be run from within DOS. VP/ix integrates DOS files into the UNIX file system, so there is no need for separate disk partitions; files are easily accessible.  DOS and UNIX apps can directly share files, and peripherals from either operating environment can be used without additional device drivers.<P>
The price for VP/ix for LynxOS is $695.00.  Reader service no. 21.<P>

Version 2.0 of QuickStart for Windows NT, a DOS-hosted cross-development tool for NT targets, has been released by Phar Lap.  QuickStart runs NT tools under DOS or in a Windows 3.1 DOS box, so Win32s applications can be created and run under Windows without the need to reboot.<P>
With the new version of QuickStart, programmers can run NT tools in conjunction with DOS editors, utilities, source-control systems, and network software.  To use QuickStart with Win32s, you use NT tools under DOS or Windows to write applications using a subset of the Win32 API calls; these apps then use Win32s to run on top of 16-bit Windows 3.1.  You can use the latest versions of Microsoft's 32-bit Windows NT C/C++ compiler, linker, librarian, and resource compiler under DOS or Windows 3.1.<P>
QuickStart is available free of charge for a limited time.  Reader service no. 22.<P>

Multi Soft is shipping two new communications libraries: CL/W, for communication between Windows development tools and mainframe programs; and CL/VB, a version of CL/W that has been integrated with Visual Basic.<P>
Both libraries are based on a Windows DLL that lets you call PC/mainframe communications functions that support two different modes of client/server communications.  The first mode, &quot;front-ending,&quot; allows use of any Windows development tool to create a graphical interface that runs &quot;in front of&quot; an existing mainframe program; the second, &quot;program-to-program communications,&quot; allows you to write a Windows program that interactively calls a partner application on the mainframe using a message-passing mechanism for exchanging data and application-specific codes.<P>
CL/W also provides functions for embedding file verification and software-distribution services in your application, ensuring that the proper versions of the executable files, database files, and tables are loaded for your application.  CL/W can be called from any development tool that lets you call a DLL.<P>
CL/VB includes all the functions found in CL/W plus dialog-driven utilities to support the screen-capture and conversion process.<P>
The package including CL/W and CL/VB costs between $50.00 and $100.00 for a runtime license, depending on quantity, and $1500.00 for a development license.  Reader service no. 31.<P>
