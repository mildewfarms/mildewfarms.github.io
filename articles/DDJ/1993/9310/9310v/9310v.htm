<a name="02f1_0001"><a name="02f1_0000">POEM VideoBox, a video SDK that provides decompression at 30 frames per second (on ISA-BUS 80486/50 MHz PCs), has been announced by Iterated Systems. Developed for network archiving, multimedia publishing, training, and other video applications, the kit provides software-only video at low bandwidths. The SDK contains C object libraries for integrating video decompression into DOS applications, sample programs with source code, and sample video footage. POEM VideoBox supports Sound Blaster and Sound Blaster Pro sound cards. Frames are dropped dynamically on slower computers to maintain sound synchronization. POEM sells for $1795.00.

Network Program-to-Program Communications (NPPC) from Software Corp., is a library designed for creating Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups network applications in C or C++. The library is available for either IPX or NetBIOS; the API is the same for both. NPPC adds about 30K to DOS-based applications. The Windows version is implemented as a Windows DLL. NPPC functions are implemented as high-level application calls that are used to perform program-to-program communications at the message level. Either library (for Windows IPX or NetBIOS) is available for $195.00 or $395.00, respectively. A BBS downloadable demo for DOS or Windows is available by calling 415-949-0207.

Distinct Corp. has announced the release of its Professional Edition TCP/IP for Windows, Version 3.0. New features of the upgraded software developer's package include three kits in one: the Windows Sockets API, Version 1.1, as well as Distinct's TCP/IP Kernel API for Berkeley-style Sockets (TCP, UDP, ICMP, Telnet, and FTP), and Distinct RPC, a complete ONC RPC/XDT tookit for Windows. Enhanced installation and easy configuration is an added feature to the upgrade. Developers can choose the portions of the program they wish to install, and then install those portions in their own directories. In addition, the program's easy to use dialog boxes allow fine-tuning networking parameters to optimize specific work environments. Possible modifications include time-out and retry values for the different protocols and maximum transmission units for packets. Distinct offers the Professional Edition SDK as an upgrade to previous versions for $200.00. Reader service no. 22.<P>

Symantec's C++ 6.0 for Macintosh and C++ 6.0 for Apple's Macintosh Programmer's Workshop (MPW) are development environments available with an integrated, native C++ compiler, and incremental linker. The linker reduces development time by only linking new or modified code into the program. Supported are C++ features such as templates, multiple inheritance, and nested classes. The environment includes an editor, a source-code browser, and a C++ source-code debugger. Symantec also upgraded Think C to Version 6.0. The Think Project Manager keeps track of all files and libraries. Symantec C++ for Macintosh includes Apple's SourceServer, which supports team development. Symantec C++ 6.0 for Macintosh or MPW costs $499.00, and Think C 6.0 sells for $299.00. Reader service no. 23.<P>

Nohau is using a special emulation device from Dallas Semiconductor to achieve emulation of the DS80C320 microcontroller. The DS80C320 is pin compatible with 80C32 and uses the standard 8051 instruction set. The core is a redesigned high-speed architecture which removes 8051's &quot;dead cycles.&quot; This means that the DS80C320 will run instructions 1.5 to 3 times faster than if they were run in a regular 80C32 using the same clock frequency. The EMUL51-PC is a high-performance, in-circuit emulator specifically designed to give an optimized environment to develop 8051 hardware and software. The EMUL51-PC emulator consists of a board which plugs directly into the IBM PC/XT/AT bus. It is also available in a box which communicates with the PC through a standard RS-232 channel at rates up to 115 kilobaud. An optional trace board holds up to 256K trace records, 64 bits each. It has multiple trigger levels, filterings, loop counting, on-the-fly timing, and time stamp. The emulator board costs $3595.00; and the DS80C320 probe sells for $995.00 and runs at speeds up to 25 MHz. Reader service no. 25<P>

Microtek International has introduced the Microtek Pentium Emulator (MPE), an in-circuit emulator for the Pentium processor. The company claims it is the first emulator to run at 66 MHz. One of MPE's features is the ability to capture an accurate execution history, even when executing code out of cache. Traditionally, this has been a stumbling block for logic analyzers and emulators. Prior to this, the designer was forced to disable the cache, thus introducing a large non-transparency issue in the debug process. Other features of the MPE include four execution breakpoints, eight complex bus event recognizers, 16K frame trace buffer, time stamp, 32-bit occurrence counter, and an external-trigger BNC connector.

Mortice Kern Systems announced a new version of its compiler construction tools, MKS LEX&amp;YACC 3.2. New features include a Windows NT release, the ability to create code for Windows application development, and 32-bit DOS extended support. MKS LEX&amp;YACC is used in the development of software that analyses and interprets input, such as an embedded command language in a configurable text editor. LEX builds a lexical analyzer, which takes a stream of input and breaks it up into tokens according to user-specified rules. YACC builds a parser, which takes a stream of tokens (such as provided by MKS LEX) and matches them against a grammar. When a portion of the grammar is matched, source code embedded in the YACC grammar file is executed, giving action to the parsed commands. LEX&amp;YACC is available for $299.00, or as an upgrade from any previous version for $99.00. Reader service no. 27.<P>

CodeProbe, from General Software, is a software analyzer for DOS developers. This analyzer records sequences of events and can show the elapsed time between them. A developer can monitor a running program at full speed, capturing system events such as hardware, DOS, and BIOS interrupts, and user-defined events triggered by the user code calling a special trace function from C or assembly language. After event capture, the developer can display the trace in summary and fully-decoded forms, with each event time stamped to sub-millisecond resolution.<P>
The analyzer installs directly on any DOS-based PC/AT or 386/486-based machines, and runs concurrently with the software under test. CodeProbe is priced at $350.00. Reader service no. 28.<P>
