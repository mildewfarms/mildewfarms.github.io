<h3><a href="9310a/9310a.htm">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE GUESSING GAMES</A></h3><P>
<i>by P.J. Plauger</i><P>
Speculating on the eventual success or failure of a programming language is a popular, if not demanding, pastime where everyone's best guess is as good as anyone else's.<P>
<h3><a href="9310b/9310b.htm">THE C+@ PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</A></h3><P>
<i>by Jim Fleming</i><P>
C+@ (pronounced &quot;cat&quot;), an object-oriented language out of AT&amp;T Bell Labs, has the syntax of C and the power of Smalltalk. Unlike C++, however, C+@ includes a library of more than 350 classes.<P>
<h3><a href="9310c/9310c.htm">THE PARASOL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</A></h3><P>
<i>by Robert Jervis</i><P>
Parasol, short for &quot;Parallel Systems Object Language,&quot; was influenced by C and Smalltalk, although the design also reflects C++, CLU, Algol, and Turbo Pascal.<P>
<h3><a href="9310d/9310d.htm">THE SATHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</A></h3><P>
<i>by Stephen M. Omohundro</i><P>
Sather, a language that's simple, interactive, and nonproprietary, has parameterized classes, object-oriented dispatch, statically-checked strong typing, multiple inheritance, garbage collection, and more.<P>
<h3><a href="9310e/9310e.htm">THE LIANA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</A></h3><P>
<i>by Ray Valdes</i><P>
Liana is an object-oriented programming language specifically designed for creating Windows applications. Like C++, Liana uses classes and member functions to provide encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Unlike C++, Liana does not use pointers or support multiple inheritance.<P>
<h3><a href="9310f/9310f.htm">THE BETA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</A></h3><P>
<i>by Steve Mann</i><P>
Since Beta was designed by the same community that developed Stimula, it's no surprise that this language resembles its object-oriented predecessor.<P>
<h3><a href="9310g/9310g.htm">THE EIFFEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</A></h3><P>
<i>by Robert Howard</i><P>
Eiffel is a class-based language that supports multiple and repeated inheritance, selective exporting, strong type checking, parameterized classes, dynamic binding, garbage collection, and exception handling.<P>
<h3><a href="9310h/9310h.htm">DAVE'S RECYCLED OO LANGUAGE</A></h3><P>
<i>by David Betz</i><P>
David dusts off AdvSys, an object-oriented adventure-writing language, adding multiple inheritance to it. The result is &quot;Dave's Recycled Object-Oriented Language&quot; (or &quot;Drool&quot; for short).<P>
<h3><a href="9310i/9310i.htm">THE ART OF PRODUCT LAUNCHES</A></h3><P>
<i>by Diane McGary</i><P>
To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Software Entrepreneurs' Forum, Diane shares guerrilla marketing tips for successfully getting your software into user's hands.<P>
<h3><a href="9310j/9310j.htm">C++ MANIPULATORS AND APPLICATORS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Reginald B. Charney</i><P>
C++ manipulators and applicators are most often used with the I/O streams package. However, you can use them with any type of class which has overloaded operators.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9310k/9310k.htm">AVOIDING MICROCONTROLLER PROCESSOR PILE-UPS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Eric McRae</i><P>
Eric describes his winning entry in the Motorola 68HC16 design contest. The problem he faced involved dealing with multiple independent periodic processes running simultaneously.<P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9310l/9310l.htm">NETWORKING WITH PERL</A></h3><P>
<i>by Oliver Sharp</i><P>
Perl, a language designed to handle a variety of system-administration tasks, makes handling the socket protocol easier still. Oliver shows how you can write Perl scripts that communicate across networks of UNIX machines.<P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9310m/9310m.htm">COMPARING OBJECT-ORIENTED LANGUAGES</A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Floyd</i><P>
Comparing one language to another usually is like comparing coconuts to kumquats. To make comparisons easier, we implemented a double-ended linked-list class in C++, then in Smalltalk, Eiffel, Sather, Objective-C, Parasol, Beta, Turbo Pascal, C+@, Liana, Ada, and, yes, even Drool.<P>
<h2>COLUMNS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9310n/9310n.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Swaine</i><P>
It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that Michael's inclined to quest after chaos. He then gets small--<I>real small</I>--as he explores nanotechnology and itty-bitty machines.<P>
<h3><a href="9310o/9310o.htm">C PROGRAMMING</A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens</i><P>
Last month, Al examined C++ exception handling in a general sense. This month, he looks at how the new 32-bit Watcom C/C++ 9.5 compiler goes about implementing exception handling.<P>
<h3><a href="9310p/9310p.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY</A></h3><P>
<i>by Tom Swan</i><P>
Tom presents a selection-sampling algorithm--a technique useful when reducing a large collection of records to a more manageable subset.<P>
<h3><a href="9310q/9310q.htm">UNDOCUMENTED CORNER</A></h3><P>
<i>edited by Andrew Schulman</i><P>
Pete Davis continues his exploration of the undocumented Windows .HLP file format.<P>
<h3><a href="9310r/9310r.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF</A></h3><P>
<i>by Jonathan Erickson</i><P>
If you're getting serious about speech recognition, <I>Computational Models of American Speech</I> is a book to pick up before going any further.<P>
