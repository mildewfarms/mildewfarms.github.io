<H1>January 1993 - POWER PROGRAMMING IN 32-BITS</H1>
<hr>
<h2>FEATURES</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9301a/9301a.htm">EXTENDING WINDOWS TO 32 BITS by Steven Baker</A></h3><P>
Steven discusses the ins and outs of 32-bit Windows development, focusing on  32-bit C compilers and Windows extenders.  But he points out that for some  applications, moving to 32-bit Windows makes sense only if the potential of  32-bit CPUs can be exploited.<P>
<h3><a href="9301b/9301b.htm">PORTING FROM 16-BIT TO 32-BIT EXTENDED DOS by Joe Huffman</A></h3><P>
Among the more subtle pitfalls of converting 16-bit applications to 32-bit  are those involving memory protection, integer size, and structure size and  padding.  Joe shows you how to avoid these problems - and what to do when  you can't.<P>
<h3><a href="9301c/9301c.htm">64-BIT PROGRAMMING IN A 32-BIT WORLD by Andy Nicholson</A></h3><P>
Andy presents proven guidelines for writing C code that's portable across  16-, 32-, or 64-bit processors.  The rules include handling high-level and  low-level structures, structure packing and word alignment, and machine  addressing characteristics.<P>
<h3><a href="9301d/9301d.htm">LUC PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION by Peter Smith</A></h3><P>
LUC public-key encryption may be the first cryptographic scheme to seriously  challenge RSA's 15 years of dominance.  Unlike RSA, LUC uses calculation of  Lucas functions instead of exponentiation for encoding and decoding.<P>
<h3><a href="9301e/9301e.htm">DDJ HANDPRINTING RECOGNITION CONTEST WRAP-UP by Ray Valdes</A></h3><P>
Who's the fastest?  How about the most accurate?  And how did they do it?   Ray presents the results of the first-ever handprinting-recognition contest.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9301f/9301f.htm">WINDOWS DDE FOR REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS by Kamal Shah</A></h3><P>
Window's dynamic data exchange provides a powerful mechanism for communication among applications.  Kamal examines how real-time DDE-aware applications can communicate with Windows applications using iRMX for Windows DDE extensions.<P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9301g/9301g.htm">SIMULATING HYPERCUBES IN UNIX, PART II by Jeffery W. Hamilton and Eileen M. Ormsby</A></h3><P>
In the second installment of this two-part article, our authors present the  source code for a simulated hypercube system that runs under standard UNIX  and describe how you can use the system.<P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9301h/9301h.htm">PORTING TO THE WIN32 API by Peter Handsman</A></h3><P>
Peter discusses his experiences in porting nearly 35,000 lines of C++ code  from the Windows NT 32-bit API.<P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9301i/9301i.htm">PROFILING FOR PERFORMANCE by Joseph M. Newcomer</A></h3><P>
Profiling tools were developed to help identify those parts of a program which  are consuming significant computing resources so that you can optimize  program performance.  Still, its necessary to understand what's being  measured, how accurately it's being measured, and the reliability of the  resulting numbers.<P>
<h2>COLUMNS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9301j/9301j.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS by Michael Swaine</A></h3><P>
Mathematician Steven Wolfram, developer of Mathematica, takes time out to talk  with Michael in this two-part column.  This month they discuss the nature of  programming languages and why they're so slow to change.<P>
<h3><a href="9301k/9301k.htm">C PROGRAMMING by Al Stevens</A></h3><P>
D-Flat++ development continues, as Al takes a look at the DF++ portability  layer that normalizes the code for different compilers and the definition of  the base DFWindow class.<P>
<h3><a href="9301l/9301l.htm">STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING by Jeff Duntemann</A></h3><P>
Jeff dives into the recently released Borland Pascal with Object 7.0, the  latest incarnation of the venerable Turbo Pascal.  This new version can be  Windows or DOS hosted and targeted, and includes a royalty-free DOS extender.<P>
<h3><a href="9301m/9301m.htm">GRAPHICS PROGRAMMING by Michael Abrash</A></h3><P>
Dirty rectangles can help you clean up the visual quality of graphics  animation.  With this technique, a copy of display memory is kept in offscreen  memory where drawing takes place. Drawings are then copied to the screen in a  burst.<P>
<h3><a href="9301n/9301n.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF by Al Stevens</A></h3><P>
Pamela McCorduck's Aaron's Code tells the story of Harold Cohen, his Aaron  software, and the quest for realistic computer-generated art.<P>
