<a name="0250_0001"><a name="0250_0000">Candela's Color Management System (CCMS) Library now supports the Macintosh Think C 5.0 compiler and  Nextstep 3.0, SunSparc OS 4.1.3, DOS 5.0, and Windows 3.1.<P>
CCMS Library includes linearizing and characterizing devices, color-gamut mapping, and operation of test targets. The CCMS Evaluator helps to link and transform color among scanners, monitors, and output devices.<P>
The technology is based on nonlinear, nonseparable math functions that provide smooth color and gray tonal transitions while processing large image files that have millions of color pixels at fast speeds. CCMS costs $7500.00 and includes the Evaluator and API documentation. Reader service no. 20.<P>

The WinClient library is a C++ object library for Windows-based relational database management system (RDBMS) front-end application development. The library unifies programming styles for different windows, including MDI frame, MDI child, and ordinary windows. Windows initialization routines can be encapsulated in the application base class. A single language--C++, for example--can handle forms, reports, and large batch programs, and can share program logic between them. Reader service no. 21.<P>

The Public Windows Interface (PWI), a specification that would put the Microsoft Windows API into the public domain, has been proposed by SunSelect (a Sun Microsystems business unit) and endorsed by a number of third-party companies, among them Borland, Corel, HP, IBM, Quarterdeck, SCO, USL, and Wordperfect. As proposed, the PWI standard would enable the development of applications and tools so that users of systems based on multiple operating systems could run Windows apps.<P>
As you might expect, however, Microsoft is not included on an endorsement list. A Microsoft spokesperson told told <I>DDJ</I>:<P>
Sun's actions are basically irrelevant. There's a known and well-published Windows interface today, certainly more broadly published and broadly documented than anything that Sun or another UNIX vendor has to offer.<P>
We have an Open Process whereby we review all the new proposed API specs...with the industry well in advance before the APIs are done, solicit feedback, and make changes if necessary to meet people's needs. The process combine[s] the speed from leadership...with an open process that makes sure that, in fact, we're doing the right thing.<P>
We do not frankly believe that Sun has any intention of doing right by the users of Windows or Windows itself. Clearly, the only economic benefit Sun might hope to derive is to fragment the Windows interface the way the UNIX interface and the UNIX API is fragmented in the hope they can continue to participate in a market that seems to have already selected Windows.<P>
We don't understand what the benefit would be of taking a Windows standard that's now supported by 25 million people and countless thousands of software developers andfragmenting it or turning it over to a body that essentially consists of hostile UNIX competitors.<P>
If they've finally acknowledged that you have to support the Windows interface in order to be a player in the market, we're tickled.<P>

Also new from SunSelect is a software technology called &quot;WABI'' that makes it possible for UNIX users to directly run Microsoft Windows apps on UNIX-based PCs and workstations. Because the Windows apps are part of the UNIX desktop, users can cut-and-paste between Windows and UNIX apps. WABI (presumably short for &quot;Windows Application Binary Interface&quot;) is not Window emulation; it translates Windows function calls into X Windows calls. WABI, which was originally developed by Praxsys Technologies, includes bitstreams font handling (including TrueType fonts).<P>
WABI has so far been licensed by USL, SCO, and SunSoft. SunSelect has set up a self-certification program, whereby developers can receive a free preview copy of WABI for conducting compatibility testing during application development. Reader service no. 24.<P>

NeuroForecaster, a neuro-fuzzy network program from NIBS Pte, provides investment analysis for stocks, options, fixed-income securities, foreign exchange, interest rates, and so on. It uses only historical data for training, so explicit expert rules aren't needed. The program provides time-series forecasting, cross-sectional classification, and indicator analysis. Forecasts can be built with any number of input and user-specified complexity, limited only by the amount of computer memory. Twelve built-in neural-network models include backpropagation, radial-basis function, and neuro-fuzzy models. Rescaled range analysis is included to help the user predetermine the predictability of the input data, and to reveal hidden cycles in the time series. NeuroForcaster 2.1 for Windows or the Macintosh sells for $350.00. Reader service no. 25.<P>

Visual Basic 3.0 has been released by Microsoft. The two major 3.0 enhancements are integration of the Microsoft Access 1.1 database engine and support for OLE 2.0 Automation. The database engine provides direct access to Access, dBase, Paradox, Btrieve, and ODBC. (ODBC drivers for Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase SQL Server, and Oracle are provided.) The engine has multiuser support, transaction processing, and support for rich data types (sound, video, OLE objects, and pictures). OLE 2.0 automation lets you build custom programs that take advantage of the capabilities of other OLE 2.0-compliant applications. Other VB 3.0 enhancements include new controls, pop-up menus, data-access objects, data-aware controls, and integration of Crystal Reports 2.0.<P>
Visual Basic 3.0 sells for $199.00. Reader service no. 26.<P>

A standard specification for ink as a data type has been proposed by pen-based developers GO, General Magic, Slate, Microsoft, Lotus, and Apple. The specification, called &quot;Jot,'' defines a common format to be used for the storage and interchange of electronic ink data. Jot, which is written in C but which can be implemented in any language, is a record-based format that covers properties such as: multiple ink strokes combined into single objects, bounds, scales, offsets, color, pen tips, timing, height of pen over digitizer, stylus-tip force, stylus buttons, and x and y angle of stylus. Forty-seven additional record types have been reserved for future use. Reader service no. 28.<P>

Tired of sitting through a 30-to 50-disk installation process--and sometimes having to start over because of an error? This problem is solved by the LAN Configuration Facility (LCF), an automated software-installation utility which allows large installations to be performed over a network. LCF, which is distributed by ForeFront Software, was developed by the Royal Bank of Canada, where it was used for the installation and configuration of OS/2 mission-critical applications; LCF is capable of distributing, installing, and configuring DOS and Windows apps as well.<P>
LCF stores software in a central library on a server, where it can either be &quot;pulled&quot; by users or &quot;pushed&quot; by administrators from the server to unattended workstations. Server software sells for $500.00 (usually one server per network is required, although you can bridge from one LAN to another), while client software sells for $50.00/workstation.

VBAssist 3.0, a Visual Basic 3.0 add-on tool from Sheridan Software, lets developers design forms for database applications using drag-and-drop to link table columns to bound controls. VB-Assist's Data Assistant opens a window showing all fields in the database associated with the bound data control. With a mouse click on the desired field, the user drags and drops it into the target control. It also allows developers to create and modify table structures, and view/modify data for any table. VBAssist 3.0 sells for $179.00; upgrades are $39.00.<P>
Sheridan is also offering 3D Widgets, a Visual C++ add-on that provides custom controls such as list boxes, command buttons, ribbon buttons, versatile panels, and specialized file, directory and drive list boxes. 3D Widgets costs $109.00. Reader service no. 32.<P>
