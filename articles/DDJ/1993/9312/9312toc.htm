<h3><a href="9312a/9312a.htm">THE INFORMATION UTILITY</A></h3><P>
<i>by Rolf Oswald</i><P>
Spatial data, such as that gathered from satellite images, presents real dilemmas when shared information over heterogeneous networks and geographical-information systems. In particular, the challenge of dissimilar file formats must be overcome. Rolf examines how Manitoba's Information Utility tackles this and other thorny data-exchange problems.<P>
<h3><a href="9312b/9312b.htm">CROSS-PLATFORM COMPRESSION</A></h3><P>
<i>by Pierre J. Dion</i><P>
Data compression is one means of achieving efficient data transfer. However, efficiency across disparate computer systems can be limited by the lack of cross-platform tools. Pierre presents an implementation of LZH compression for MS-DOS, UNIX, and MVS.<P>
<h3><a href="9312c/9312c.htm">DATABASE INTEROPERABILITY AND APPLICATION TRANSPORTABILITY</A></h3><P>
<i>by Edward Dowgiallo</i><P>
In the database world, interoperability refers to the ability to build applications that can simultaneously access data in different databases provided by different vendors; transportability is the ability to move an application from one network/hardware combination to another while using the same database. Ed examines the strategies database vendors implement to make this possible.<P>
<h3><a href="9312d/9312d.htm">REXX AND THE OS/2 WORKPLACE SHELL</A></h3><P>
<i>by Eric Giguere</i><P>
The REXX language interface provides a simple way to customize the OS/2 Workplace Shell environment. Eric also takes a peek at the upcoming object-oriented REXX being developed by IBM.<P>
<h3><a href="9312e/9312e.htm">THE IDEA ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM</A></h3><P>
<i>by Bruce Schneier</i><P>
The International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) may be one of most secure block algorithm available to the public today. Bruce examines its 128-bit long key (over twice the length of the familiar DES) and unravels the algorithm for both encryption and decryption.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9312f/9312f.htm">VISUALIZING DATA IN REAL TIME </A></h3><P>
<i>by James F. Farley and Peter D. Varhol</i><P>
Our authors use Vision, a graphical front end for data display, and Visual Basic to build an application that acquires and displays sensor data from an optical fire detector.<P>
<h2>NETWORK SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9312g/9312g.htm">UNDERSTANDING OSI NETWORK MANAGEMENT</A></h3><P>
<i>by William Stallings</i><P>
The OSI network-management system, which relies on an object-oriented design, provides an operator interface for monitoring and controlling network activity.<P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9312h/9312h.htm">EXAMINING THE STARVIEW APPLICATION FRAMEWORK</A></h3><P>
<i>by Ramin Firoozyi</i><P>
StarView is a cross-platform C++ application framework that operates across Windows, Macintosh, NT, OS/2, OpenLook, and Motif. C++ code written to this application framework can be copied from one machine to another and rebuilt, resulting in a native executable that has the speed of a C++ application and the look-and-feel of the native GUI.<P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9312i/9312i.htm">WIRELESS DATA AND MINIMUM AIRTIME SOFTWARE</A></h3><P>
<i>by Darrell Diem</i><P>
Wireless networks, which can be implemented as LANs, MANs, or WANs, have their own unique technical challenges. Darrell examines how minimum airtime algorithms can reduce transmission errors and wireless-network airtime costs.<P>
<h2>COLUMNS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9312j/9312j.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS </A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Swaine</i><P>
Michael examines powerful tools for manipulating HyperCard extensions.<P>
<h3><a href="9312k/9312k.htm">C PROGRAMMING</A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens</i><P>
Al continues with D-Flat++, this month implementing classes for tool bars and tool buttons using a text-editor named TED to illustrate how you can use these classes. TED sports a menu bar, status bar, and tool bar, and it lets you work on one text file at a time.<P>
<h3><a href="9312l/9312l.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY </A></h3><P>
<i>by Tom Swan</i><P>
Tom uses frequency distribution to explore if pseudorandom numbers really are. In particular, he examines a statistical method known as the &quot;chi-square distribution.&quot;<P>
<h3><a href="9312m/9312m.htm">UNDOCUMENTED CORNER </A></h3><P>
<i>by Andrew Schulman</i><P>
Andrew presents VXDLIST, a program that walks the Windows Enhanced mode VxD chain and displays the names of all VxDs loaded on the system. VXDLIST will be particularly useful for exploring the upcoming &quot;Chicago&quot; operating environment, which is based on VxDs.<P>
<h3><a href="9312n/9312n.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF </A></h3><P>
<i>by Jonathan Erickson</i><P>
<I>Mobile Robots</I> is about more than just silicon-based creatures scurrying around underfoot. It's really an application of an exciting approach to organizing intelligence systems using an architecture referred to as &quot;subsumption.&quot;<P>
