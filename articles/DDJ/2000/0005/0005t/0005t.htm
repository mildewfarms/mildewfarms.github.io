SuperCache-NT and SuperDisk-NT improve web server performance by caching disk data in the system's main memory. Web applications are able to operate at fast CPU and memory speeds, rather than being throttled back by slow disk and I/O speeds. SuperSpeed.com has also announced the availability of its RAM disk and disk-caching software products for the Windows 2000 operating system. </p><p>SuperSpeed.com</p><p>327 E Boston Post Road </p><p>Sudbury, MA 01776 </p><p>978-443-5106</p><p>http://www.superspeed.com/</p><p>Borland has released C++Builder 5, a new version of its ANSI C++ development system.

Neoware's version of Linux is fully binary compatible with Linux, and supports standard Linux device drivers. This OS is designed for small devices that typically do not have hard disk drives or significant memory. Neoware's Linux can be combined with other Linux software to create various appliances, including web access appliances, e-mail appliances, thin client appliances for ASP computing, hand-held wireless communication appliances, and network appliances such as firewalls and routers. Neoware's products are thin-client appliances designed to allow access to Linux, the Internet, and Windows-based applications running on multiuser Windows NT servers. They are designed as an alternative to dumb terminals, offering lower up-front and administrative costs.</p><p>Neoware Systems Inc.</p><p>400 Feheley Drive </p><p>King of Prussia, PA 19406 </p><p>610-277-8300 </p><p>http://www.neoware.com/</p><p>Be Inc. has unveiled BeIA (previously known by the code name "Stinger"), its software platform for devices that deliver information and entertainment over the Internet. BeIA is a device-independent platform focusing on the personalization of multimedia and information-rich products. The design of BeIA lets Internet appliances be configured as information devices such as personal online portals or financial management monitors. At the foundation of BeIA are a core set of system functions, leveraged from BeOS, which talk directly to the individual hardware designs. These functions perform tasks such as low-level I/O, memory, and media management. Coupled with these core functions is an API that allows control over look and feel. Layered above the core functions are an integrated Internet browser and a Java Virtual Machine. Devices can be configured on HTML 4.0, XML, JavaScript, SSL 2.0 and 3.0, CSS 1&amp;2, RealNetworks RealSystem G2, Macromedia Flash, QuickTime, AVI, MPEG1, Cinepak, Intel Indeo, MP3, major PC formats, USB, IEEE 1394, analog I/O, CD reading and writing, Windows file system support, C++, and PersonalJava.</p><p>Be Inc.</p><p>800 El Camino Real, Suite 400</p><p>Menlo Park, CA 94025</p><p>650-462-4100</p><p>http://www.be.com/</p><p>Seagate Crystal Reports 8, from Seagate Software, offers integration with Microsoft Office and reporting tools for web and Windows developers.

ParaSoft has expanded the static analysis feature by adding RuleWizard, which lets teams create their own set of static analysis rules to be enforced. Jtest 3.1 has also increased the number of rules it automatically enforces. When the program accesses external files or databases, Jtest automatically generates input coming from those resources and alerts you if there are any inputs that will make the program throw an uncaught run-time exception. Jtest can test classes that use CORBA and EJB. White-box stubs are provided for the Object Request Broker (ORB) and other CORBA objects referenced by the class under test. In addition, Jtest checks a set of EJB-specific rules from Sun's "Enterprise JavaBeans Developer's Guide."</p><p>ParaSoft</p><p>401 E.
