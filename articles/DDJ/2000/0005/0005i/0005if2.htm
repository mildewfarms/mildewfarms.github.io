To minimize receive time, one block is sent from each group in turn. While sending a given index value, the group order may be randomly varied to avoid correlation of periodic losses. G, the number of groups, is the ceiling of the file size divided by k.</h4><a href="0005i.htm#rf2">Back to Article</a></body></html>
