The gain at a particular frequency is expressed as a ratio of the output signal amplitude divided by the input signal amplitude at that frequency. The reason dBs are used rather than simple ratios is that very large and very small ratios can be described with numbers of reasonable size. Another reason is that two ratios can be multiplied or divided by adding or subtracting their values in dBs, thus simplifying calculations.</p><p><A NAME="rf13"><A HREF="0004hf13.htm">Figure 13</A> is the mathematical definition of gain in dBs. In this formula, A<sub>out</sub> is the output amplitude, A<sub>in</sub> is the input amplitude, and <img src="alpha14.gif" width="7" height="6" align="middle"> is their ratio in units of dBs. <img src="alpha14.gif" width="7" height="6" align="middle"> will be negative if the output amplitude is smaller than the input amplitude. Using this formula, if A<sub>out</sub> at some frequency is 1/1000 of A<sub>in</sub> at that frequency, then <img src="alpha14.gif" width="7" height="6" align="middle">=-60 dB.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>Some other examples: A gain of -1 dB decreases the output amplitude to 0.89 times the input amplitude and -6 dB decreases the output amplitude to 0.50 times the input amplitude. A gain of +6 dB multiplies the input amplitude by 2.0.</p><p> -- J.L.</p><a href="0004h.htm#rs1">Back to Article</a></body></html>
