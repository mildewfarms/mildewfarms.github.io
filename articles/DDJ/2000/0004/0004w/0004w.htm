With VSFlexGrid Pro 7.0, you have the choice of three types of data binding, ensuring a small software footprint for any application. You can choose from an ADO/OLEDB data-binding version for compatibility with the latest database standards, a DAO version for compatibility with legacy systems, and a "lite" version that reduces footprint size and eliminates the need to distribute ADO DLLs in applications that don't require database support. New features include custom data sources, translated ImageLists, column reference by key, range aggregates, easy ComboLists, modified user interface, new event for data conversions, as-you-type searching, and improved design-time interface for setting properties visually. VSFlexGrid Pro 7.0 is compatible with Visual Basic 5 and 6.
