You could call dozens of companies or ask around for information, but you'll have better luck on the Internet. </p><p>For example, along with high-tech jobs, Earthweb's dice.com (the company I work for) provides career and salary information to the IT industry. Dice.com recently published the results of its annual salary survey to help IT professionals discover what their skills are worth. In August and September, 1999, 15,000 web-site visitors participated in the survey, which was cosponsored by Datamation.com. The data can be queried by employment status, years of experience, location, education, and skills. You can view the survey results at http://www.dice.com/surveys/results1999. Using the online query tool, you can investigate typical rates and salaries for specific skills in either contract or permanent IT positions. </p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>The survey gives some surprising (and some not so surprising) results. Overall, dice.com found that IT professionals average between $50,000 and $75,000 per year, with 60 percent of respondents making over $50,000 per year. </p><p>Another interesting fact is that salaries in the Midwest and on the East Coast are catching up to -- and in some states even surpassing -- those on the West Coast (see <A NAME="rf1"><A HREF="0004lf1.htm">Figure 1</A>). Connecticut comes in at the top with over 70 percent of the respondents making over $50,000 per year. Two Midwestern states, Kansas and Illinois, follow close behind with 65 percent and 64 percent of respondents, respectively, making that much. California respondents also finished in the same range with 62 percent making over $50,000 per year. </p><p>"The results of the survey depict a changing landscape for IT professionals who work in this industry as West Coast salaries are no longer the highest," said Lloyd Linn, cofounder and president of dice.com. "The good news is that demand for highly skilled IT professionals has elevated compensation in both contract and permanent categories." </p><p>Contract IT professionals in the transportation industry reported making the most money per year, with 84 percent making over $50,000. Salaries in the entertainment industry, agriculture, and retail/e-commerce followed close behind with about 82 percent making over $50,000. Most contract workers work in more than one industry.</p><p>The utilities industries seem to be the place to look for permanent IT jobs. Permanent IT professionals in the gas and electric industries reported making the highest salaries with 67 percent making over $50,000 a year. The entertainment and financial/insurance industries follow with almost 60 percent of respondents in each category exceeding $50,000 per year. IT workers in education and the computer hardware industry reported the lowest salaries for both permanent and contract employees. </p><p>When it comes to making money, independence is the key. The average salary range for permanent and agency workers is $50,000 to $75,000. For independent contractors, the average range increases to $75,000 to $90,000, with over 40 percent of independent IT professionals making over $100,000 per year (see <A NAME="rf2"><A HREF="0004lf2.htm">Figure 2</A>).</p><p>The survey also found that, as with wine, salaries get better with age. Most salaries increase with the age of the job seeker, with the two exceptions being at the top and the bottom of the scale. Workers under 18 make about 10 percent more than their 18-24 year old counterparts, and workers over 60 see a slight decrease in salary (see <A NAME="rf3"><A HREF="0004lf3.htm">Figure 3</A>).</p><p>Finally, the survey confirms a disappointing fact: Men continue to earn more than women in comparable positions. For example, 34 percent of male programmers who held contract positions earned in excess of $50,000 per year compared to 22 percent of female programmers. Almost 10 percent more men than women make over $75,000. </p><p>With the dice.com survey data, you can make an informed decision about whether you should be looking for your next job -- or learning a more lucrative set of skills.</p><p><b>DDJ</b></p></body></html>
