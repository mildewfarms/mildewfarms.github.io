The next version, StarOffice 6, will serve as the source-code base for OpenOffice.org, an architecture of separate applications and componentized services. OpenOffice.org will host StarOffice source code, specify XML file formats for documents and language-independent APIs, and provide Microsoft Office file filters.</p><p>Sun Microsystems</p><p>901 San Antonio Road</p><p>Palo Alto, CA 94303-4900</p><p>650-960-1300</p><p>http://www.openoffice.org/</p><p>Version 2.1 of Raycosoft's Typhon (formerly called the "Portable Unix Toolkit") is now available for Windows as well as Solaris, Linux, and a variety of other UNIX platforms. Typhon contains 106 programs for text processing, file and directory processing, customizing login environments, disk space management, performance analysis, system monitoring, and system security. Version 2.1 introduces full support for the UNIX bash login shell; Typhon also supports the Korn shell, bash, C shell, and tcsh. Version 2.1 also includes better disk space management for temporary files, enhanced support for the public-domain Korn shell, enhanced support for UNIX standards, signal trapping and handling, and a new program for text processing.</p><p>Raycosoft </p><p>501 North 43rd Street </p><p>Seattle, WA 98103 </p><p>206-547-6903</p><p>http://www.raycosoft.com/</p><p>	</p><p>Xi Graphics has released DeXtop, a GUI for Linux, designed to be used with the Xi Graphics display servers. DeXtop is based on the Open Group's Common Desktop Environment (CDE). CDE is a commercial GUI, and the same Motif/CDE interface is found on workstations from Compaq, IBM, HP, and Sun, so DeXtop offers complete interoperability with these platforms. The package includes Open Motif 2.1.30, CDE, and a development environment including all the components necessary to compile CDE/Motif applications. Other DeXtop features include integrated support for utilities such as Netscape, Acrobat, and Postscript viewer; a graphical login and session manager; glibc 2.1 support; and full XiG X11R6.4 and Open Motif 2.1.30p2 source code.</p><p>Xi Graphics Inc.</p><p>1801 Broadway, Suite 1710 </p><p>Denver, CO 80202</p><p>303-298-7478</p><p>http://www.xig.com/</p><p></p><p>Tech Soft America has announced the availability of the HOOPS/Stream and HOOPS/ActiveX Toolkits for creating web-based visualization applications or publishing models to the Web. HOOPS/Stream is the latest extension to HOOPS/3DAF, and lets you create highly compressed, stream-capable files, enabling the efficient transfer of large models containing 2D, 3D, and custom data. The complementary HOOPS/Active X component gives you a set of base classes for building custom ActiveX controls. The HOOPS streaming technology is designed to be a modular set of components for building custom applications, is targeted to CAD/CAM/CAE developers, is not limited to OpenGL 3D primitives, and does not require a separate web server module.</p><p>Tech Soft America</p><p>1301 Marina Village Parkway, Suite 300</p><p>Alameda, CA 94501</p><p>510-769-2300</p><p>http://www.hoops3d.com/</p><p>PowerChart, a Java Charting component from ProtoView Development, is a set of integrated JavaBeans that provide 2D and 3D rendering of a wide variety of graph types to any Java application. This version of the tool supports charting types of area, bar, candle, column, line, pie, stock, and surface. Charts can be rotated in any direction as well as zoomed in and out, and there is an interactive point-and-click interface for changes to data and styles. PowerChart can get data from JDBC data, streaming data, XML or n-tier data feeds. The data models also conform to standard JavaBeans models for 2-dimensional data. For thin client delivery, PowerChart can remain on the server and dynamically render JPG-format charts to HTML or JSP pages. </p><p>ProtoView Development</p><p>2540 Route 130</p><p>Cranbury, NJ 08512</p><p>609-655-5000</p><p>http://www.protoview.com/</p><p>CARIS has released Spatial Fusion Developer, a Java tool for integrating distributed multiformat datasets online.

The Suite supports the MCF5407 chip as well as the series 2 and 3 ColdFire cores. The simulator lets ColdFire programs be developed without hardware; when the hardware becomes available, the parallel port BDM (background debug mode) debugger extends the source-level debugging capabilities to the hardware. The simulation and remote debugging environments are almost identical, and a script file to configure the debugger can be automatically generated by the simulator.</p><p>Crossware Products</p><p>Old Post House, Silver Street, </p><p>Litlington, Royston, Herts, </p><p>SG8 0QE, UK</p><p>44-0-1763-853500</p><p>http://www.crossware.com/</p><p>A new version of the webMapServer Internet mapping toolkit from Graticule now has functions for WAP access. webMapServer runs on a Windows NT 4 Server and offers a range of functions for creating high-quality maps and making these available over the Web.

First released in 1990, CNL is a collection of more than 300 mathematical and statistical analysis functions written in C that you can embed directly into numerical analysis applications. The primary enhancement in Version 4.0 is that the Library is now thread-safe, meaning application developers can integrate CNL into multithreaded applications. In addition, CNL routines can now be more easily called from relational database management systems such as Oracle and Informix. </p><p>Visual Numerics Inc.</p><p>5775 Flatiron Parkway, Suite 220</p><p>Boulder, CO 80301</p><p>303-939-8797</p><p>http://www.vni.com/</p><p>Harmonic Software has announced O-Matrix Developers Version, a tool that lets you create binary O-Matrix applications that can be distributed royalty free.
