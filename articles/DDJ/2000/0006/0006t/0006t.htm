ArcView Spatial Analyst 2 introduces ESRI's ModelBuilder, which integrates logical modeling with GIS functionality. It provides you with a set of easy-to-use tools for building and interacting with various types of spatial models. Users construct models with process wizards or by dragging icons representing data (grid themes, for instance) and functions into the model and connecting them with lines to show how the data is processed. Models can be created, saved, and rerun using different input data and function parameters.</p><p>ESRI</p><p>380 New York Street</p><p>Redlands, CA 92373</p><p>800-447-9778</p><p>http://www.esri.com/spatialanalyst/</p><p>Dundas Chart, from Dundas Software, is an OpenGL powered charting component for use with Windows DNA 2000, Active Server Pages, Visual Basic, and Visual C++ development projects.

Using re-View C++, you can examine the directories and libraries where the source code is stored. From this point, the tools automatically generate an initial layout of the inherent structures and dependencies within the code base. The tools let you refine and modify software without compromising existing round-trip engineering processes. The tool also allows for the development of more accurate project plans. Headway re-View C++ costs $1000.00. A 30-day evaluation version of the software is available at the Headway Software web site.</p><p>Headway Software</p><p>48 Upper Mount Street</p><p>Dublin 2, Ireland</p><p>353-1-6787178</p><p>http://www.headway-software.com/</p><p>Numerical Objects AS has shipped the Diffpack Datafilter Toolbox 1.0 -- a plug-in module to the Diffpack Multi-Physics Simulation Framework.

The Zend Optimizer speeds up the execution of PHP code, and is available in a version compatible with the current Beta 4 release of PHP 4.0. The Zend Optimizer uses multipass code optimizations to double the running speed of PHP 4.0 applications by running several optimization passes on the code, created by the run-time compiler, before the code is executed. The Zend Optimizer is capable of performing approximately 20 different optimizations. For example, one of the simpler optimizations that the Zend Optimizer does is to change postincrementing to preincrementing everywhere possible, since preincrementing is considerably faster. PHP (http://www.php.net/) is an open-source scripting language used for developing dynamic web pages for e-commerce and other dynamic web applications.</p><p>Zend Technologies</p><p>35 Jabotinsky Street</p><p>Ramat-Gan 52511, Israel</p><p>972-3-6139</p><p>http://www.zend.com/</p><p>VxDWriter 2.0 is a Windows 95/98 device driver (VxD) development tool from Techsoft. Using this tool, VxD can be developed entirely in C/C++ without requiring any assembly-language programming. The resulting VxD, when compiler optimization is enabled, is supposedly comparable with that written in assembly language in code efficiency and size. Key features include VxDWizard, special Ring 0 run-time library, more than 620 additional VxD service wrapper functions, a highly optimized VxD Foundation Class Library, support for developing VxD in the Visual C++ IDE, integrated help file with Win98 DDK, sample VxDs, and most of the run-time library source code. The VxDWriter costs $429.00 and can be purchased from the company's web site.</p><p>Techsoft Pvt.

RTOS-32 is a scalable component architecture, so that only the components needed by the application are loaded on the target. RTOS-32 consists of the RTTarget-32 development system, the RTKernel-32 real-time scheduler, the RTFiles-32 embedded file system, and the RTIP-32 embedded TCP/IP stack. The development system integrates with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 and also supports Borland C, Watcom C, and Borland Delphi. The TCP/IP stack makes the core TCP/IP protocols available through the UNIX socket API. Pricing starts at $1700.00.</p><p>On Time Software</p><p>88 Christian Avenue</p><p>Setauket, NY 11733</p><p>631-689-6654</p><p>http://www.on-time.com/</p><p>Zentropix has announced the availability of a set of Perl bindings that let you use the Real Time Application Interface (RTAI) programming API from a scripting environment. The bindings extend the LXRT technique in the RTAI to a scripting environment. RTAI facilitates hard real-time programming on a Linux system by using its API within a user-written kernel module. LXRT provides soft real-time support for Linux using a new paradigm. Rather than altering the Linux scheduler, LXRT uses a proxy hard real-time process to carry out the scheduling duties of the user space process. RTAI, LXRT, and the LXRT Perl bindings are all released under terms of the GNU LGPL. </p><p>Zentropix</p><p>441-B Carlisle Drive</p><p>Herndon, VA 20170</p><p>703-471-6690</p><p>http://www.zentropix.com/</p><p>Chilisoft has released Chilisoft Active Server Pages (ASP) for Linux.
