The new release replaces SPEC CPU95, which will be gradually phased out by July 2000. Performance results from CPU2000 cannot be compared to those from CPU95, since new benchmarks have been added and existing ones changed. SPEC CPU2000 comprises two sets of benchmarks: CINT2000 for measuring integer performance, and CFP2000 for floating-point performance. SPEC CPU2000 results are available at the SPEC web site. The SPEC CPU2000 software is available on CD-ROM from SPEC, priced at $125.00 for universities, $250.00 for current licensees, and $500.00 for new customers.</p><p>SPEC</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>10754 Ambassador Drive, Suite 201</p><p>Manassas, VA 20109</p><p>703-331-0180</p><p>http://www.spec.org/osg/cpu2000/</p><p>ISE Eiffel Version 4.5 has been released by Interactive Software Engineering. Changes in ISE Eiffel 4.5 include EiffelBench compiler and development environment modifications for faster C compilation, with a finalization from a precompiled system as fast as a finalization from scratch, together with many other optimizations. ISE Eiffel 4.5 features a major release of the EiffelCOM library on the client and server side (to enable the user to produce COM applications from Eiffel). ISE Eiffel 4.5 also offers recursive clusters where users can specify "all" in the Ace file, so that all subdirectories will be compiled. Enhancements within EiffelBench for 4.5 include a new Eiffel parser completely rewritten in Eiffel with no more length limitations in either the number of generic parameters, the length of identifiers, or the length of manifest strings. ISE Eiffel 4.5 is available on Windows, Linux, UNIX, Cray, embedded, and VMS. Pricing for Eiffel 4.5 starts at $79.95 for the personal version, and $595.00 for the professional version. ISE Eiffel 4.5 is available for free download and trial at http://www.eiffel.com/.</p><p>Interactive Software Engineering, Inc.</p><p>270 Storke Road, Suite 7 </p><p>Goleta, CA  93117</p><p>805-685-1006</p><p>http:// www.eiffel.com/</p><p>CryptoObject has announced CryptoObject Version 1.0, a utility that enables cryptography from within Microsoft's Active Server Pages. CryptoObject 1.0 is a simple COM object that wraps the base cryptography functions provided by the Microsoft Cryptographic API (CryptoAPI). The CryptoAPI has a handle-base design that works well for traditional C++ and Visual Basic developers, but does not work well when used within IIS/ASP or Windows Scripting Host. CryptoObject 1.0 runs under Windows 95/98 and NT 4.0. A single-server license is available for $100.00. </p><p>CryptoObject</p><p>705 Laurel Bay Lane</p><p>Holly Springs, NC 27540</p><p>http://www.cryptoobject.com/</p><p>Blinkinc has released Blinkinc DeltaPatch 1.2, a multiplatform change distribution system that updates virtually any type of file. This program lets you distribute any necessary changes to software and data. With DeltaPatch 1.2, you can send out a small patch file of just the changes to your software, instead of redistributing the entire system every time you make a minor update. The Apply program may be freely distributed, so generic patch files that will only update current users can be posted on the Web for download. The Build program uses an intelligent algorithm to compare old versions of files or directories to their new versions and create a patch file of the differences. Free upgrades and fully functional demo versions of all Blinkinc tools are available at http://www.blinkinc.com/.</p><p>Blinkinc</p><p>P.O.
