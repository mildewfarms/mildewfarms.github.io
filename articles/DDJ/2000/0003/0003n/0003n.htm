Shasha</h3><I>Dennis, a professor of computer science at New York University, is the author of The Puzzling Adventures of Dr. Ecco (Dover, 1998), Codes, Puzzles, and Conspiracy (W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., 1992). He can be contacted at DrEcco@ddj.com.</I><hr><p>Benjamin Baskerhound himself was at our door. Kidnapper of Ecco, stealer of submarines, would-be founder of a colony in Antarctica, Baskerhound had promised the authorities that he would avoid mischief ever since his radical brain surgery and subsequent (in my opinion, ill-advised) presidential pardon.</p><p>"I now invent fictional strategy games," he said, paused, his eyes twinkling, "without ulterior motive." He had lost weight since the last time I saw him. He now would have blended into the professional class of any college campus: sports jacket, unruly hair, crooked glasses, and intelligent, bemused eyes. I still saw wickedness behind those eyes, I must confess. "I have invented a game now that I can't solve. It's so easy to explain, I call it 'Simple.'"</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>I saw Liane rub her hands in delight. Ecco too leaned forward in his chair. In spite of (or because of?) their history together, Ecco seemed comfortable with Baskerhound.</p><p>"The game is played on a grid without boundaries," Baskerhound began. "Players -- we'll call them player X and player O -- alternate moves as in tic-tac-toe. Player X goes first. The object is to get four-in-a-row. But the four must be connected either vertically or horizontally. Diagonal foursomes don't count." </p><p>"Still, as in tic-tac-toe, the first player has quite an advantage," Liane observed. "Is there any compensating advantage for the second player?"</p><p>"Well, yes," said Baskerhound, "But that is where I need your help. To win, player X (the first player) must get four-in-a-row before player O does and player X must win within his first 10 moves. If, after 10 moves of player X, that player has no vertical or horizontal four-in-a-row, then player O wins." </p><p>"So, no game can have more than 19 Xs and Os on the page," said Liane, showing off a little.</p><p>"You do credit to your uncle Ecco here, young lady," Baskerhound said to Liane. "But the real question is this: Does either side have a winning strategy? If so, is 10 too low a number or doesn't it matter?" </p><p>After a few seconds of silence, Liane spoke up. "If only three-in-a-row were necessary, then player X could win in exactly three moves. Here is how:</p><blockquote><p>Player X moves and O moves next to X.</p><p>XO</p><p>Now, player X moves orthogonally to where O moved:</p><p>XO</p><p>X</p></blockquote><p>Since X only needs to get three in a row, there is no way for O to stop X."</p><p>"Right," said Ecco. "The question of four should bend to the same reasoning. After all, any three-in-a-row with open ends on both sides should force a win. Still, the problem is not trivial at all. We need to think." </p><p>Ecco invited Baskerhound and Liane to a table. After an hour of playing on paper and chessboard, with much chuckling and exclamations of surprise, Ecco, Baskerhound, and Liane turned to me with a look of triumph.</p><p>"We think we have it," said Liane.</p><p><i>Reader: Does either player have a winning strategy and, if so, what is the strategy? If player X can force a win, then how many moves are needed? If player O can force a win (by preventing player X from winning in 10 moves), then does X ever have a winning strategy?</i></p><p>"But there are some open questions with answers we don't know," Ecco added. "Does the answer change if both players must always--after player X's first move--place a mark that is one square away (either horizontally or vertically) from some other mark? That is, after player X's first move, every new O must be next to some O or X and similarly for every X. What if we allow one square away diagonally too?</p><p>"We also have some variants of the game. Can either player be sure to get four-in-a-row more than once? What is the situation if winning requires five-in-a-row?" </p><p>I don't know the answers to any of the questions, nor do I know whether my friends -- and Baskerhound, too -- ever figured them out.</p><p><i>Reader: Would you like to have a try?</p><h3></i>Last Month's Solution</h3><p>The data is consistent, thankfully. <A NAME="rf1"><A HREF="0003nf1.htm">Figure 1</A> is one design that works.</p><h3>Reader Notes on "My Enemy's Enemy"</h3><p>Nearly all readers who submitted a solution for "My Enemy's Enemy" (<i>DDJ</i>, December 1999) submitted the best possible solution. (Dr. Ecco's published solution was worse, partly because the initial conditions stated numerically were wrong. Group 9 was initially red, but was miscounted as blue.)</p><p>First, readers recognized that good solutions required having some groups change alliances twice. (Are border states always fickle?) Next, they saw that nine alliance changes was a minimum. As Alan Dragoo put it: "The five original reds must change once each and two other groups must change twice each, creating and destroying links connecting the reds to each other and/or to the sea in order to avoid having a group surrounded by its enemies." </p><p>Finally, they found the following ordering, which should present the minimum difficulty of 309,803.55 for conversion: 10 to red, 6 to red, 20 to blue, 2 to blue, 8 to blue, 9 to blue, 15 to blue, 10 to blue, and 6 to blue. </p><p>Readers who achieved this were, in order of submission: Jon Beal, Richard Roy, Greg Smith, Eric W. Biederman, Kevin Ruland, Jason Strickland, James H. Puttick, Rodney &amp; Jialin Meyer, Magne Oestlyngen, Patrick R. Schonfeld, Steve Tether, Pearl Pauling, Larry Holding, Philip Mayfield, Jimmy Hu, Tomas G. Rokicki, Alan Dragoo, and Mark Yendt. Clever people.</p><p><b>DDJ</b></p></body></html>
