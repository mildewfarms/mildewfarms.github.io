It lets system administrators substitute Perl scripts for Sendmail recipes. PerlMx handles mail as Sendmail is dealing with it, not after, so scripts can be written to immediately bounce certain pieces of mail without using Sendmail resources. It also runs as a constant process; it does not start up and shut down for every message. PerlMx operates on the Linux and Solaris platforms.</p><p>ActiveState Tool </p><p>P.O.
