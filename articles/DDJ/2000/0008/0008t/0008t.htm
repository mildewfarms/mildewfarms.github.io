<p>DarkBASIC is a Windows-based development environment designed to let you tap directly into the DirectX architecture. DarkBASIC programs are compiled into optimized scripts that run almost as fast as C. DarkBASIC supports numerous graphics features, including automated double buffering, full-screen display modes, AVI animation control, MIDI music control, and 3D sound effects. Supported 2D and 3D features include landscape terraforming, dynamic model space, polygon collision detection, model animation, ambient lighting, alphablending, fogging, and more. DarkBASIC is available on CD-ROM for $70.00. A trial version of DarkBASIC, along with documentation and special-effect demos and tools, is available at the company's web site.</p>

<p>Spider Software has ported its SpiderSTREAMS -- a platform for the deployment of wide-area communications protocols -- to Linux. The STREAMS protocol stacks run as a Linux process, interacting with applications through an interprocess communication driver. It requires no modifications to the Linux kernel code. Frame Relay and X.25 will be the first protocols to be deployed by Spider in a Linux environment. The initial release will be on PC hardware and PCI interface cards.</p>

<p>Oakdale Engineering has announced that DataFit 7.0 is now shipping. DataFit is designed to aid in the tasks of curve fitting (nonlinear regression), statistical analysis, and data presentation. It determines whether a relationship exists between two or more variables, describes the nature of the relationship in the form of a mathematical equation, and then assesses the degree of accuracy of prediction achieved by the equation. Improvements in Version 7.0 include a reduction in solution time, enhanced 2D and 3D plotting capabilities, the addition of plot templates, stepwise variable selection procedures (data mining), enhanced data importing and editing features, and enhancements to nongraphical macro features. DataFit runs on Windows and costs $199.00 for a single-user license.</p>

<p>Software AG has launched Tamino, a native XML information server that provides web-enabled data exchange and application integration. Tamino can store and treat data structures of any kind as XML objects, increasing interoperability of data among applications. XML data without a previously defined structure is also accepted and stored. Tamino can provide additional communication channels as necessary by adopting existing HTTP servers, and it supports single-sign-on security systems and existing methods of encryption (RACF, NTLM, Kerberos, and SSL). It is available now for Windows NT, with versions for UNIX, Linux, and IBM mainframes to follow later this year. </p>
