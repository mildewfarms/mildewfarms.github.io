<h2>FEATURES </h2>


<h3><a href="0008a/0008a.htm">INSIDE XBOX GRAPHICS</a></h3>

<h4>by Michael Abrash</h4>

<p>Microsoft's upcoming Xbox game console has some pretty impressive graphics capabilities. Michael ought to know -- he's been developing the graphics internals for the past few months.</p>

<h3><a href="0008b/0008b.htm">TRIANGLE INTERSECTION TESTS</a></h3>

<h4>by Eric Haines and Tomas M&ouml;ller </h4>

<p>Our authors provide an alternative to the classic methods of testing whether a point is inside a triangle. This new technique is based on barycentric coordinates. </p>

<h3><a href="0008c/0008c.htm">OPTIMIZING 3DNOW! REAL-TIME GRAPHICS</a></h3>

<h4>by Max I. Fomitchev</h4>

<p>One approach to pumping up real-time 3D graphics performance is AMD's 3DNow! technology, which adds floating-point SIMD extensions to the original x86 instruction set. Max examines 3DNow! technology, then provides guidelines for optimizing its performance even more.</p>

<h3><a href="0008d/0008d.htm">AUGURAL IMAGE ZOOMING</a></h3>

<h4>by Wm. Douglas Withers</h4>

<p>Augural image zooming is a new method for zooming images with a minimum of computation, while keeping smooth regions smooth and sharp edges sharp. </p>

<h3><a href="0008e/0008e.htm">AUTOMATED BUILDS</a></h3>

<h4>by Aspi Havewala</h4>

<p>Automated builds refer to a series of commands that can be executed to compile and link source code into its final deliverable format. Aspi discusses some advantages of automated builds, and suggests some features your builds can incorporate.</p>

<h3><a href="0008f/0008f.htm">EXAMINING VMWARE</a></h3>

<h4>by Jason Nieh and Ozgur Can Leonard</h4>

<p>VMware is a virtual machine platform that provides an abstraction of x86 PC hardware so that multiple operating systems can run unmodified at the same time on a standard PC. Among other things, this means you can run Windows applications with Linux. </p>

<h3><a href="0008g/0008g.htm">A LINUX IEEE 1394 CONFIGURATION ROM DECODER</a></h3>

<h4>by William F. Alexander</h4>

<p>William's DumpRom program is designed to read and decode the configuration ROM of 1394 peripherals. He presents the Linux implementation of DumpRom using an OHCI 1394 controller. </p>

<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2>


<h3><a href="0008h/0008h.htm">RELIABILITY &amp; EMBEDDED NETWORKS</a></h3>

<h4>by H. Thomas Richter</h4>

<p>Reliability requirements for embedded networks are more critical than with nonembedded networks. Thomas presents a new method for ensuring reliable communication between hosts in small networked environments.  </p>

<h2>INTERNET PROGRAMMING</h2>


<h3><a href="0008i/0008i.htm">DB FORMS: PHP, MYSQL, AND PHPLIB</a></h3>

<h4>by Darryl Ross and Con Zymaris</h4>

<p>Darryl and Con use the PHP server-side scripting engine, MySQL database engine, and PHPLIB class framework to build DB Forms, a reusable database framework for writing web applications.</p>

<h2>PROGRAMMER'S TOOLCHEST</h2>


<h3><a href="0008j/0008j.htm">EXAMINING THE 3D GAME STUDIO TOOLKIT</a></h3>

<h4>by Clayton E. Crooks II</h4>

<p>3D Game Studio from Conitec is a Win32-based authoring system for  creating interactive 3D applications. Clayton uses it to build a typical  three-room world that includes actor movements. </p>

<h2>COLUMNS </h2>


<h3><a href="0008k/0008k.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</a></h3>

<h4>by Michael Swaine</h4>

<p>C.J. Date's new book <i>What Not How: The Business Rules Approach to  Application Development</i> gets Michael thinking about Prolog, declarative programming, business rules, and the state of software development  in general.</p>

<h3><a href="0008l/0008l.htm">C PROGRAMMING</a></h3>
	
<h4>by Al Stevens </h4>

<p>You'd think that after 12 years, Al would figure out that complaining isn't  worth the effort. But you have to hand it to him -- he doesn't give up.</p>

<p></p>

<h3><a href="0008m/0008m.htm">JAVA Q&amp;A</a></h3>

<h4>by Alexandre Sieira Vilar</h4>

<p>Object pooling can be used very effectively to reduce the number of  garbage collection executions in a Java application. And that reduction  can deliver benefits in terms of reduced processor usage and the  absence of unpredictable delays.</p>

<p></p>

<h3><a href="0008n/0008n.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY</a></h3>

<h4>by Laurence Marrie</h4>

<p>Alternating skip lists are an option anywhere balanced search trees are appropriate. Laurence presents a subset of <i>std::set</i> functionality using ASLs,  and gives a basic space/time comparison against a typical red-black tree implementation. </p>

<h3><a href="0008o/0008o.htm">DR. ECCO'S OMNIHEURIST CORNER</a></h3>

<h4>by Dennis E. Shasha</h4>

<p>Nefarious criminals might be able to foil robotic prison guards, but  out-thinking Ecco and Liane is another task altogether.</p>

<p></p>

<h3><a href="0008p/0008p.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF</a></h3>

<h4>by Gregory V. Wilson</h4>
