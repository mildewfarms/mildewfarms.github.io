OpenSSH is to be released with OpenBSD 2.6, and is compatible with both SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols. It dodges most restrictions on the free distribution of strong cryptography. Without SSH, terminal sessions transmitted in clear text let eavesdroppers on the Internet capture user names and password combinations, thus bypassing the security measures in the operating system. OpenSSH relies on the Secure Sockets Layer Library (libssl), which incorporates the RSA public-key cryptography system. </p><p>OpenBSD<br>812 23rd Avenue SE<br>Calgary, AB<br>Canada T2G 1N8<br>http://www.openbsd.org/</p><p>Mabry Software has released HTTP/X, an ActiveX control that provides high-level access to the HTTP protocol. HTTP/X comes both as an ActiveX control (OCX) and a COM object (DLL). HTTP/X runs in Visual Basic, Visual FoxPro, Internet Explorer, Delphi, and any other environment that supports either ActiveX controls or COM objects. With HTTP/X, you can use the normal event-driven programming model or Fast Notifications, which allows your program to quickly receive events through simple functions rather than having to fire an event. HTTP/X supports nonblocking asynchronous mode as well as pseudoblocking and true blocking modes, and use behind firewalls. HTTP/X is priced at $79.00. A version that includes the C++ source code is priced at $199.00. Free demo copies are available at the company's web site.</p><p>Mabry Software<br>503 316th Street NW	<br>Stanwood, WA 98292<br>360-629-9278<br>http://www.mabry.com/</p><p>Progress Sonic MQ, from Progress Software, is an Internet messaging server for Java developers. The Sonic MQ server is based on the Java Message Service (JMS) specification from Sun, but extends it to include features such as a hub-and-spoke architecture, XML compliance, Java-based graphical administration or command-line tool options, and hierarchical name spaces. Sonic MQ ships in two versions: Enterprise Edition for deployment configurations and complex development environments; and Developer Edition, letting you build and test messaging applications.
