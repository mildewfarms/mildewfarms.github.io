REBOL/Command 1.0 lets you extend your REBOL language-based applications by integrating them with platform-specific libraries, tools, third-party applications, and databases. REBOL/Command-based applications directly integrate with e-mail, web servers, and database systems (through ODBC under Windows, as well as direct communication with databases such as Oracle). REBOL/Command is available for Windows, Linux, and Solaris, and starts at $249.00.</p><p>REBOL Technologies</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>301 South State Street</p><p>Ukiah, CA 95482</p><p>707-467-8000</p><p>http://www.rebol.com/</p><p>Jn-Software has released VBAcodePrint, a Visual Basic add-in that enhances source code printing across the Microsoft Office 2000 suite of applications. VBAcodePrint's main window is a dockable floating toolbar that integrates fully with Visual Basic for Applications, and can be used to set options, preview source code, print it without previewing, or export the formatted output to RTF ready to be incorporated into word processors. VBAcodePrint's color-coded printing lets users specify the font attributes and colors for comments, identifiers, keywords, line numbers, strings, procedure headings, and page headers and footers. VBAcodePrint costs $25.00.</p><p>Jn-Software</p><p>P.O.

The EC++ compiler is a component in the IAR Embedded Workbench. Features of the compiler include the ability to allocate a number of registers to the developer instead of the compiler, making it more efficient when switching context in an RTOS. A set of new keywords to extend the C/EC++ language has also been introduced, such as the "_eeprom" keyword to gain direct access to the EEPROM memory from C/EC++. The stack sizes and addresses to external memory can also be specified within the IAR Embedded Workbench.</p><p>IAR Systems</p><p>One Maritime Plaza, Suite 1770 </p><p>San Francisco, CA 94111</p><p>415-765-5500</p><p>http://www.iar.com/</p><p>Polyspace has announced a software verification and validation tool that automatically evaluates every program execution case to identify code that is incorrect. The C Verifier requires only correct compilation, not modification or execution of the source code. C Verifier detects an attempt to read a noninitialized variable; access conflicts for unprotected shared data; referencing through null or out-of-bounds pointers; out-of-bounds array access; buffer overflow; division by zero; invalid arithmetic operations; overflow and underflow of arithmetic operations for integers and floating-point numbers; unreachable code; and illegal type conversion. The software program runs on personal computers under Linux and on Sun workstations under Solaris.</p><p>Polyspace Technologies</p><p>100 Cummings Center, Suite 207P</p><p>Beverly, MA 01915</p><p>877-711-POLY</p><p>http://www.polyspace.com/</p><p>IBM's VisualAge for Java Version 3.5 includes a new servlet wizard; prebuilt solution templates; improved bridge to external version control systems; storage for heterogeneous resources; an XML toolkit; and solution maps.

By directly querying a Windows NT domain, InaAuthenticate enables password and user name authentication across the entire network. It can also verify that users belong to certain groups within the domain, and it allows for the retrieval of all groups users belong to within the domain. As such, it can support security systems that restrict user access or grant permission to specific areas within a site.</p><p>Inabyte Inc.</p><p>5 Betty Lane</p><p>Novato, CA 94947</p><p>415-883-3407</p><p>http://www.inabyte.com/</p><p>Syware has announced Visual CE 5.0, a database development tool for building customized databases on Windows CE and Pocket PC handheld computers. Visual CE 5.0 has been designed to mirror the look-and-feel of the device it is running on. New features include the ability to open an image, play a recorded sound, or open a Pocket Word document from within a database form. Data can be pulled from multiple tables and shown on a single form. In addition, the contents of a drop-down list can be changed based on the value selected in another list.
