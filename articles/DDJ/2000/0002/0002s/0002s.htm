The FairCom ODBC Driver is based on single-tier driver technology that indicates all of the program logic necessary to handle requests from a front-end application contained within the driver itself, including a SQL interpreter. The ODBC-compliant application uses the FairCom driver to access c-tree data files via the traditional c-tree ISAM API. The FairCom ODBC Driver: c-tree 4.3 Edition is priced separately for end users and for FairCom developers who wish to deploy directly to their customers. c-tree Plus sells for $895.00.</p><p>FairCom Corp.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>2100 Forum Boulevard, Suite C</p><p>Columbia, MO 65203-5456 </p><p>800-234-8180 </p><p>http://www.faircom.com/</p><p>Excelon Stylus, an Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) editing tool, has been released by Object Design.

Two Java tools that provide services to help reduce the cost and time required to create Internet applications. Java Blend 2.0 software is a data access tool that connects distributed applications with multiple sources of data. Java Blend includes transparent persistence capabilities that allow developers access to tables, attributes, and rows, without writing any JDBC or SQL code. It maps relational database tables into Java objects and eliminates impedance mismatch, the gap that occurs when mapping 2D data with Java objects. Java Message Queue 1.0 enterprise messaging software provides a standard way for business applications to communicate and exchange information. Its software allows developers to focus on creating business logic, and is a full production implementation of the open-standard Java Message Service 1.0.1 specification, which provides improvements over traditional process-oriented messaging systems. Java Message Queue software intelligently routes messages throughout the network for efficient bandwidth usage. </p><p>Sun Microsystems Inc.</p><p>901 San Antonio Road</p><p>Palo Alto, CA 94303 </p><p>800-555-9786</p><p>http://www.sun.com/</p><p>Tashcom Software has introduced ASPEdit 2.05 for Windows, an Active Server Pages, scripting, and HTML editor.

These tools are for real-time Linux development. The R2D2 debugger addresses later development stages during which it is critical that the application is not stopped or stepped during the debug. This debugger provides nonintrusive, run-time symbolic access to parameters within user space and within the kernel and its modules, while the application continues to execute at its normal iteration. This paradigm increases the speed and simplicity of application tuning, integration, and verification. Both products are available on Zentropix's validated RealTime Linux installation CD, Version 2.2.</p><p>Zentropic Computing, LLC (Zentropix)</p><p>441-B Carlisle Drive</p><p>Herndon, VA 20170</p><p>703-471-6690</p><p>http://www.zentropix.com/</p><p>The Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) and The Portland Group (PGI) have released an optimized version of the NAG Fortran Library for Intel processor-based Linux workstations, servers, and clusters. Mark 18 of the NAG Fortran Library for Linux is built and validated using PGI's Linux compiler, and is fully interoperable with the latest release of PGI's Fortran, C, and C++ compilers, and tools for Linux. The NAG Library comprises reusable software components packaged to provide application developers with mathematical and statistical functionality. The Portland Group has also announced PGI Workstation 3.1, the latest release of PGI's suite of parallel Fortran, C, and C++ compilers and tools. PGI Workstation 3.1 is supported on Intel processor-based workstations, servers, and clusters running the Linux, Solaris86, and NT operating systems.

Test objectives can either be provided by the user, with respect to functional requirements, or computed by TestComposer, with respect to structural coverage. Test suites are currently generated either in Message Sequence Charts (MSC) or in Tree and Tabular Combined Notation (TTCN) format. ObjectGeode is a toolset dedicated to analysis, design, verification, and validation through simulation, code generation, and testing of real-time and distributed applications. ObjectGeode supports a coherent integration of complementary object-oriented approaches based on standards: UML, SDL, and MSC. ObjectGeode provides graphical editors, a powerful interactive, random, and exhaustive simulator, a C/C++ code generator targeting popular real-time OSs such as VxWorks, VRTX, pSOS+, Win32, Posix, and Chorus, and network protocols such as TCP/IP, and a design-level debugger.
