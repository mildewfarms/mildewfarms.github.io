<p>Conventional lithography-based VLSI technology is fast approaching the limits 
  of its capabilities. The reasons for this range from ultra-thin gate oxides, 
  short channel effects, and doping fluctuations, to increasingly difficult and 
  expensive lithography. To surmount problems such as these, nanoscale quantum 
  devices and circuits have been proposed for some time, and demonstrations of 
  many of these technologies have been accomplished. Still, the question remains 
  whether these will be viable technology alternatives for the postVLSI era. </p>
<h3>Limiting Factors</h3>
<p>Many of these proposals do not critically address the major limiting factors 
  of a 2D lithography-based technology: accessible parallel fabrication, interconnection 
  density, and alignment. Any successful new technology must solve the interconnect 
  problem, use self-aligned fabrication, and operate at room temperature and at 
  the atomic level. The last point is important because scaling any technology 
  to the 10-nM level may not be cost effective, as the performance increase is 
  marginal compared to the development costs. </p>
<DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE> 
<p>Recently, molecular electronics-based computation has attracted attention because 
  it addresses the ultimate in a dimensionally scaled system -- ultra-dense and 
  molecular-scale. An additional driving factor is the potential to utilize thermodynamically 
  driven directed self-assembly of components, such as chemically synthesized 
  interconnects, active devices, and circuits. This approach for spontaneously 
  assembling atomic scale electronics attacks the interconnection and critical 
  dimension control problems in one step, and is implicitly atomic scale. Concurrently, 
  the approach utilizes inherently self-aligned batch processing techniques that 
  address the fabrication limitations of conventional VLSI.</p>
<h3>Synthetic Chemistry</h3>
<p>The world of synthetic chemistry lets you create complex structure and function 
  in a batch parallel fabrication method. And unlike the operation of semiconductor 
  devices that depends critically on lithography-defined processes (and thus inherently 
  has variation), every molecular device is precisely the same. The nagging problem 
  of having to make hundreds of millions of integrated silicon devices, each having 
  characteristics identical to one another, becomes difficult (if not impossible) 
  to achieve as the device is downscaled. This problem does not exist in the molecular 
  device realm, where all the molecules must inherently be the same.</p>
<p>The methods used to produce these molecules are the same as those in the pharmaceutical 
  industry. For example, a molecular device is created by starting with a compound, 
  then gradually transforming it by adding prescribed reagents whose molecules 
  are known to bond to others at certain specific sites, and creating the desired 
  orbital structure. The procedure may take many steps, but gradually the pieces 
  come together to form a new potential molecular device.</p>
<p>To achieve these results and demonstrate electrical function, researchers needed 
  a way to make physical and electrical contacts to something the size of a single 
  molecule -- a challenge that has stymied them for many years. How do you contact 
  the molecular world? Once a molecular species is made, how is it turned into 
  a device that can be plugged into a conventional electronic circuit? </p>
<h3>Atomic Fab Techniques</h3>
<p>For molecular-scale electronics to come of age, fabrication and measurement 
  techniques had to reach the atomic scale. The advent of atomic imaging techniques, 
  such as the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic force microscope, 
  have given us an atomic view of molecular placement, fabrication, and self-assembly. 
</p>
<p>Manipulating molecules, one at a time, has become possible with the invention 
  of the scanning tunneling microscope. However, STM, or single manipulation, 
  loses its utility for large-scale electronics -- what you want is a method to 
  manipulate molecules to where you want (that is, fabricate the device) in a 
  manner that is analogous to the parallel processing strategy of lithography. 
</p>
<p>The key is a technique called "self-assembly." First developed by Dave Allara 
  at Bell Labs, it was discovered that certain molecular endgroups could have 
  an extremely high affinity to binding onto metal surfaces. One of the most common 
  and well studied is the sulfur endgroup gold system called "thiol." A variety 
  of other endgroup-contact systems are available as well. You now only need to 
  attach the sticky endgroups to the molecular device of interest, and they spontaneously 
  assemble onto the metallic contacts, forming the device. If you can assemble 
  truly large-scale functional electronic components, the technique is not only 
  analogous to lithography, it is better -- no lithography steps need to be performed 
  in the device fabrication. </p>
<h3>Early Measurements</h3>
<p>In 1996, the first measurements of a self-assembled molecule were performed 
  by Paul Weiss's group at Penn State University using molecules synthesized by 
  James Tour's group at the University of South Carolina. Using STM, they qualitatively 
  observed conductivity of a designed molecular wire, self-assembled onto a substrate. 
  Similar results were also obtained in a group at Purdue University. At the same 
  time, the group at Yale University was performing the first quantitative electrical 
  measurements of a single molecule, fabricated by self-assembly; see <A NAME="rf1"></a><A HREF="0013bf1.htm">Figure 
  1</A>. Using the simplest possible construct to demonstrate the principles -- 
  a single benzene ring for mobile, delocalized electrons, with sticky thiol endgroups 
  on both ends to contact the metal leads -- the experiment for the first time 
  supplied real electrical characteristics to compare to theory, and demonstrated 
  that self-assembly was a viable technique. </p>
<p>The first observations of conduction in molecules quickly led to simple device 
  demonstrations. The simplest electronic device you can imagine is a diode. In 
  1997, only a few months after the first measurements, diodes were realized by 
  two separate groups -- one by Robert Metzger's group at the University of Alabama, 
  and another by Chong-Wu Zhou at Yale. The Alabama results were based on a molecule 
  that had an internal energetic line-up or orbitals, different depending on the 
  polarity of voltage applied. The Yale result used a different principle, the 
  difference in the line-up of the energies of the external metal contacts to 
  the internal molecular orbitals, to create large rectification. These first 
  basic device demonstrations set the stage for the design of truly useful and 
  interesting molecular devices and circuits.</p>
<p>To make these devices, an approach adopted by the Yale group (an adaptation 
  of a structure made first by Kristan Ralls and Bob Buhrman at Cornell University) 
  used an extremely minute device, called a "nanopore," in which a self-assembled 
  monolayer of a small number of the candidate species formed the active region 
  of the device. In a small 30-nanometer hole, a small number -- approximately 
  a thousand -- of the molecules self-assemble to form the device. Self-assembly 
  is a technique used to create a perfect single layer (or monolayer) of molecules 
  in a rigid structure. Typically, you start with a beaker containing a solution 
  of the molecules you want to attach to the active region of the device, which 
  has an exposed metal surface. By merely dipping the wafer with these exposed 
  areas into the beaker, the molecules attach themselves to the surface in a regular, 
  typically well-ordered array resembling a bed of nails. Evaporating a metal 
  contact onto the top of the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) completes this device.</p>
<h3>Making a Switch</h3>
<p>The first molecular diodes were made using devices like these -- but a diode 
  is not sufficient. To make a general-purpose computer, you need at minimum a 
  controllable switch. Even better, you need that switch to have amplification 
  (gain) to achieve large scales of integration. The silicon transistor is the 
  heart of integrated circuits for just that reason. Although the molecular equivalent 
  of a transistor with gain is yet to be discovered, researchers have taken the 
  first steps along the path by realizing switches.</p>
<p>The first observations of switching behavior, caused by a voltage-dependent 
  overlap of orbitals through a molecule, exhibited a very large switching behavior; 
  see <A NAME="rf2"></a><A HREF="0013bf2.htm">Figure 2</A>. This switching effect, 
  first seen by Jia Chen at Yale, has an on/off ratio greater than 1000 (compared 
  to around 100 seen in the solid state analogous device called a "resonant tunneling 
  diode," or RTD). Similar behavior was observed in experiments jointly conducted 
  by the University of California at Los Angeles and Hewlett-Packard. Although 
  these elements do not yet exhibit amplification, they still have a range of 
  potential circuit applications when combined with conventional electronics. 
</p>
<h3>Creating Memory</h3>
<p>As an example of the ease and flexibility in which molecular-scale devices 
  can be redesigned, a simple change to the internal electrically active unit 
  made the molecule sensitive to the charge state of the internal group. Absence 
  or presence of charge in the internal node would modify the orbital overlap 
  -- and it would retain, or remember, this charge for a long time. Thus, using 
  molecules, you have created a memory. In combination with switches, complex 
  circuits can be realized.</p>
<h3>A Sober View</h3>
<p>Given the potential fabrication and density advantages of molecular devices, 
  why don't we scrap silicon research and proceed wholeheartedly to molecular-based 
  systems? A sober view identifies a number of difficult obstacles, both fundamental 
  and technological, which must be surmounted before the potential benefits can 
  be realized. </p>
<p>Foremost is to make molecular devices that operate analogously, like a transistor, 
  with a third control terminal. With this achievement, the chemical synthesis 
  of tremendously efficient and complex circuits will be possible. Even before 
  then, combinations of molecular systems with conventional electronics will probably 
  be used in places where the advantages of self-assembly are natural.</p>
<p>Utilizing the impressive difference in densities may not be as simple as it 
  appears. The sheer thermal aspects of molecules as electronic devices, run in 
  a conventional mode, is staggering. Present state-of-the-art microprocessors 
  with 10 million transistors and a clock cycle of half a gigahertz (half a billion 
  cycles per second) emits almost 100 Watts -- similar in radiant heat to a range-top 
  cooking surface in the home -- and is close to the thermal limitations of the 
  technology. Knowing the minimum amount of heat that a single molecular device 
  gives puts a limit on the number of devices we can have on a chip (and this 
  underestimates the total amount of heat), because there is heat generated in 
  the interconnections between devices. This fundamental limit of a molecule, 
  operating at room temperature and at today's speeds, is about 50 picoWatts (a 
  millionth millionth of a Watt), which means a number of devices no greater than 
  100,000 times more than what we can do today. Although an appreciable advance, 
  it is far below the density one can achieve (in area, or perhaps in three dimensions) 
  by simple volume considerations.</p>
<p>Assumed here is the conventional notion that every device is addressable -- 
  that you can find a specific device from among the countless millions through 
  the interconnections, such as distinguishable street addresses. This kind of 
  addressing (random access) would be required, for example, to retrieve the contents 
  of a particular memory location. At present, there is no notion of how you can 
  create such an interconnect structure on the molecular level. Straightforward 
  extensions of the present techniques we employ to create complex microelectronics 
  are not useful for molecular scale electronics. Is the ability to address every 
  device -- the common architecture we use today -- necessary or efficient at 
  the type of molecular-scale densities we can achieve? Are the logic gate and 
  circuit approaches we have been using in semiconductor systems for the last 
  few decades the right approach? What will large-scale circuits of this technology 
  look like? </p>
<h3>Into the Future</h3>
<p>In the future, radical departures from present computing-design approaches, 
  for which we only have limited ideas and insight, will probably be needed to 
  fully exploit molecular computing systems if we want to extend microelectronics 
  significantly beyond the Moore's Law limit. The ability to construct complex 
  molecular devices, with a shopping list of how what can stick to whom, and in 
  what configurations, opens up an entirely different way to think about computer 
  construction. </p>
