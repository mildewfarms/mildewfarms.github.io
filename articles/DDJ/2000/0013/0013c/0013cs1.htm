Watson Research Center. The Software Technology team in IBM Research includes about 150 researchers worldwide, and encompasses research in programming languages and models, run times, and tools and frameworks necessary to build and deploy advanced applications. At a core technology level, the team has made significant efforts on Java, XML, and emerging e-business technologies, and is responsible for much of the technology driving the Java performance efforts from IBM. Building on the core technologies is a focus on tools and techniques for software design and engineering, such as design patterns, subject-oriented programming, and automated software testing. At the enterprise level, the team works on creating and enhancing new platforms, like web application servers such as WebSphere, and bringing programming to business domain experts through technologies such as Enterprise Builder. Most recently, the Software Technology team has been exploring technology for nontraditional computing devices, such as mobile and embedded systems or home-based "game" machines, as well as embracing collaborative Open Source efforts through such projects as a SOAP implementation and the Jikes Java bytecode compiler.
