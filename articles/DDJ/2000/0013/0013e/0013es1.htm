The method is based on coding information, using a large number that is the product of two primes. The security of this system is based on the difficulty of finding the factors.</p><h3>Encrypting/Decrypting  Using Large Numbers:  How Does It Work?</h3><p>We need two, maybe unusual, pieces of mathematics:</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p></p><ul>  <li><i>c</i> is a common diviser of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> if it divides <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> without a remainder.  <li>The modulo function <i>x mod n</i>, is the remainder of <i>x</i> divided by <i>n</i>.</ul><p>To understand the procedure, you first need what is called the "Euler function," <i><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11"></i>(<i>n</i>) associated with a number <i>n</i>. It is the number of integers smaller than <i>n</i> the greater common diviser of which is 1. So for example, for <i>n</i>=15, <i><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11"></i>(15)=8 as only (1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14) have the number 1 as common greatest diviser with 15.</p><p>The Euler function has two neat properties: </p><p>1.	If <i>n</i> is the product of two primes <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>, then <i><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11"></i>(<i>n</i>)=(<i>p</i>-1)(<i>q</i>-1). Thus, if we know <i>n</i>, (=<i>pq</i>) and <i><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11"></i>(<i>n</i>), we easily get the factors, and thus finding <i><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11"></i>(<i>n</i>) is computationally equivalent to factor <i>n</i>.</p><p>2.	If two numbers (say, <i>k</i> and <i>m</i>) have only one as their common greatest common diviser, then <i>k</i> exponentiated to the Euler function of <i>m</i> is equal to one modulo <i>m</i>; that is, <i>k<sup><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11">(m)</sup></i>=1 <i>mod m</i>. For example, 3 and 8 have 1 as greatest common diviser, thus 3<sup><i><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11"></i>(8)</sup>= 3<sup>4</sup>=81, and 81 <i>mod</i> 8=1.</p><p></p><p>With all these ingredients we can see how to send secure information: Alice wants to send her credit-card number to Bob. Bob selects a "large" number, <i>N</i>=15, which is the product of two primes. (Today, the Netscape browser uses RSA with a 128-digit number. The largest factored number had 129 digits by 600 people working on 1600 workstations over 8 months.) He calculates <i><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11"></i>(15)=(5-1) X (3-1)=8, by rule (<i>A</i>). He selects a number <i>e</i> such that the greater common diviser of <i>e</i> and <i><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11"></i>(15)=8 is 1: <i>e</i>=3 works. He sends <i>N</i> and <i>e</i> to Alice. Alice encodes her credit-card number <i>x</i>, say 2, by the transformation <i>x<sup>e</sup></i> <i>mod N</i>=2<sup>3</sup> <i>mod</i> 15=8, which she sends back to Bob. To decode this, Bob needs to find <i>d</i> such that <i>ed</i>=1 <i>mod</i> <i><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11"></i>(<i>N</i>), <i>d</i>=3 will work (that is, 3 X 3=1 <i>mod</i> 8.) To find <i>x</i>, Bob uses the rule (<i>B</i>) to calculate <i>x<sup>ed</sup></i>=<i>x</i><sup>1+<i>k</i><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11"><i>N</i></sup>=<i>x mod</i> <i>N</i>; for instance, 2<sup>3 X 3</sup> <i>mod</i> 15=2.</p><h3>How to Break This Encryption?</h3><p>To break the code, we need to know <i><IMG SRC="phi10.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="11"></i>(<i>N</i>) or equivalent to factor <i>N</i>. Factoring large numbers on a classical computer is a difficult problem. To factor a number of <i>N</i> with <i>log<sub>10</sub>N</i> digits takes roughly <i>Exp</i>[(<i>log<sub>10</sub>N</i>)<sup>1/3</sup>] number of steps -- a quantum computer would accomplish the same task in about (<i>log<sub>10</sub>N</i>)3 steps; see <A NAME="rf5"></a><A HREF="0013ef5.htm">Figure 5</A>.</p><p>To factor <i>N</i>, a classical computer essentially tries all numbers, one by one, up to roughly <i>N</i>. That makes it a very inefficient process. Quantum computers excel for problems that search for a common property of a large set of numbers such as the periodicity. It turns out that factoring is equivalent to finding the period <i>r</i> of the function <i>f</i>(<i>a</i>)=<i>y<sup>a</sup> mod N</i>, where <i>y</i> is, essentially, any number between 1 and <i>N</i>. The greatest common diviser of (<i>y</i><sup>r/2</sup>±1) <i>mod</i> <i>N</i> and <i>N</i> will be a factor of <i>N</i>. With the aforementioned example using <i>N</i>=15, we can choose <i>y</i>=7.</p><p>The periodicity of the function, as seen in the figure, is 4. (7<sup>4/2</sup>±1) <i>mod </i>15=5 or 3, which indeed are the right factors; see <A NAME="rf6"></a><A HREF="0013ef6.htm">Figure 6</A>. The quantum algorithm works in such a way that in a single computation, we evaluate the function <i>f</i>(<i>a</i>) for the superpostition of all numbers a from 1 to <i>N</i>. The periodicity is determined by a Fourier transform, a process that induces constructive interference for the correct value of the periodicity and destructive interference for the incorrect ones. To do the same task on a classical computer would require exponentially more steps.</p><p>D.C. and R.L.</p><a href="0013e.htm#rs1">Back to Article</a></body></html>
