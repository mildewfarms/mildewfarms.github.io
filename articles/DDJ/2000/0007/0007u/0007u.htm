<p>Inxight Software, a Xerox spinoff, has released five products designed to make infoglut on the web more manageable. The Thing Finder software component highlights selected facts in a document, such as names, dates, addresses, products, or URLs; when applied to a set of documents it can create a browsable index. The Summarizer is a document summary tool that emphasizes or deemphasizes concepts at user request. It is available as an SDK or as a web server add on; both support a number of file formats including HTML, Word, PowerPoint, WordPerfect, and PDF. The Categorizer automatically sorts documents into a subject-based hierarchy. It is adaptable to different writing styles, scalable to over 100,000 documents per day, and provides an Oracle-based data store for high availability environments. </p>


<p>In addition to these linguistic technologies, Inxight has also introduced two tools for visual analysis. The Hyperbolic Tree technique for visual site navigation is available in several packages: an SDK for Windows and Java, which supports standard component object models and provides a set of functions for customizing interactive behaviors; a server based on the SDK for Java; and the Site Lens Studio, which is a more basic tool for building site maps. Lastly, the Table Lens desktop application turns large data sets (such as spreadsheets) into a visual representation that allows sorting, sifting, and rearrangement.</p>

<p>The CoCentric Fixed-Point Designer is a software tool from Synopsys that reads in ANSI C source code that contains floating-point data types, and writes out a new version of source code substituting the floating-point types with public SystemC fixed-point data types. It also provides a set of functions to assist you in custom-fitting the results. Instead of worst case analysis, Fixed-Point Designer uses the "range propagation" method to compute word size propagation in code. It works with CoCentric System Studio and COSSAP, Matlab, and SPW 4.5.</p>

<p>QNX Software is making the QNX Realtime Platform freely available for non-commercial use, and is releasing source code for many QNX applications, drivers, and libraries. The QNX Realtime Platform is intended to combine the reliability of a true RTOS with the advantages of a true platform OS. It follows an accessible source model, where source code will be publicly available for most modules, but not for those core components deemed critical to system security and developers' intellectual property. QNX is also deploying a new web-based QNX Developer's Network to provide support services, including newsgroups, FAQs, technotes, upgrades, and free software.</p>

<p>The DSP Group has released a set of C/C++ software development tools for the PalmDSPCore digital signal processor. The PalmDSPCore C/C++ compiler implements various optimization strategies and parallel instruction selection alternatives to find the best code sequence matching C/C++ code. In places where human intervention is necessary, the compiler supports a set of C/C++ language extensions, enabling the inlining of special assembly instructions or forcing a certain code generation behavior. The modular PalmDSPCore Debugger and Simulator allows customization of the hardware interface to communicate with any kind of hardware emulation board, synchronization with other debuggers, and an open architecture with a flexible programming interface for integration into System-on-a-Chip simulation environments.</p>

<p>Systolix has announced PulseDSP, a DSP array architecture designed to build low-cost ICs capable of custom video-rate digital signal conditioning. Systolix's designs are based on an array of bit-serial multiply and adder cells which may be configured from an EPROM or external microprocessor to operate in highly parallel configurations. This field-programmable processor array lets hundreds of multiply-accumulate cells process data simultaneously and can accommodate datawidths up to 32 bits. The first commercial chip incorporating a PulseDSP core is an A/D converter from Analog Devices.</p>

<p>OC Systems has released the Aprobe software development and testing tool for Windows 2000/NT. Previously only available for UNIX, Aprobe creates probes that patch the executable of a software program. The probes are written in ANSI C, can be added anywhere in an application, and can change the way a program runs or gathers data without modifying the application's files. Aprobe works directly on the executable; no access to source code is required, so it can be used on third-party software. Pricing begins at $4995.00 for a single- user concurrent license.</p>
