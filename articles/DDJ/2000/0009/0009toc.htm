Along the way, he invented the mouse, hypertext systems, collaborative video teleconferencing, and more. Eugene talks with Engelbart about his career, inventions, and vision.</p><h3><a href="0009b/0009b.htm">THE GENERIC GRAPH COMPONENT LIBRARY</a></h3><h4>by Jeremy G. Siek, Lie-Quan Lee, and Andrew Lumsdaine</h4><p>As good as it is, the C++ Standard Template Library doesn't address every problem domain. Consequently, our authors implemented the Generic Graph Component Library (GGCL) for  use with sparse matrix ordering algorithms for scientific computing.</p><h3><a href="0009c/0009c.htm">ANALYTICAL COMPUTING</a></h3><h4>by Laurent Bernardin</h4><p>The convergence of numeric and symbolic computation systems are making it possible to enjoy  the speed of numeric computation and the flexibility and accuracy of symbolic computing. </p><h3><a href="0009d/0009d.htm">GRAPHING CALCULATORS MEET PCs</a></h3><h4>by David S. Birkett</h4><p>Maxwell, the program David presents here, lets you logically and accurately chart numerical  solutions to difficult problems. And it is written in a visual object-oriented programming  language called "HP Vee," developed by Hewlett-Packard. </p><h3><a href="0009e/0009e.htm">SIMULATING KONRAD ZUSE'S COMPUTERS</a></h3><h4>by Raul Rojas</h4><p>Raul presents a working simulation (written in Java) of Konrad Zuse's Z3 computer, originally  created in 1938. The real Z3 consisted purely of electromechanical relays, but was ready and  operational in 1941 -- four years before the ENIAC. </p><h3><a href="0009f/0009f.htm">FORENSIC COMPUTER ANALYSIS: AN INTRODUCTION</a></h3><h4>by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema</h4><p>Solving computer mysteries require skills detectives and programmers have in common --  logical thinking, understanding cause and effect, and possessing an open mind. </p><h3><a href="0009g/0009g.htm">WRITING WINDOWS CE DISPLAY DRIVERS</a></h3><h4>by Jeff Spurgat</h4><p>Jeff examines the fundamentals of Windows CE display-driver development, including Microsoft's  display-driver C++ classes, then explores improvements to simplify display-driver development. </p><p></p><h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><h3><a href="0009h/0009h.htm">MICROCONTROLLERS AND CORDIC METHODS</a></h3><h4>by Michael Pashea</h4><p>CORDIC algorithms are efficient in terms of both computation time and hardware  resources -- and in most microcontroller systems, these resources are normally a premium. </p><h2>INTERNET PROGRAMMING</h2><h3><a href="0009i/0009i.htm">INTEGRATING WEB PAGES WITH DATABASES</a></h3><h4>by David Cox</h4><p>E-commerce is mostly about using and interacting with databases.
