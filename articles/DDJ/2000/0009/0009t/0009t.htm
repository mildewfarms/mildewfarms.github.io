Eliminating the Java Virtual Machine, VMFoundry is designed to increase performance, reduce memory requirements, and lower system and development costs for embedded networked devices. Websprocket is also offering a free, open-source Java for embedded networked systems, called JEMINI, which works "out of the box" with VMFoundry.</p><p>Websprocket</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>395 W El Camino Real, 2nd Floor</p><p>Sunnyvale, CA 94087</p><p>408-530-0631</p><p>http://www.websprocket.com/</p><p>Zero G announced the release of InstallAnywhere 3.5, a multiplatform installer designed to deploy software for distribution on the Internet, CD-ROMs, or most other networks. The interface lets you build installers in six steps; every installer created by InstallAnywhere recognizes the platform on which it is operating and tailors its installation to the user's operating system. InstallAnywhere is compatible with Java 2 1.3 and adds full support for Linux.</p><p>Zero G Software</p><p>514 Bryant Street</p><p>San Francisco, CA 94107</p><p>415-512-7771</p><p>http://www.zerog.com/</p><p>Lineo is shipping Embedix SDK for x86, an SDK for Linux-based embedded devices and systems.

The add-on does not introduce a second kernel underneath Linux, nor does it attempt to substitute RTOS components for Linux itself; instead, it is integrated into the standard Linux kernel. The MontaVista scheduler executes before the standard Linux scheduler, only examining and dispatching the highest priority real-time entity that is ready to run. Unlike the Linux scheduler, overhead for process selection is fixed. You can still use standard Linux APIs and memory-protected programming models.</p><p>MontaVista Software Inc.</p><p>490 Potrero Avenue</p><p>Sunnyvale, CA 94086</p><p>408-328-9200</p><p>http://www.mvista.com/</p><p></p><p>Covalent Technologies has released Raven SSL 1.5 of its security add-on for Apache.
