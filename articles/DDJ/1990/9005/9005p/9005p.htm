A new release of Think Pascal, Version 3.0, now includes Symantec's Think Class Library and support for MacApp, the class library from Apple.  The Think Class Library has code for all the standard Macintosh user interface components and behaviors.  This library can be used with either Think Pascal or C.  And Think Pascal provides extensive support for object-oriented programming.<P>
DDJ spoke with Claris' Dennis Cohen and Stonecutter Software's Don Sawtelle, two programmers who have been using Think Pascal 3.0 throughout its beta testing stage.  Cohen said &quot;I do all my final builds in Think Pascal 3.0.  The environment is great.  For an individual programmer it's phenomenal.  For a team, MPW is probably better because of the projector and the tools for use with the projector.&quot;  Sawtelle added that &quot;It's [3.0] excellent.  There's nothing better in terms of delivering commercial applications, because of its speed and the excellent interface for source-level debugging.&quot;  Sawtelle didn't see the lack of a Projector as much of a problem: &quot;It's so compatible with MPW, you can run both simultaneously under Multifinder.&quot;<P>
Also new to Think Pascal 3.0 is the class browser, a graphical navigation aid that lets you view the interrelationship of your program's classes.  Think Pascal 3.0 has an integrated environment, instant incremental linking, and source-level debugging tools.  Productivity enhancements include better segmentation control, improved MPW compatibility, resource editing tools, and user interface enhancements.  The retail price is $249, and upgrades cost $69.

Version 6.0 of Microsoft C Professional Development System has been announced by Microsoft. Microsoft C 6.0 includes performance-oriented improvements in the compiler as well as additional software development tools, including an integrated development environment called the Programmer's Workbench.<P>
New optimization technology added to the compiler includes register-based parameter passing, a globally optimizing code generator, segment-based pointers to memory, and pragma-level (function-level) control over optimizations.  The compiler now allows in-line assembly language in the style of Quick-C.<P>
The Programmer's Workbench is new to Microsoft C, and is an integrated development environment similar to that of Quick-C, with pull-down menus, dialog boxes, and windowing capabilities.  With the Workbench are updated versions of CodeView, the make utility, the Microsoft Editor, and source browser.  The Workbench's open architecture allows third-party vendors to offer additional tools.<P>
The Source Browser is a program navigation tool that lets you view the calling structure (call tree) of an entire application, find the definition of a variable or function, or visit all references to a variable or function.<P>
The new version of CodeView can now reside in extended memory, leaving only a 15K footprint in conventional DOS memory.  CodeView now supports multiple files and multiple views into memory, browsing through structures and arrays, dynamic record-and-replay of debugging sessions, debugging of multi-threaded programs and DLLs, and remembering of configuration data from one session to another.<P>
Improvements in OS/2 support now allow multi-threaded DLLs (by contrast, C 5.1 allows only multi-threaded apps or single-threaded DLLs).  The compiler will run under either DOS or OS/2, and, under OS/2, will allow components of the compiler to operate in the background.  Both the compiler and linker now have an incremental processing mode for faster operation.<P>
The recommended configuration is 640K RAM, 10 Mbytes of hard disk space, and 384K Extended Memory or LIM 4.0.  The suggested retail price is $495.  Microsoft is also releasing a new version of QuickC with QuickAssembler.  Reader service no. 32.<P>

Insite Peripherals recently announced availability of its I325 Floptical Disk Drive to OEMs. The Floptical Drive makes use of optical technology to store up to 20 Mbytes on a standard high-density 3.5-inch diskette that embeds optical servo tracks into the surface of the media.  The drive includes an optical system that detects these &quot;grooves&quot; and converts the images to electronic signals, which are used for servo tracking information.  Magnetic data is written to &quot;land&quot; areas between neighboring grooves.<P>
The company also notes that its I325VM version, which additionally reads and writes to standard 720K and 1.44-Mbyte diskettes, will be available in volume to OEMs later this year. The company claims that the Floptical's SCSI interface makes it two to three times faster than typical floppy drives and approximately 50 percent as fast as a Winchester drive.  I325 evaluation kits, which include the Floptical Drive and a PC to AT host adapter, are available to OEMs for $600.  Reader service no. 21.<P>

A series of modular tools for memory management is available with the utility program Above DISC, Version 3.1, from Above Software.  Above DISC is an expanded memory simulation (EMS) program for DOS users.  Some of the added features are a hard disk spill-over with disk caching for hard disk emulation, and the ability to increase conventional memory to 736K on systems with EGA/VGA adaptors.<P>
The hard disk spill-over feature is for 286 and 386 users.  It increases memory without additional RAM chips, converting extended memory to expanded memory for applications that require large amounts of expanded memory.  The conventional memory enhancement on EGA and VGA color systems is for all PC/XT/AT, 286, and 386 users, and comes from accessing an additional 96K from the video memory on the system's motherboard.  And you can turn this feature on and off, as when you need full access to your EGA/VGA graphics capability.  Above DISC comes bundled with AboveLAN, for moving Novell NET3.COM or NET4.COM drivers into the first 64K of extended memory in order to run larger applications such as Excel off of the network.  Also bundled is AboveMEM, which converts up to 512K of extended memory into EMS for increased speed with Lotus 1-2-3.  Above DISC 3.1 sells for $119.  Reader service no. 22.<P>

A productivity tool for C programmers is available from Silico-Magnetic Intelligence. Better-C is a generic C program methodology and generator that works with most popular C compilers.  According to Kalman Toth, chief scientist on the project, the product is based on complexity management, natural language naming, top-down design, and programming with objects.  One of the benefits of Better-C is its pliability for projects involving teams of programmers.<P>
Ed Hoffman of IDG Consulting told DDJ that his shop used Better-C to convert one of their programs to C.  &quot;One of our products is an AI system that had been written in a whole system of languages by many different programmers.  There were over 200,000 lines of good code, but it got really hard to find things, and we had duplicate functions.  Better-C helped us to get organized -- to recode the project.  We answered a few questions in the beginning, and it assigned standard names for us.  It doesn't generate modules you can execute, but it helps you write better C code -- it can make you look like a very well organized C programmer.&quot;<P>
An initial module frame generator automatically generates a framework for a new module -- it sets up the necessary files and spans a framework for the new module.  Objects are treated as files -- they can be lists, trees, databases, windows, or whatever.  The open function gets object handles and the close function destroys objects.  And Better-C provides exact methods for organizing programs, by using encapsulated modules as building blocks.  Better-C costs $98, and the Frame Generator Source code also costs $98.

If embedded-systems engineering is your field, you might want to look into Avocet's AvCase, an integrated set of tools for the code-compile-test cycle of your software projects.  According to the company, they integrated the editor, C compiler, assembler, linker, and simulator/source-level debugger.  And everything supposedly runs on your PC.<P>
One keystroke can compile, assemble, and link an application.  When it finds an error, the offending module and associated error message are displayed in a window for editing.  The complete package includes an AvCase 8051 family C compiler with run-time library and source, user manuals, and on-line reference database; an AvCase 8051 family Assembler with linker, object librarian, hex file utility, cross-reference utility, integrated editor, make utility, user manuals, and on-line reference database and engine; and an AvCase 8051 family Simulator with source-level debugging and user manual.  This whole package costs $1895.  Sold separately, the C compiler and assembler package is $995, the assembler alone is $495, and the simulator package alone is $995.  Requires an IBM PC or compatible, MS-DOS 2.0 or later, 640K RAM, and a hard disk.  Reader service no. 25.<P>

More memory movement is possible with Move 'Em, a program loader from Qualitas.  Move 'Em moves device drivers, network system drivers, and memory-resident programs to the formerly inaccessible memory between 640K and 1 Mbyte.  Move 'Em works on all PC platforms from the XT to the 486.<P>
A resident program optimization facility automatically determines the best loading order and required parameters for memory-resident programs and device drivers.  On systems equipped with a Chips and Technologies ChipSet, the built-in shadow RAM (about 384K of memory) can be recovered by Move 'Em.<P>
Move 'Em runs on any IBM PC or compatible with an EMS 4.0 memory board with at least 256K of EMS memory, and PC- or MS-DOS 3.0 or later.  It retails for $89.<P>
Also from Qualitas: 386MAX and 386MAX Professional, designed for PCs that use the 80386 or 80486.  These management programs locate unused pockets of addresses between 640K and 1 Mbyte and move TSRs, device drivers, and other memory-resident programs into that space.  They also convert previously unavailable extended memory above 1024K into EMS memory, which makes it compatible with the EMS 4.0 specification that many large applications require.  386MAX sells for $74.95, 386MAX Professional for $129.95.
