Third-party CAD/CAM developers may be interested in the CAD/CAM Developer's Kit (CCDK) from Building Block Software.  CCDK is a toolbox of C functions that provides full 3-D DXF, 2-D and 3-D display and geometry operations, and list-management capabilities.<P>
DDJ spoke with Kevin Green of Karta Technology, who said that &quot;We needed to create a drawing with AutoCAD and bring the drawing into our program, which links to databases or a variety of other things.  The big advantage [of CCDK] was the DXF support.  It would have taken us a lot of time to develop this on our own.&quot;  Kevin also mentioned that the documentation and tech support are exceptional.<P>
CCDK can be used for developing DXF file viewer add-ons to database programs, numerical code generators, finite element mesh generators, 3-D piping layout tools, and printed circuit board layout checking programs.  CCDK augments Autodesk's C-binding environment with a full set of functions for CAD/CAM operations, saving developers the task of writing all the computational functions themselves.  Object hierarchies and data encapsulation make programming faster and minimize the number of public routines required to support all of CCDK's operations.  Full DXF Release 10 functionality is supported, so programs can read and write both ASCII and binary DXF formats.  Block inserts can be exploded into geometry and solid models can be generated for shading with AutoSolid.  The routines are adaptable to popular graphics libraries.  CCDK is compatible with Microsoft C 5.1 and 6.0 and Borland Turbo C 2.0, and supports Metaware and Watcom compilers as well.  Single programmer licenses start at $1,295.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

The ToolBook Author's Resource Kit (ARK) is now available from Asymetrix.  The ARK includes a license to distribute a royalty-free runtime version of ToolBook and three DLLs, as well as development tools.  ToolBook 1.0 is a software construction set for building graphical applications without using traditional programming languages.  You can use ToolBook to build Windows 3.0 applications.<P>
ARK includes two development utilities, and two online applications offer ideas on user interface design for ToolBook applications.  The Windows DLLs include a DLL that provides access to and file manipulation of dBase III data files; another for determining the characteristics of a display device, for determining which fonts are available for display and printing, and for setting and retrieving values in a Windows initialization file directly from a ToolBook script; and one for copying and deleting DOS files and for performing other DOS functions within a ToolBook script.<P>
Merillin Paris; head engineer on the project, told DDJ that &quot;a misconception some people have is that ToolBook is interpreted.  It is not interpreted, it is p-code.  You can strip the code down to binary and remove the script to protect your source code.&quot;  The utility included for that is Script Remover.  Another utility included is BookLook, for examining and changing an object's properties.  The ARK is priced at $450, and for another $495 you can subscribe to the Asymetrix Developer Support Partnership program and be assigned to a support engineer for one year of technical support.

If you need high-performance, interrupt-driven control of asynchronous communications in your C programs, you might want to check out the new SilverComm C Async Library from SilverWare.  The library is customizable, as full source code is included.<P>
A device event monitor capability permits execution of your C functions at interrupt time. These functions can set flags that signal an event in your application.  And you can create functions that process the interrupt.<P>
Jim McCusker of Electronics Unlimited has been a beta tester for all evolutions of the Async package.  He told DDJ, &quot;We have used the library on various projects here.  We do a lot of custom software and hardware for the process-control industry.  This package takes the burden off the user -- you don't need to know about serial ports on a PC.  You can write a comm program in about 10 minutes for a dumb terminal.  You can grow with this package -- it has extra functions, such as timers for setting a delay and basic video I/O.  And it supports multiple communication ports simultaneously, asynchronously.  One of the best things is the manual; each function is described in detail and has an example of its use.&quot;<P>
The SilverComm C Async Library features huge model queues; terminal emulation; XModem, YModem, YModem batch, and ASCII; background timers; enhanced compatibility; flow control; smart modem support; high-level remote input; character filtering; and supports up to 115K baud.  The library sells for $259.  Reader service no. 25.<P>

Macintosh programmers now have an alternative to TextEdit with the release of DataPak Software's Word Solution Engine, a new module for basic text editing with multiple font and style support.  The company claims that Word Solution Engine has superior buffering capabilities (16 Mbytes) to TextEdit (which has a 32K limit), is faster, and formats better.<P>
Ben Cahan of MacToolkit concurs.  He told DDJ that Word Solution Engine &quot;is very complete and works flawlessly.  I'm working in an application that is text-editing intensive, and this product handles pretty much everything.  It could save one or two years of work writing your own text editor.  This is the only solution I've seen so far for quality text editing.&quot;<P>
Word Solution Engine features fast editing and display of large text files, Script Manager support, Quickdraw color support, and &quot;User Styles.&quot;  Also multiple stylations, tab handling, I/O and printing support, &quot;scrap&quot; support, and full-justification.
