<h2>FEATURES</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9004a/9004a.htm">BIDIRECTIONAL ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY SYSTEMS IN C++</a></h3><p><br> by Adam Blum
Bidirectional associative memory is a neural net model that may solve the content-addressability problem.  Adam implements BAM systems using C++,  discovering that object-oriented languages go hand-in-glove with neural net  development.
<h3></p><a href="9004b/9004b.htm">A NEURAL NETWORK INSTANTIATION ENVIRONMENT</a></h3><p><br> by Andrew J. Czuchy Jr.
Developing useful and efficient network architectures requires a simple,  yet flexible environment.  Andy presents an environment that dynamically  creates neural networks.
<h3></p><a href="9004c/9004c.htm">UNTANGLING NEURAL NETS</a></h3><p><br> by Jeanette &quot;Jet&quot; Lawrence
With more than 40 functioning neural net models to choose from, it is  important to understand their similarities and differences.
<h3></p><a href="9004d/9004d.htm">IMPLEMENTING THE RHEALSTONE REAL-TIME BENCHMARK</a></h3><p><br> by Rabindra P. Kar
It's been over a year since DDJ first introduced the Rhealstone, a set of  benchmarking operations for real-time multitasking systems.  Robin presents  the &quot;refined&quot; definition, along with a suite of C programs to implement the  benchmark.
<h3></p><a href="9004e/9004e.htm">BOUNDING BOX DATA COMPRESSION </a></h3><p><br> by Glenn Searfoss
The &quot;bounding box&quot; method of data compression is fast and efficient for bit  mapped data. Glenn describes this technique and compares it to the better-known RLE.
<h3></p><a href="9004f/9004f.htm">VESA VGA BIOS EXTENSIONS</a></h3><p><br> by Bo Ericcson
The VESA VGA BIOS extensions make it possible to write generic graphics  software that tap into the powerful capabilities of Super VGA.
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9004g/9004g.htm">CRUISING WITH TOPSPEED</a></h3><p><br> by Alex Lane
TopSpeed C launches JPI into the C arena.  Alex puts the package under the  Doctor's microscope, paying special attention to the C Techkit, and has  some fun in the process.
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9004h/9004h.htm">NEURAL NETWORKS AND IMAGE PROCESSING</a></h3><p><br> by Casimir C. &quot;Casey&quot; Klimasaukas
Casey explores different approaches to edge enhancement systems, first  using C, then using an off-the-shelf, two-dimensional array engine called  Lotus 1-2-3.
<h2>COLUMNS</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9004i/9004i.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</a></h3><p><br> by Michael Swaine
SD '90 brought a little of everything, from serious talk about new  paradigms to hype about new products.  Here's Mike's report on the year's  most important programming conference.
<h3></p><a href="9004j/9004j.htm">C PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p><br> by Al Stevens
Al starts to sort things out with CSORT, a sorting facility that you can  use from within your programs or from the command line.
<h3></p><a href="9004k/9004k.htm">STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p><br> by Jeff Duntemann
The time has come for a time-and-date stamp object.  Jeff develops one  using Turbo Pascal, after mulling over Xerox's suit against Apple.
