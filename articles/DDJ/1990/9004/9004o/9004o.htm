Actor 2.0, an object-oriented development environment for Microsoft Windows applications, has been announced by The Whitewater Group.  Version 2.0 boasts an automatic object swapping system that swaps static objects and code out to disk, which allows developers to break the 640K barrier of MS-DOS and create applications that are larger than 1 Mbyte in size.  It does this by means of an LRU (least-recently used) algorithm, which ages unused objects and sends the old ones out to disk.<P>
Actor 2.0 also has additional object-oriented features, new commands, and improved support for C.  Whitewater spokesman Zack Urlocker told DDJthat &quot;programmers wanted increased compatibility with C so we've added the ability to pass C structures and combine primitives in C and assembly language.  This means you can get directly into the low-level structure of objects.&quot;  2.0 runs on any PC or PS/2 (or compatibles) under Microsoft Windows, and requires 640K of memory, a hard disk, a graphics card of any resolution, a mouse, and Microsoft Windows 2.x or later.  The cost is $695, but registered users of previous versions can upgrade for $149.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

Version 2.00 of Top Speed Modula-2 has been announced by JPI.  This version works with the multilanguage development recently released with TopSpeed C, which automatically selects the appropriate compiler for the source file it needs to compile, and includes nine editing windows, 500K per file, and a hypertext help system.  New compiler options allow interfacing of C libraries and functions with Modula-2 programs, and vice versa.  The optimizing code generator is featured in the new family of TopSpeed languages (including a TopSpeed Pascal, which has also been announced), common to all the languages.<P>
TopSpeed Modula-2, Version 2.00, has multiple memory model support, and new keywords and syntax extensions allow object-oriented programming.  A new keyword CLASS allows a RECORD-like structure to include PROCEDURE declarations, hide data, specify inheritance and VIRTUAL procedures.  And syntax extensions allow the name of a variable of a CLASS type to qualify the name of a procedure.<P>
Included now in all TopSpeed compilers is the Visual Interactive Debugger (VID), which is a multilanguage source-level debugger that features on-screen display of all breakpoint traps, single-step operation, and full source code inspection.  TopSpeed Modula-2 is available for DOS ($395 for extended edition) and OS/2 ($495 for extended edition).  Reader service no. 33.<P>

A software development tool that gives the 80386 processor the same level of protection available in protected operating systems has been announced by Nu-Mega.  Bounds-Checker automatically detects out-of-bounds accesses by an application program, using the symbolic information created by the Microsoft C 5.X and 6.0 compilers to show you the exact source line causing the out-of-bounds access.  Nu-Mega claims that Bounds-Checker cuts steps in the development process and eliminates the need to debug, and that it prevents serious side effects of subtle overwrites that may not be particularly dangerous until the program is in the field.<P>
The Bounds-Checker provides real-time memory protection, differentiates between code and data, protects program code and all memory outside your program, and prevents the system software from corrupting your program -- it can determine if a TSR or other program is trouncing your program.  Sells for $249.  Reader service no. 35.<P>

Borland International has announced Version 2.0 of its Turbo Debugger, which includes a toolkit that features the new Turbo Profiler.  The profiler measures where in your program time is spent, how many times a line is executed, how many times a routine is called and by what, and which files are accessed most often and for how long.  It also tracks the use of resources such as processor time, disk access, keyboard input, printer output, and interrupt activity.<P>
The Turbo Profiler graphically displays where your program is spending its time, telling you which parts of the program are used most often and may need optimization or rewriting, and which parts are used so little that you needn't bother tightening them.  An optimizing compiler generates code for the program you give it.<P>
Multiple overlapping windows, icons, mouse support, and context-sensitive on-line help are included in the user interface.  The Profiler works with Turbo Pascal 5.0, Turbo C 2.0, and Turbo Assembler 1.0, and any later versions of these compilers.  Also supports CodeView and .MAP file debug formats.  For IBM PCs and compatibles operating PC-DOS (MS-DOS) 2.0 or later. Requires 384K (256K for Turbo Assembler).  The toolkit retails for $149.95.  Reader service no. 34.<P>

Version 4.0 of the LALR compiler construction toolkit can now be purchased from LALR Research.  The toolkit includes the parser generator, LALR, and a scanner generator, DFA, as well as various source code modules, such as a main program, a screener, parser skeleton, and scanner skeleton.  DDJ spoke with the developer, Paul Mann, who said that the LALR compiler is &quot;an advanced compiler construction tool that goes beyond YACC.  It features extended BNF notation, automatic creation of abstract syntax trees, and a high-speed scanner generator.  It's well suited for developing compilers, translators, and interpreters for computer languages.&quot;<P>
A BNF grammar describes the statements of the language as input to the LALR, and describes the symbols as input to the DFA.  The LALR parser generator provides automatic error recovery, and handles large grammars such as Fortran and Cobol.  The company claims that the DFA scanner generator produces high-speed deterministic finite automatons that run about four times faster than LEX scanners.  The source code output is compatible with Turbo C, Microsoft C, Watcom C, among others.  The price is $495.  Reader service no. 26.<P>

BrainMaker v2.0, a system for designing, building, training, testing, and running neural networks, is now available from California Scientific Software.  The company claims that version 2.0 is a major enhancement, and has such features as the NetMaker, which is a network generation and data manipulation program with spread-sheet style data display and the ability to perform arithmetic operations on data.  In addition, BrainMaker now reads data from Lotus, dBase, Quattro, and Excel files; automatic numeric translation allows the display of large numbers; graphics post-processing of network results is supported; and it includes training and running algorithms that are as fast as 500,000 neural connections per second.  Mark Lawrence, CSS president, told DDJthat &quot;with Release 1, we knew we had a neat technology, and that our users would have to tell us what it was for.  They told us it was mostly for financial forecasting, so now we've gone back and written it like it should have been.&quot;<P>
This upgrade includes the Introduction to Neural Networks, an overview of the history and research of neural networks, and a user's guide and reference manual.  The cost is $195, $95 for registered users.  Requires a PC, PS/2, or compatible.  Reader service no. 21.<P>

A QuickBasic file indexing program, Index Manager, has been released by CDP Consultants.  This product supposedly gives programmers the ability to create B+ tree files indexed within their QuickBasic programs.  It allows random file access by full key, browsing through files by partial key, or sorting forward or backward.  One external subroutine performs all of Index Manager's functions, and the programmer still retains full control over all data files, as only indexes are managed.<P>
Indexes are created with a prefix B+ tree.  The program is written in assembler language, and utilizes a large cache buffer for keeping important index records in memory.  A demo version can be downloaded on CompuServe (GO MSSYS) on data library 1 or 2, called INDEXM.ARC, and GEnie (M 505) on data library 10, file 828.  The program costs $59.
