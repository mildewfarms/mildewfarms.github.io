<a name="0162_0002"><a name="0162_0000">There's always been something special about DDJ's coverage of graphics programming, this month's theme.  As far back as July 1976 (our first year of publication), DDJ began publishing articles such as &quot;A Home Brew TV Display with Graphics for the Altair 8800.&quot;  From that point on, graphics programming became a regular topic in DDJ, leading up to Kent Porter's enormously popular &quot;Graphics Programming&quot; column in 1989.  Sadly, Kent passed away before he had a chance to complete the job he set out to do.<P>
In Kent's memory, we've established a scholarship program for full-time computer science majors enrolled in accredited colleges and universities.  The purpose of the scholarship is to recognize academic achievement and potential, and to financially assist continuing students in the pursuit of their educational goals.  At the request of Kent's family, consideration will be given (but not limited) to students who are raising children while attending school, a situation similar to that of Kent and Jeanne in their university days.  Scholarships will be awarded in increments of $500 for the 1990 - 91 academic year.<P>
M&amp;T Publishing will provide $1,000 a year to fund the scholarship, and, for this year, Markt and Technik (M&amp;T's parent company) will provide another $1,000.  Additionally, we're accepting contributions to the scholarship fund from individuals and corporations.  Your contributions will be appreciated and acknowledged if you take part in this program.<P>
To apply for a scholarship, request in writing an application from:<P>

Software being what it is, we made a couple of last minute changes to June's hypertext project.  Because of the size of the self-extracting file (380K on the bare-bones version), we're providing the system as a PKZIP file; the resulting compressed file is about 275K.  Once you extract either file, running the system is the same -- just type DDJ.<P>
The hypertext document included with the June source code listings disk, available through M&amp;T Books, is also compressed with PKZIP so that the issue will fit on a single 360K disk. PKUNZIP, which you'll need to extract the file, is included on the disk.<P>
Remember that the enhanced version -- the one that includes everything -- is available online and from Scott Johnson at NTERGAID (and it's a really big file).<P>
Once you've had a chance to use the hypertext edition, let us know what you think about it. What would you have liked to see different about it?  How have you been using it?  And, most importantly, what sort of applications will you be developing with the hypertext engine source code (and other programs) included in the issue?<P>
Thanks for the great response to our May editorial survey card.  We've received thousands of cards so far and more arrive every day.  If you haven't returned your card, it isn't too late, so keep those cards and letters coming -- and we really are reading every one of them.<P>
Finally, the folks at Springtree Partners have compiled a DDJ subject and author index that spans the years 1982-1989.  It's available on disk and in paperback.  Call 804-286-3466, Ext. 3, or write Springtree Partners, Rt.2 Box 89, Scottsville, VA 24590-9512.  They've done a great job of documenting the last seven years of DDJ.<P>
