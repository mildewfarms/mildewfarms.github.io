DDJ will continue the active pursuit of &quot;realizable fantasies&quot; that are within the bounds of current technology and knowledge.  This includes computer music, real-time video graphics, and unusual input techniques.  We will also explore shared memory, computer networking via telephone, and who knows what else.  You are part of this. The &quot;Journal&quot; is primarily a communication medium and an intellectual rabble-rouser.  Send us your ideas, your creations, your problems, and your solutions.  The more we all share, the more we all gain.--DDj Editorial, March 1976.<P>
