Overlay Architect and Overlay Optimizer, two tools that manage overlay structures, have been released by AtLast!  Software.  According to AtLast!, Overlay Architect can handle more than 4000 modules and 16,000 code symbols, supports libraries and object modules, works with most compilers, produces nested overlays and multiple overlay areas, supports indirect calls, detects unused functions and modules, supports multiple entry points, as well as full use of the Plink86plus TRACK command.  The company claims that this will result in the smallest possible executable program size by using nested overlays and multiple overlay areas; on a 386, a program consisting of a megabyte of code in a thousand modules can be analyzed by Overlay Architect in less than three minutes.<P>
Overlay Optimizer analyzes the performance of a program's overlay structure and determines how overlays should be rebuilt for optimal performance.  It requires a Plink86plus map file and the debug output of the sample debug run of a program; you specify the size to which your program can grow, and Overlay Optimizer creates a link response file that reflects the new overlay structure.  It is a two-step process: You first have to run your program with the debugging version of the Plink86plus overlay loader, and then run Overlay Optimizer.  The Architect and Optimizer can be purchased together for $569, or separately for $369 and $269, respectively.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

A monitor called the &quot;DB-51 Enhanced System Monitor,&quot; for 8051/31-and 80515/535-based single board computers, has been released by Allen Systems.  This monitor allows for development and debugging of user software right on the target 8051 hardware.  It supports a command set to facilitate user operation.  The monitor is EPROM-resident, and can be directly installed into the user hardware.  After object code output is downloaded from the host into RAM on the target system under DB-51 control, the host is configured as a terminal that allows the user direct access to the DB-51 and its available commands for debugging and testing.<P>
In addition to the command set, DB-51 also features the routing of interrupt service routines through external RAM, and line-oriented command entry which allows simple command-line editing prior to command processing.  In addition, DB-51 display information can be suspended, resumed, and aborted.  And upon initialization, the DB-51 checks the target hardware and then configures itself for optimum resource utilization.<P>
In addition to the software and user's manual, a listing of the DB-51 source is also available on hardcopy and on disk.  It sells for $100.  Reader service no. 21.<P>

Microsystems Software has announced CodeRunneR, a highly-optimized library for creating fast, compact TSR programs with full DOS access, using Borland's Turbo C and Microsoft C.  Users can supposedly create C programs on a performance and code size par with assembly language at a fraction of the development time and cost.  Developers can, says president J. Scott Benson, &quot;stay with high-level languages like C, and yet produce very tight code that can still fit their user's systems.&quot;<P>
Among CodeRunneR's features are the elimination of initialization code and data when programs go resident, a function-level granular and auto-initializing run-time library, the ability to create multitasking programs, a BCD floating-point package, full hotkey support transparent DOS access, and two levels of event schedulers.  CodeRunneR lists for $149, and Microsystems offers a 30-day money-back guarantee if you can find a commercially-available C library that delivers smaller or faster run-time code.

MetaWare has released High C compiler Version 1.6 for MS-DOS and 386/486DOS.  The package includes MetaWare's High C compiler for OS/2 and real-mode MS-DOS.  Version 1.6 features expanded libraries, new documentation, two editors, a disk cache utility, a b-tree library, and a graphics library for the 386/486 in protected mode.  MetaWare's new make facility is included, as well as a set of Unix-style utilities for the MS-DOS operating system.  This upgrade comes with the GFX/386 Graphics library, produced in conjunction with C Source, which provides specific floating-point graphics functions.  High C also includes the EC editor from C Source, HyperDisk disk cache from HyperWare, and source code for the MicroEMACS editor.<P>
The High C library is ANSI conformant, and additional library functions bring it to 86 percent compatibility with Microsoft's C libraries.  The High C compiler also provides cross-language calling, diagnostics, and configurability.  Toggles and pragmas allow developers to select from a variety of compiler features.  The High C compiler is discussed in the two-part article &quot;Stalking General Protection Faults&quot; by Andrew Schulman, which begins this month in DDJ.<P>
Current licensees covered by the technical support program can upgrade for free.  Users of Version 1.5 who do not have this policy can upgrade for $75 on the 8088, 80186, and 80286; the upgrade for the 80386 is $150.

Sun Microsystems has introduced GUIDE (Graphical User Interface Design Editor), a design tool for building an Open Look graphical user interface for applications.  The GUIDE prototyper is an interactive tool that features a palette of icons that represent various objects, such as window control functions, scrollbars, and menus, so a developer can drop an icon into the desired location instead of writing new code.  GUIDE automatically generates the user interface code, which can shorten development time.  And applications designed with it can offer 'drag and drop&quot; file loading, so users can select an icon and the application will automatically load.<P>
The GUIDE prototyper runs on Release 4.X of the SunOS operating system on the X11/NeWS window system.  GUIDE media, documentation, and a right-to-use license will be sold unbundled for $250, and will be available sometime during the first quarter of 1990.  Reader service no. 26.<P>

The Software Organization announced a new programming tool, DialogCoder, that is supposed to eliminate 95 percent of the coding normally associated with dialog box programming.  The company claims that DialogCoder automatically generates compilable C source code from dialog templates to manage all controls in the dialog; that it uses graphical metaphors to express the relationships between dialog controls and actions; that it allows users to interactively specify the state of each dialog control during initialization and command processing; that it supports listbox initialization from ASCII files, resources bound to an application, and directory lists; that it supports multiline edit initialization from ASCII file; and that it provides validation code for text and number edit controls.<P>
The DialogCoder also supports all controls provided by the Microsoft and Whitewater dialog editors, as well as the entrance and exit processing for edit fields.  DialogCoder is designed for both novice and experienced Windows programmers -- the learning curve is about one hour for an experienced Windows programmer -- and even non-programmers can use it, provided they're given detailed dialog design specifications to follow.  DialogCoder requires a 286- or 386-based machine with minimum memory for Windows 2.X, and a Microsoft-compatible mouse is optional.  The cost is $349.  Reader service no. 29.<P>

Software Translations Inc. (STI) has announced the release of v7.5 of its B-Tran Basic to C translator, which translates Microsoft QuickBasic v4.5 and the recently announced Basic 7.0 to C source code.  Software Translations guarantees 99 percent translation of code, including user-defined variables, multidimensional dynamic arrays, and named COMMON blocks.  B-Tran is available for all machines running DOS, Unix, Xenix, AIX, Ultrix, and VMS.  It translates more than 1000 lines per minute of QuickBasic code into C that complies with SVID, X/Open, ANSI, and K&amp;R standards.  One command translates, compiles, and links.  The C code it produces is supposedly readable for Basic developers, though it does offer the appearance of a professional C program.  And B-Tran translated code has none of the memory or code size restrictions of QuickBASIC.  Pricing starts at $449 for the Microsoft C compiler under DOS. Other translators available include DEC VAX Basic, DEC Basic + and Basic +2, TI Basic, and CBasic.  Technical support and maintenance is also provided.  Reader service no. 30.<P>
