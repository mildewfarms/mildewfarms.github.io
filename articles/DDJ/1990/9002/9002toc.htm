<h2>FEATURES</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9002a/9002a.htm">MANAGING MULTIPLE DATA SEGMENTS UNDER MICROSOFT WINDOWS: PART I</a></h3><p><br> by Tim Peterson and Steve Flenniken
In the first installment of this two-part article, Tim and Steve present a  segment table technique that helps you cope with MS Windows' &quot;memory  movement&quot; phenomenon.
<h3></p><a href="9002b/9002b.htm">THREE-DIMENSIONAL GRAPHICS USING THE X WINDOW SYSTEM</a></h3><p><br> by Michael Stroyan
3-D graphics are possible with X Window systems even though most toolkits  don't provide much support for creating them.  Michael shares his  experiences with porting 3-D graphics to X, and provides you with solutions to some thorny problems.
<h3></p><a href="9002c/9002c.htm">PICK-A-NUMBER INTERFACES</a></h3><p><br> by Bob Canup
Sometimes trailing-edge technology provides the right tool for the right  job.  Bob states his case for when you might &quot;pick-a-number&quot; interfaces  rather than cutting-edge windowing interfaces.
<h3></p><a href="9002d/9002d.htm">SELF-ADJUSTING DATA STRUCTURES </a></h3><p><br> by Andrew M. Liao
Self-adjusting heuristic algorithms are ideal for lists, binary search  trees, and heaps. Andrew explains what they are, and how you can use them.
<h3></p><a href="9002e/9002e.htm">MULTIPLEXING ERROR CODES</a></h3><p><br> by William J. McMahon
It's possible to detect unexpected errors</a></h3><p><br> by using function communication  techniques such as the one Bill presents here.
<h3></p><a href="9002f/9002f.htm">PROGRAMMING RISC ENGINES</a></h3><p><br> by Neal Margulis
Neal uses Intel's i860 to illustrate how programmers can take advantage of  pipelined execution, while Hal Hardenbergh adds his thoughts on RISC vs.  CISC.
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9002g/9002g.htm">C_TALK/VIEWS</a></h3><p><br> by Noel Bergman

<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9002h/9002h.htm">STALKING GENERAL PROTECTION FAULTS: PART II</a></h3><p><br> by Andrew Schulman
Andrew continues his hunt for GP faults, this month using 32-bit C compilers  and Phar Lap's 386 DOS Extender.  He then returns to 16-bit land to see how  GP faults can be caught under OS/2.
<h2>COLUMNS</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9002i/9002i.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</a></h3><p><br> by Michael Swaine
This month Mike resumes his examination of Lisp, taking a look at Lisp's  representation scheme and the wide range of data structures supported</a></h3><p><br> by  the Common Lisp standard.
<h3></p><a href="9002j/9002j.htm">C PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p><br> by Al Stevens
Al continues TEXTSRCH, his text retrieval systems that provides a  concordance-like index into a text data base that uses two general-purpose  functions--parsing the command line and binary trees--you might find useful in other projects.
<h3></p><a href="9002k/9002k.htm">STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p><br> by Jeff Duntemann
Jeff takes time to reflect on The Quake of '89 before moving on to Arizona  and Modula-2.
