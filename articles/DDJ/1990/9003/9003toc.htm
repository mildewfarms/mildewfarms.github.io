<h2>FEATURES</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9003a/9003a.htm">ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE LIVES!</a></h3><p><br> by Michael Abrash
Assembly language isn't the be-all and end-all of PC programming, but as  Michael states, it's sometimes the only game in town when performance or  program size are important.
<h3></p><a href="9003b/9003b.htm">ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE TRICKS OF THE TRADE</a></h3><p><br> by Tim Paterson
Every programmer collects a personal bag of programming tricks.  Tim's has  been 13 years in the making, and he shares some of his favorites with you.
<h3></p><a href="9003c/9003c.htm">68040 PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p><br> by Stephen Satchell
The newest member of the 680x0 family provides some challenges for  programmers at all levels, particularly when it comes to caching.
<h3></p><a href="9003d/9003d.htm">HOMEGROWN DEBUGGING--386 STYLE </a></h3><p><br> by Al Williams
Use the 80386's hardware to debug your programs</a></h3><p><br> by including Al's assembly  language code to establish breakpoints.
<h3></p><a href="9003e/9003e.htm">MANAGING MULTIPLE DATA SEGMENTS UNDER MICROSOFT WINDOWS: PART II</a></h3><p><br> by Tim Paterson and Steve Flenniken
Last month, Tim and Steve presented a method for managing multiple data  segments under MS WIndows using the segment table.  This month, they  provide a sample Windows program that puts the segment library to work.
<h3></p><a href="9003f/9003f.htm">OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING WITH ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE</a></h3><p><br> by Randall Hyde
Randy makes a case that the object-oriented paradigm isn't completely the  domain of high-level programming languages.  He believes that OOP  techniques can be applied, and are worth considering for ASM projects too.
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9003g/9003g.htm">INSIDE WATCOM C 7.0/386</a></h3><p><br> by Andrew Schulman
Andrew suspects that Watcom's C 7.0/386 has launched the opening salvos in  a 32-bit 386 development tool war.  He also looks at how Novell has  implemented the compiler for its C Network Compiler/386.
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9003h/9003h.htm">MIXED-LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING WITH ASM</a></h3><p><br> by Karl Wright and Rick Schell
As Karl and Rick point out, it's not only practical but often advisable to  mix languages and memory models in order to achieve the best results.   Assembly language is a vital part of this mix.
<h2>COLUMNS</h2>
<h3></p><a href="9003i/9003i.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</a></h3><p><br> by Michael Swaine
Lisp has been codified, gentrified, and now objectified.  Michael looks at  how the Common Lisp data-type system underlies the object system, and how  Lisp functions have been extended to the object world.
<h3></p><a href="9003j/9003j.htm">C PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p><br> by Al Stevens
TEXTSRCH, Al's text retrieval project, continues to grow.  Now you can  select and view one of the files from within the TEXTSRCH program itself.   He then uses this feature to explore the CURSES function library.
<h3></p><a href="9003k/9003k.htm">STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p><br> by Jeff Duntemann
There really were some neat ideas at last fall's Comdex, you just had to  search them out. Jeff describes the jewels he discovered, then delves into sets in Modula-2.
