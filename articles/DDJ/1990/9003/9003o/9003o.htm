Codecheck, a rule-based expert system that checks C and C++ source code for maintainability, portability, and compliance with in-house style, has been announced by Conley Computing.  Codecheck has the ability to identify the number of operators per expression and lines per statement, and it provides a statistical analysis of code complexity and style, allowing programmers to check for both industry standards and those established by their company.<P>
Codecheck also reviews code for its portability to ANSI C and K&amp;R C, among others.  Company president Patrick Conley told DDJ that Codecheck can be beneficial to both corporations and individuals, but especially to corporations that use many programmers for single projects. &quot;The problem is getting programmers to adhere to standards; since everyone has their own Tower of Babel concerning standards, Codecheck can be programmed to check in-house style.&quot;<P>
Codecheck supports all C compilers from major vendors, and is available for PC-DOS and Macintosh at $495, for OS/2 at $695, and for AIX, PC/IX, and QNX at $995.  Multiple copy and educational discounts are also available.  Reader service no 21.<P>

The Paradox Engine, a C library for the relational database Paradox, has been announced by Borland International.  The company claims that this product will enable C programmers to build applications that create or access Paradox data because programs that use the Paradox Engine are standard .EXE files.  The benefit is interoperability among Borland's major business applications and languages, which theoretically allows the building of customized computing environments.<P>
A program written with the Paradox Engine is compiled in C and linked with the Paradox Engine library to build an executable application that can dynamically access Paradox data. The PAL language can also access Paradox tables.<P>
The engine provides an API of more than 70 functions, which allows the manipulation of Paradox tables in single and multiuser environments.  The C version should be shipping this quarter, and will cost $495.  A Pascal version is scheduled for release sometime in the middle of the year, and OS/2 and Windows versions are also under development.  During the first 90 days of availability, registered Borland users can purchase the product for $195.  Reader service no. 22.<P>

The original developer of Turbo Prolog, the Prolog Development Center (PDC), has been granted the rights to the product by Borland International.  The PDC will publish and market new versions under the name PDC Prolog.  According to Michael Alexander at PDC, &quot;The new version is a superset of the current Turbo Prolog.  With the exception of the turtle graphics predicates, it is source-compatible with Turbo Prolog, so existing Turbo Prolog programs can be compiled 'as is' with PDC Prolog.&quot;  And PDC Prolog supports the Borland BGI graphics interface.<P>
A new DOS version should be available by now, and registered users of the DOS version of Turbo Prolog will be able to upgrade for $79.  The OS/2 version should also be available, and will cost $599.  Network support and a SCO 386 Unix version is scheduled for release in the second quarter of this year.  Reader service no. 27.<P>

From Base Two Development comes Spontaneous Assembly, an assembly-language library that contains over 600 functions and macros, including string and memory manipulation, near/far/relative heap management, doubleword/quadword integer math, date and time manipulation, and more.  The company claims that every routine is hand-coded and optimized, and are easy to use because of the register-oriented parameter-passing convention.  Company spokesman Alan Collins told DDJ that &quot;this product does for 8088-family assembly language programming what Borland did for high-level language programming.&quot;<P>
Spontaneous Assembly supports all Microsoft/Borland standard memory models, as well as custom models and mixed-model programming.  The tool sports a full-overlapping windowing system with custom shadowing that allows direct memory via screen access or BIOS. DOS 2.0 or higher is required, and MASM 5.1 or TASM 1.0 are recommended.  It costs $199, includes all source code, and comes with a money back, 60-day guarantee.  Reader service no. 3.

Another is DASM, a disassembler for the 8086, 8088, and 80286, available from JBSoftware. DASM is able to disassemble and modify programs for which the source code is unavailable.  It takes binary run files for DOS and compatible operating systems as input, and creates an assembly language file suitable for modification and reassembly as output.  It acts as a virtual machine and maps the program being disassembled.  It tracks register usage and determines the code, data, and labels, allowing the user to then edit the output and change the program.<P>
DASM works by viewing commands and procedures in their real-time processing order, rather than in the sequence they appear in the program, which JBSoftware claims makes the programs easier to interpret and edit.  Some of DASM's other features include the ability to generate appropriate ASSUMEs and segment maps, to handle multiple entry points, transfer vectors, and .EXE, .COM, and .BIN files up to 200K.  It costs $250.  Reader service no. 2.<P>
