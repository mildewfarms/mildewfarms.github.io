<a name="0198_0002"><a name="0198_0000">The future is now, or so it seems as we begin planning next year's editorial line up. Thanks in part to the thousands of you who responded to our call for 1991 article topic suggestions, we've settled on the following monthly themes for the upcoming year.<P>
<pre>    January              Software Design
    February             Data Compression
    March                Assembly Language Programming
    April                Biocomputing
    May                  Programming for Coprocessors
    June                 Structured Languages
    July                 Graphics Programming
    August               C Programming
    September            Little Languages, Big Engines
    October              Object-Oriented Programming
    November             Operating Systems
    December             User Interfaces</pre><P>
Before going any further, I'll quickly throw in my standard caveat.  These aren't the only topics we'll be discussing; in most issues of DDJ, we try to devote at least half the magazine to non-theme topics.  Among those &quot;other&quot; subjects we'll be covering are embedded systems programming, data structures, 32-bit programming, communications, scientific and engineering programming, windowing systems, software engineering, and just about any efficient implementation of an algorithm.<P>
Keep in mind that we prefer advance notice on all articles, particularly if you want to match your article with a specific monthly theme.  However, we'll run a good technical article on any aspect of programming in any month.  And remember, the more source code (in any language), the better.<P>
If you have an article in mind but want some guidance on how to prepare the proposal and article, give us a call or drop us a letter and we'll get you going.<P>
A special thanks to Terry Vaughn of West Covina, California, the first reader to make a donation to the Kent Porter Scholarship Fund.  In his note, Terry says &quot;. . . if everyone does the same, it'll add up.&quot;  We've received numerous requests for applications and we're looking forward to sharing Terry's goodwill with others.<P>
Those of you who've been using the DDJ listing service should note that the system has moved from New Hampshire, to California, with the phone number changing to 415-364-8315.  David Betz will continue development work from New Hampshire while Keith Lyon will be the programmer on this coast.<P>
And at least one software company took to heart my mention a few months back of Dr. Dobbs, the race horse we adopted as our official mascot.  A recent letter from the company in question was addressed to &quot;Mr. Jon Erickson, Ed.&quot; but, mailmerge programs being what they are, the note began &quot;Dear Mr. Ed,&quot;.  No, it didn't hurt my feelings (I've been called a lot worse).  I just whinnied, stamped my foot on the floor three times, and made my way out to pasture.<P>
