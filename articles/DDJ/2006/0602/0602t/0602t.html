They&#146;re sawed, chopped,   rolled, turned, burned, floated, and even written&#151;but never thrown. This   simple physics applies to programming as well. In other words, you shouldn&#146;t   throw exceptions that have already been logged. And yet, I&#146;ve seen code   such as this:</p>  <pre>try {  // something that generates an exception  . . .  } catch( Exception x ) {  Logger.log(x);  throw x;  }</pre>  <p>Bad. This will most likely result in seeing the same exception message at very   different points in your program&#146;s execution. The problem is, it&#146;s   the same error! </p> <p> Trying to debug this is confusing at best. It also sends an ambivalent and confusing   message to the callers of your function. The pitcher is saying to the catcher,   &#147;I&#146;ll log this now but, well, I&#146;m not sure&#133;it could be fatal&#133;perhaps   you should deal with it, too?&#148; This isn&#146;t only weak minded; it&#146;s   also lazy and pathetic.</p> <p> &#151;Benjamin Booth<br>  <a href="http://www.benjaminbooth.com/">http://www.benjaminbooth.com/</a></p> </body></html>
