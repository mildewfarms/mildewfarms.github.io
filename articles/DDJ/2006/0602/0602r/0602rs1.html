You would need only 21 links. We call this the "two-fan design," because     each hub creates a fan. You need two fans in case one hub is wounded. </li>  <li>Divide the nodes into 96 nodes (the base nodes) that will have six links     each and 12 nodes (the switchboard nodes) that will have 59 links each. This     results in a total of 642 links. Number the 96 base nodes from 1 to 96. Call     1 through 24 the <i>A</i> nodes, 25 through 48 the <i>B</i> nodes, 49 through     72 the <i>C</i> nodes, and 73 through 96 the <i>D</i> nodes. The 12 switchboard     nodes are divided into two groups of six. The first group is called <i>AB</i>,<i>     AC</i>, <i>AD</i>, <i>BC</i>, <i>BD</i>, and <i>CD</i>. The second group is     called <i>AB'</i>, <i>AC'</i>, <i>AD'</i>, <i>BC'</i>, <i>BD'</i>, and <i>CD'</i>.<a name="rf1"></a><a href="0602rf3.html">     Figure 3</a> shows all the nodes and all the interconnections except the complete     graph among all the switchboard nodes (for example, every switchboard node     is connected to every other one). Note that <i>XY'</i> has the same connections     as <i>XY</i> (both to the base nodes and to the hub nodes).<br>    <nbsp> Why does this work? Any two base nodes, say <i>B</i> and <i>D</i>,     are connected through two switchboard nodes (in this case, <i>BD</i> and <i>BD'</i>).     Two base nodes are connected through six switchboard nodes if the base nodes     are in the same letter group. Any base node is connected to any switchboard     node either directly or by connecting to any of the six switchboard nodes     that the base node is directly connected to, plus a direct link to the other     switchboard node.</li></ol><p><b></b></p><p><b>DDJ</b></p><a href="0602r.html#rs1">Back to Article</a></body></html>
