SwiftShader supports both Pixel and Vertex Shaders. Direct3D 8- and Direct3D 9-compatible APIs are available, and OpenGL-compatible APIs are also under development. Vertex Shader 1.1 and Pixel Shader 1.4 features are currently supported. The company claims that SwiftShader can perform over 50 times faster than Microsoft's Direct3D Reference Rasterizer in tests with sample applications. SwiftShader is currently available for x86 CPUs with Intel's SSE multimedia instruction set extensions. SwiftShader runs on Microsoft Windows 98 and higher, and on Linux through TransGaming's Cedega portability technology.</p><p>TransGaming Technologies Inc.<br>55 Byward Market, 2nd floor<br>Ottawa, ON, Canada K1N 9C3<br>http://www.transgaming.com/</p><p>Aonix has released Version 8.2 of its ObjectAda for Windows' development environment.

CodeCollaborator enforces peer code inspections by integrating with version control, issue tracking, reporting, and other external systems. The customizable workflow provides a variety of options based on current inspection processes. The workflow can range from formal rules-based inspections, to casual "buddy pass-arounds." CodeCollaborator's reporting tool provides you with metrics, such as average defects per KLOC and defects per person-hour. It also provides a side-by-side diff viewer with an IM-style audit trail. </p><p>Smart Bear Inc.<br>12885 Research Boulevard, Suite 210<br>  Austin, TX 78750>877-501-5651<br>http://www.codecollaborator.com/</p><p>QNX Software Systems has announced QNX Momentics MultiCore Edition, an integrated set of development tools and OS features for developing software that targets multicore processors. Among other multicore features, Momentics supports Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP) (for managing individual processors on a chip independently) and Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP), Bound Multiprocessing (BMP) (which combines the resource management of SMP with the application control of AMP, letting you assign applications to specific processors). The package also includes a system profiler and system builder tools to support the unique architectures of multicore processors.</p><p>QNX Software Systems<br>175 Terence Matthews Crescent<br>Ottawa, ON, Canada K2M 1W8<br>613-591-0931<br>http://qnxsoftware.com</p><p>SDMetrics has released SDMetrics 2.0, a software-design quality measurement tool for UML. SDMetrics measures structural design properties such as coupling, size, and complexity of UML designs. SDMetrics also checks design rules to automatically detect incomplete or incorrect design, and to point out violations of style guidelines such as circular dependencies or naming conventions. UML-design measurement helps you identify opportunities for design refactoring, and supports effort estimation, project planning, and monitoring. SDMetrics features a suite of object-oriented-design quality metrics and rules covering all UML diagram types. You can add new design rules and metrics that are tailored to your local development process. SDMetrics works with all UML modeling tools and reverse engineering tools that support the UML model interchange format XMI. Version 2.0 includes support for UML 2.0 and XMI 2.0/2.1 standards, with an extended set of design metrics and rules for the new UML2 diagrams and model elements. </p><p>SDMetrics<br>In der Lache 17<br>67308 Zellertal-Harxheim, Germany<br>+49 6355 954 761 <br>http://www.sdmetrics.com/</p><p>Canoo has released an upgrade of its free Eclipse Integration plug-in.
