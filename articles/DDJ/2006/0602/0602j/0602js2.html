<h2></h2>

<p>The initial goal of my project was to write a Java interpreter of the SPARQL query language for use in Sesame, an RDF data server. SPARQL, the first W3C standardized query language for the RDF data format, is a step toward standardization of the Semantic Web vision of W3C.</p>

<p>The language is reminiscent of SQL&#151;users specify a series of set and value constraints on the data in the server:</p>

<blockquote>
SELECT ?title <br>
  WHERE { _:book :title ?title . <br>
    FILTER (?title != "Old Title") }<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The server then returns data values that fit those constraints. However, RDF data is not relational and is usually visualized as a graph of data relationships. Therefore, queries are more akin to graph pattern matching, with variables being bound to certain matched parts of the graph.</p>

<p>The first design was a library of classes that processed the query from within the object structure created by parsing the query into an abstract syntax tree. This design, however, suffered from one of the common problems in OO programming&#151;a dependence on inheritance for extension. To customize the interpreter for other servers, one had to subclass certain query objects and rebuild the library. </p>

<p>The final design uses a combination of design patterns to overcome this dependence. The main principle of the design is the separation of interpretation logic and query data, via prolific use of the Strategy pattern. Because abstract syntax trees lend themselves ideally to the Visitor pattern, a visitor is used at interpretation time to walk the AST query structure and bind logic to each part of the query, using an Abstract Factory to create the logic objects. Developers wishing to implement a customized query interpreter can shortcut the default logic using their own factory implementation to rewrite any part of the logic, without ever needing to recompile the main library. The primary efficiency penalty of the design is found in the data interface between the library and the server. Because most servers use a slightly different data object representation, every data value that is used by the interpreter has to be passed through its own adapter, which either passes on method calls or creates a new interpreter-compatible data value. For greater speed, the most computationally intensive set logic in the interpreter can be overridden to let servers do their own native data manipulation. Hopefully, the benefits of using a standardized specification library will allow server developers to focus more on the front-end server interfaces and underlying persistent storage and less on the particular quirks of this new query language.</p>
