<p>The Java Location API for J2ME is intended to run on small client devices such as mobile phones. It integrates generic positioning and orientation data with persistent storage of point of interest (POI) objects known as "Landmarks." Although there are phones and software tools, including models and emulators from Ericsson and Nokia, that implement this API, developers wishing to work with it have been constrained by a limited set of options for simulating location data. Both the current Nokia and Ericsson tools, for instance, limit input to GPS data (from a log file, for example),  while the CityGuide demo application shipped with the J2ME Wireless Toolkit (Version 2.3) uses an XML file of 'waypoints' as input. For a more interactive approach, I present in this article an open-source map-based simulation environment designed to work with the Sun J2ME Wireless Toolkit (http://java.sun.com/products/ j2mewtoolkit/index.html).</p>

<p>lif/lifindex.html). This protocol works on the assumption that the system is a device-aware cellular network, and that location information is pulled in XML format from a server-hosted API. In contrast, the Location API for J2ME (http://jcp.org/aboutJava/ communityprocess/final/jsr179/index.html) is a client-side generic location interface intended to work with many different positioning methods. Generic interfaces let you implement systems that span multiple sources of location information at the same time. This becomes increasingly important as devices and channels for tracking locations increase, letting us aggregate and prioritize different information sets that relate to the same target, as well as being able to choose between multiple methods of determining the location of a single device. This provides a number of advantages, including fail-over, indoor/outdoor transparency, and a choice between the speed and accuracy trade-offs that could be made between GPS, cellular, or other positioning mechanisms. In this article, I first examine the object model used in the Location API, then code examples that you can explore using the map-based simulator, which can be freely downloaded.</p>
<h3>The Location API Object Model</h3>

<p>The Location API object model consists of 11 classes and two listener interfaces (<i>LocationListener</i> and <i>ProximityListener</i>), all in the javax.microedition.location package. Their design approach uses several standard patterns&#151;Facade, Factory Method, Singleton, and Value Object, and standard JavaBeans-style accessors. Of the 11 classes, two are <i>Exception</i> classes (<i>LocationException</i> and <i>LandmarkException</i>) and another four (<i>AddressInfo</i>, <i>Criteria</i>, <i>Orientation</i>, and <i>QualifiedCoordinates</i>) are primarily value objects. Many of the properties of these objects may in practice be unavailable, depending on the location-finding technology implementing the API. Still, these properties anticipate likely future developments in mobile networks and devices and the level of location and context detail that they provide.</p>

<p>Location objects are immutable aggregates of <i>AddressInfo</i> and <i>QualifiedCoordinates</i> objects. Location instances are acquired from a <i>LocationProvider</i>, a facade to the mobile device's underlying location information that consists of a factory method (parameterized by a <i>Criteria</i> object), to retrieve a <i>LocationProvider</i> instance, methods to return current or last-known <i>Location</i> objects, and methods to register listeners for location and proximity events. The <i>Coordinates</i> class (the superclass of <i>QualifiedCoordinates</i>) encapsulates geometric methods such as calculating the azimuth (angle) and distance between locations. The <i>Orientation</i> class is completely separate from the rest of the object model, having no association or dependency relationships with any other classes. This is presumably because not all devices can support orientation information. At minimum, the device must be able to provide a compass azimuth value to support <i>Orientation</i> objects, with optional support for pitch and roll values. <i>Orientation</i> objects can be derived either from a factory method or a parameterized constructor. </p>

<p>The classes discussed so far encapsulate the subset of the API that is directly related to the acquisition of location information from whatever underlying technology is available to the device. <a name="rf1"></a><a href="0601if1.html">Figure 1</a> summarizes these classes.</p>

<p>The SimpleLocation MIDlet I present here (available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 4) displays the current location of the device on the screen. The interaction with the Location API in this example is straightforward. First, you access the <i>LocationProvider</i> using the static factory method <i>getInstance</i>. The parameter is a <i>Criteria</i> object that can be used to set quality of service parameters;  but in <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a>(a), I pass a null reference. The <i>LocationProvider</i> can now be used to get the current location. The parameter to the <i>getLocation</i> method is the timeout period; see <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a>(b).</p>

<p>Once you have a <i>Location</i> object, you can use it to find out the current latitude, longitude, altitude, direction, and speed by accessing the <i>QualifiedCoordinates</i> object that is aggregated inside it:</p>

<blockquote>
coordinates = <br>
    location.getQualifiedCoordinates();<br>

</blockquote>

<p>A location may also contain an <i>AddressInfo</i> object, with details such as the location's postal address, phone number, country, URL, and the like. Depending on the implementation and context, however, there may not actually be an <i>AddressInfo</i> associated with a given location. For example, if you are standing in the middle of a field, there will be no <i>AddressInfo</i> data. In the simulator implementation described here, the <i>AddressInfo</i> is always null. </p>

<p>The current course, speed, and altitude are returned from the <i>QualifiedCoordinates</i> object as <i>float</i> values, while latitude and longitude are returned as <i>double</i>s. To assist the display of location data, the <i>Coordinates</i> class includes a method to convert a coordinate object into a String representation in either of two formats:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Format 1. Degrees, Minutes, and decimal fractions of a minute. For example, for the double value of the coordinate 61.51d, the formatted string is 61:30:36.</li>
  <li>Format 2. Degrees, Minutes, Seconds, and decimal fractions of a second. For example, for the double value of the coordinate 61.51d, the formatted string is 61:30.6.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the example MIDlet (available electronically), I use Format 2, selected using the constant field <i>Coordinates.DD_MM_SS</i>. Alternatively, Format 1 can be selected using <i>Coordinates.DD_MM</i>. <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a> is the MIDlet code where the location information is displayed on the screen, using a series of <i>StringItem</i>s. <a name="rf2"></a><a href="0601if2.html">Figure 2</a> is from the J2ME Wireless Toolkit with the current location details displayed.</p>
<h3>Using the Location and Proximity Listeners</h3>

<p>The <i>LocationProvider</i> can register two types of listener&#151;a single <i>LocationListener</i> and/or multiple <i>ProximityListeners</i> (<a name="rf3"></a><a href="0601if3.html">Figure 3</a>). These listeners help us to create more dynamic location-based services that can be triggered by location-related events.</p>

<p>In the previous example, I used the <i>LocationProvider</i> to find out the current location whenever the Refresh button was pressed on the phone. This is not a flexible approach and it would be better if you could automatically trigger an event whenever the current location changed, without having to make an explicit call to <i>getLocation</i>. You can achieve this behavior by using the <i>LocationListener</i> interface, which you can use to listen for updates to the current location. Only one <i>LocationListener</i> can be registered with the <i>LocationProvider</i> at any one time, so this listener can therefore act as a kind of Singleton for all components that need location information. The <i>LocationListener</i> is updated with current location information at specified intervals and can expose and process that information in an application-specific context to be accessed by other components on demand. </p>

<p>In the next example, I make the MIDlet itself the <i>LocationListener</i> (available electronically). To listen to location events, the MIDlet must implement the <i>LocationListener</i> interface; see <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>(a). Once the MIDlet implements the <i>LocationListener</i> interface, it can be registered with the <i>LocationProvider</i> as the current <i>LocationListener</i> via the <i>setLocationListener</i> method. The parameters to this method are the listener, interval between updates, timeout period, and maximum acceptable age for location information; see <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>(b). </p>

<p>The listener interface contains two methods&#151;<i>locationUpdated</i> and <i>providerStateChanged</i>. The <i>LocationProvider</i> triggers the <i>locationUpdated</i> method whenever the location changes. The <i>providerStateChanged</i> method is informed when the state of the <i>LocationProvider</i> changes between its three possible states: <i>LocationProvider.AVAILABLE</i>, <i>LocationProvider .TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE</i>, and <i>LocationProvider.OUT_OF_SERVICE</i>. In the MIDlet, only the <i>locationUpdated</i> method is implemented, calling the method that refreshes the screen form; see <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>(c). With these few changes to the MIDlet, you can automatically update the location display whenever the location has changed, without having to press the Refresh button and do a manual update. </p>

<p>In the previous example, I illustrated how a mobile application can use the <i>LocationListener</i> interface to listen for updates to the current location. In addition, you can implement the <i>ProximityListener</i> interface, which lets you trigger events when you approach specified locations. Unlike the <i>LocationListener</i>, which can have only one registered instance, the <i>LocationProvider</i> lets you register multiple <i>ProximityListeners</i>. The <i>ProximityListener</i> MIDlet (available electronically) adds proximity monitoring to the existing location monitoring; see <a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a>(a). This time when the MIDlet starts up, it registers itself three times so that you can listen for proximity events for three different locations (in this case, three buildings on the map used in the simulator). Each registration requires the listener, coordinates, and required proximity radius from these coordinates as parameters; see <a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a>(b). </p>

<p>The <i>ProximityListener</i> interface has two methods&#151;<i>monitoringStateChanged</i> and <i>proximityEvent</i>. The <i>monitoringStateChanged</i> method informs listeners whether proximity notification is currently active. The <i>proximityEvent</i> method provides two parameters&#151;the coordinates originally registered with the <i>LocationProvider</i> and the current location. In this implementation, I compare the given coordinates with the ones I am listening for and select the matching location; see <a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a>(c). The various alerts display an image of the appropriate building. <a name="rf4"></a><a href="0601if4.html">Figure 4</a> shows the proximity alert for the Study Center displayed on the mobile device.</p>
<h3>Landmarks and the LandmarkStore</h3>

<p>What particularly distinguishes this API from other location-based class libraries is the use of local storage to provide a persistent database of landmarks. This shifts the emphasis onto the mobile client in terms of location-aware applications, enabling local mappings from physical positions to points of interest. This approach means that at least part of a location-aware application can be installed on the mobile device rather than on the server. One key advantage of this is that applications are more likely to have useful functionality, even where network connectivity is unreliable. </p>

<p>The API includes two classes to support the persistent storage of location-related data&#151;<i>Landmark</i> and <i>LandmarkStore</i> (<a name="rf5"></a><a href="0601if5.html">Figure 5</a>). <i>Landmark</i> objects, like <i>Location</i> objects, are partial aggregates of <i>AddressInfo</i> and <i>QualifiedCoordinates</i> objects, but <i>Landmark</i>s and <i>Location</i>s have different roles in the architecture. <i>Location</i> objects are immutable and transitory, reflecting the dynamic movement of a mobile device. In contrast, <i>Landmark</i> objects are intended to be persisted in the mobile data store and are mutable, so they might be updated over time.</p>

<p>The <i>LandmarkStore</i> acts as a facade to the underlying data store on the device, and is a collection of landmarks. There can be many <i>LandmarkStore</i>s on a device, shared by multiple applications. <i>Landmark</i>s may optionally be stored under a category name, and may be added to multiple stores and multiple categories. The only restriction is that a <i>Landmark</i> cannot be added to the same category in the same <i>LandmarkStore</i> more than once. Be aware, however, that the local data store has restricted capacity, with storage limited to no more than a few hundred landmarks.</p>

<p>An important feature of the API is that a <i>Landmark</i> object can be populated from the coordinate and address data of a <i>Location</i> generated by the <i>LocationProvider</i> (provided, of course, that the <i>LocationProvider</i> is able to include an <i>AddressInfo</i> along with the <i>QualifiedCoordinate</i>s). This means that <i>Landmark</i>s can be dynamically added to the store.</p>

<p>In addition, <i>Landmark</i> objects already in the <i>LandmarkStore</i> can be linked with <i>Location</i> objects in terms of listener behavior (<a name="rf6"></a><a href="0601if6.html">Figure 6</a>). A mobile application can register multiple <i>ProximityListener</i>s that can be triggered when the current location is within a specific range of a given <i>Landmark</i>. When a proximity event occurs, the appropriate <i>Landmark</i> can be retrieved from the store. </p>

<p>There are two basic scenarios for an application that utilizes the <i>LandmarkStore</i>. First, the store can be a small, static collection of application-specific <i>Landmarks</i> that rarely needs updating. <i>ProximityListener</i>s could be permanently registered to trigger proximity responses to the fixed landmarks. Systems that must deal with a larger set of <i>Landmark</i>s would require more dynamic provision of landmark information. In this context, the <i>LandmarkStore</i> would not contain preloaded objects, but would add/remove them dynamically, using suitable push/pull mechanisms. A hybrid approach might also be used, with batch replacements of data based on movement between larger areas. <i>ProximityListener</i> registration/deregistration would also need to be dynamic, or alternatively, instead of using Proximity Listeners, the API would support searching the <i>LandmarkStore</i> for <i>Landmark</i>s that fall within a specified area. </p>

<p>To keep things simple, the final example (<i>ProximityListener</i> MIDlet; available electronically) assumes a prepopulated <i>LandmarkStore</i> that you use to display information about <i>Landmark</i>s when triggered by a proximity listener. In the previous example, I used a <i>ProximityListener</i> to display alerts when I came close to certain coordinates. In this MIDlet, I display information from the <i>LandmarkStore</i> instead. </p>

<p>The first step is to get an instance of the <i>LandmarkStore</i> (the null parameter indicates the default store):</p>

<blockquote>
landmarkStore = <br>
  LandmarkStore.getInstance(null);<br>

</blockquote>

<p>In this example, I create the <i>Landmark</i> objects at startup and write them to the <i>LandmarkStore</i>. The <i>Landmark</i> constructor requires a landmark name, description, set of coordinates, and <i>AddressInfo</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
Landmark landmark1 = new Landmark<br>
  ("Study Centre", <br>
   "Building on campus", <br>
     studyCentreCoordinates, info);<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Each landmark is added to the <i>LandmarkStore</i> using a category name, but categories must already exist before landmarks can be added to them. In this example, I first add the <i>"campus"</i> category to the <i>LandmarkStore</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
landmarkStore.addCategory("campus");<br>

</blockquote>

<p>It is then possible to add a <i>Landmark</i> object to the store under the <i>"campus"</i> category:</p>

<blockquote>
landmarkStore.addLandmark(<br>
		  landmark1, "campus");<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Later in the MIDlet, I retrieve the needed landmark using the <i>getLandmark</i>s method, passing the names of the category and the <i>Landmark</i> as parameters:</p>

<blockquote>
Enumeration e = <br>
   landmarkStore.getLandmarks(<br>
	           "campus", "Study Centre");<br>
Landmark landmark = <br>
   (Landmark)e.nextElement();<br>
AddressInfo info = <br>
   landmark.getAddressInfo();<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Once the <i>AddressInfo</i> object is retrieved, it can be displayed onscreen (<a name="rf7"></a><a href="0601if7.html">Figure 7</a>). </p>
<h3>Using the Location API  For J2ME Simulator</h3>

<p>To test the code, you need to install and run the map-based simulator (available electronically). The simulator consists of three components:</p>



<ul>
  <li>A Swing application that allows a user to control the direction and speed of a virtual mobile device moving across a map in a desktop environment. The virtual mobile device makes itself available to clients by way of the RMI registry.</li>
  <li>A simple web application that reads position data from the Swing application and publishes it to HTTP clients via a JavaBean embedded in a JavaServer Page.</li>
  <li>An implementation of the Location API for J2ME that can be deployed into the Sun J2ME Wireless Toolkit as a JAR file. This implementation acquires position data by connecting over HTTP to the web application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this three-layer design may seem a little complex, it enables loose coupling between the Wireless Toolkit and simulator. Since the <i>LocationProvider</i> implementation could only work with libraries available on the CLDC/MIDP platform (or we would not be able to also use the implementation on a mobile device), it is not possible to use RMI directly from the Wireless Toolkit. One advantage of this architecture is that both simulated and actual wireless devices can easily access the same data from the web server. <a name="rf8"></a><a href="0601if8.html">Figure 8</a> summarizes the various layers and components in the simulation system. Detailed instructions on how to configure and run the simulator can be found in the readme file in the downloadable archive.</p>
<h3>What's Not In the API?</h3>

<p>One feature that is present in some APIs, but not this one, is topological data, which is usually derived from the shapes of cell site coverage. Regardless of the underlying technology, area-of-interest data can be just as useful as point-of-interest data. The best you can do in this API is to define an area by its radius from a point, but the facility to acquire topological data when available might be useful in some applications. There is no support for location-based queries either, though these are fundamental to the use of server-hosted spatial databases (such as Oracle's) that support LBS. Perhaps a client-side query language could be a useful feature, enabling clients to build queries to be executed on the server. Other aspects of spatial databases such as yellow pages, routing, and mapping are also key components of location-based service, but could not reasonably be expected to be hosted on a client device. However, it might be useful if the API provided some facilities to interact with such systems. Perhaps in future versions of the spec, we will see extensions to the API to enable more functionality on the mobile client.</p>
