That's 1/6 of the time. I think that's the best one can do. See if you can do better.  <li>	For six chips with three guesses per color, the best I know of is 1/20. As Alan Dragoo puts it: "Guess the same half of the boxes for one half of the chips and the other half of the boxes for the other half of the chips. This gives a probability of (<i>n</i>/2)!&times;(<i>n</i>/2)!/<i>n</i>! of winning." For 6, this comes out to be 1/20.  <li>Is there a nice generalization? See the Dragoo comment in the answer to 2. </li>  <li>Identify the colors with numbers:</li><blockquote>Black -- 1<br>White -- 2<br>Red -- 3<br>Green -- 4<br></blockquote>	Here are the programs. The boxes are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 in left-to-right order. <blockquote>Black: 1; Black -&gt; win, White -&gt; 2, Red -&gt; 3, Green -&gt; 4<br>White: 2; White -&gt; win, Black -&gt; 1, Red -&gt; 3, Green -&gt; 4<br>Red: 3; Red -&gt; win, Black -&gt; 1, White -&gt; 2, Green -&gt; 4<br>Green: 4; Green -&gt; win, Black -&gt; 1, White -&gt; 2, Red -&gt; 3<br></blockquote>	The notation means the following:<blockquote>Black starts at box 1; if box 1 has a black chip, then Black wins;<br>if box 1 has a white chip, then Black next opens box 2;<br>if box 1 has a red chip, then Black next opens box 3;<br>and so on.<br></blockquote>	This strategy wins 10 times out of 24 permutations. To see this, consider any ordering of the colors in boxes. <blockquote>1	2	3	4	win/lose<br>Black 	White	Red	Green	win	<br>Black	White	Green	Red	win	<br>Black  	Red 	White	Green 	win	<br>Black   	Red   	Green 	White 	lose	<br>Black  	Green 	White 	Red   	lose	<br>Black   	Green 	Red   	White 	win	<br>White   	Black 	Red   	Green 	win	<br>White  	Black 	Green 	Red   	win	<br>White 	Red   	Black 	Green 	lose	<br>White  	Red   	Green 	Black 	lose	<br>White	Green 	Black 	Red   	lose	<br>White	Green 	Red   	Black 	lose	<br>Red 	Black 	White 	Green 	lose	<br>Red 	Black 	Green 	White 	lose	<br>Red 	White 	Black 	Green 	win	<br>Red 	White 	Green 	Black 	lose	<br>Red 	Green 	Black 	White 	win	<br>Red 	Green 	White 	Black 	lose	<br>Green	Black 	White 	Red   	lose	<br>Green 	Black 	Red 	White	lose	<br>Green 	White 	Black 	Red   	lose	<br>Green 	White 	Red   	Black 	win	<br>Green 	Red 	Black	White	lose	<br>Green	Red   	White 	Black 	win	<br></blockquote>  <li>Out of the 720 possible permutations of the six elements, one can win 276 times (or more than 38 percent of the time). The agents all agree in advance on the following arbitrary association of boxes to colors (which may be completely incorrect).</li><blockquote>Black &#151;&gt; box 1<br>White &#151;&gt; box 2<br>Red &#151;&gt;	 box 3<br>Green &#151;&gt; box 4<br>Blue &#151;&gt; box 5<br>Orange &#151;&gt; box 6<br></blockquote>	Here is the program for the agent for color <i>X</i>. Start at the box corresponding to color <i>X</i> in the arbitrary association. If you find <i>X</i>, then you've won, so you can stop. Otherwise, look up the color you find, say <i>Y</i>, in the arbitrary association and look at that box. If you find <i>X</i>, then you've won, so you can stop. Otherwise, look up the color you find, say <i>Z</i>, in the arbitrary association and look at that box. If you find <i>X</i>, then you've won. Otherwise, you lose. <p>For example, White does the following:</p><blockquote>White: 2; <br>      Black-&gt;1, White-&gt;win, Red-&gt;3, Green-&gt;4, Blue-&gt;5, Orange-&gt;6;<br>      Black-&gt;1, White-&gt;win, Red-&gt;3, Green-&gt;4, Blue-&gt;5, Orange-&gt;6;<br></blockquote>	The idea for this problem comes from Peter Winkler and the solution approach for the procedural agent scenario comes from Michael Rabin. The idea is to use the color-number association (which is completely arbitrary) in a consistent manner to direct each color to the next bucket. For the algebraists: You win whenever the longest cycle in the permutation is of length <i>n</i>/2 or less.</ol><p></p><p><b>DDJ</b></p><a href="0601t.html#rs1">Back to Article</a></body></html>
