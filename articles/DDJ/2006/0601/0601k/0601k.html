<h1>Cocoa Memory Management</h1>
<h2>Efficient memory management leads to better performance</h2>

<p>Cocoa is a set of frameworks for Macintosh application development. With the news that Apple will be shipping an Intel version of Mac OS X, understanding the Cocoa environment has gained importance for a broad new range of software developers. In this article, I examine Cocoa memory management. Applications that efficiently manage memory tend to load faster, exhibit better performance (especially in low-memory situations), and are less susceptible to errors caused by memory leaks and fragmentation. The code examples I present here&#151;including MemLab, an application that lets you explore memory-management concepts&#151;were developed and tested with Apple's Xcode IDE. MemLab (available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 4) requires a PowerPC Macintosh running Mac OS 10.3 (or later). </p>

<p>Cocoa uses a memory-management scheme that's different from that of Java or C++. For instance, when instantiating a new object in C++, you use <i>theObj = new theClass;</i>. You can later dispose of that object with <i>delete theObj;</i>. In Java, however, you instantiate a new object with <i>theObj=new theClass();</i>. You then take no action to dispose of the object. Instead, Java's garbage collection decides when to dispose of the object.</p>

<p>Cocoa takes an intermediate approach toward managing its objects. While you still instantiate new objects somewhat like C++ and Java, Cocoa uses a reference-counting scheme to decide when the object can be safely discarded. With this scheme, the object uses an internal counter to keep track of the number of active references to it. When the count reaches zero, the object promptly self destructs.</p>
<h3>Creation and Disposal</h3>

<p>For the most part, Cocoa applications are written in either Objective-C or Objective-C++. Objective-C is a strict superset of ANSI C. Memory-management routines such as <i>malloc()</i> and <i>free()</i> are still available as part of stdlib.h, and you still use these routines to allocate and dispose of memory for your <i>struct</i> and <i>union</i> datatypes. However, you cannot use <i>malloc()</i> and <i>free()</i> to instantiate and dispose of Cocoa objects.</p>

<p>To instantiate Cocoa objects, you can use one of three approaches as provided by Objective-C. </p>

<p>The most common approach is to send to the object class an <i>[alloc] </i>and an<b> <i></b>[init] </i>message, as in:</p>

<blockquote>
theObj = [[theClass alloc] init];<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Here, you send <i>theClass</i> an <i>[alloc] </i>message telling its <i>NSObject</i> parent to allocate memory for the instance from the default memory zone (more on memory zones later). You then send it an<i> [init] </i>message to initialize any objects or data structures it contains.</p>

<p>As a shorthand approach to instantiating Cocoa objects, you send a <i>[new]</i> message to <i>theClass</i> instead of the <i>[alloc] </i>and <i>[init] </i>messages:</p>

<blockquote>
theObj = [theClass new];<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, you send the<i> [alloc] </i>and<i> [init]</i> messages like this:</p>

<blockquote>
theObj = [theClass alloc];<br>
[theObj init];<br>

</blockquote>

<p>This approach is useful when debugging Cocoa objects. If the object fails to instantiate, you can determine whether the problem occurs in the <i>alloc</i> or <i>init</i> message phase of instantiation.</p>

<p>The second approach to instantiating Cocoa objects is using factory or convenience methods. These methods let you instantiate Cocoa objects, as well as initialize them to a specific value. Cocoa classes such as <i>NSString</i> provide a range of convenience methods that let you do just that:</p>

<blockquote>
theStr = [NSString stringWithString:@"Dr. Dobbs"];<br>
theNum = [NSNumber numberWithInt:42];<br>
theURL = [NSURL URLWithString:<br>
                           @"http://www.ddj.com];<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The third approach to instantiating Cocoa objects is to make a copy of an existing object. You do this by sending a <i>[copy]</i> message to the latter:</p>

<blockquote>
theCopy = [theObj copy];<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Each Cocoa class handles the <i>[copy] </i>message differently. Immutable classes such as <i>NSString</i> and <i>NSNumber</i> perform a shallow copy when they handle a <i>[copy] </i>message. A shallow copy duplicates an object's pointers by reference. As a result, the copy has the same pointer references as the original. Mutable classes such as <i>NSMutableString</i> and <i>NSMutableNumber</i> perform deep copies. In deep copies, the object's pointers are duplicated by value. This process is repeated until all pointer references in the original are covered. Changing a pointer value in a deep-copy object will not affect the same pointer value in the original object.</p>

<p>There is a catch. Regardless of whether the Cocoa class is mutable or immutable, using the <i>[copy]</i> message always creates an immutable copy. If you want to create a mutable copy of a mutable object, you have to send a <i>[mutableCopy]</i> message:</p>

<blockquote>
theCopy = [theObj mutableCopy];<br>

</blockquote>
<h3>Disposing of Objects</h3>

<p>Once you are done using a Cocoa object, you can dispose of it by sending a <i>[release] </i>message:</p>

<blockquote>
[theObj release];<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The<i> [release] </i>message does not immediately deallocate the object. Instead, it decrements the internal reference count of that object by 1. Once that reference count reaches 0, the object self destructs by invoking its <i>dealloc</i> method directly. </p>

<p>You can also dispose of the Cocoa object by sending it an <i>[autorelease] </i>message:</p>

<blockquote>
[theObj autorelease];<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The <i>[autorelease]</i> message defers the object's disposal by placing it in a specialized area called an "autorelease pool." Once placed, the object usually remains valid until the pool itself is discarded.</p>

<p>There is no convenient way of finding out whether the object is still valid once it receives an <i>[autorelease] </i>message. Apple recommends you assume that autoreleased objects remain valid only within the scope of the current method. Apple also recommends not sending another <i>[release] </i>or an <i>[autorelease]</i> to an autoreleased object. Doing so generates either a <i>SIG_SEGV</i> or an <i>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</i> error.</p>
<h3>Retention and Release</h3>

<p>Again, Cocoa objects maintain an internal reference counter to decide when they should self-destruct. When objects are instantiated using either the<i> [alloc] </i>and <i>[init], [new], </i>or <i>[copy] </i>message, their reference count is initially set to 1. Sending a <i>[release] </i>message to the same object decrements the reference count by 1. Once the count reaches zero, the object promptly self destructs by calling its <i>dealloc</i> method. If you want to prevent the object from self destructing prematurely, you can retain the object by sending it a<i> [retain] </i>message, as in <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a>. The<i> [retain] </i> message increments the reference count by 1. Additional<i> [retain] </i> messages will also increment the count by 1. To decrement the count, send a<i> [release]</i> message to the object.</p>

<p>To determine the current reference count, send a<i> [retainCount] </i>message to the object; see <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a>. The <i>[retainCount]</i> message returns an unsigned integer indicating the number of active references to the object. However, it does not take into account any <i>[autorelease]</i> messages that are still pending. </p>
<h3>Rules of Retention and Release</h3>

<p>Once you know how to retain and release Cocoa objects, you need to become familiar on when to use the<i> [retain], [release],</i> and <i>[autorelease] </i>messages. Incorrect use of these messages can result in memory leaks or the dreaded <i>SIG_SEGV</i> and <i>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</i> fatal errors. These rules may help:</p>



<ul>
  <li>If you instantiated an object using <i>[alloc] </i>or <i>[copy],</i> dispose of the object using either <i>[release]</i> or an <i>[autorelease]</i>.</li>
  <li>If you instantiated an object using a convenience method, the object is already slated for autorelease. Do not send a <i>[release]</i> or an<i> [autorelease] </i>message to this object.</li>
  <li>If you send a<i> [retain] </i>message to the object, send a <i>[release]</i> message to cancel the retention.</li>
  <li>If you received an object as a result of a method call, always assume that the object is valid within the scope of your calling method. If you want to extend the object's validity beyond the scope of your calling method, send a <i>[retain] </i>message to that object.</li>
  <li>Use the <i>[release]</i> message whenever possible for performance reasons. If you are returning an object as part of your method call, use the <i>[autorelease]</i> message.</li>
  <li>Retain and release the object to prevent the object from being accidentally eliminated as a side effect of certain Cocoa operations such as <i>NSLog().</i></li>
  <li>Balance all <i>[retain] </i>messages with an equal number of <i>[release]</i> and <i>[autorelease]</i> messages.</li>
  <li>Never send a <i>[dealloc]</i> message to the object. Though this may also dispose of the object, it does so regardless of the current reference count. Other objects that have retained the object you've just deallocated are left with invalid references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Designing Accessors and Modifiers</h3>

<p>Accessor and modifier methods let other objects access and modify an object's internal properties. If the property itself happens to contain a Cocoa object, other Cocoa objects may try to retain and release that property value. This is where memory management becomes a factor in their implementation. Because accessors and modifiers are some of the most frequently called methods, be sure that these methods perform as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>I design accessor and modifier methods in five different ways. To illustrate each design variant, I use the generic Cocoa class in <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>. The class has an accessor method named <i>getObj</i> and a <i>modifier</i> named <i>setObject</i>. The internal property used to store a Cocoa object is <i>theProp</i>. <a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a> is a basic design of an accessor and modifier method. Here, the <i>getObject</i> accessor simply returns a reference to <i>theProp</i>. The <i>setObject</i> modifier first sends a <i>[retain]</i> message to <i>newObj</i> to retain the new object. It then sends a <i>[release]</i> message to <i>theProp</i> to dispose of the object stored in that property. It then updates <i>theProp</i> with the object contained in <i>newObj</i>. </p>

<p>In most situations, this basic accessor and modifier implementation is sufficient. However, there are design variants that provide some performance advantages in certain design scenarios. For instance, if the calling method maintains its own autorelease pool, I use the <i>getObject</i> accessor in <a name="rl5"></a><a href="#l5">Listing Five</a>. This accessor ensures that the returned object stored in <i>theProp</i> is automatically placed in the caller's autorelease pool.</p>

<p><a name="rl6"></a><a href="#l6">Listing Six</a> is a faster variant of the <i>setObject</i> modifier. Here, the argument <i>newObj</i> is compared with the property <i>theProp</i>. If both objects are different, the modifier retains <i>newObj</i> and releases <i>theProp</i>. Only then does it update <i>theProp</i> with <i>newObj</i>. By first comparing <i>newObj</i> and <i>theProp</i>, I avoid the unnecessary process of retaining and releasing the objects involved. I also avoid updating <i>theProp</i> if both the property and argument already contain the same object.</p>

<p><a name="rl7"></a><a href="#l7">Listing Seven</a> is a third variation of the <i>setObject</i> modifier. Here, an <i>[autorelease] </i>message is first sent to <i>theProp</i>. Afterwards, a<i> [retain]</i> message is sent to <i>newObj</i>, which is then assigned to <i>theProp</i>. I use this variant when my calling method has stored the previous value of <i>theProp</i> locally (see <a name="rl8"></a><a href="#l8">Listing Eight</a>). Here, the current object stored in <i>theProp</i> is stored in the local <i>theObj</i>. A new object is then assigned to <i>theProp</i> using the<i> [setObject] </i>modifier. For the comparison to work, <i>theObj</i> needs to remain valid after the modifier is invoked. If a <i>[release] </i>message is sent to <i>theProp</i> instead of the <i>[autorelease]</i> message,  the object stored in <i>theObj</i> may get eliminated, causing the <i>if()</i> construct to fail with either a <i>SIG_SEGV</i> or <i>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</i> error.</p>

<p><a name="rl9"></a><a href="#l9">Listing Nine</a> is a variation of the <i>setObject</i> modifier. This modifier is a faster variant of the one in <a name="rl7"></a><a href="#l7">Listing Seven</a>. It omits the comparison check used to see <i>theProp</i> already has the same object as <i>newObj</i>. I use this variant if and only if I know that <i>newObj</i> will always be different from <i>theProp</i>.</p>
<h3>The Autorelease Pool</h3>

<p>An autorelease pool is an instance of the Cocoa class <i>NSAutoreleasePool</i>. This pool is used to contain other Cocoa objects that were given <i>[autorelease] </i>messages. Once stored in the pool, these objects remain valid until the pool itself is eliminated. The autorelease pool has a number of unique characteristics. For one thing, you can only dispose of the pool by explicitly sending it a<i> [release] </i>message. Any attempts to send either a<i> [retain]</i> or an <i>[autorelease] </i>message to the pool generates an exception.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the pool is that you can only add objects to the pool. You cannot take objects out of the pool. Also, you cannot send another <i>[release]</i> or <i>[autorelease] </i>message to an object that is already in the pool. If you do so, the pool generates an <i>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</i> error. The <i>NSAutoreleasePool</i> class is opaque; its internal structure is a black box. Short of using a low-level debugger, you have no way of telling how each autoreleased object is stored in the pool. Because of this opaqueness, you should only assume that all autoreleased objects would eventually be discarded. Never make any assumptions on how or in what order the disposal would occur. </p>
<h3>When to Create Your  Own Autorelease Pool</h3>

<p>Cocoa applications that are based upon the Application Kit framework always have one autorelease pool available. This pool is created at the beginning of the event loop and is periodically eliminated at the end (see <a name="rf1"></a><a href="0601kf1.html">Figure 1</a>). </p>

<p>In most situations, the default autorelease pool is sufficient. However, you can instantiate additional pools when necessary. Each instantiated pool is then arranged as a LIFO stack with the latest pool at the top and the default pool at the bottom (<a name="rf2"></a><a href="0601kf2.html">Figure 2</a>). Any Cocoa object that received an <i>[autorelease]</i> message would be added to the topmost pool. </p>

<p>So when should you instantiate additional autorelease pools? Here are a number of design scenarios where instantiating additional pools would be useful:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Building a Cocoa application that does not use the Application Kit framework; for example, a command-line utility that makes use of the Foundation Kit framework.</li>
  <li>A detached thread based on either <i>NSThread</i> or <i>pthread</i> that makes use of Cocoa objects.</li>
  <li>An application or thread that generates and disposes of a large number of autorelease objects.</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, you need to instantiate at least one autorelease pool if you plan to have Cocoa objects without the benefit of the Application Kit framework. </p>
<h3>Instantiating Autorelease Pools</h3>

<p><a name="rl10"></a><a href="#l10">Listing Ten</a> shows how to instantiate and dispose of your autorelease pool. Apple recommends that the pool needs to be discarded in the same context in which it was instantiated. For example, if the pool is instantiated at the start of a loop, it needs to be eliminated at the end of that same loop. Also, if the pool is instantiated at the beginning of a method, it needs to be eliminated at the end of the method. Failing to dispose of the pool correctly prevents its cache of autorelease objects from being eliminated as well. This results in a potentially large memory leak.</p>

<p>You also have to make sure that you dispose of the autorelease pools in the same order in which they were instantiated. For example, if you have six autorelease pools instantiated, sending a <i>[release] </i>message to pool 6 results in only that pool being discarded (see <a name="rf3"></a><a href="0601kf3.html">Figure 3</a>). However, if you send a<i> [release] </i>message to pool 4 (<a name="rf4"></a><a href="0601kf4.html">Figure 4</a>), pools 5 to 6 will also be discarded. If those pools still have objects with pending <i>retain</i>s, those objects will not get discarded.</p>
<h3>Memory Zones</h3>

<p>A memory zone is a region of page-aligned memory used by a Cocoa application to store its Cocoa objects. Unlike the traditional application space, a memory zone is allowed to grow whenever necessary. Mac OS X creates a default memory zone for each Cocoa application. Cocoa objects that were instantiated using the<i> [new], [alloc],</i> or <i>[copy] </i>messages are allocated memory from the default zone. Although you do have the option of creating additional zones, the default zone is fast and efficient enough for most purposes. </p>

<p>There are scenarios where creating additional memory zones may be desirable. For instance, if a Cocoa object instantiates and destroys a lot of objects within its scope, the default zone could get severely fragmented (<a name="rf5"></a><a href="0601kf5.html">Figure 5</a>); this results in a performance hit. Using independent memory zones for storing/disposing large numbers of objects prevents the default zone from being severely fragmented.</p>

<p>Another scenario occurs when the default memory zone has grown to at least two pages long. If two objects (say, <i>obj3</i> and <i>obj5</i>) were instantiated, these objects may be located relatively far apart from each other in the default zone (<a name="rf6"></a><a href="0601kf6.html">Figure 6</a>). This becomes an issue if a page fault occurs and <i>page2</i> is written to the disk.</p>

<p>When <i>obj3</i> tries to access <i>obj5</i>, a page fault has to occur, causing <i>page2</i> (containing <i>obj5</i>) to be read from the disk. If this page fault frequently occurs, it translates into a noticeable performance hit. A worse-case scenario would be where reading <i>page2</i> from the disk generates another page fault that may cause <i>page1</i> to be written to the disk. Creating a separate memory zone to store <i>obj3</i> and <i>obj5</i> keeps both objects within the same page. If a page fault occurs, the zone containing both objects is written to the disk. Also, when <i>obj3</i> is accessed, the resulting page fault causes the same zone (again, containing both objects) to be read from the disk.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of creating additional zones is that it increases the memory footprint of the application. You are also responsible for keeping track of any objects that were allocated to the zone, and making sure that the zone is empty before you dispose of it. Due to these disadvantages, creating additional zones should be considered only for optimization purposes. </p>

<p>To create your own memory zone, use the <i>NSCreateZone</i> function: </p>

<blockquote>
NSZone *theZone = <br>
          NSCreateZone(8192, 1024, TRUE);<br>

</blockquote>

<p>This function takes three parameters: the initial size of the zone, the amount that the zone grows or shrinks, and whether the zone should reclaim memory. If it was able to create a new zone, it returns an opaque data structure called an <i>NSZone</i>; otherwise, it returns a <i>NIL</i>.</p>

<p>When you instantiate a new Cocoa object, use the <i>[allocWithZone] </i>message for the object to allocate its memory from my memory zone (<a name="rl11"></a><a href="#l11">Listing Eleven</a>). Passing a <i>NIL</i> to the same message would cause the object to use the default zone as its allocation source. To create copies of an object, use the<i> [copyWithZone] </i>or <i>[mutableCopyWithZone] </i>whenever appropriate. </p>

<p>You can also use the <i>NSRecycleZone</i> function (<a name="rl12"></a><a href="#l12">Listing Twelve</a>) to free up any unused memory contained by the zone. The function also preserves any objects stored in the zone that still have valid references. </p>

<p>Finally, if you want to completely dispose of the memory zone, use the system function call <i>malloc_destroy_zone().</i> This function frees up all memory contained by the zone and disposes of the zone as well. It does this regardless of whether the zone still has objects with valid references. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have discarded any objects you have stored in that zone before invoking <i>malloc_destroy_zone().</i> Never use <i>malloc_destroy_zone() to</i> dispose of the default memory zone.</p>
