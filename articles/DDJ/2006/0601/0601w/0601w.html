The technology behind Predictive Lite incorporates a machine learner to analyze defects, enabling you to identify the best metrics and thresholds to use across one or more projects. Predictive Lite is deployed on the same PC where the code resides. You direct Predictive Lite to the targeted code, and metrics are applied. Predictive Lite then organizes the detected defects hierarchically for analysis and reporting. The tool executes at an average processing speed of 1500 lines of code per second, on a system with a 2.8-GHz processor and 512 MB of RAM. Predictive Pro adds Heuristics and Trend Identifier modes that facilitate the analysis of complied error data and identify trends within a project. Finally, Predictive Server is designed to provide all features across multiple projects and in a distributed, networked environment.</p><p>Integrated Software Metrics Inc.<br>1000 Technology Drive, Suite 1215<br>Fairmont, WV 26554<br>408-612-3410<br>http://www.ismwv.com/</p><p>Triplehash has released XtraPHP, a PHP framework that manages state, separates logic from presentation, and provides event-driven programming and validation controls. XtraPHP lets you fully separate presentation code (HTML) from logic code (PHP), making for neater and easier to maintain code. By putting the logic in a separate file, designers can work on the design of a page without tampering with program logic. XtraPHP comes with PHP classes to represent various web controls, such as text boxes, buttons, and so on. It also includes several validation controls that automatically perform common input validation operations with minimal code, or allows the developer to specify more complex validation. Pages, based on XtraPHP automatically, maintain their state between page requests using a so-called "ViewState." This, combined with an event-driven programming model eases development and reduces both development time and the potential for errors.</p><p>Triplehash <br>3 Club Road<br>Walmer<br>6070 South Africa<br>+27 84 581 3258<br>http://www.triplehash.com/</p><p>Quma Software has released QVCS-Pro Version 3.9, a Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003 version control system that brings order and control to the application development process. The latest version supports directory recursion from within the GUI, letting you see at a glance the status of your entire project so you can immediately identify the files that are out of date. QVCS-Pro automates the tracking of files as they change during the development of a new software application. By requiring you to log files in and out, QVCS-Pro prevents multiple programmers from unknowingly working on the same file simultaneously. QVCS-Pro integrates with any IDE that supports Microsoft's SCC API, including Microsoft's Visual C++ 6.0, Visual Basic 6.0, Visual Studio.Net, and PowerBuilder. QVCS-Pro keeps track of which changes are made to which files, and when. When you check out a file, QVCS-Pro retrieves the latest revision of the file, and record a date/time stamp for you. QVCS-Pro ensures that the programmer is authorized to work on the module. It will warn the programmer if a writeable copy of the file already exists, and deny access to the file if another programmer is already working on that file.</p><p>Quma Software Inc.<br>20 Warren Manor Court<br>Cockeysville, MD 21030 <br>202-478-0246<br>http://www.qumasoft.com/</p><p>Beaver Valley Software has released Help Writer 1.0, a developer tool that produces the Windows-compliant documentation for help systems. Help Writer lets you use your HTML editor of choice to produce the content for the documentation. After writing the documentation, Help Writer creates the Table of Contents and the index based on the information provided to it. If you don't like the order of Table of Contents, it can be changed. And additional information can be added to the index if desired. Help Writer requires the HTML Help Workshop compiler to create the help file. The compiler is available from Microsoft without charge. Help Writer also requires the .NET Framework, and the Help Writer CD comes with the required files to install the .NET Framework. </p><p>Beaver Valley Software Company <br>P.O.

Chimera lets AI developers deliver distributed rule-based systems, expert systems, and knowledge-based applications. Chimera combines the heuristic intelligence modeling of logic programming, enhancing the standard relational nature of Prolog with an intuitive system of raising and responding to events, both locally and across network connections. Built directly upon the Windows Sockets (Winsock) TCP/IP support that has been added to the latest version of Win-Prolog, Chimera is entirely self-contained, and does not require any other toolkits. </p><p>Logic Programming Associates Ltd.<br>Studio 4, R.V.P.B., Trinity Road,<br>London, SW18 3SX, UK<br>+44 20 8871 2016<br>http://www.lpa.co.uk/</p><p>Lake of Soft Ltd has announces the release of Version 3.0.2005.08 of its VCX Library, a set of ActiveX controls that provides real-time, low-latency multiclient audio streaming over TCP/IP networks for applications such as voice chat, web chat, and multistreaming software. The VCX Library includes components for recording and playback of audio streams through one of the installed sound cards; mixing, resampling, reading and writing wave files; encoding and decoding a stream by different codecs. This includes the ability to control the Volume Control panel, display audio stream graphically, similar to the display in WinAmp. The library also provides TCP/IP server and client components for peer-to-peer, multiuser, and broadcasting audio communications.</p><p>Lake of Soft Ltd.<br>Pr. L.
