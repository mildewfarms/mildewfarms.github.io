<p>Lattix has announced the availability of Lattix LDM for Eclipse as part of its Lattix LDM Version 2.5 release. Lattix LDM lets you create lightweight dependency models of applications so that you can analyze architectures in detail, edit the structure to create what-if and should-be architectures, and create design rules to formalize and communicate that architecture. With the Eclipse plug-in, Lattix extends developer capabilities to visualize and maintain the architecture during application development by delivering the power of Lightweight Dependency Models (LDM) to formalize, communicate, and control the architecture of Eclipse projects. Lattix LDM for Eclipse lets you map architecture to actual code, test architecture and detect architectural violations while coding, and refactor architectures.</p>

<p>Revelation Technologies has released Version 2.0 of its Dali intelligent data access layer software component. Dali lets existing business objects interact with a database, either directly using a two-tiered architecture or indirectly using an n-tiered, web service-based architecture. For new projects, Dali provides a code generator tool, Dali Studio, which creates source-code files appropriate for the chosen database. Dali does not require any additional mapping files that can get out-of-sync with the code.</p>

<p>EmbeddedPlus Engineering has announced its Systems Modeling and Simulation Toolkit (SMST) for the IBM Rational Software Development Platform, an add-on to the Eclipse-based IBM RSDP, which provides support for SysML and the ability to execute and simulate UML and SysML models. SMST supports IBM's Rational Systems Developer tools and helps large-scale programs govern their systems and software development. SysML is a modeling language for systems engineering and has been created by extending the Unified Modeling Language (UML) with systems domain specific constructs, diagrams, and features. EmbeddedPlus SMST provides the ability to directly import Rose models and with a single click, upgrade them to SysML and simulation-capable models.</p>

<p>Inv Softworks has released Version 2.0 of its FlexHEX hex editor. Among other tasks, hex editors let you analyze data files, create input files for test runs, patch binaries, and the like. FlexHEX edits raw binary files, OLE compound files, logical disks, physical drives, and can inspect, modify, insert, search, or replace binary, ASCII, or UNICODE data. The editor fully supports advanced NTFS features, such as alternate streams or sparse files. FlexHEX also supports editing binary data as typed values in a number of formats. The data conversion functions let a user easily import or export binary data, or just drag-and-drop them to/from another application.</p>

<p>Headway Software has released Structure101 for Java, a tool that lets you see and understand how applications are constructed. Supposedly all you do is point Structure101 at your code and you can see where those architectural skeletons lie. Structure101 for Java features include: view dependencies at any level; detect, measure, and report excessive structural complexity; different hierarchies and auto partitioning of graphs.</p>

<p>Mozilla has released a developer preview of its application framework, code-named XULRunner, that aids in the rapid development and deployment of cross-platform applications. XULRunner provides a base for software application authors to leverage Internet technologies, the Mozilla XUL user-interface language, and the same networking and rendering engine as Firefox to develop rich-client applications, such as media players, web authoring tools, and IP-based phones, which can run on any operating system. XULRunner contains features developed in conjunction with IBM, which let the Eclipse development environment  display, develop, and debug web technologies such as HTML, XML, and JavaScript.</p>
