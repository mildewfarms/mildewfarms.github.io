<p>VIA Technologies has released the VIA Java Cryptography Service Provider (VIA JCP), an add-on package that enables the Java Runtime Environment offload AES encryption and random-number generation to the VIA PadLock Security Engine integrated into VIA C7-M and VIA C7 processors. The VIA JCP enables Java-based applications that utilize the Java Cryptography Architecture to benefit from the military-grade protection offered by the VIA PadLock Security Engine with no program modification. Running in the background of Windows and Linux, the VIA JCP requires no user interaction or maintenance. The VIA JCP can accelerate these AES cipher functions by up to 90 times, enabling real-time encryption of data with low processor utilization, and strengthens the process of private/public key creation through utilizing the unprecedented speed and quality of VIA PadLock's quantum-based random-number generators to build an unshakable foundation for security. The VIA JCP is available for free download at http://www.viaarena.com/.</p>
