<p>The OSGi Alliance Service Platform (<a href="http://www.osgi.org/">http://www.osgi.org/</a>) is a Java-based environment that is multithreaded from the ground up. The OSGi framework consists of libraries and services designed to execute code from various sources. You can also use the Eclipse OSGI runtime as a standalone framework because it is part of the Eclipse Equinox project, the foundation of the Eclipse Rich Client Platform. However, multithreading in OSGi isn't just about improving performance or taking advantage of chip multiprocessors&#151;it's essential to getting something done. To illustrate, in this article I examine issues that can arise when developing applications that must simultaneously manage UI, computation, and network activity, somewhat akin to what iTunes does. In the process, I discuss solutions I developed in terms of a specific class, <i>ThreadManager</i>. The point of <i>ThreadManager</i> isn't necessarily that you should use it&#151;although that would be fine, too&#151;but that it seems a relatively modest amount of reusable code can go a long way toward easing multithreaded programming.</p>

<p>The OSGi unit of composition is a "bundle." Physically, a bundle is a JAR file, but it is not loaded and processed as typical JAR files are. Each bundle is by default isolated from all other bundles; that is, they cannot invoke each other or even share class declarations&#151;even if those declarations are "public." A bundle exports a package it contains via an export declaration in the JAR manifest. Similarly, a bundle declares which packages it requires via an import declaration. OSGi examines these declarations when bundles are loaded to make sure each import is satisfied, exports do not conflict, and so on. This is all managed via a set of delegating classloaders.</p>

<p>Bundles can be started, stopped, loaded, and unloaded all while OSGi is running. This is important for embedded devices that are "always on"&#151;rebooting during "Desperate Housewives" to apply the latest patches just won't do. The OSGi framework tracks dependencies between bundles&#151;for class definitions and services&#151;to coordinate these operations.</p>

<p>Of course, set-top boxes aren't really always on; they tend to get unceremoniously unplugged when being moved or when extension cords get tripped over. Consequently, the state of an OSGi device is generally persistent. When an OSGi device starts, bundles are restored to their previous state, running or stopped. Operations such as installing a bundle are transactional for this same reason.</p>

<p>OSGi has been carefully defined, as an embedded environment, to run on top of reasonably sized J2ME profiles. However, it can also be applied to full J2SE environments. The OSGi bundle model is even being adopted as the basis for Eclipse plug-in management.</p>

<p>While thinking of OSGi as an operating system for running Java programs is a good place to start, it has an important difference from operating systems&#151;OSGi does not provide a thread of execution to each bundle. Events are delivered to bundles through certain interfaces, but no guarantees are made about which thread event delivery occurs on. Generally, event callbacks are required to finish quickly and should not make calls back into the OSGi framework to avoid possible deadlock. It is common, therefore, for bundles to start one or more threads in order to get work done.</p>






<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>The prototype application is designed to perform several tasks in parallel&#151;processing events received via the UI, performing computations required (say, to playback or compress audio), and sending and receiving data over the network. This is a wonderful application for a parallel machine because, well, these operations really can be performed in parallel.</p>

<p>Java supports this kind of parallelism via its threading mechanisms, and so its APIs for most operations, such as IO, are blocking. This isn't the only possible approach; many traditional applications use an event-driven model that can multiplex events from multiple sources, including UI and nonblocking IO facilities. However, while an event loop can give the illusion of doing several things at once, it is really only one event at a time that's being processed. That didn't matter much when a CPU could only do one thing at a time, but Java's approach is better suited to increasing hardware parallelism.</p>

<p>The essential threading requirement imposed by OSGi is that applications keep track of all of these threads operating in parallel. This arises from OSGi's dynamic nature; OSGi wants to be able to start, stop, load, and unload bundles as necessary or as directed. That implies that a bundle must respond to a command to stop, and stopping must be complete: There cannot be threads that are forgotten still tying up resources the bundle was supposed to have released.</p>

<p>This OSGi design arises from its target set-top environment where bundles from various sources&#151;including possibly different vendors&#151;need to cooperate. When building a desktop application on OSGi (possibly transitively, by building first on Eclipse), this level of dynamism might seem excessive. Even a desktop application, however, might be composed of different bundles. It might support plug-ins built by third parties, and any of these might need to be updated. OSGi's dynamism might be essential in embedded devices but it certainly isn't useless on the desktop.</p>






<h3>The Challenge</h3>

<p>I quickly discovered that coordinating the lifetimes of even a small number of threads (read: two) was easy to get wrong. There are the usual issues with state shared between threads; those can be solved with appropriate synchronization mechanisms. Stopping the threads turns out to be the tricky part.</p>

<p>To make things concrete, an OSGi bundle can implement an interface called <i>BundleActivator</i>, which contains just two methods: <i>start()</i> and <i>stop().</i> OSGi calls these methods when the bundle is started or stopped. The general rules for implementing these methods are that they must return quickly, they can be invoked on any thread, and they should avoid doing things that could lead to deadlock. For example, a <i>start()</i> method should not attempt to use the OSGi facility for installing a new bundle because that is a long-running operation. Furthermore, because the level of parallelism in the OSGi implementation is not guaranteed, the installation call might block waiting for the start method to return; because install was called from start, deadlock arises.</p>

<p>The bundle is allowed (assuming security permissions are granted) to spawn new threads. However, the <i>stop()</i> method must guarantee that all of these threads have exited before returning. That's the root of the coordination problem.</p>

<p>What can happen if you get this wrong? Just about anything. The OSGi implementation I was working on was throwing <i>ClassNotFoundException</i> exceptions from classes I'd written when they attempted to access other classes I'd written in the same bundle&#151;which meant it couldn't be a classpath problem. That baffled me until I realized the exception was thrown from a thread in my bundle, which was still running after <i>stop()</i> had returned. The OSGi framework, thinking the bundle was stopped, had disconnected the class loaders for that bundle, causing a later request to load classes to fail. (Remember, class loading in Java is lazy.)</p>






<h3>Problem Solving</h3>

<p>The application I was prototyping needed several threads. I started off by tracking them in an ad hoc manner: Each time I needed a new thread, I created a member field to keep a reference to it and added code to my <i>stop()</i> method to interrupt it, then waited for it via <i>Thread.join</i>().</p>

<p>At first I had only two long-running threads, so this method worked well. Soon, however, I realized I'd need to keep track of a worker thread that was sometimes created and ran only for a short period of time, and a set of threads&#151;the size of which would vary over time&#151;processing I/O. It quickly became apparent just looking at my <i>stop()</i> method implementation that a more structured approach was needed. The code actually might have been correct, but it was too complicated to read and be accurate&#151;a sure sign of trouble.</p>

<p>Fortunately, since I'd started in an ad hoc fashion, I hadn't yet invented any fancy thread-control patterns to pollute my thinking. Instead, I took a look at what worked for the threads I was managing and tried to look for patterns. If I could find a pattern, I could probably factor out some kind of supporting classes to simplify things.</p>

<p>It turns out that the basic pattern for handling threads properly in OSGi has three parts:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Keep track of each thread when you start it.</li>
  <li>Know how to interrupt each thread.</li>
  <li>Wait for each thread to exit when stopping.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Java has <i>Thread.start()</i> for the first item and <i>Thread.join()</i> for the last, but has little to say about how to interrupt a thread. If you're thinking that <i>Thread.interrupt()</i> is the answer, you need to realize that this method only interrupts threads waiting on monitors. It will do nothing for a thread blocked on, say, reading from an <i>InputStream</i>.</p>

<p>I didn't need a concurrency revolution to get this right; I just needed the right decomposition of the problem. The design I came up with centers on a <i>ThreadManager</i> object for handling a set of threads; for instance, as might be created by a particular bundle. It also consists of an abstract class, <i>Interruptible</i>, which extends the standard Java <i>Runnable</i> interface with an <i>interrupt()</i> method. The <i>interrupt()</i> method has to know with certainty how to interrupt each thread.</p>

<p><i>ThreadManager</i> provides two basic operations: <i>run( Interruptible )</i> and <i>stopAll()</i> (see Listing One). The former schedules the <i>Interruptible</i> on a new thread. The latter calls <i>interrupt()</i> on every <i>Interruptible</i> and then <i>join()</i> on every thread. <i>StopAll()</i> doesn't return until every <i>Interruptible</i> passed to <i>run()</i> has exited.</p>

<p>This reduces the code required to properly manage threads within a bundle to just a couple of lines. A call to <i>ThreadManager.run()</i> replaces every call to create, start, and keep a reference to every new thread. A single call to <i>stopAll()</i> guarantees that each is shut down.</p>






<h3>ThreadManager Design Points</h3>

<p>I found many subtle and interesting design points in writing <i>ThreadManager</i>, and probably not all of them.</p>

<p>For instance, the major service provided by the <i>ThreadManager</i> is keeping track of each thread it starts so that they can all be stopped at some later time. This requires nothing more than keeping an accurate list of interruptible objects running on various threads. The list part is easy; the accurate part takes a bit of effort.</p>

<p>Each <i>Interruptible</i> is added to the list of running objects before its assigned <i>Thread</i> is started. This guarantees that once <i>ThreadManager.run()</i> is called for some Interruptible, both <i>run()</i> and <i>interrupt()</i> are called on it. It also makes it possible for <i>interrupt()</i> to be called first.</p>

<p>The second half of this problem is removing each Interruptible from the list when it exits, which happens when the run() method returns. This is handled by scheduling not the Interruptible itself but a private class called <i>ManagedRunnable</i>. <i>ManagedRunnable</i> has a <i>run()</i> method that wraps the call to <i>Interruptible.run()</i> in a <i>try/finally</i> block. The <i>finally</i> clause is invoked when <i>run()</i> returns&#151;whether normally or with an exception&#151;and removes the <i>Interruptible</i> from the list.</p>

<p>The kind of interrupt required varies, depending on what the code in the thread is doing. The <i>Thread.interrupt()</i> method isn't always appropriate. For example, while it will interrupt a thread waiting on <i>Object.wait</i>(), it won't interrupt a thread waiting on <i>ServerSocket.accept().</i> The <i>interrupt()</i> method implementation&#151;which is always called from a thread other than the one on which <i>run()</i> is called&#151;must take appropriate action to interrupt the thread, whatever that might be. My prototype called for three different strategies.</p>

<p>My prototype used SWT for the UI. The application bundle launched a thread on which a loop polled and processed the SWT event queue. The interrupt method for this thread made use of the SWT <i>Display.asyncExec()</i> call to post a "quit" event back to the UI thread, causing that loop to exit. Swing provides similar facilities. Worst case, you could implement your own mechanism for passing the request between threads and check it in the event loop. (In that case, however, you might need a timeout on the call to poll for an event.)</p>

<p>Threads waiting on I/O are even easier; typically, simply closing the stream or socket on which they are waiting is sufficient. The close will cause the <i>read()</i>, <i>accept(),</i> or other call to return with an error. The thread performing the I/O simply needs to exit when this error occurs.</p>

<p>Worker threads performing computation can be the trickiest because there is not a good mechanism for interrupting CPU-bound work from another thread. The only option here is to have the thread periodically check to see if an interrupt bit has been set. It shouldn't do that too often or the overhead will take a toll, but it must do it frequently enough to keep the interrupt responsive.</p>







<h3>Multiple Blockers</h3>

<p>Interrupting a thread can require more than one technique if a thread can be blocked in multiple places. For example, some threads might sometimes be waiting on a monitor and other times on a socket. The <i>interrupt()</i> method must then interrupt both. The <i>run()</i> method must be written to ensure that interrupts cause the method to exit and not block again.</p>

<p>The hardest part of writing an interrupt can be inspecting all the code invoked from the thread's <i>run()</i> method and determining whether it can block and, if so, how to interrupt it. This is particularly hard if that method uses third-party code or libraries that don't clearly document their behavior or dependencies. Although I did not encounter this, it is easy to imagine library calls that are written so as to be essentially uninterruptible. Indeed, adding this kind of thread-specific behavioral information to signatures hints at potentially big requirement changes for those writing reusable code.</p>
<h3>Interrupt  Before Run</h3>

<p>Again, an <i>Interruptible</i> scheduled to run via <i>ThreadManager</i> is guaranteed to have both its <i>run()</i> and <i>interrupt()</i> methods called, but not necessarily in that order. It turns out this is often easier to code correctly than you might think. For example, if a socket connection is open before <i>run()</i> is called, then <i>interrupt()</i> can safely close it; the <i>run()</i> method will find it closed when it is invoked and immediately exit.</p>

<p>Other times, however, <i>interrupt()</i> will have to set a special flag to let <i>run()</i> know that <i>interrupt()</i> has already been called and to avoid proceeding to any blocking code. The first time I got this wrong (I didn't have the flag logic), I briefly considered making a guarantee that <i>run()</i> was always invoked first.</p>

<p>However, what kind of guarantee could I really make? I could have <i>interrupt()</i> block until the <i>runThread</i> had started, but that wasn't sufficient. The thread might start but yield before the first instruction in the <i>run()</i> method, so <i>interrupt()</i> could still be called earlier than expected. The only way to guarantee that <i>run()</i> had accomplished any particular amount of work before <i>interrupt()</i> was called is with synchronization code (wait and notify, for example) inside cooperating <i>run()</i> and <i>interrupt()</i> methods. You can write such code if appropriate, but <i>ThreadManager</i> doesn't have this kind of knowledge and won't do it for you.</p>






<h3>Interrupt After Run</h3>

<p>It is also possible for <i>interrupt()</i> to be called after <i>run()</i> has exited. <i>ThreadManager.stopAll()</i> could check to see if <i>run()</i> has exited before calling <i>interrupt(),</i> but by the time the call to interrupt() actually happens, <i>run()</i> may have exited. In practice, most <i>interrupt()</i> methods perform idempotent actions, such as closing streams. Usually, no special code is required to properly handle this case.</p>


<h3>Interrupting the  Right Thread</h3>

<p>If your <i>interrupt()</i> method does use <i>Thread.interrupt(),</i> you'll need a handle on the thread running the <i>run()</i> method. This is another case where synchronization between <i>run()</i> and <i>interrupt()</i> is necessary&#151;you can't interrupt a thread before it has been created. Here, however, <i>ThreadManager</i> really can help you out.</p>

<p><i>Interruptible</i> defines a method called <i>getRunThread()</i> that returns the thread on which <i>run()</i> has been (or will be) invoked. This is why <i>Interruptible</i> is an abstract class, and not an interface.</p>

<p>The implementation depends on the private field <i>runThread</i> being assigned exactly once when the thread is created. Callers to <i>getRunThread()</i> block until the assignment occurs. <i>ThreadManager</i> arranges to perform this assignment but the field should not otherwise be visible, even to derived classes implementing <i>Interruptible</i>. This is why <i>Interruptible</i> is a nested class within <i>ThreadManager</i>.</p>

<p>To set the <i>runThread</i> field, <i>ThreadManager</i> leverages the nested <i>ManagedRunnable</i> class, mentioned earlier. <i>ManagedRunnable</i> has its own <i>run()</i> method that sets runThread and calls <i>notifyAll()</i> before invoking <i>Interruptible.run().</i></p>





<h3>Interrupt Me  Before I Run Again</h3>

<p>Working with multiple threads is, in a way, like writing transactional database code&#151;you need to think carefully about which operations have to be atomic to preserve the system, yet being too conservative in this regard can make your code inefficient. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as a database is typically handling multiple requests from multiple clients in parallel. If you look at ThreadManager as a miniscule database, the same conditions apply: <i>run()</i> and <i>stopAll()</i> can be called in parallel. What guarantees should be made?</p>

<p>In my prototype application, one worker thread is spawned periodically based on external events, runs for a few hundred milliseconds, and then exits. (Because it takes little time to complete and doesn't block, I even used a null <i>interrupt()</i> method.) Creation of this thread was independent of when my bundle might be stopped; in fact, the two always occurred on different threads. The guarantees wanted as a client of <i>ThreadManager</i> are:</p>



<ul>
  <li>If a call to <i>run()</i> succeeds, then that Interruptible will be stopped by a (possibly simultaneous) call to <i>stopAll</i>().</li>
  <li>If <i>stopAll()</i> is called, no later calls to <i>run()</i> on that <i>ThreadManager</i> succeed.</li>
</ul>



<p>Together, these rules guarantee the necessary transactionality, and thus synchronization, between creating and stopping threads using the same <i>ThreadManager</i> instance. Without them, race conditions could permit new threads created at the same time as <i>stopAll()</i> to continue running after <i>stopAll()</i> returns.</p>

<p>These guarantees are implemented with a Boolean object in <i>ThreadManager</i>, <i>isStopping</i>, that tracks whether a call to <i>stopAll()</i> has started. Once set, subsequent calls to <i>run()</i> fail. It is important that synchronization is performed on this variable and that <i>run()</i> and <i>stopAll()</i> are not themselves synchronized. If they were, calls to <i>run()</i> would block while <i>stopAll()</i> was executing. Because <i>stopAll()</i> could be stopping a thread calling <i>run(),</i> deadlock could result.</p>






<h3>Interrupted  Exceptions</h3>

<p>Prior to this multithreading exercise, <i>InterruptedException</i> had always been a bit of a mystery to me. Was it really needed? Why? What should I do with it? Sample code frequently ignores it. Even Doug Lea didn't really seem to know what to do with it in <i>Concurrent Programming in Java</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2000).</p>

<p><i>ThreadManager</i> gives a clear answer to these questions: <i>InterruptedException</i> must be obeyed&#151;not ignored. The exception is thrown when a thread should exit posthaste. Ignoring it is almost certainly the wrong thing to do. Certainly <i>ThreadManager</i> won't work properly if you do. Proper operation of <i>ThreadManager</i> requires that threads exit when requested. If they don't, calls to <i>stopAll()</i> won't return.</p>

<p>The same applies to other exceptions, such as <i>IOExceptions</i>, which might indicate interruptions. These cases have always seemed more obvious to me; after all, there is often little one can do after receiving an exception on a socket. <i>InterruptedException</i> has always carried that temptation to try again.</p>

<p>Consistent with this advice, <i>ThreadManager</i> itself will break out of a call to <i>stopAll()</i> if it gets interrupted. Is this the right thing to do? It would seem to depend on the situation&#151;something only the caller can know. When handling exceptions, deferring up the call stack generally seems like the right solution.</p>









<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>My prototyping experience convinced me that, ultimately, getting used to multithreaded programming is going to be a big change. It won't necessarily mean the use of new languages or even new skills. It will require consistent attention to parallelism as a new axis along which things must be made to work and can go wrong.</p>

<p>I suspect the database folks have a real advantage in this concurrency revolution. Unlike most applications, the shared-state nature of databases has meant scaling up to additional users was never as easy as adding racks of additional, yet essentially independent, machines. Databases are already quite good at exploiting true machine parallelism.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, database designers have had to consider issues of concurrency, isolation, and deadlock for every line of code they have written. Soon, this requirement will apply to all of us. It doesn't mean we have to rewrite everything from the ground up, but it could mean we'll have to reconsider every library we use to ask questions about how it will operate (or fail) in a multithreaded world.</p>
