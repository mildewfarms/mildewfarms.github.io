<p>There are several files I need to access and update from practically any computer I use&#151;my web browser favorites, contact lists, web-site passwords, and my .NET programming tips. Although I keep these files on a flash drive, it's not always convenient to take the drive everywhere I go. I'd rather store the files on a server and access them over the Internet, as long as it's reliable, secure, and inexpensive. Xdrive.com offers 5 GB of Internet-accessible storage, but the $10.00 monthly fee is more than I pay for hosting my entire web site. Fortunately, Amazon's S3 web service offers secure Internet file access at modest prices. Additionally, .NET 2.0's FtpWebRequest class offers access by programs to FTP sites. In this article, I show how to use S3 and FtpWebRequest to securely synchronize files on multiple machines.</p>

<p>To illustrate, I use Visual Studio 2005 to develop a sample application named "Synchronize Files" (available at <a href="http://www.ddj.com/code/">http://www.ddj.com/code/</a>). You can build it with Visual Studio 2005 or Visual C# 2005 Express Edition (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualcsharp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualcsharp</a>). This program encrypts files for security, and compresses them to conserve bandwidth and storage space. It takes advantage of the Microsoft Enterprise Library for cryptography, logging, and exception management.</p>


<h3>Building and Running The Sample App</h3>

<p>The sample app uses the Cryptography, Exception Handling, and Logging "Application Blocks" from the January 2006 Microsoft Enterprise Library for .NET Framework 2.0. Before building the app, download the Enterprise Library (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/entlib2.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/entlib2.asp</a>) and run the install. After installing the library, specify an encryption key to encrypt/decrypt your files. To specify your key, first ensure the sample app's app.config file is writable. Run the Enterprise Library Configuration program. Select File/Open Application and open the sample app's app.config file. Right-click the Symmetric Provider on the left and select Remove. Then right-click Symmetric Providers and select New/Symmetric Algorithm Provider. Select RijndaelManaged and press OK. Make sure the Create a New Key radio button is selected, then click Next. Click the Generate button, then Next. Specify the key file path and press Next. Specify the data-protection mode and press Finish. On the right, change the Name from "RijndaelManaged" to "Symmetric Provider," which is the name the sample app expects. Finally, select File/Save Application.</p>

<p>Now it's time to build the app. Open SynchronizeFiles.sln in Visual Studio 2005, build the app, and run it. Select Options/Settings and select the S3 or FTP radio button to specify where your files will be stored. If you're using S3, enter the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key you received when signing up. Then press Get Canonical User ID and your Canonical User ID and Display Name is filled in. For an FTP site, first use an FTP program to create a folder on the FTP site for your home directory. Then go back to Synchronize Files and enter the FTP site (ftp://upload.comcast.net, for instance), the home directory you created, and your User ID and Password.</p>

<p>After entering your configuration information, press OK. Click the New button to create a bucket (folder) to hold your files. Then click Upload to upload your files. When files are selected by checking the checkbox in the DataGridView's leftmost column (Figure 1), they can be downloaded or deleted. When you press the Synchronize button, all files with a check in the Synchronize column are uploaded to the server if they've changed on the local machine. </p>

<h3>Amazon S3</h3>

<p>The S3 web service (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s3">http://www.amazon.com/s3</a>) costs $0.15 per month per GB of storage, and $0.20 per GB of data transferred. If you already have an Amazon account, your existing account is billed. The price is reasonable; so far I've run up a $0.03 bill. All calls to S3 go over an encrypted SSL connection (although you can use a nonSSL connection for debugging or troubleshooting). When signing up for S3, you are assigned an Access Key ID that identifies you in every S3 call. Your Access Key ID is not secret. You are also given a Secret Access Key that creates a signature that authenticates you.</p>

<p>S3 organizes data in "buckets" that are similar to disk folders. Although individual S3 users can have no more than 100 buckets, each bucket can hold an unlimited number of objects. Unlike disk folders, buckets cannot contain other buckets&#151;just objects. Objects are blobs of data from 1 byte to 5 GB. Each object in a given bucket is identified by a unique key. Although my sample app only grants you access to the objects it stores, the S3 API lets you grant access to other users via access-control lists. See <i>S3DataTransfer.AccessControlList</i> in the sample app source code for an example of an access-control list. You can grant yourself access to an object with an access-control list containing either the e-mail address you use for your Amazon account, or your Canonical User ID. I use my Canonical User ID because my e-mail address doesn't work (because my Amazon account somehow ended up with multiple passwords). You can determine your Canonical User ID and display name by calling the <i>ListAllMyBuckets</i> method and inspecting the <i>Owner.ID</i> and <i>Owner.DisplayName</i> properties in the response object. That's how the Options/Settings dialog box does it.</p>

<p>To use S3 in a Visual Studio 2005 application, add a web reference to http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/AmazonS3.wsdl. Download the "Amazon S3 Library for SOAP" in C# from Amazon's S3 Resource Center. Add the AWSAuthConnection.cs and AWSDateConnection.cs files to your project. You'll need to add a <i>using</i> statement to the AWSAuthConnection.cs file that points to the web service proxy that you created when you added the web reference. See the sample app's version of AWSAuthConnection.cs for an example of this. Synchronize Files uses the <i>AWSAuthConnection</i> class to make all of its S3 calls because it takes care of all the security details.</p>

<p>Reading through the <i>S3DataTransfer</i> source code, you notice a few S3 API quirks. Currently the <i>AWSAuthConnection.createBucket</i> method always returns a null response object, even when it successfully creates the bucket. That's why <i>S3DataTransfer.CreateBucket</i> calls <i>S3DataTransfer.BucketExists</i> to determine if the bucket was created. Another quirk is that <i>AWSAuthConnection.put</i> stores a string, but <i>AWSAuthConnection.get</i> retrieves a byte array. To overcome this asymmetry, <i>S3DataTransfer.UploadBuffer</i> converts its byte array into a string using <i>UTF8Encoding.GetString</i>. When that byte array is subsequently retrieved using <i>AWSAuthConnection.get</i> in <i>S3DataTransfer.DownloadBuffer</i>, the byte array will be identical to the one previously stored.</p>








<h3>FtpWebRequest</h3>

<p>Although the S3 fees are not high, if you already have access to an FTP site, you may prefer to host your files there. But beware! Unless your FTP site is running over SSL, your FTP credentials (user ID and password) are transmitted over the Internet in plaintext, and can be intercepted and abused by bad guys. This vulnerability applies to every program that uses the FTP protocol, not just the sample app. You can see this vulnerability with Packetyzer, a freely available network analysis program (<a href="http://www.networkchemistry.com/products/packetyzer.php">http://www.networkchemistry.com/products/packetyzer.php</a>). Start a network capture in Packetyzer. Then use Synchronize Files to download a file from an FTP site. You'll see a trace like the following in Packetyzer:</p>

<pre class="code">

 USER fredjones
 ..UR..331 Password required for fredjones.
 PASS fredspassword
 ...e..230 User fredjones logged in.
 
</pre>

<p>Bad guys monitoring packets on any of the machines through which the transfer travels will be able to capture your credentials. Scary! Although the sample app can't prevent this vulnerability, it encrypts your files before uploading them to the FTP site, and decrypts them only after they've been downloaded to your machine. Consequently, there's little risk that bad guys could decrypt your files by intercepting them during transfers, or by downloading them directly from your FTP site. </p>

<p>.NET 2.0 provides native FTP access with <i>FtpWebRequest</i>, but this class is little more than a thin wrapper over the FTP protocol. See <i>FTPDataTransfer</i> for examples of using the <i>FtpWebRequest</i> to synchronize files between the user's machine and an FTP site. <i>FTPDataTransfer.GetFtpWebRequest</i> (Listing One) returns an <i>FtpWebRequest</i> object. The <i>KeepAlive</i> property is set to False to ensure that the connection to the FTP server is closed after every FTP operation. If this isn't done, some FTP operations may fail, depending on the FTP command that was previously executed, and the server's FTP software. Although the <i>KeepAlive = false</i> setting allows arbitrary command sequences to succeed, creating a new FTP connection for each operation is slow. Furthermore, your FTP credentials will be sent to establish each new connection. <i>GetFtpWebRequest</i> includes a <i>Method</i> parameter that specifies the FTP operation that will be performed. There are several FTP operations including <i>UploadFile</i>, <i>DownloadFile</i>, <i>DeleteFile</i>, <i>ListDirectory</i>, and so on. Finally, the <i>UseBinary</i> property should be set to True. Otherwise, binary files will not be correctly transferred.</p>

<p><i>FTPTransfer.DownloadBuffer</i> calls <i>GetFtpWebRequest</i> to download a file's contents (Listing One). First the <i>EncodeName</i> method is called to convert the bucket name and file name into characters that FTP supports. Then <i>GetFtpWebRequest</i> is called with the FTP address of the file that will be downloaded, and the <i>DownloadFile</i> method. <i>GetResponse</i> is called to access the <i>FtpWebRequest</i>'s response stream. The contents of the file are then read from the stream using a <i>BinaryReader</i>. After the stream is closed, the file's contents are returned. When a file is uploaded to an FTP site, its contents are written to the <i>FtpWebRequest</i>'s request stream (see <i>FTPTransfer.UploadBuffer</i> for details).</p>







<h3>The DataTransfer Abstract Class</h3>

<p>Synchronize Files uses the <i>DataTransfer</i> abstract class to transfer files to and from S3 or an FTP site. The <i>DataTransfer</i> class includes nonabstract methods such as <i>UploadFile</i> that are independent of the transfer mechanism (S3 or FTP), and abstract methods such as <i>UploadBuffer</i> that are totally dependent on the transfer mechanism, and implemented in the <i>S3DataTransfer</i> and <i>FTPDataTransfer</i> classes. The sample app is able to transfer files using a <i>DataTransfer</i> object, without having to be aware of the differences between S3 and FTP.</p>

<p><i>DataTransfer</i> maintains metadata for each file that is uploaded to the server. The metadata includes an SHA1 hash of the file's contents. This hash is a 160-bit binary number that is computed from the file's contents. Because it is extremely unlikely that two different files will have the same hash, the hash is used to avoid unnecessary file transfers. If the user requests a file download, the file will only be downloaded if the server's copy has a different hash than the local file. And a file will only be uploaded if its hash differs from the hash of the corresponding server file. The sample app also uses the hash to detect file corruption. When a file is downloaded, the sample app knows the file's contents have changed due to corruption or sabotage if its hash differs from the one stored on the server. To compute a hash from an array of bytes, instantiate an <i>SHA1Managed</i> object and call its <i>ComputeHash</i> method.</p>

<p><i>DataTransfer</i> compresses and encrypts all files uploaded to the S3 or FTP server, and decrypts and decompresses all downloaded files. The <i>Serialization</i> class does the compression/decompression and encryption/decryption. For example, Synchronize Files calls <i>Serialization.ObjectToBase64String</i> (Listing Two) to compress and encrypt a file prior to uploading it. First the <i>ObjectValue</i> parameter is serialized to a <i>MemoryStream</i> using a <i>BinarySerializer</i>. The serialized data is extracted from the <i>MemoryStream</i> into a byte array. The byte array is then compressed using the <i>Compression</i> class. Thanks to the Enterprise Library's Cryptography Application Block, encrypting the byte array is just a simple call to <i>Cryptographer.EncryptSymmetric</i>. Decryption is just as easy, just a call to <i>Cryptographer.DecryptSymmetric</i>. In addition to simplifying encryption and decryption, the Cryptography application block decouples the cryptography algorithm from the code that uses it. The sample app is configured to use the Rijndael algorithm, but a different algorithm can be substituted with no code changes. Just run the Enterprise Library Configuration program. Select File/Open Application and open the sample app's app.config file. Right-click the Symmetric Provider and select Remove. Then right-click Symmetric Providers and select New/Symmetric Algorithm Provider. Specify a different algorithm (say, <i>TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider</i>), create a key, specify a key file path, and specify the data-protection mode. Finally, change the name of the TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider on the right to Symmetric Provider.</p>

<p>Encrypting your files is useless if a bad guy gets hold of your private key. That's why the Cryptography Applicaton Block encrypts keys using DPAPI. This makes the key useless on any machine other than the one on which it was originally encrypted. This extra level of security makes it less convenient to transfer your key to other machines, which is exactly what you'll need to do if you intend to run Synchronize Files on multiple computers. To transfer a key to another machine, first make sure your key file is writable. Then run the Enterprise Library Configuration program, select File/Open Application, and open the sample app's app.config file. Right-click the Symmetric Provider on the left and select Export key. Specify a filename and a password for the exported key and press OK. Then copy the exported key file to the second machine. On the second machine, run the Enterprise Library Configuration program. Remove the Symmetric Provider on the left. Right-click Symmetric Providers on the left and select New/Symmetric Algorithm Provider. Choose RijndaelManaged and press OK. Then select the "Import a password-protected key file" radio button and press Next. Choose the exported key file and enter the password you used to encrypt it. Click Next and specify where the imported key file should be stored. After completing the key import process, change the Name field on the right to Symmetric Provider.</p>

<p>The <i>Compression</i> class (Listing Three) uses the .NET 2.0 <i>GZipStream</i> class to compress and decompress files. <i>Compression.Compress</i> instantiates a <i>MemoryStream</i> and associates it with a <i>GZipStream</i> with a <i>CompressionMode</i> of compress. When a byte array is written into the <i>GZipStream</i>, then retrieved using the <i>MemoryStream</i>'s <i>GetBuffer</i> method, it is compressed. Attempting to compress very small files, or already compressed files such as Zip or JPEG files, will tend to result in larger, not smaller, files.</p>

<p>The <i>DataTransfer</i> class includes two methods&#151;<i>EncodeName</i> and <i>DecodeName</i>&#151;that relax restrictions in S3 and FTP bucket and file names. For example, S3 Bucket Names currently only allow ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. This is a surprising restriction considering the popularity of Unicode for web-service text encoding. The sample application can handle bucket names and filenames with no restrictions because <i>EncodeName</i> converts unsupported characters to supported characters, and <i>DecodeName</i> does the reverse. This lets the sample application display bucket and filenames in high market-share languages such as Chinese.</p>

<p><i>DataTransfer</i> the Enterprise Library's Logging Application Block to log file transfers and errors. The log file is named trace.log and is stored in the same folder as the .exe. Most messages go to this log file. Serious errors are sent to the system event log that you can inspect by going to Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Event Viewer. The Logging Block provides two major advantages to applications that use it: </p>







<h3>Log Messages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It's simple to create detailed and informative logs with a minimal amount of code:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="code">

protected void Log(string Category, string Message)
{
    LogEntry logEntry = new LogEntry();
    logEntry.Categories.Add(Category);
    logEntry.Title    = Application.ProductName;
    logEntry.EventId  = ++eventId;
    logEntry.Priority = 0;
    logEntry.Message  = Message;
    logEntry.ExtendedProperties.Add("Protocol", ProtocolName());
    Logger.Write(logEntry);
}


</pre>
<ul>
  <li>No coding is necessary to specify the destination of the log messages. A simple configuration change will route the log messages to a flat file, a database, an e-mail address, the system event log, and so on. You can even filter messages based on their category or priority with a configuration change.</li>
  <li>	    The sample app leverages the Enterprise Library's Exception Handling Application Block to manage exceptions. This application block lets you create named exception policies in a configuration file and use the policies in source code:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="code">

catch (Exception ex)
{
  if (ExceptionPolicy.HandleException(ex, "policy"))
  {
     throw;
  }
}

</pre>
<p>The effect of this code depends on the configuration file. The policy can specify that the exception is rethrown, replaced with a different exception, wrapped in another exception, or logged. If the exception should be thrown, <i>HandleException</i> will return True.</p>

<p>The S3 web service is a simple way to store and retrieve data over the Internet. But if you already have access to an FTP site and can live with the security drawbacks, you can use the .NET 2.0 <i>FtpWebRequest</i> class instead. In either case, the .NET 2.0 <i>GZipStream</i> class is a convenient way to compress data to conserve bandwidth and storage space. The Microsoft Enterprise Library contains some invaluable Application Blocks that simplify application development, and let many important modifications be accomplished with configuration updates rather than code changes. The cryptography, logging, and Exception Handling Application Blocks simplified the sample app's design and coding. I recommend you download the Enterprise Library and familiarize yourself with all of its capabilities.
