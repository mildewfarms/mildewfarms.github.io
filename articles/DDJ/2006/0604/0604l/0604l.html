<p>The Eclipse Foundation has released the Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) 1.0. Eclipse WTP 1.0 is an extensible, Standards-based tool platform for developing J2EE and web applications. WTP has already been adopted by BEA, Borland, IBM, JBoss, and ObjectWeb. This full version release solidifies the platform API for third-party extension, and accompanying documentation improvements make WTP ready for the next-level of vendor adoption. This release focuses on two of the three major goals outlined in the WTP roadmap&#151;defining the WTP API and keeping current with the underlying Eclipse platform. Future releases will focus more on the third roadmap goal of currency with Standards like Java 5.0 and WSDL 2.0. </p>

<p>Helixoft has released VBdocman .NET 2.2, an add-in for Visual Studio .NET 2002/2003/2005. This program lets you generate technical documentation from Visual Basic .NET and ASP .NET projects with a few mouse clicks. VBdocman parses the source-code files and automatically creates the table of contents, index, topics, cross-reference, IntelliSense information, and context-sensitive help. You can also use VBdocman to add C#, XML, or JavaDoc comments to the source code via the WYSIWYG comment editor, which enables you to insert tables, lists, pictures, links, and other formatting elements directly to the code. VBdocman compiles documentation into a fully customizable HTML Help, Microsoft Help 2, HTML, RTF document, or XML file.</p>

<p>TulaSoft has released SQL Examiner 1.2, a database synchronization tool for automatically moving changes from development databases to production servers. Its engine compares objects of different hierarchy and builds a script for a fast and accurate synchronization. Stripped of the service code, the synchronization script is easy to modify for your specific needs. SQL Examiner 1.2 passes over noncritical tasks to provide higher synchronization speed while maintaining accuracy. SQL Examiner 1.2 compares and synchronizes different SQL versions; supports SQL 2005 Server, including new data types, indexes, schemas, and triggers; supports synchronization of privileges and user roles, and synchronization of a back up copy (before extracting), detached database and snapshots; and supports partial synchronization and exclusion of dependents.</p>
