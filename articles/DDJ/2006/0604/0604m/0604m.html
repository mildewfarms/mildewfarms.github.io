<h2>Tip #8: Run from Runtime Exceptions (and Errors)</h2>



<I></I>

<hr>





<p>Here we go. Avoid unchecked (runtime) exceptions and errors unless absolutely necessary. For me, following my own advice means giving up my old bar buddies <i>IllegalArgumentException</i> and <i>IllegalStateException</i>. Sound crazy? Joshua Bloch, author of <i>Effective Java</i> would say so.</p>

<p>This is a controversial tip, but I stand by it. Let me begin by explaining both arg types:</p>

<p>Individualist-clean-freaks say: Throwing too many checked exceptions clutters up the API and also makes it harder to use. Plus, the appropriate runtime exception already exists; why not use it? API users must handle try/catches constantly. What a pain! Plus, it slows down your app. Checked exceptions suck.</p>

<p>Socialist-do-gooders say: It's important to declare what can go wrong explicity and force people to consider how to handle specific cases. This encourages the construction of a more bullet-proof application. Throwing an unchecked exception doesn't give people a chance to consider the appropriate response to an error until it happens&#151;when the thing is actually running (or being tested). Then, it may be too late.</p>

<p>To the dismay of libertarians everywhere, put me in the socialist-do-it-righter camp on this one. But there's more here than meets the eye.</p>

<p>Think about it. "Forcing" someone to deal with your checked exception actually is giving them a choice (libertarians breath easier now), while throwing unchecked exceptions destroys exception handling free-will by ensuring there's no alternative.</p>

<p>Running from runtime exceptions primarily applies to static typed languages like Java. Lisp and Ruby folks would laugh at such grade-school advice, but as a general rule, it's safest to use checked exceptions. In Java, this means always throwing subclasses of <i>java.lang.Exception</i>.</p>

<p>In the rare event that an exception thrower is sure that the application must die, only then should they murder it with a runtime exception. Bill Venners summarizes this pretty well in his article "Designing With Exceptions" (JavaWorld, July 1998; <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-07-1998/jw-07-techniques.html">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-07-1998/jw-07-techniques.html</a>):</p>

<p>In general, you should throw an exception and and never throw errors. <i>Error</i>, a subclass of <i>Throwable</i>, is intended for drastic problems, such as <i>OutOfMemoryError</i>, which would be reported by the JVM itself. On occasion, an error, such as <i>java.awt.AWTError</i>, could be thrown by the Java API. In your code, however, you should restrict yourself to throwing exceptions (subclasses of class <i>Exception</i>). Leave the errors to the big guys.</p>



<p>Think twice before catching subclasses of <i>Error</i> or <i>RuntimeException</i>. If the pitcher was careful enough to throw a <i>Runtime</i> or <i>Error</i> exception type, then what could possibly make higher-level catchers confident enough to process it and continue on as if all is okay (such as in an <i>OutofMemoryError</i>)?</p>
