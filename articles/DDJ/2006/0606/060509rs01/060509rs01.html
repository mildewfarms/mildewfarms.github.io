<p>Visual C++ 2005 expands support for developing components and applications that run on a virtual machine with garbage collection using C++/CLI (the Common Language Infrastructure). C++/CLI is an extension of the C++ programming language that adds features such as properties, events, garbage collection, and generics for all types including existing Standard C++ classes.</p>

<p>Visual C++ 2005 supports the .NET Framework Common Language Runtime (CLR), Microsoft's implementation of a garbage-collected virtual machine. The C++ syntax supported in Visual C++ 2005 for .NET programming has evolved significantly from the managed extensions for C++ introduced in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003. Managed extensions for C++ are still supported but have been deprecated in favor of the new syntax. Visual C++ 2005 also adds new features for native programming, including targeting 64-bit processor architectures and new library functions with improved security, </p>

<p>In this article, I examine C++ programs that are minimally ported to this new environment using managed extensions. This involves porting an existing legacy system to this environment [1] with minimal effort (a common approach by understaffed and overworked software maintenance teams). The purpose is to determine whether these programs are still susceptible to the buffer overflow vulnerabilities that have plagued C and C++ programs [2]. </p>

<p>Listing One prompts users for a username and password. Regardless of the username, the program only accepts "NCC-1701" as a valid password. If the user fails to enter the proper password, the program exits. (This program is intended as a test for vulnerabilities in C++/CLI code and not as an exemplar of how to handle passwords.) </p>

  Listing One

<p>Execution starts on line 21 in <i>main().</i> The program prompts for a username on lines 25 and 26 using a combination of <i>puts()</i> and <i>gets(),</i> resulting in an unbounded string copy from standard input into the <i>buff</i> character array declared on line 4. This is one of two locations in the program where a buffer overflow vulnerability can occur. The <i>checkpassword()</i> function is called from line 27 of <i>main().</i> The <i>checkpassword()</i> function prompts users for a password on lines 12 and 13, also using a combination of <i>puts()/gets()</i>. This second call to <i>gets()</i> can also result in a buffer overflow in the password character array defined on the stack. </p>

<p>The program is compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 with the buffer security check option disabled (<i>/GS-</i>) and managed extensions enabled (<i>/clr</i>). The buffer security check is enabled by default, and it is generally a bad idea to disable it (as this example demonstrates). The <i>/clr</i> setting allows mixed assemblies consisting of managed and unmanaged code.</p>

<p>There are several warnings during the build process that are ignored; for example, "warning C4996: 'gets' was declared deprecated" and "warning C4996: 'strcpy' was declared deprecated." The compiler recommends using <i>gets_s()</i> instead of <i>gets()</i> and <i>strcpy_s()</i> instead of <i>strcpy().</i> If these replacement functions are used properly, the possibility of buffer overflow would be eliminated [3]. However, these are only warnings and can be ignored (or even disabled). Ignoring these warnings is consistent with the scenario of minimally porting an existing legacy system.</p>

<p>When using managed extensions, the compiler generates Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) (renamed the Common Intermediate Language or CIL as part of the standardization process) for <i>main()</i> and for the <i>checkpassword()</i> functions. The CIL bytecodes are packaged into an executable that invokes the just-in-time compiler (JIT) to translate these bytecodes into native assembly instructions and then transfers control to <i>main().</i></p>





<p>When executed, the program first prompts for a username:</p>


<pre class="code">
Enter user name:
rcs

</pre>
<p>The program prompts users for a password, which is read into the password variable declared on line 11 as an automatic array of 10 characters. In Example 1, if you examine the data starting at the address of the array on the stack (<i>0x002DF3D4</i>, in this example) before the password is read from standard input, you can see the storage allocated for password (shown in bold) and the return address on the stack (shown in red). The return address is Little Endian.</p>

<p>By providing more characters than can fit in the storage allocated for the password character array, an attacker can overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address with the address of shellcode (arbitrary code inserted into memory by the attacker). For the purpose of this example, we'll assume this code has already been injected in a separate operation (that does not need to involve a buffer overflow or other vulnerability) and is located at <i>0x00408130</i>. To execute arbitrary code, the attacker need only enter the following string as the password:</p>

<pre class="code">

Enter 8 character password:
123456789012345678900|@

</pre>
<p>This input string is copied into the password character array, overflowing the buffer and overwriting memory up to and including the return address. The three characters in the <i>0|@ </i>string overwrite the first three bytes of the return address. The last byte of the return address is overwritten by a null-termination character as a result of the <i>gets()</i> function. Notice that if the null byte were located anywhere but in the last byte, it would be impossible to copy the entire string because the <i>gets()</i> function interprets the null character as the end of the string. So why these three characters? The hexadecimal representation of these characters provides the values required to represent the address in memory. The ASCII hexadecimal code for "<i>0</i>" is <i>0x30</i>, "<i>|</i>" is <i>0x81</i>, and "<i>@</i>" is <i>0x40.</i> By concatenating these three characters in the order { '0', '|', '@' }, you can write the Little Endian representation of the address of the shellcode (<i>0x00408130</i>) into memory. Again, the final null byte is supplied by the null termination byte for the string (see Example 2).</p>

<p>When the <i>checkpassword()</i> function returns, control is passed to the shellcode instead of returning to the original return address in the <i>main()</i> function.</p>

<p>To simplify the exploit, buffer security checks using the <i>/GS</i> option were disabled. If this option had not been disabled, the compiler would have inserted a canary after any array (buffer) declared on the stack; see Figure 1.</p>

Figure 1: Canary-based buffer overflow protection.
</div>
</div>



<p>To overwrite the return address (EIP), base pointer (EBP), or other values in a stack frame protected by a canary using an unbounded string copy operation such as  <i>gets()</i> or <i>strcpy()</i>, an attacker would need to first overwrite the canary. If the canary is modified, an error is generated when the function returns and the attack will fail (unless the goal of the attack is a denial of service). It is possible to defeat the canary by brute force, predicting the value, or other means. However, the difficulty of launching a successful exploit increases. </p>





<p>Enabling the <i>/GS</i> option does not make programs completely immune to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Buffer overflows in the stack can still crash the program, and the possibility still exists for attackers to exploit a stack-based overflow to execute arbitrary code even with the <i>/GS</i> flag enabled. More importantly, the <i>/GS</i> flag cannot detect buffer overflows in either the heap or data segments. </p>

<p>To illustrate, Listing Two presents the previous example program rewritten to use the Win32 GUI. This program provides a menu bar with some simple options, including a File menu with two menu options: "Login" and "Exit." The Login command prompts the user for a password using a dialog window. Once the password is entered, the user presses the "OK" button and the password is checked against the recorded password. </p>

<p>The program is compiled and tested in the same environment except that the Unicode character set is specified and the buffer security check option (<i>/GS</i>) is enabled. We continue to use managed extensions (that is, Common Language Runtime support). The program builds cleanly without error. </p>

<p>This is a relatively simple program, although it is somewhat longer because of the code required to support the Windows GUI. There are several variables of interest from lines 17-20. The <i>lpszPassword</i> variable is an initialized static variable consisting of 16 wide characters (32 bytes). Following this variable is the <i>userP</i> pointer and two unsigned integers: <i>userNameLen</i> and <i>userPasswordLen</i>. After <i>userP</i> is initialized on line 33, these variables have the following addresses: </p>



<pre class="code">
&amp;lpszPassword = 0x0040911C
&amp;userP =   0x0040913C
&amp;userNameLen =  0x00409140
&amp;userPasswordLen =   0x00409144

</pre>
<p><i>userP</i> is <i>0x00554D30</i>. <i>userNameLen</i> is <i>0x00000010</i>. <i>userPasswordLen</i> is <i>0xffffffff</i>. If we examine memory starting at the address of <i>lpszPassword,</i> we can clearly see the initial values for these variables (Example 3). </p>


<div>

<pre class="code">
0040911C   <font color="#00FF00">30 00 31 00 32 00 33 00 34 00 35 00 36 00 37 00</font>

<div class="caption">
Example 3: Memory starting at the address of lpszPassword.
</div>
</div>


<p>The vulnerability in this program is in the call to <i>SendDlgItemMessage</i> on lines 118-123. The EM_GETLINE message specifies that a line of text from the edit control IDC_EDIT1 (the text edit box in the Login dialog) is copied to the fixed-length buffer <i>lpszPassword</i>. This buffer has sufficient space for 15 Unicode characters and a trailing null word. If more than 15 characters are input, a buffer overflow occurs. If 20 characters are entered, the 17th and 18th characters overwrite <i>userP</i>. The 19th and 20th characters overwrite <i>userNameLen</i>, and the trailing null word overwrites <i>userPasswordLen</i>. </p>

<p>Assuming that both <i>userP</i> and <i>userNameLen</i> are overwritten, an arbitrary memory write occurs on line 124 when <i>userNameLen</i> is assigned to the address stored in <i>userP</i> + 4 (the offset of <i>len</i> within <i>struct</i> user). By overwriting an address to which control is eventually transferred, attackers can take advantage of an arbitrary memory write to transfer control to arbitrary code. In this example, the return address on the stack is overwritten. Because the <i>lpszGuestPassword</i> variable is declared as an automatic variable in the <i>GetPassword</i> function, you can examine memory starting from the address of this variable.</p>





<p>Assuming that <i>lpszGuestPassword</i> is located at <i>0x002DEB9C</i>, you can examine the contents of the stack by examining memory at this location. Through debugging the example program or by trial and error, it is possible to determine that the return code of <i>0x004f3a99</i> is located at the address <i>0x002DEBD0</i> in the stack (see Example 4). </p>

<p>The bytes shown in red illustrate where the return code on the stack has been overwritten with the value of the address code. No other bytes on the stack (including the canary) are modified, making this attack undetectable by the runtime system. As a result, control is passed to the shellcode when the <i>GetPassword()</i> function returns.</p>

<p>This second case is interesting for a variety of reasons. First, it demonstrates that the return address on the stack can still be overwritten&#151;even with buffer security checks (<i>/GS</i> flag) enabled, as these checks only mitigate overflows for automatic buffers declared on the stack. Second, it shows that a program can compile cleanly without warning in the Visual Studio 2005 environment and still be vulnerable. Listing Three eliminates the buffer overflow. Before sending the message, the first word of <i>lpszPassword</i> must be set to the size, in TCHARs, of the buffer. For Unicode text, this is the number of characters. The size in the first word is overwritten by the copied line. Also, for edit controls the copied line does not contain a terminating null character. The return value (the number of TCHARs copied) must be used to null-terminate the string.</p>


<pre class="code">
LRESULT Retval;
*((WORD *)(&amp;lpszPassword)) = (sizeof(lpszPassword)/sizeof(TCHAR))-1;
Retval = SendDlgItemMessage(hDlg, IDC_EDIT1, EM_GETLINE, 
  (WPARAM) 0,       // line 0     
  (LPARAM) lpszPassword
);
lpszPassword[Retval]='\0';</pre>
