The C# Toolkit 2.0 includes generic type parameters and an expanded data structure family over the previous release. It has more than 50 algorithms designed for use with collections and C# native arrays of objects. In addition, there are generic algorithms that can be adapted using function objects and predicates to solve most collection-processing problems. The toolkit also adds two new data structures to its family, LinkedHashMap and LinkedHashSet, thus extending its already rich variety of data structures. www.recursionsw.com</p>

<h2>Productive Software Systems</h2>

<p>Productive Software Systems has released Version 3.0 of its Robot source-code search engine. Robot is a source code and text cross-referencing tool that differs from other string-searching tools by maintaining a database of specific references within text and source-code files. It provides fast online inquiry to those references and the files that contain them. You can specify how references or items are constructed by the Robot parsing utility for each language processed. Robot supports languages and report writers whose source files are stored as text files, including C, C++, Cobol, Oracle, Fortran, RPG, Pascal, and SQL. Robot is currently supported on HP-UX and will soon be released for Solaris. www.prodsoft.com</p>
