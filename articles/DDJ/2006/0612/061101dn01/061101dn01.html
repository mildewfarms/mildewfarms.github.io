<h2>McObject</h2>

<p>McObject has released Perst Lite, a micro-footprint version of its  Perst open source, object-oriented embedded database. Perst Lite targets embedded systems and intelligent devices developed on the Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME). Perst Lite generates object serialization and de-serialization code for the application that incorporates the database. This code replaces reflection, but without the complexity and large runtime code footprint that caused reflection to be dropped from J2ME. <br>
