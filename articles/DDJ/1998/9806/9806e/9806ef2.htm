DB-9 matrix of serial connectors is at upper left, built atop the Sexbar hardware; Vixbar is at lower left cabled to patch panel on far right; Auxbar is the large two-board stack. (b) The Hub, a folding assembly with the prototyping area (nexus) opened for service. The exposed layer is all New Micros 2&amp;times;4 I/O boards bussed together with 34-pin ribbon; the Hub processor itself is underneath this panel.
