<p>General Software has announced Version 4.1 of its Embedded BIOS, which initializes an industrial PC or embedded target, then boots Windows CE from ROM, Flash, or disk. Third-party loader or launcher software or DOS is not required to boot Windows CE. The Embedded BIOS architecture offers capabilities such as a built-in debugger that can be used to check-out address and data paths, memory, and Flash components. Manufacturing Mode allows the system's disk drives and Flash disks to be managed remotely, and permits the BIOS or Windows CE to be re-Flashed in the system over a standard RS-232 connection to a host PC. Remote console redirection offers the ability to redirect traditional keyboard and screen I/O over an RS-232 connection to a host PC running terminal emulation software, making it possible to debug targets without keyboards or screens. Embedded BIOS comes with a royalty-free copy of Embedded DOS-ROM, the company's run-from-ROM DOS for embedded systems, and a royalty-free copy of its Resident Flash Disk software that emulates floppy or hard disks with solid-state Flash media.</p>
