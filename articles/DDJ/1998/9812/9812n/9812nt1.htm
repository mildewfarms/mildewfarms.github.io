All implementations are written in assembly language, and their level of optimization is comparable. Code and data are assumed to reside in the on-chip caches (except for Snefru, Tiger, and SHARK, which require more data memory than the 8 KB of the primary data cache). Only the required memory for tables is listed. Some algorithms require additional memory for storing the state and possibly the round keys.  </H4><p><A HREF="9812n.htm#rt1">Back to Article</A></p><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1998, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
