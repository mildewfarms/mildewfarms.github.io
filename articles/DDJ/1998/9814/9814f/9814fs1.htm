<h1>Should You Go Overseas?</h1>
<hr>
<p>Here are questions that experts recommend you answer before deciding to consult overseas:</p>


<ul>
<li>Am I flexible enough to adjust to another culture? Can I adjust to dining on shepherd's pie or sushi? Can I adjust to living in tiny apartments without air conditioning?  <li>Am I prepared to live in a foreign country for an extended period without family members and friends nearby? Can I overcome bouts of loneliness if I do not have my usual support systems?
  <li>Am I interested in leveraging my international experience to gain another overseas assignment?
  <li>Have I done considerable homework on the staffing company who will assign me? Have I researched the client company and its culture? 
  <li>Will the company pay for a relocation expert to prepare me for going overseas?
  <li>Are all agreements, such as fees, living expenses, and airfare back to the States, in writing?
</ul>
