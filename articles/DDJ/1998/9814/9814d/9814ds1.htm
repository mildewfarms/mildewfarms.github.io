<h1>The Real Rate Survey</h1>

<hr>
<p>Computer consultants have contributed over 3000 rate reports to The Real Rate Survey since 1995. The survey can be found at http://www.realrates.com/. Each rate report posted on the survey includes data about the consultant's rate, previous rate, and the rate charged to the client as well as the technical skills, tasks and industry involved in the assignment. The rate reports also include information about the contractor's tax status, whether or not the contract was brokered, how long it lasted, and the consultant's experience level. A Real Salary Survey, added in January of 1998, has collected information about more than 500 computer-related jobs.</p>
