<h1>Windows CE 1.0 versus Windows CE 2.0 </h1>
</h1>

<HR>
<P>
The major differences between Windows CE 1.0 and Windows 2.0 include the following:
</P>

<ul>
<li>Version 1.0 only supported raster fonts. Version 2.0 supports TrueType fonts.  <li>Version 1.0 did not support any of the OLE Win32 API functions (<i>CoInitializeEx,</i> for instance). Version 2.0 supports the OLE API. The Visual C++ Toolkit for CE will also include the Active Template Library for OLE development.
  <li>Printing is also new for Version 2.0. However, there is no print manager and there is no spooling of print jobs. Hence, only one application can print at a time. Also, multiple print jobs are not allowed.
  <li>Version 1.0 only supports 2 bpp color. Version 2.0 supports 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 bpp. This covers the same range of support as the other Win32 platforms. 
  <li>Custom palettes are supported in 2.0.
  <li>Support for Java has been announced, although the details remain elusive.
</ul>

<h3>The CE Embedded Toolkit</h3>

<p>The CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 has been announced to enable embedded developers to customize the CE kernel. This enables a specialized version of CE using a minimum set of software modules to support the platform's requirements (in order to minimize the memory footprint and maximize performance of the operating system). </p>

<p>For example, you could build a version of the OS that contains the kernel and a selected set of communications modules but which does not provide a graphical user interface. In addition, Visual Basic 5.0 and Visual J++ have add-on packages to support CE as one of their target platforms. A Visual Basic run-time interpreter and Java virtual machine are part of these add-on packages.</p>
