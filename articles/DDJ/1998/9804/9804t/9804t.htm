<h3>The Secret Story of Nonsecret Encryption</h3>

<p>GCHQ, the British equivalent of the U.S. NSA, released a document on December 17, 1997, claiming to have invented public-key cryptography several years before it was discovered by the research community (http://www.cesg.gov.uk/ellisint.htm). According to the paper, GCHQ discovered both RSA and Diffie-Hellman, then kept their discoveries secret.</p>

<p>James Ellis, the author of the paper (who died a few days before the paper's release), wrote that he was inspired by an unknown Bell Telephone Labs researcher during World War II. This researcher had the idea that a receiver could inject noise onto a communications circuit and effectively drown out any signal. An eavesdropper would only hear the noise, but the receiver could subtract the noise and recover the signal. The interesting idea here is that the sender doesn't have to know any encryption "key" to send a secret message to the receiver -- the receiver does all the work. (This is essentially what echo-cancelling modems do; they scream at each other along the same line, and subtract out their own signal when they listen for the other.) This was promptly classified by the U.S. government.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the U.K. in 1960. Intrigued by this idea, James Ellis wrote a classified paper providing an existence proof of "nonsecret encryption." It's a thoroughly impractical scheme, with large tables and other precomputer cryptographic ideas, but there it was.</p>

<p>In 1973, C.C. Cocks (another British spook) published a classified paper where he described what was essentially RSA. And in 1974, M. J. Williamson invented another classified algorithm, remarkably similar to Diffie-Hellman.</p>

<p>Experts believe that the GCHQ claims are valid, and that the mathematics of public-key cryptography were discovered within the intelligence community several years before they were discovered by academic cryptographers. But while they may have discovered the mathematics, it is clear that they never understood its significance.</p>

<p>Public-key cryptography is not used to encrypt data directly. It is used for key exchange, key distribution, and digital signatures. Its primary benefit is that it allows people who have no preexisting security arrangement to exchange messages securely, or for a sender to authenticate a message to a random receiver.</p>

<p>The military world is a fixed hierarchy. Key distribution works through the chain of command, and units trust their superiors. Soldiers don't need to communicate with people they don't have preexisting arrangements with; those people are either civilians or the enemy. The problems that are immediately obvious to someone trying to secure the nutty world of business and personal communications just didn't occur to those trying to secure a military.</p>

<p>So the British didn't envision their non-secret encryption as a solution to the key management problem, and the notion of digital signatures didn't occur to them. It took Ralph Merkle, Martin Hellman, and Whitfield Diffie to invent public-key cryptography, and Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adelman to invent RSA. (The British claim they did not invent knapsack encryption or the El Gamal algorithm before it was published in the academic community.)</p>

<p>This announcement by GCHQ doesn't mean we're going to start calling RSA "Cocks," and Diffie-Hellman "Williamson," but it is an interesting footnote to the history of modern cryptography. And we still don't know if the NSA developed public-key cryptography before learning about it from the British or the press, as they have sometimes claimed. But we do know that the first military device that used public-key cryptography, the STU-III, was not built until the 1980s, long after the academic community expounded on the technology.</p>

<h3>Netscape News</h3>

<p>In a surprising development, Netscape announced in January that it would release the source code of its upcoming Communicator Version 5.0 under a GPL-like license.</p>

<p>Initial response has been predictably positive, especially within the free software community. Within 24 hours of the announcement, programmers were forming groups to facilitate development of the upcoming software (see, for example, http://www.openscape.org/).</p>

<p>Whether this move will prove beneficial for Netscape on a corporate level remains to be seen. Even with Netscape controlling its trademarks (assuring that any browser with the "Netscape" or "Communicator" name will fall under the auspices of Netscape developers), it's not clear whether large companies' traditional biases against free software will prevent them from using the browser. On the other hand, the Netscape announcement gives widespread credibility to the free software movement, and may possibly shatter this corporate bias.</p>

<p>Netscape's move is admirable, but it will have its hands full. The size of the software -- probably the largest codebase of any free software package to date -- and the number of platforms supported will strenuously test the scalability of the "bazaar" technique of software engineering (see "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," by Eric Raymond, http://www. earthspace.net/esr/projects.html) popularized by Linux and Perl.</p>

<h3>Key Escrow Woes</h3>

<p>Is IBM/Lotus' recent deal with the U.S. government a breach of national security? Some people think so. Lotus obtained permission to export Notes software containing strong 64-bit encryption on the condition that 24 bits of each key be deposited with the U.S. government. (This requirement doesn't apply to domestic sales.) Not surprisingly, Swedish government officials aren't too pleased that U.S. authorities can read their e-mail. Other national governments and businesses have similar concerns, especially in light of press reports alleging that the CIA participates in industrial espionage.</p>

<h3>Fingerprint IC</h3>

<p>In a paper presented at the 1998 International Solid-State Circuits Conference, Lucent Technologies described a new high-resolution, direct-contact fingerprint sensor chip that could lower the cost -- and increase the reliability -- of biometric authentication systems. The sensor IC, which captures an image of a fingerprint, consists of a 2D array of metal plates. Each plate functions as the bottom plate of a capacitor, while the finger surface is the grounded top plate. The distance between the bulk of the finger and the sensor (the measured capacitance) varies with the pattern of ridges and valleys that characterize a fingerprint. The capacitance is "measured" as the change in voltage that results when a fixed charge is removed from each sensing plate.</p>
