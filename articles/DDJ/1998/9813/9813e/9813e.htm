And they're recruiting soldiers for this army from both near and far -- as near as the ranks of their own retirees, and as far as the universities of India. </p><p>Experts predict that it will take 300,000 to 500,000 programmers to handle all of this country's Year 2000 conversion work -- the equivalent of one-quarter of America's software workforce. </p><p>The challenge isn't just finding enough programmers. It's finding programmers with skills in "legacy" languages -- old mainframe computer languages such as Cobol. </p><h3>Firms Scrambling </h3><p>Companies are scrambling in a number of directions to get the people they need: </p><ul>  <li>Pulling their own computer experts off other projects to do Year 2000 work.   <li>Luring 70-year-old mainframe programmers out of retirement.   <li>Using promises of $30,000 bonuses or 30 percent raises to steal each other's Year 2000 staff.   <li>Shipping some of the work offshore -- mostly to India, where one consulting firm has a 2000-worker "Year 2000 factory." </ul><p></p><p>"The people are tough to find," said Lisa Donetti, western regional recruiter for Data Dimensions, a consulting firm in Bellevue, Washington, that works on Year 2000 problems. "Most of the people I recruit have 20 years in mainframes. The younger kids don't have these skills." </p><h3>Sweet Vindication </h3><p>For many legacy programmers, the current clamor for their services is sweet vindication. </p><p>"It feels good to be in demand again," said Dick Barnes, 58, a San Jose, California, Cobol programmer who is doing Year 2000 work for an Orinda, California, consulting firm called Systems Partners. </p><p>"We were just dirt at the bottom of the barrel a few years ago," said another veteran Cobol programmer who lives in Fremont, California. "Now we're kind of smiling and saying, 'See? Mainframe ain't dead yet.'" </p><p>While the market for people with Year 2000 skills is already hot, it's likely to get even hotter over the next year, experts say. </p><h3>Salaries Rising </h3><p>"The peak staffing demands will start to occur in late 1998 or '99," said Howard Rubin, a computer-science professor at Hunter College in New York. "No one's hit the crunch yet, which is when companies will need people to start testing their Year 2000 solutions." </p><p>Salaries for Year 2000 programmers haven't hit the astronomic levels of $100 an hour or more that some observers initially predicted. </p><p>But they've risen steadily -- from about $40 an hour to about $60 an hour -- and are likely to rise even higher before the year is out. </p><p>These salary increases pose a big retention challenge for companies that are trying to solve their Year 2000 problem entirely with their own in-house staff. </p><p>"One of my clients, a bank, had a great Year 2000 project manager who had been with them for 21 years," said Stephanie Moore, a consultant with Giga Information Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "She left for another firm that offered her two-and-a-half times her salary. She loved her old company, but she had kids in college. She couldn't pass the opportunity up." </p><h3>Outside Consultants </h3><p>So companies that don't want to lose their own Year 2000 staff are having to set aside big chunks of money for bonuses, raises, and other kinds of retention incentives. Prudential Securities, for instance, promises a $30,000 bonus to Year 2000 workers who stay on board until January 31, 2000. </p><p>While some companies struggle to hold onto their own Year 2000 staff, others are turning to outside consultants to handle the problem for them. </p><p>Some consulting firms are building their own labor pools from scratch. A Boston consulting firm called Keane Inc. trained 500 entry-level programmers in 1996 -- many of them former liberal arts majors who were eager to get into the lucrative world of high-tech. </p><p>Other Year 2000 consulting firms are bringing retired mainframe programmers back into the workforce. "This has been a change for me, since I hadn't had a supervisor since 1957," said Daniel Haagens, 72, a Cobol programmer who came out of semiretirement last year to work for a Year 2000 firm in San Jose called MatriDigm. "I'd been working on my own or in technical management. But I'm enjoying this. I enjoy puzzles, and this is a different kind of puzzle." </p><p>Looking further afield, some consulting firms are using overseas programmers on Year 2000 jobs. </p><h3>India Bound </h3><p>While areas like Israel and Eastern Europe have gotten small amounts of this work, the bulk of it has gone to India. </p><p>"India has three major advantages," said Gopal Parandhamn, president of Global Solutions, a Sacramento, California, computer consulting firm with 80 employees in the United States and 50 in India. "It's got more scientists and engineers than any country after the U.S. It's an English-speaking country. And there's the cost differential, where pay is typically one-quarter of what it costs in the U.S." </p><p>Parandhamn says his Indian programming operation can expand to 300 workers if necessary to meet Year 2000 work orders. </p><p>Meanwhile, Tata Consultancy -- the computer consulting arm of a big Indian corporation -- opened a huge "Year 2000 Factory" in Madras in October. The facility, located in a former garment factory, will employ about 2000 programmers when fully staffed. "The time difference gives us extra leverage," said S. Sambamurthy, manager of Tata Consultancy's San Francisco office. "People can do project scoping here in the U.S. during the daytime, then pass it off to people offshore at night, and have the work done when they come back in the morning." </p><p>Like their American-born counterparts, India's mainframe programmers welcome the increased pay, prestige, and opportunity created by the Year 2000 problem. </p><p>But programmers in both countries are well aware that their moment in the driver's seat will be brief. </p><p>Some Year 2000 work will continue into the new century, as companies iron out glitches and get around to lower-priority date conversions. And companies will still need people for general maintenance of their legacy systems long after 2000. </p><h3>Demand to Slacken </h3><p>But at some point after the turn of the century, demand will slacken. So Year 2000 programmers today are considering more than raises and bonuses when they choose between jobs. </p><p>Fresno, California, programmer Jim Patterson got a 30 percent pay hike last October, when he moved from the computer consulting firm of Data Dimensions to one called Systems Partners. </p><p>But more important than the raise, he said, was the prospect of job security. </p><p>"Data Dimensions was concentrating solely on Year 2000, and it was not clear what there would be to do in the post-2000 environment," Patterson said. "With System Partners, Year 2000 is not its only focus. So there were visible post-2000 opportunities."  </p><p><b>DDJ</b></p><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1998, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
