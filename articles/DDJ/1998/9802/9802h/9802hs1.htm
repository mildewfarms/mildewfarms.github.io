<h1>XML and Python Initiatives</h1>
</h1>

<HR>
<H3>XML</H3>
<P>
The following is a list of some initiatives for XML:
</P>


<P>
	<B>Channel Definition Format (CDF).</B> An initiative by Microsoft and others to use XML as the basis for describing data for "Active Channels" in web browsers such as Internet Explorer 4.0.<br>
	<B>Cold Fusion Markup Language (CFML).</B> An XML-based markup language from Allaire for server-side scripting of web applications.<br>
	<B>Document Object Model (DOM).</B> A W3C initiative to standardize the APIs for access to HTML and XML documents in a platform- and language-independent way.<br>
	<B>Open Financial Exchange (OFE).</B> An initiative by Microsoft, Intuit, and Checkfree to use XML to describe financial transactions. <br>
	<B>Open Software Distribution (OSD).</B> An initiative by Microsoft, Marimba, Installshield, and others for an XML-based software distribution mechanism over the Internet.<br>
	<B>XML-Data.</B> An initiative by Microsoft and others to use XML syntax to capture DTD information. <br>
	<B>XSL.</B> A standard for expressing how XML should be rendered. XSL provides greater formatting power than CSS/HTML, while being interoperable with both. XSL's expression language is, itself, XML combined with the use of ECMAScript for situations where a full-fledged programming language is required.<br>
</P>


<H3>Python</H3>
<P>
Here are some initiatives for Python:
</P>


<P>
	<B>Grail.</B> A World Wide Web browser written in Python by Guido van Rossum. Naturally, it supports the execution of Python as applets downloaded in HTML pages.<br>
	<B>Python Image Library.</B> Adds an image object to Python. Supports a variety of image file formats and processing options.<br>
	<B>Bobo.</B> A collection of software for building web applications with Python. The core of Bobo is an object-request broker (ORB) that converts HTTP requests into Python object requests.<br>
	<B>Alice.</B> A 3D graphics package that uses Python as its embedded scripting language.<br>
	<B>kjParsing.</B> A parser generator implemented in Python that generates Python code.<br>
	<B>Python COM.</B> A Python extension that makes Python interoperable with COM/ActiveX. It supports ActiveX scripting allowing Python to be used like Javascript both client side (Internet Explorer) and server side (IIS). It also allows Python to act as a Windows Scripting Host.<br>
