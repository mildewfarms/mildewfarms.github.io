<p>The Motorola 68HC16Z3 16-bit microcontroller has a real-time operating system kernel (RTEK) on-chip. A minimal version of Motorola's RTEK kernel is designed to fit into the 68HC16Z3's eight KB of ROM, yet still provide 94 services to manage program tasks and resources such as the CPU, memory and time. It also enables real-time data manipulation and provides a common API for related tasks. Included with the RTEK developers kit is RTEKgen, a graphical system generation program that simplifies system configuration. In addition to eight KB of ROM, the 68HC16Z3 features a System Integration Module with 12 programmable chip select outputs and system failure protection; four KB on-chip standby RAM; queued serial peripheral interface and serial communications interface; General Purpose 16-bit Timer with nine-stage prescaler and 11 timer channels; selectable eight-bit/ten-bit, eight-channel analog-to-digital converter.</p>

<p>Ironside Technologies has announced its ironX remote Java software which lets users run large commercial-class Internet and intranet Java applets on central servers while downloading a small Java client to end-user browsers. When loaded by a browser, the ironX ultra-thin client connects to the ironX server platform, which starts a target applet running on the server. When the customer-written target applet running on the server uses the Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) to display Java components, the ironX server platform, transparent to the applet, transmits component instructions to the ironX client which then displays the components on the user's screen. As the user interacts with the components, events and component changes are transmitted by the ironX client back to the ironX server platform and are transparently made available to the applet.   </p>
