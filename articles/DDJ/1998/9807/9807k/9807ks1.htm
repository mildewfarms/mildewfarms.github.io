But questions of paternity are often tricky. According to the U.S. Patent Office, the inventor was a bank clerk in St. Louis named William Seward Burroughs, in 1886. Burroughs, the namesake and ancestor of beat author William S. Burroughs, built both a calculator and a company to sell it (American Arithmometer Company, later Burroughs Adding Machine Co.).</p><p>But Burroughs was beaten to the punch (by fully 66 years) by one Charles Xavier Thomas, Thomas of Colmar to his friends, who built the first commercial mass-produced calculator in 1820. It could add, subtract, and multiply, and, if you helped it a little, even divide. It took up most of a desktop, and continued to be sold for 90 years.</p><p>Tom had got the idea, though, from a 17th century invention of Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz. Leibniz's Stepped Reckoner was definitely a calculator: It added, subtracted, and did multiplication by repeated addition and shifting. Although Leibniz was an early booster of the binary system, his machine was decimal.</p><p>But Leibniz wasn't first: Three years before he even planned his machine, a Brit named Samuel Morland had built a machine for toting up (decidedly nondecimal) British currency.</p><p>Was Morland the first? Nope. Both he and Leibniz had merely expanded on an invention of Blaise Pascal. The Pascaline, built in 1642 for Pascal's tax-collector dad, was (aha!) the first digital adding machine (and the first digital business machine). Pascal sold about a dozen of them. But the story doesn't end there. Still earlier, in 1624, a fellow named Schickard had built a Calculating Clock that could add and subtract. If you really needed to multiply, you could use the slide rule affixed to the front.</p><p>And even earlier, sometime in the 1500s, an artist drew some (recently discovered) sketches for a mechanical device that would add and subtract numbers. When a machine was built based on these sketches, it actually worked.</p><p>The name of this artist, arguably the true inventor of the calculator, was Leonardo da Vinci. Another Leo.</p><p> -- M.S.</p><P><a href="9807k.htm#rs1">Back to Article</A></P><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1998, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
