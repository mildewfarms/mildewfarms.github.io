<p>Crossware has developed an 8051 ANSI C compiler that features smart pointers that produce efficient code without the programmer declaring specific pointer types. Crossware's linker performs a full type-check across the complete program, and checks all global variables, structures and unions, and all function attributes, including parameter types and numbers, to ensure total program integrity. The compiler supports all variants of the 8051 microcontroller, and supports large and small memory models and tiny memory model for the Philips 80C750 family. It can generate nonreentrant code for maximum speed and efficiency or reentrant code for full ANSI conformance. The compiler is available for both DOS and Windows 95/NT 4.0. The Windows 95/NT 4.0 version comes complete with the Crossware Embedded Development Studio, which provides project management, build and browsing support, as well as context colored drag-and-drop editing.</p>

<p>Applied Language Technologies (ALTech) has announced SpeechWorks 3.0, which features speech recognition technology, rapid application development tools, and predefined application component templates. SpeechWorks 3.0 uses object-oriented building blocks, known as DialogModules, to deliver significant enhancements in vocabulary size and natural language capabilities. Each DialogModule accomplishes a particular task within an application, ranging from "simple" tasks such as capturing a yes/no response to more complex tasks such as capturing credit card information or name and address information from a caller. Through embedded human factors expertise, pre-built grammars, user-interface design, internal call flow, and error recovery routines, DialogModules provide application developers with easy-to-use functionality. Using a set of GUI-based composition and vocabulary editing tools provided by ALTech's SpeechBuilder toolkit, DialogModules can be customized by developers for specific application requirements. </p>

<p>Schlumberger has demonstrated the first Java-based SIM (subscriber identity module) for mobile phones, and released it for beta-testing to telecommunications companies. The Java capability allows the smart card provided with digital mobile phones to operate as a miniature computer and run a spectrum of additional applications, including applets downloaded dynamically over the network as required. In short, the SIM card allows mobile phones to function as a secure and portable gateway to the services available on networks. Schlumberger's SIM prototype is based on its Cyberflex product. Conforming to the Java Card Forum-endorsed API standard developed for smart cards, this provides an interoperable platform for portable applications. For more information, see http://www.cyberflex.austin.et.slb.com/ or http://www.javacardforum.org/.  </p>

<p>Microsoft has announced the availability of Version 2.0 of its SDK for Java. The SDK includes Microsoft's virtual machine, the Microsoft Application Foundation Classes (AFC), and J/Direct. The SDK is available for free download at http://www.microsoft.com/java/ (connect-time charges may apply).</p>

<p>The AFC is a set of UI-centric class libraries (written in Java) for creating Java applications. AFC ships with Internet Explorer 4.0 and is slated to ship with Windows-based PCs and Macintosh systems in the future. J/Direct lets you call the Win32 API or any other DLL directly, without having to write Java-aware native code wrappers. The Microsoft virtual machine provides automatic, bidirectional integration of ActiveX technologies and JavaBeans, letting you mix and match components written in Java and other programming languages. The virtual machine's package manager handles automatic installation of class libraries and provides version control. These features work with any standard web server, and security is enforced on downloaded libraries.</p>
