That means no jokes, tall tales, leaked memos, or speculation about what's <i>really</i> going on between Bill Gates and Madeleine Albright.   If the business of business is business, then the business of <i>DDJ</i> is magazine articles. That said, I'm pleased to present our 1999 editorial calendar and invite you to contribute articles and ideas for the coming year.</p><p><b><i>Dr. Dobb's Journal </i>1999 Editorial Calendar</b></p><table border="0" cellpadding="3"><tr>	<td>January</td><td rowspan="12">&nbsp;</td>	<td>Scripting Languages</td></tr><tr>	<td>February</td>	<td>Java Programming</td></tr><tr>	<td>March</td>	<td>Simulation and Emulation </td></tr><tr>	<td>April</td>	<td>Algorithms</td></tr><tr>	<td>May</td>	<td>Database Development</td></tr><tr>	<td>June</td>	<td>Object-Oriented Design</td></tr><tr>	<td>July</td>	<td>Communications and Networking</td></tr><tr>	<td>August</td>	<td>Visual Programming</td></tr><tr>	<td>September</td>	<td>Graphics Programming</td></tr><tr>	<td>October</td>	<td>C++ Programming</td></tr><tr>	<td>November</td>	<td>Operating Systems</td></tr><tr>	<td>December</td>	<td>Computer Security</td></tr></table><p>This list, of course, isn't all inclusive. We're interested in any topic related to programming, whether it pops up on the above list or not. If you've come up with a useful, interesting technique, utility, algorithm, data structure, or application -- in any language, for any platform -- chances are that your fellow programmers want to hear about it.</p><p>One important thing to remember is that <i>DDJ</i> is in reader's hands several weeks prior to the cover date. This means that we'll need your manuscript well in advance if you want to contribute to a specific issue. However, if you have an article on, say, scripting and our January issue has come and gone, that's okay, too. We'll find a home for it in a later issue.</p><p>Also keep in mind that we'd like you to submit an outline or abstract before sending in the article itself. That outline should generally assume that your article will be about 2500 words in length, not counting source code, figures, tables, and the like. We promise to do our best in getting back to you right away. We usually respond to most proposals within a couple of weeks, although I'm the first to admit some take longer and others fall through the cracks. For this, I sincerely apologize. The exact month your article eventually appears in print depends on a number of factors, including the topic and length of your article, the number of pages in an issue, and the like. In any event, don't hold back in bugging us about about the status of your proposal. </p><p>As you're likely aware, we're on the lookout for all kinds of articles -- programming language features, embedded-systems and real-time development, web development, product and book reviews, operating-system internals, algorithms and protocols, file formats, digital consumer electronics, methodologies, and more.</p><p>If you have an article idea about these or other topics, contact any of us -- Tim Kientzle (kientzle@ddj.com), Eugene Kim (eekim@ddj.com), or me (jerickson@ddj.com). Since Tim edits our "Algorithm Alley" column, drop him a note if you want to target that section. If you'd like to contribute to the "Online Op-Ed" at our web site (http://www.ddj.com/), Eugene wants to hear from you. And if you've read a book that you'd like to review for either our "Programmer's Bookshelf" or Electronic Review of Computer Books web site, Amy Wong (awong@mfi.com) looks forward to hearing what you have in mind. For more details on the type of articles and how we'd like you to approach them, please refer to our author guidelines at http://www.ddj.com/ddj/authors.htm, which provide more details.</p><p>Phew. Now that that's out of the way, I can get back to the real business of the American media machine, starting with the sordid story of starry eyes and broken hearts, Bill Gates and Janet Reno. It's a dirty job, but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.</p><p>-- Jonathan Erickson</p><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1998, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
