However, Microsoft is changing things with DirectX 5. Its DirectSound subsystem now supports audio capture. It has a slightly simpler interface, and it works very differently than the traditional Windows and Mac OS systems. You allocate a single buffer that DirectSound fills in a circular fashion. You can have DirectSound notify you when it has recorded a certain amount of data, or you can ask it yourself. When enough data has been recorded, you can copy it out of the circular buffer and process it as you see fit. The initial release does not offer any performance improvements over the existing <i>waveIn</i> APIs in terms of letting you process the samples sooner after they are recorded, but in the future it will. Look up DirectSound and DirectSoundCapture on MSDN for more information.</p><p> -- R.C.</p><P><A HREF="9810d.htm#rs">Back to Article</A></P><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1998, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
