Since then, CAPI has evolved to Version 2.0 of the Standard that supports many different ISDN variants, including Euro-ISDN. You can use CAPI to program practically all of the functions of modern ISDN cards. CAPI is defined for a whole range of operating systems including Windows 3x/95/NT, DOS, OS/2, and UNIX. The CAPI organization now has contributing members from companies all over the world, and http://www.capi.org/ is a great resource of information about CAPI 2.0.</p><p> -- M.D.</p><P><A HREF="9809d.htm#rs1">Back to Article</A></P><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1998, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
