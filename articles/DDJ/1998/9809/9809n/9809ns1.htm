The relationship between the more widely used alpha, and the less widely used characteristic time (<i>Tau</i>) that governs the decay of the exponential weights is <i>alpha=exp(-dt/Tau)</i> or <i>Tau=-dt/ln(alpha)</i>. Here, <i>dt</i> is the  sampling interval.</p><p>Although <i>Tau </i>can be loosely interpreted as the moving averaging window, bear in mind that exponential averaging windows are not as clear cut as ordinary equal weight-averaging windows. For example, although around 95 percent of the weights are associated with points less than 3*<i>Tau</i> time units old, a single monster data point -- despite being many more than three <i>Tau</i>s old -- could still have a sizable impact on the average.</p><p>The largest possible averaging window is a function of numeric precision, with <i>Taumax=-dt/ln(</i>1<i>-EPS)~=dt/EPS</i> (<i>EPS</i> is the smallest number, such that 1<i>+EPS&gt;</i>1).</p><p> -- J.C.G.</p><P><A HREF="9809n.htm#rs1">Back to Article</A></P><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1998, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
