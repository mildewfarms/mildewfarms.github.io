In Navigator releases 3.0b5-7, changes were introduced to thwart IAC via static fields, with the reason given "to fix real bugs in LiveConnect security where applets could use JavaScript to see data (such as form fields) on HTML pages other than the ones they were associated with" (J. Giannandrea, "Netscape 3.0b7," Posting on java.comp.lang, August 15, 1996). The resulting "outcry" (Netscape's term) obliged it to backtrack and restore this facility. Netscape has decided to introduce a new model of IAC using JavaBeans (J. Giannandrea, Personal e-mail, September 12, 1997). </p><p> -- S.B. and J.M.C.</p><P><A HREF="9809a.htm#rs1">Back to Article</A></P><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1998, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
