<h2>FEATURES </h2>

<h3><a href="9703a/9703a.htm">AGENT TCL</a></h3>

<h4>by Robert S. Gray</h4>

<p>A mobile agent is a program that migrates under its own control from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network. Agent Tcl is a mobile-agent system that uses Tcl as its main language, but provides a framework for incorporating additional languages. </p>

<h3><a href="9703b/9703b.htm">AGENTS AND REINFORCEMENT LEARNING</a></h3>

<h4>by Satinder Singh, Peter Norvig, and David Cohn</h4>

<p>Many people see agents and agent-based programming as ushering in a new era in computing -- particularly on the Internet. Our authors explain why programming agents is not just business as usual, but requires a new way of looking at problems and their solutions. </p>

<h3><a href="9703c/9703c.htm">DISTRIBUTED ACTIVE OBJECTS</a></h3>

<h4>by Marc H. Brown and Marc A. Najork</h4>

<p>Distributed active objects, which communicate with other active objects located on different machines across the Internet, make it easy to write groupware, computer-supported cooperative work applications, and multiplayer games.</p>

<h3><a href="9703d/9703d.htm">RPC FOR WINDOWS 95/NT </a></h3>

<h4>by Steve Sipe</h4>

<p>Remote Procedure Call (RPC) programming allows client programs to call server-based functions. Steve presents a technique to simplify the use of Remote Procedure Calls in 32-bit Windows 95/NT applications. </p>
<HR>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS </h2>

<h3><a href="9703e/9703e.htm">KERTESY: A REAL-TIME EVENT-DRIVEN MICROKERNEL</a></h3>

<h4>by Biswajit Sain and Timothy A. Gonsalves</h4>

<p>"Kertesy" is a real-time microkernel for embedded systems designed around Analog Devices' ADSP-21xx series of digital-signal processors. The microkernel is small and fast, but nonetheless powerful.</p>
<HR>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS </h2>

<h3><a href="9703f/9703f.htm">DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS</a></h3>

<h4>by Gregory Bollella </h4>

<p>Greg reviews memory allocators, then discusses the allocator used in typical implementations of TCP/IP. He also describes a number of allocator implementation techniques that are helpful in debugging.</p>
<HR>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S TOOLCHEST</h2>

<h3><a href="9703g/9703g.htm">EXAMINING WIN32 C++ COMPILERS</a></h3>

<h4>by Ron van der Wal</h4>

<p>Ron examines the leading C++ compilers for creating Win32 executables, including Borland C++, Visual C++, Symantec C++, Watcom C++, and VisualAge C++. </p>

<h3><a href="9703h/9703h.htm">VISUAL BASIC 5 AND ACTIVEX CONTROLS</a></h3>

<h4>by Al Williams</h4>

<p>Microsoft's Visual Basic 5 lets you create controls as easily as form-based applications. In theory, these controls can then be used with VB, web pages, C++, Delphi, or any other environment that understands ActiveX.      </p>
<HR>
<h2>COLUMNS </h2>

<h3><a href="9703i/9703i.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS </a></h3>

<h3><a href="9703j/9703j.htm">C PROGRAMMING </a></h3>

<h4>by Al Stevens </h4>

<p>When writing a data-scope program called "DScope," Al found a dearth of information on the Windows communications API. Still, after lots of digging and even more trial and error, he was able to get DScope up and running -- as a DOS application.</p>

<h3><a href="9703k/9703k.htm">JAVA Q&AMP;A</a></h3>
