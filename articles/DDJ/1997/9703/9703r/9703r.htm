<p>Borland has announced Borland C++Builder, a C++ visual development tool. The environment couples the power of C++ with Delphi's rapid application development (RAD). Borland C++Builder lets you leverage existing C++ code by permitting recompilation of all ANSI-compatible C++ code and allowing them to build fast, productive front ends for either Borland C++ or Visual C++ applications. Borland C++Builder, which provides built-in interoperability with existing Borland C++, includes a visual IDE that combines the Borland C++ compiler and integrated debugger with new visual tools, including a visual form designer, object inspector, and a component palette with more than 100 reusable components via the Visual Component Library (VCL). With the Two-Way tools, changes made in the code editor are automatically reflected in the visual designers and vice versa. Visual Form Inheritance lets you change the characteristics of any new form by inheriting properties from any other form. </p>

<p>Borland C++Builder includes a new, optimizing 32-bit native-code compiler, incremental linker, fully integrated editor and debugger, and CPU View (five separate panes that give you views of registers, memory dumps, and assembly language).  </p>

New features include integrated security, naming, load balancing, asynchronous operation, multithreading, and server management. NobleNet RPC 3.0 is priced at $5000.00 per developer seat, plus a one-time distribution charge for application deployment. It is available for UNIX, Windows 3.1/95/NT, Macintosh, OpenVMS, and VxWorks.</p>
