<p>Hewlett-Packard has released HP C++, a C++ compiler based on the ANSI/ISO Draft Working Paper and optimized for HP's PA-8000-based workstations and servers. Designed to execute on HP-UX 10.20 and 10.10, HP C++ includes pre-compiled header files, which reduce compilation time and produce smaller object files. The template instantiation mechanism offers automatic and explicit syntax. Generating default exception-handling information at compile time avoids run-time cost and allows applications to mix and match exception and nonexception routines for optimum performance. Included is a debugger, performance analyzer, incremental linker, Standard C++ Library and Rogue Wave's Tools.h++. HP workstation and server user licenses are priced at $1495.00 each.</p>
