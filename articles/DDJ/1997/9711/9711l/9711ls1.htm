<h1>The Browser Matters</h1>
</h1>


<P>
Different browsers handle the ClipboardPrinterApplet in different ways. In HotJava, for instance, you encapsulate the applet in a signed JAR file. (See my column in the August 1997 issue of <i>DDJ</i>.) Or, you open Edit/Preferences/Applet-Security, advanced, create a group, create a host, drag the host under the group, then select the host and select System Permissions, and give the host permission to access the clipboard and print jobs.

<p>At this writing, Netscape does not support AWT 1.1 features. You must encapsulate the applet in a JAR file signed with a signing certificate obtained from a certificate authority using an encryption method supported by Netscape. (The easiest way to get such a certificate is to go to the web site of one of the certificate authorities listed under Netscape's Security Preferences, and follow their instructions.) For more information on signing applets for Netscape, see http://developer.netscape.com/library/documentation/signedobj/.</p>

<P>
Under IE, you must encapsulate the applet in a signed CAB file. See "Inside Windows Cabinet Files," by Sven B. Schreiber (<i>DDJ</i>, May 1997) or http:// www.microsoft.com/ for information on CAB files.
