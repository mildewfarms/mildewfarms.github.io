<p>NewCode Technology has introduced NCremote, a C++ virtual machine that can be used to monitor and run diagnostic tests on any C/C++ applications over a network. NCremote uses an NCremote Agent to connect applications to an NCremote Switchboard. These applications can then be accessed through a Java applet called "NCremote Monitor" which lets you load prewritten diagnostic code or enter C++ code on the fly. This code is then sent over the Internet, via the NCremote Switchboard, to the NCremote Agent in the monitored C++ virtual machine. Output is sent back to the Monitor for display. Diagnostic code can be executed either immediately or at designated probe points coded into the application.</p>

<p>NCremote allows monitoring of deployed applications, working with code compiled for debugging or with optimized code stripped and prepared for customer deployment. Status information, which an application might normally write to log files, can be redirected to the NCremote Monitor, through which users can define new functions to output additional information, as needed.</p>

<p>NCremote 1.0 supports applications running on Windows 95/NT. It is compatible with applications built using Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2. The NCremote Monitor may be run from any Java-enabled web browser.</p>

<p>ASPI Digital has announced the AudiOasis A1024 MPEG Audio Encoder Module, an off-the-shelf MPEG 2 Audio Encoder. The A1024 provides MPEG 2 audio compression in a self-contained, double-sided module occupying six square inches of printed-circuit board space. Input (stereo or two monaural channels) to the A1024 is either analog audio (balanced or single-ended) or digital audio through an interface to a digital audio receiver chip. Output is available in either an elementary stream or a packetized elementary stream (PES) in both byte-parallel and bit-serial formats. The PES is fully configurable with presentation time stamps (PTS). A built-in externally triggerable system clock register (SCR) is also provided. The A1024 MPEG Audio Encoder Module costs $239.00 in quantities of 500. A PC-based evaluation board is available. </p>

<p>Wind River Systems and Objective Software Technology have introduced Look! for Tornado, a dynamic visualization tool for graphically exploring embedded and real-time C++ programs while they execute. Look! for Tornado provides multiple, animated views of the structure and behavior of executing C++ applications. It graphically displays the objects which exist, their interrelationships (reference and creation) and interobject communication, while it statically filters classes, functions or modules that are not of interest. All of the run-time graphical views are synchronized with a source-level debugger and provide point and click access to the application details. Look! for Tornado also provides common static views such as class inheritance hierarchies. Both the dynamic and static views  enable developers to more quickly review and debug applications. The tool is available for UNIX and Windows 95/NT host platforms and more than a dozen target processor families</p>
