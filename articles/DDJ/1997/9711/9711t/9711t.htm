<h1>A Clock Puzzle</h1>

<p><i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i> November 1997
</p>
<HR>
<p>I had just set four bowls on the floor and opened a can of turkey and giblets dinner when I saw "Good Morning Silicon Valley" paint across my monitor and knew that my e-mail was in.</p>

<p>Pushing the cat feeding project aside, I sat and sorted: news in the News folder; spam and unsolicited attachments to Trash; personal mail to Personal; mail regarding this column, click-click, consign it all to Flames. When I finished triage, I began to work through the Flames folder.</p>

<p>Here's a musical correction: A song parody I quoted, "Write in C," was actually written by Brian Marshall at Microsoft back in '87 when he was a freshperson at the University of Waterloo. "I have a yellowed printout of the original draft." he wrote, "written on a Commodore 64 and printed on a Mannesmann-Tally printer, ready for carbon dating test." That won't be necessary, Bri.</p>

<p>Tiny yowled at my feet, leapt the 39 vertical inches to the desktop, and yowled at my face.</p>

<p>Still getting letters on the temperature problem from some months back: What do you do when you've been recording high and low temperatures daily and you miss a day? Evan Manning wrote to say that his <i>UDouble</i> classes don't help with the problem as another reader said they might: They propagate error distributions through further calculations, but don't tell you what the error distribution is. Darn.</p>

<p>Several other temperature messages, then a message from my cousin Corbett.</p>

<p>"Here's a puzzle for you," it said. "How do you set a digital clock?" </p>

<p>"I'll bite," I replied, and Ariel seemed to be thinking about it herself, "how do you set a digital clock?" I went to get tea, closely followed by two cats.</p>

<p>When I came back, two other cats were pacing across my desk and Corbett had responded.</p>

<p>"Say your digital clock shows only the hour and minute," his e-mail began. "Say you set it exactly right, waiting until 11:00:00.00000 to set it to 11:00. Okay, then it's going to say 11:00 right up through 11:00:59. If you take it literally, you could be off by almost a minute. Your best guess for the actual time when a clock set this way reads 11:00 is not 11:00 at all, but 11:00:30, a whole half minute later. Right? So how should you set this clock? That's the puzzle. My answer is, set it a half-minute off to begin with. Just watch for 10:59:30 and then set it to 11:00. That way, if you take its reading literally, you'll never be off more than 30 seconds."</p>

<p>"I disagree," I typed. "Would you do the same with the year, having your date/time clock change to 1997 in July? Of course not. When we say this is 1997, we understand that 1997 labels an interval, not a porklint." Actually, I typed "point"; "porklint" was how Frizzy's cat feet edited it.</p>

<p>"We're not talking about porklints," Corbett's reply said, "We're talking about clocks. When you look at a clock, you want to know what time it is now, not 30 seconds ago."</p>

<p>"But suppose you're a clockwatcher, I said, "eager to get off work. You want to know when it's exactly 5:00, and if you watch the properly set clock closely, it'll tell you that. Your 30-seconds-off clock won't." Ike rubbed against my leg to tell me she knew what time it was. </p>

<p>Corbett's reply was brief: "So what? Should I get docked for leaving 30 seconds early when that measurement exceeds the precision of the timeclock?"</p>

<p>I tried unsuccessfully to imagine my independent and undependable cousin Corbett punching a timeclock.</p>

<p>Hmm...I like this deceptively simple puzzle, but I've got to go feed these cats. You got any ideas?</p>
