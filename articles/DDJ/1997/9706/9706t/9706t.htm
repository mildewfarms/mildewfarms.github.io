<p>Rogue Wave Software has announced its Serialize.h++, a C++ class library that uses the Java serialization mechanism to exchange objects and data with Java programs. This mechanism eliminates the need for Java code to make native calls to C++ code. Likewise, it eliminates the need to have the C++ and Java code on the same machine/platform. Serialize.h++ uses small helper objects called "ReaderWriters" to map C++ classes to Java classes to accomplish data exchange. A prebuilt set of ReaderWriters maps key classes in Rogue Wave's Tools.h++ class library to corresponding classes and data types in the Java core library. Serialize.h++ is only available in a source code version, and sells for $995.00 for a single-user license. It supports Windows 95/NT, HP-UX, SGI Irix, and Sun Solaris, and requires Tools.h++ 7.0.</p>
