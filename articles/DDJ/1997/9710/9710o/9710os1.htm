<h1>Why Start with MFC 4.2?</h1>
<HR>
<p>It is hard to speculate why Microsoft chose to port MFC 4.2 for Visual C++ instead of the fresher 4.21, but our investigations found the date 11/15/96 used heavily in some of the <i>#ifdef</i>s that were used to create Mini MFC. If the Mini MFC project was started around this date, then MFC 4.2 was the latest and greatest. Unfortunately, it looks like the Mini MFC changes were a one-shot version of MFC, because MFC 4.21 did not include the changes made to create Mini MFC. This means that whenever Microsoft starts the next revision of Mini MFC, they will either have to merge the Mini MFC changes into the main MFC source code stream, or take the latest version of MFC and redo all of the work they performed to get MFC 4.2 moved over to Windows CE. Unfortunately, this version of Mini MFC was evidently a quick and dirty way to get MFC up and running on Windows CE and was not considered critical enough to affect the main MFC code stream.</p>
