<h3><a href="9710a/9710a.htm">A CONVERSATION WITH RON RIVEST</a></h3>
<P><I>by Jack Woehr</I></P>

<P>Computer scientist Ron Rivest takes time out to chat with Jack Woehr about computer security, digital certificates, cryptography, and a variety of other subjects.


<h3><a href="9710b/9710b.htm">INTERNET MULTICASTING</a></h3>

<P><I>by Bob Quinn</I></P>

<P>Multicasting lets you deliver content from a single sender to multiple receivers. Bob uses the multicast-enabled WinSock API to present TimeCast, a one-to-many application that multicasts the time of day to multiple clients. 


<h3><a href="9710c/9710c.htm">THE SSH TRANSPORT LAYER PROTOCOL</a></h3>

<P><I>by Camillo S&auml;rs</I></P>

<P>The SSH protocol provides secure Internet connections that are authenticated and encrypted using military-grade encryption. Camillo examines how the transport layer protocol enables secure remote connections.


<h3><a href="9710d/9710d.htm">JAVA AND INTER-APPLET COMMUNICATION</a></h3>

<P><I>by Andrew Meckler</I></P>

<P>The base Java libraries partially support inter-applet communication. However, if there are multiple HTML pages displayed in the browser at one time, the applets in different contexts cannot communicate with one another. Andrew presents a way around this problem.


<h3><a href="9710e/9710e.htm">THE BLOCK CIPHER SQUARE ALGORITHM</a></h3>

<P><I>by Joan Daemen, Lars R. Knudsen, Vincent Rijmen</I></P>

<P>Square is a new fast block cipher that encrypts data in blocks of 128 bits, using a 128-bit key. Square's structure has been carefully chosen to allow very efficient implementations on a wide range of processors.


<h3><a href="9710f/9710f.htm">WIN32 NETWARE CORE PROTOCOL REVISITED</a></h3>

<P><I>by Sven B. Schreiber</I></P>

<P>Microsoft's NetWare clients for Windows 95 and NT are a well-integrated part of the operating system. However, their APIs are rudimentary, making it difficult for NetWare client software developers to write nontrivial applications. Luckily, both operating systems offer a useful-albeit undocumented-NCP interface, allowing client/server communication through the backdoor. Sven explores those undocumented interfaces.EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

<h3><a href="9710g/9710g.htm">THE ENHANCED PARALLEL PRINTER PORT</a></h3>

<P><I>by Dhananjay V. Gadre and Larry A. Stein</I></P>

<P>The Enhanced Parallel Printer Port protocol was developed to provide a high-performance parallel-port link compatible with existing parallel-port peripherals and interfaces. Our authors examine this specification, and present routines for implementing high-speed digital I/O using EPP BIOS calls.
