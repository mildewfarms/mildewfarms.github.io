<p>TIBCO Software has announced TIB/ObjectBus 2.0, a CORBA 2.0-compliant object request broker (ORB). TIB/ObjectBus brings TIB "push" middleware, which conserves network bandwidth by using reliable multicast, to the Object Management Group's (OMG) Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), enabling massively scalable distributed computing.</p>

<p>TIB/ObjectBus 2.0 is a set of tools and a run-time environment that supports the development and deployment of distributed applications compliant with the CORBA 2.0 specification. In addition, TIB/ObjectBus 2.0 contains a CORBA API, which integrates TIBCO's transport software. TIB/ObjectBus also provides support for OMG's Internet Interoperability Protocol (IIOP). Unlike other ORBs, TIB/ObjectBus 2.0 can use broadcast and reliable multicast to initiate ORB requests and distribute ORB events across an unlimited number of servers and users. TIB/ObjectBus leverages TIBCO's multicast protocol to send information across the network in a one-to-many distribution model, providing for large-scale implementations over the Internet or intranets. Pricing for TIB/ObjectBus 2.0 starts at $600.00 per client or desktop at run time and $5000.00 for the SDK. </p>

<p>Unwired Planet has announced its UP.Link Platform 2.0 and HDML (Handheld Device Markup Language) SDK. The UP.SDK, available at no charge at Unwired Planet's web site, lets you create interactive applications and content for smartphones, such as those offered by the AT&amp;T Wireless PocketNet service, Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile Cellscape service, and GTE Wireless SuperPhone service. The UP.SDK supports HDML 2.0. </p>

<p>The UP.SDK also lets you "push" information to mobile phones enabled with UP.Browser. Any Internet or intranet web server can transmit urgent alerts that notify the user of specific events. These events may be the arrival of an e-mail message, a change in a stock's price, and so on.</p>

<p>AuraVision has introduced its DirectShow SDK, which supports Microsoft's DirectShow architecture. DirectShow, formerly known as ActiveMovie 2, is a player/processor/control interface for the display and manipulation of video and audio data. DirectShow will be included with Microsoft's yet-to-be released Memphis operating system, and can also be used with Windows 95/NT. AuraVision's DirectShow SDK includes the components necessary for you to develop video playback and processing for DVD, DVB, and video-conferencing applications.</p>

<p>The AuraVision DirectShow SDK consists of four components -- AVShow, AVLive, AVRenderer, and AVPROP.DLL. AuraVision's AVShow application captures and displays video from live sources, AVI files, and MPEG sources. It provides multiwindowing, TV remote-type control, and VCR-type recording in a single application. The AVLive and AVRenderer components are source, capture, and renderer filters that let you take advantage of hardware video acceleration. </p>

<p>New Art Communications has released Version 1.0 of NaTrace for C, a tool that lets you track an object's path through a C program down to a depth of 1000 nodes. NaTrace for C is part of New Art's NA-Series suite of tools, which includes NA2000 Scan, NaImpact, and NaTrace for Cobol.</p>

<p>NaTrace for C is a Windows-based, interactive analytical tool that lets you "explode" the impact of a single variable throughout a given C program. Particularly useful for Year 2000 analysis, NaTrace for C pinpoints nonobvious date-related variables (for example, if <i>daydate </i>moves to <i>wcalc, </i>which then is added to <i>bcalc, </i>NaTrace will trace the path of <i>daydate, wcalc </i>and then <i>bcalc</i>).</p>

<p>NaTrace for C enables you to search either in a case-sensitive or case-insensitive mode. The tool also permits you to separate the structure from the member (or the database from the variable) to ease the search process. The NaTrace C/Cobol bundle sells for $595.00.</p>
