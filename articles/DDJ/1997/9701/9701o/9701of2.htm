	(a) The heap after inserting values 0-12 and extracting 0. Now,
	start from 11 and consolidate the heap; (b) 10 and 11 both had
	degree zero, so were joined; (c) 8 and 9 were joined; (d) 8 and 10
	both had degree one; (e) 7,6,5, and 4 were consolidated. (f) Eight
	and 4 both had degree two; (g) Finished. One has degree zero, 2 has
	degree one, 4 has degree three. Note that every element is smaller
	than all of its children. </P> <a href="9701o.htm#ref3">BACK TO
