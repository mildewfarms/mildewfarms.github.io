<h2>FEATURES </h2>

<a href="9701a/9701a.htm"><h3>A CONVERSATION WITH EVA BOZOKI</H3></a>

<h4>by Jack Woehr</h4>

<p>Network security is a concept whose time clearly has come, and, as Jack finds out this month, DSNT chief scientist Eva Bozoki is in the thick of things, security wise. </p>

<a href="9701b/9701b.htm"><h3>THE RIPEMD-160 CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH FUNCTION</H3></a>

<h4>by Antoon Bosselaers, Hans Dobbertin, and Bart Preneel</h4>

<p>Cryptographic hash functions are an essential building block for applications that require data integrity. In this article, our authors propose that the RIPEMD-160 hash function is a secure replacement for MD4 and MD5. </p>

<a href="9701c/9701c.htm"><h3>REED-SOLOMON ERROR CORRECTION</H3></a>

<h4>by Hugo Lyppens</h4>

<p>For any number of reasons, Reed-Solomon error correction is commonly implemented in hardware. Here, Hugo presents a highly optimized software implementation of Reed-Solomon error correction, written in C++ and assembly language.</p>

<a href="9701d/9701d.htm"><h3>THE ZLIB COMPRESSION LIBRARY</H3></a>

<h4>by Mark R. Nelson</h4>

<p>Mark examines zlib, a library of C routines that can be used to compress or expand files using the same deflate algorithm popularized by PKZIP 2.0.</p>

<a href="9701e/9701e.htm"><h3>WINDOWS NT SYSTEM-CALL HOOKING</H3></a>

<h4>by Mark Russinovich and Bryce Cogswell</h4>

<p>Mark and Bryce present the design and implementation of NTRegmon, a tool that uses hooking to show detailed information about each and every registry access that occurs on a Windows NT system. </p>

<a href="9701f/9701f.htm"><h3>STEGANOGRAPHY FOR DOS PROGRAMMERS</H3></a>

<h4>by Alan Johnson</h4>

<p>Steganography is a branch of cryptography that deals with concealing messages.</p>
<HR>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS </h2>

<a href="9701g/9701g.htm"><h3>SIMULATION AND DEVICE-DRIVER DEVELOPMENT</H3></a>

<h4>by Eddy Quicksall and Ken Gibson </h4>

<p>To ease the process of writing device drivers for new hardware designs, our authors present a simulation environment. To illustrate its use, they use the sample Adaptec AHA-1540 SCSI miniport driver that comes with the Windows NT DDK.</p>

<a href="9701h/9701h.htm"><h3>SIMULATING THE DENVER AIRPORT AUTOMATED BAGGAGE SYSTEM</H3></a>

<h4>by John Swartz</h4>

<p>John uses Xlisp to implement a computer simulation of the essential components of the Denver airport automated baggage fiasco, er... system.</p>
<HR>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS </h2>

<a href="9701i/9701i.htm"><h3>EXAMINING EXTENDED MAPI 1.0</H3></a>

<h4>by Les Thaler</h4>

<p>The Extended Messaging Application Programming Interface 1.0, not to be confused with the previous-generation "Simple MAPI," was created to standardize the interfaces between messaging applications and the underlying messaging systems.</p>
<HR>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S TOOLCHEST</h2>

<a href="9701j/9701j.htm"><h3>PUBLISHING DYNAMIC DATA ON THE INTERNET</H3></a>

<h4>by Lauren Hightower</h4>

<p>Allaire's Cold Fusion is a development tool that provides access (via the Web) to any database the web server can access using ODBC. Cold Fusion runs as a multithreaded Windows NT system service and works with any ODBC-compliant database. </p>

<a href="9701k/9701k.htm"><h3>INSIDE ITERATED SYSTEMS' FRACTAL DEVELOPMENT KIT</H3></a>

<h4>by Dino Esposito</h4>

<p>The Fractal Development Kit from Iterated Systems is a library that makes it possible for you to embed fractal-imaging capabilities into C/C++ Windows and Macintosh applications. </p>

<h2>COLUMNS </h2>

<a href="9701l/9701l.htm"><h3>PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</H3></a>

<h4>by Michael Swaine </h4>

<p>Michael looks at paradigms past, focusing this month on spreadsheets.</p>

<a href="9701m/9701m.htm"><h3>C PROGRAMMING</H3></a>

<h4>by Al Stevens</h4>

<p>Users expect standard Windows Help for all applications, no matter how small or how intuitive the procedures. To that end, Al updates a property page dialog-based application to include context-sensitive help for the controls on the dialog pages.</p>

<a href="9701n/9701n.htm"><h3>JAVA Q&AMP;A</H3></a>

<h4>by Cliff Berg</h4>

<p>Cliff examines how you can use Java to implement a CORBA application that is representative of the way CORBA is likely to be used. In doing so, he revisits the chat application introduced in a previous column.</p>

<a href="9701o/9701o.htm"><h3>ALGORITHM ALLEY</H3></a>

<h4>by John Boyer</h4>

<p>Heaps are usually implemented via binary trees, with the property that for every subtree, the root is the minimum item. Here, John describes how to implement exceptionally fast "Fibonacci" heaps.</p>

<a href="9701p/9701p.htm"><h3>UNDOCUMENTED CORNER</H3></a>

<h4>by Robert R. Collins</h4>

<p>Robert launches an examination of the Intel System Management Mode (SMM), comparing the SMM's RSM instruction to the ICE mode's undocumented LOADALL instruction.</p>

<a href="9701q/9701q.htm"><h3>PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF</H3></a>

<h4>by Ron van der Wal and William Stallings</h4>
