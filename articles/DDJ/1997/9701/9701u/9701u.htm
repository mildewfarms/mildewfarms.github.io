<p>Apple has announced its Advanced Chinese Input Suite (ACIS), an integrated suite for inputting Chinese text on Mac OS-based computers. The suite includes the Apple Chinese Dictation Kit, the Apple Chinese Handwriting Kit, and Apple Chinese Text-to-Speech. The Chinese Dictation Kit requires the user to train the system to recognize his or her voice by reading 25 pages of text, which takes about two hours. The Chinese Handwriting Kit requires little training and recognizes any handwritten Chinese character, as long as it is written in the sequence of common strokes used to write the Chinese language. ACIS runs on any PowerPC-based Mac OS system with System 7.5 or later; Chinese Language Kit 1.1.1 or later. ACIS requires 8 MB of RAM, at least 35 MB of hard-disk space to accommodate the voice file generated during the training phase of the Chinese Dictation Kit, and 16-bit sound input. </p>

<p>Secant Technologies has announced its Secant Persistent Object Manager (POM), which is an object-management toolset for building object-oriented, client-server applications. POM's mapping services allow relational, ISAM, and stream-oriented datastores to be integrated into an application's object model. The metadata compiler compiles an object-oriented schema, including all database mappings, to a working C++ object model. This includes all the code necessary to manage object storage to a database.</p>

<p>In addition to the mapping services, POM provides an integrated Object Manager that offers transaction services to C++ applications.  This allows operations such as "rollback," "checkpoint," and "commit" to be applied to in-memory objects as well as to databases. The transaction services are coded to OMG COSS standards that allow POM clients to easily plug in to any OMG-compliant three-tiered environment.</p>

<p>The Secant POM toolset is available for C++ and SOM-enabled languages. It runs on Windows 95/NT and OS/2. POM supports Visual C++, Borland C++, Visual Age C++, ODBC, and Borland's Database Engine (BDE).</p>

<p>NCompass Labs has released ScriptActive, a plug-in that provides ActiveX support for Netscape Navigator. ScriptActive allows intranet and Internet developers to script ActiveX control applications using VBScript, JavaScript, or other ActiveX scripting languages, and run these controls under either Microsoft's ActiveX or Netscape's LiveConnect Frameworks. To provide compatibility between Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, ScriptActive comes with a conversion tool that allows HTML pages featuring ActiveX Controls and VBScript to become directly compatible with Netscape Navigator.</p>

<p>NCompass Labs has also released CaptiveX, a set of ActiveX controls that enable site developers to embed dynamic visual objects into Web pages. </p>

<p>Sinectonalysis has announced four software libraries for the PowerPC. These libraries provide fast routines for edge detections, convolutions or FFT transforms, and the like. Each library has been optimized at the algorithm level to run in the shortest number of cycles for the best possible performance. These libraries can be used on their own, or can be used to prepare for the release of the hand-tuned versions, which will provide substantially increased performance.</p>

<p>In addition to the PowerPC versions, these libraries are also available for Windows NT on the Intel x86, IBM RS/6000, Sun workstations, and Texas Instruments TMS320C4x/TMS320C3x DSPs.</p>

<p>L3 Systems has released the Keyat Keyboard Port Adapter that lets you connect to a PC's keyboard port using either RS-232 or RS-485 interfaces and still be able to use the existing keyboard. The Keyat is designed to aid software testing, allowing a test controller to simulate keyboard use without adding special software or communication hardware to the target computer system. </p>

<p>The Keyat is addressable, and the RS-485 interface allows you to have one host computer to control the testing of up to 58 target systems simultaneously. You can send the Keyat ASCII, scan codes, or keyboard codes. The Keyat can also monitor keyboard sessions for developing regression test data, or for detecting key combinations which are causing software problems. The unit comes with manual and keyboard adapter cable, and is priced at $99.00.</p>

<p>Visigenic has announced its Caffeine, a tool that lets developers of IIOP-based (Internet Inter-ORB Protocol) distributed applications program objects directly in Java. Caffeine, based on Visigenic's VisiBroker for Java technology, provides transparent interoperability between ORB (object request broker) objects implemented in Java and C++. VisiBroker for Java acts as a code generator in Caffeine that takes Java-interface files as input and produces IIOP-compliant objects in return. Caffeine also enables application developers to pass any objects from one machine to another by value. VisiBroker for Java is a Java-based ORB that lets you send object-level messages via any programming language, hardware platform, operating system, or network infrastructure.  </p>

<p>Visigenic has also announced the availability of its VisiODBC Driver for IBM DB2, which allows ODBC-enabled applications to access the complete family of IBM DB2 databases for MVS and VM mainframe, RS/6000 AIX, AS/400, OS/2, and Windows NT.</p>
