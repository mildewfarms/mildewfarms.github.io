<p>Stingray Software has released Visual CASE 1.0, a tool that provides Visual C++ developers with a graphical, object-oriented view of their projects. Visual CASE can import existing projects and provide you with a graphical representation that can be manipulated. You can graphically manipulate projects using Visual CASE (either from scratch or reverse engineered), then generate MFC/ATL source code for Visual C++. Visual CASE supports a subset of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that is appropriate for Visual C++ development. Visual CASE 1.0 fully supports MFC, ATL, ActiveX, and OLE/COM. The Visual CASE App Wizard allows you to export generated code into Microsoft Developer's Studio. Visual CASE comes with complete templates for Stingray's Objective Toolkit and Objective Grid. (To actually use the objects, you must purchase the complete libraries separately.) The retail cost of Visual CASE is $695.00. Subscriptions are available for $295.00.</p>

<p>Embedded C++ (EC++) from Green Hills Software is a C++ compiler that implements a subset of C++ optimized for resource-constrained embedded applications. The EC++ compiler supposedly achieves a 30-90 percent improvement in code size and run-time efficiency over full-blown C++, particularly for applications containing I/O of any kind. Green Hills' C++/EC++ compiler is fully compatible with the draft specification produced by the EC++ Technical Committee. The compiler is available for Motorola 68K and PowerPC family processors. The compiler also produces native code for workstations running Solaris 2.5. Development host options include PCs and workstations running Windows 95/NT, Solaris 2.5, and HP/UX 10.0. Windows 95/NT versions of the Green Hills C++/EC++ compiler cost $3900.00; UNIX versions cost $5400.00.</p>
