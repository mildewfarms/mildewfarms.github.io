<h3><a href="9712a/9712a.htm">OBJECT MODELS AND JAVA</a></h3>
<P><I>by Jean-Marie Chauvet and Marc Lerman</I></P>
<P>Although distributed objects are rapidly becoming the foundation for many applications, differences between object models continue to be a problem. Our authors show how you can use Java to glue together Microsoft's ActiveX controls and the OMG's CORBA objects.

</P>
<h3><a href="9712b/9712b.htm">IMPLEMENTING ABSTRACT FACTORY AS AN STL CONTAINER</a></h3>
<P><I>by Jason Shankel</I></P>
<P>The Abstract Factory design pattern provides an abstract interface for object creation. This allows applications to select object implementation at run time. Jason implements the Abstract Factory pattern using C++ and the Standard Template Library.

<h3><a href="9712c/9712c.htm">C++ AND GARBAGE COLLECTION</a></h3>
<P><I>by Mike Spertus</I></P>
<P>Automatic garbage collection is one reason languages such as Java and Smalltalk are so appealing. C++ programmers can also enjoy the benefits of efficient memory management, with tools such as the Great Circle garbage collector. 

</P>

<h3><a href="9712d/9712d.htm">AUTOMATED METRICS AND OBJECT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT</a></h3>
<P><I>by Jagdish Bansiya and Carl Davis</I></P>
<P>QMOOD++, the automated tool presented here, supports a suite of over 30 object-oriented metrics. In addition to making it easy to collect metric data, QMOOD++ has a repository in which metric data can be stored and retrieved for later comparison. 

</P>

<h3><a href="9712e/9712e.htm">JAVA AND THE ZIP FILE FORMAT</a></h3>
<P><I>by Mark R. Nelson</I></P>
<P>By compressing data and reducing the number of download transactions, Sun's java.util.zip package speeds the loading of applet components across the Internet. Data-compression guru Mark Nelson examines this package.

</P>

<h3><a href="9712f/9712f.htm">WRITING PORTABLE WIN32 SCSI APPLICATIONS</a></h3>
<P><I>by Thomas Tewell</I></P>
<P>The native SCSI APIs for Windows 95 and Windows NT are very different from one another, making portable Win32 SCSI programming difficult. ASPIEMU, the WinASPI <br>32-bit DLL emulator module presented here, can make the job easier.

</P>


<h3><a href="9712g/9712g.htm">IMPROVE YOUR PROGRAMMING WITH ASSERTS</a></h3>
<P><I>by Bruce D. Rosenblum</I></P>
<P>Asserts help you track and fix bugs faster, provided you understand how to use them effectively. Bruce offers ten easy rules for creating more reliable software with asserts.

<h3><a href="9712h/9712h.htm">REAL-TIME OBJECT-ORIENTED MODELING</a></h3>
<P><I>by Kevin W. Smith</I></P>
<P>ObjecTime is a CASE tool that supplies a graphical modeling environment for the object-oriented design and simulation of event-driven real-time systems. Using a formal object-oriented design methodology, graphical models are entered into the ObjecTime toolset, and efficient real-time C++ source code is generated.

<h3><a href="9712i/9712i.htm">BUILDING A SMART ONLINE VIDEO APPLICATION</a></h3>
<P><I>by Robin Rowe</I></P>
<P>Many of today's applications involve Internet protocols, MPEG-1 video, JPEG images, ActiveX components, Netscape plug-ins, and other hard-to-master programming paradigms. Robin describes an application that integrates these disparate technologies.

<h3><a href="9712j/9712j.htm">GNAT: THE GNU NEW YORK UNIVERSITY ADA TRANSLATOR</a></h3>
<P><I>by Gavin Smyth</I></P>
<P>Gavin examines the GNU New York University Ada Translator, a high-quality, low-cost Ada 95 (and Ada 83) compiler that supports DOS, Windows, and various flavors of UNIX. 

</P>

<h3><a href="9712k/9712k.htm">CODESTORE AND INCREMENTAL C++</a></h3>
<p><i>by Lee R. Nackman</i></p>
<P>IBM's CodeStore technology promises fast builds by taking the source code, the previous build's target files, and any other state the system chooses to save to produce the desired target files. For "incremental" builds such as these, build time is proportional to the impact of the source code changed since the last build.
