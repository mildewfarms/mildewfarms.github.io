<p>Headspace's Beatnik is a web-based software system for the creation and playback of interactive music. The Beatnik system consists of the Beatnik Editor and the Beatnik Plug-in. The Beatnik Editor, available for the Macintosh, can import music and sound in a variety of industry-standard file formats, and outputs Real Music Format (RMF), which allows for MIDI music to be integrated with digital audio samples. The Beatnik Plug-in manages playback on web browsers. Beatnik supports a set of Java-callable functions that allow a web site to play music based on user events, such as a mouse-click or a mouse- over. These events can also trigger individual notes, sampled voices, or sound effects; start or stop music; and change tempo, volume, pitch, or mix. The Beatnik Plug-In and the Beatnik Editor are both freely available.</p>

<p>TracePoint Technology announced HiProf, a hierarchical profiler available for the Windows Intel platform. HiProf's hierarchical profiling enables developers to conduct code analysis on the binaries of 32-bit C/C++ Windows applications. Hierarchical profiling shows each function's self-time and the number of calls taking place between all parent and child functions, and the time that the activity takes. This information is displayed in graphical pie charts, histograms, and lists. HiProf instruments and profiles compiled and linked EXEs or DLLs, using its patented Binary Code Instrumentation (BCI) technology. No source code or OBJ files are required with HiProf. HiProf also enables developers to selectively exclude DLLs or portions of their EXE file from profiling in order to drill down on specific portions of an application, or to evaluate third-party components. HiProf reports on multiple threads individually, and supports all applications compiled with Visual C++ 2.x and later. HiProf's suggested retail price is $599.00. </p>

<p>ObjectSpace's Voyager is a platform for agent-enhanced distributed computing in Java. It supports both traditional and agent-enhanced distributed programming techniques to create sophisticated network applications for equipment ranging from desktop computers to embedded consumer devices. Voyager enables you to create agents that can roam a network and continue to execute as they move. Moving agents and other objects can exchange remote messages using regular Java message syntax. Objects can be constructed remotely using the regular Java construction syntax, static methods can be executed remotely, remote exceptions are automatically rethrown to the caller, and serializable objects can be passed and returned by value. Once serializable objects are created, you can move any of these objects to a new location, even while the object is receiving messages. Messages sent to the old location are automatically forwarded to the new location. The entire Voyager system, is 70 KB in a compressed jar file, and 150 KB uncompressed. Voyager is available free for commercial use at the ObjectSpace web site.</p>

<p>SoftQuad International has introduced the SoftQuad AdaptAbility Toolkit, a suite of technologies designed to make the World Wide Web accessible to people with disabilities. SoftQuad AdaptAble Technologies consists of four components: a Visual Dynamic Keyboard, a Screen Enhancer, an integrated screen reader, and customizable user profiles. The Visual Dynamic Keyboard is an on-screen keyboard that lets users enter text, select commands, activate dialog box controls, and so on, without using a traditional keyboard and mouse. The Screen Enhancer is a screen-magnification technology that rerenders the desktop and/or the application in logical ways for better, more intuitive navigation and viewing. SoftQuad's integrated screen reader is both application aware and HTML aware. In addition to standard screen-reader elements, users are able to set up automatic routines for reviewing an HTML page when it appears. SoftQuad's AdaptAble Technologies also include customizable user profiles, in which users can select display and control preferences. User profiles can be selected upon startup, so multiple individuals with varying preferences can use a single terminal.</p>
