<p>TechBridge Technology has introduced RIO Wizard for C++ 2.0, a C++ code generator for client/server applications. RIO Wizard works inside Microsoft's Visual Studio, and produces applications in C++ code using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) and Microsoft's Data Access Objects (DAO) are supported for accessing databases. Using wizards and a visual builder, Visual C++ programmers can create client/server applications complete with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) without leaving the development environment. RIO Wizard also automates the process of packaging applications into ActiveX controls that can either be used as components of a complex software system or embedded in HTML documents. RIO Wizard generates full 32-bit applications. It requires Windows 95/NT and Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0.</p>
