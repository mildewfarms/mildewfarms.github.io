<h2>FEATURES </h2>

<h3><a href="9702a/9702a.htm">UNIT AND REGRESSION TESTING</a></h3>

<h4>by Adrian McCarthy</h4>

<p>Testing a function, module, or object in isolation from the rest of the program -- referred to as "unit testing" -- coupled with rerunning tests to detect unexpected changes in behavior ("regression testing") can dramatically reduce your bug counts. Adrian describes how to build effective units tests and automate regression testing.</p>

<h3><a href="9702b/9702b.htm">A DEBUG/TRACE TOOL</a></h3>

<h4>by Rainer Storn</h4>

<p>The debug/trace tool Rainer presents here is useful when you don't have a powerful debugger at hand, and also when you need to build trace functionality into your code for error-spotting support at the client's site. </p>

<h3><a href="9702c/9702c.htm">JAVA GUI TESTING</a></h3>

<h4>by Alan Walworth   </h4>

<p>As Java development takes off, so does the need to test GUI applications written in Java. Alan examines Java GUI testing issues and presents a test harness written in and for Java.</p>

<h3><a href="9702d/9702d.htm">A DISASSEMBLER WRITTEN IN PERL</a></h3>

<h4>by Tony Zhang</h4>

<p>Tony presents the core subroutines of a disassembler written in Perl. Although designed for Intel's x86 instruction set, you can easily modify or customize the disassembler for your own applications. </p>

<h3><a href="9702e/9702e.htm">EXAMINING THE WINDOWS NT FILESYSTEM</a></h3>

<h4>by Mark Russinovich and Bryce Cogswell</h4>

<p>Mark and Bryce open up the inner workings of the NT filesystem by describing how a filesystem request originates in a user's program and ends up as a disk access. They also present an application called Filemon that monitors and displays all filesystem activity.</p>

<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS </h2>

<h3><a href="9702f/9702f.htm">ROBOTS AND FINITE-STATE MACHINES</a></h3>

<h4>by Everett F. Carter, Jr. </h4>

<p>Designing and building autonomous robots presents a host of technical challenges. Our author focuses on one of these challenges, describing the high-level processing he implemented in designing a robot-control system. </p>
<HR>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS </h2>

<h3><a href="9702g/9702g.htm">UNIX FILESYSTEMS WITHOUT I-NODES</a></h3>

<h4>by Volker Lendecke</h4>

<p>The Linux kernel nfs, smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems make it possible to link Linux machines to file servers across a LAN -- even though Microsoft's SMB protocol is not designed to handle UNIX clients like Linux. Volker presents a workaround for this limitation. </p>
<HR>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S TOOLCHEST</h2>

<h3><a href="9702h/9702h.htm">EXAMINING C++ PROGRAM ANALYZERS</a></h3>

<h4>by Scott Meyers and Martin Klaus</h4>

<p>Our authors examine a bevy of off-the-shelf tools that parse and analyze C++ source code, enabling you to detect troublesome C++ code via static analysis.</p>

<h3><a href="9702i/9702i.htm">TESTING TESTERS</a></h3>

<h4>by Ron van der Wal</h4>

<p>In an ideal world, development progresses smoothly from requirements to completion. In the real world, errors creep in. Ron examines a collection of commercially available automated testing tools that aid in ferreting out those errors.  </p>
