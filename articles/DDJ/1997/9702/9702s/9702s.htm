<p>Infrastructures for Information has announced a desktop edition of its Standard SGML Support System (S4), a real-time SGML language processor. Delivered as middleware, S4 can be embedded in existing software such as word processors, composition tools, databases, and the like. The S4-Desktop API implementation includes over 70 function calls to support SGML-tag searching and navigation, attribute searching and navigation, hypertext navigation, and contact extraction. The S4-Desktop Developer's Package also includes a number of sample applications -- such as a set of Word macros that allow the use of Microsoft Word as the composition engine -- and sample code that shows how to decompose SGML instances into information components, store them in an SQL database, and reassemble them for export as valid SGML files. Also included is an Adobe Exchange Plug-In that automates the process of redoing SGML hotlinks and TOCs into PDF files.</p>

<p>S4-Desktop is delivered as a set of DLLs in the Windows environment and as a set of shared libraries in the Macintosh and UNIX environments. It costs $1500.00 for the Developers License, plus $149.00 per seat run-time charge. Three versions -- 16- and 32-bit for PCs and Macintosh -- are available.</p>
