<h1>The Online Database Derby</h1>
<h3>By Douglas K. Barry</h3>
<hr>
<p>Have you considered using a database manager in either an Internet or intranet environment, but just weren't sure what it could do? Did it seem too risky? Have you been unable to try them out? The upcoming Online Database Derby at http://www.odbmsfacts.com/ gives you a chance to see exactly what database management tools can do on the Web. </p>

<p>The Derby will let you see database management software in action in a real life, multiuser, Internet environment. You'll be able to look at application source code, test product performance, and log on during Derby month to see how the applications fare with continued use. Development times, application source code, and functioning HTML screens running against live databases in a continuously available environment will all be fully available for viewing.</p>

<p>The Online Database Derby is an Internet event planned for September and October, 1997. It will give you an opportunity to see database management products in action on complex data. And this will give you a chance to draw your own conclusions about these products, based on the your own experiences using the products during Derby month.</p>

<p>Any company, using any tools, can be a Derby participant, provided they use some type of database management system (DBMS). Object DBMS and object-relational DBMS vendors, along with vendors providing object interfaces to relational DBMSs and vendors providing web-development tools, are among the expected participants. Consulting firms using any of these products may also wish to participate. This is not an exhaustive list. Again, the main requirement is that the data be stored in a DBMS.</p>

<h3>How Will the Derby Work?</h3>

<p>On Derby Day, September 22, participants will receive a package containing a development assignment. The assignment will include the definition of the data, description of applications, required example screens, and data in a neutral format to be loaded into their databases. The assignment will be a medical record application and data. Development time for the application is anticipated to range from less than one day to several days.</p>

<p>Monitors will ensure that all participants start development at the same time. (A monitor will deliver the package with the development assignments and ensure that the package is opened only at a predesignated time.)</p>

<p>Derby participants will each determine the number of developers they want to use for their assignment. Upon completing the assignment, each participant will report completion, subject to verification by Barry &amp; Associates. Once all participants have completed their work and fine-tuned their implementations, the screens and databases will be available around-the-clock for 21 days.</p>

<p>Each product will be using the same data with access through the same screens. And because visitors to the site can log into the Derby throughout the 21-day period, you can use the applications multiple times throughout those 21 days. In short, the Derby will show what these products can do in the short and long run.</p>

<p>Data will be provided that will allow you to do your own ranking based on the Derby results of most interest and importance to you, rather than declaring an overall winner. There will, however, be two classes of participants -- those who complete all aspects of the Derby and those who do not. Awards will be granted to all participants who complete all aspects of the Derby.</p>
