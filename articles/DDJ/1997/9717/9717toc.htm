<h3><a href="9717a/9717a.htm">ODMG 2.0: An Overview</a></h3>

<p><i>by R.G.G. Cattell and Douglas K. Barry</i></p>

<p>The Object Database Management Group's primary goal is to promote standards for writing portable applications. Release 2.0 of the ODMG standard differs from Release 1.2 in a number of ways, including Java language bindings. In addition, Douglas provides details about the upcoming "Online Database Derby", which will let you see database management software in action in a real-life, multiuser, Internet environment.</p>

<h3><a href="9717b/9717b.htm">Fault Tolerance with Object Databases</a></h3>

<p><i>by Andrew E. Wade</i></p>

<p>As database systems become more distributed, they offer the possibility of dramatically reducing the frequency of failures. Andrew discusses the facilities ODBMSs have to do this, what new facilities they're adding, and how these affect you.</p>

<h3><a href="9717c/9717c.htm">Authorization Models for Object-Oriented Databases </a></h3>

<p><i>by Frank Buddrus</i></p>

<p>To protect data, it is critical that all databases support authorization. Frank presents a flexible approach for providing customized authorization to object-oriented databases. </p>

<h3><a href="9717d/9717d.htm">ODBMS Solutions</a></h3>

<h3><a href="9717e/9717e.htm">Relational C++ Objects</a></h3>

<p><i>by Eric Kass</i></p>

<p>Eric presents a database system that builds on C++ by adding a set of object classes that provide an object-oriented modeling environment. This system overcomes the inherent problem of mapping a hierarchical object schema to flat storage. </p>

<h3><a href="9717f/9717f.htm">Dealing with Java Persistence</a></h3>

<p><i>by Johnny Martin</i></p>

<p>Direct Express for Java is a tool that gives</p>

<p><i>by Ken North</i></p>

<p>As next-generation database architectures evolve, vendors continue their debate over where to install logic and which data types belong in what server. Ken examines the issues, and shows that database developers have more options than ever for deploying discrete logic in the right place. </p>

<h3><a href="9717j/9717j.htm">Web Database Developer</a></h3>
