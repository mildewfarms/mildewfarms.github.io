<p>WexTech Systems released AnswerWorks, a tool that lets you add a natural-language interface to Windows online Help. AnswerWorks lets online Help users get answers to questions phrased in everyday language. AnswerWorks' index building engine parses a Help system and creates a linguistic image that describes the content of every sentence, storing words in root form along with information regarding their syntactical use. The AnswerWorks development system provides an authoring wizard and four predefined end-user interfaces (including ones that look like Microsoft's AnswerWizard and Corel's PerfectExpert), and includes an OLE Automation API that allows developers to create custom interfaces.</p>

<p>AnswerWorks supports English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch for all Windows 3.1/95/NT Help systems, and works with Help authoring tools including Doc-To-Help, Documentation Studio, RoboHELP, ForeHelp, and HDK. The AnswerWorks development system is free and can be downloaded from WexTech's web site. Authors who want to include AnswerWorks technology with their product or system must purchase a separate license for each product and for each language. Licenses cost $795.00.</p>

<p>The MathWorks has introduced tools for modeling, simulating, and prototyping real-time embedded systems applications: Simulink 2.1, Stateflow, and Real-Time Workshop 2.1, respectively. Simulink provides a graphical environment in which users can create block diagram models of their systems and then simulate their performance. Simulink contains a variety of predefined and extensible components for modeling nonlinear dynamic systems of any size or complexity, including continuous time, discrete-time, and hybrid systems.</p>

<p>Stateflow is a graphical tool for designing complex control and supervisory logic systems. Stateflow gives you the ability to model and simulate the behavior of complex reactive, event-based systems based on finite state machine theory. Stateflow also provides automatic C code generation through the optional Stateflow Coder.</p>

<p>Real-Time Workshop 2.1 allows real-time execution of models from Simulink. Real-Time Workshop automates the steps of code generation, and allows customization of this code using its Target Language Compiler. Code is generated as ANSI C for multiple target hardware platforms. All three tools are available for Windows 95/NT, Macintosh, and UNIX platforms.</p>
