VectorC{PC} is typically used within Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0, and can be a replacement for the Visual C/C++ compiler, either over the whole project or on a per-file basis. VectorC{PC} is a "smart compiler" that recognizes parallelisms in standard C/C++ source code, generates vectorized code for the supported CPUs, and automatically utilizes advanced CPU features. It targets all SIMD capable CPUs, including the Intel Pentium 4 and AMD Athlon. </p><p>Codeplay Software Ltd.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>34 Claverton Street</p><p>Pimlico, London, SW1V 3AU</p><p>England</p><p>44-0-131-466-0503</p><p>http://www.codeplay.com/</p><p>Commerce One has made available DocSoapXDK, an open-source, royalty-free web services and SOAP XML Development Kit. DocSoapXDK includes: UNIParser, an XML compiler that parses and validates XML documents and checks for compliance with their XML schema; Xgen, an XML JavaBean generator that lets Java programmers manipulate XML documents without understanding XML; Document Framework APIs for manipulating XML documents through DOM, SAX, and Bean interfaces; and DocSOAP Framework APIs, which generate and process SOAP messages conforming to SOAP 1.1 and 1.2, SOAP with Attachments, and DIME.</p><p>Commerce One</p><p>4440 Rosewood Drive</p><p>Pleasanton, CA 94588-3050</p><p>925-520-6000</p><p>http://www.commerceone.com/</p><p>ARC International has introduced its voice coding library for the customizable ARCtangent-A5 RISC/DSP core. The library includes a full set of codec types, including A-law/5-law, ADPCM, and CELP compression schemes. In addition, the library includes Line and Acoustic echo cancellation (LEC and AEC) algorithms for suppressing analog line and background noise effects. ARC is also offering class and device drivers for High-Speed USB On-The-Go (OTG) applications, and the company's RTOS and networking stack are now integrated with Metrowerk's CodeWarrior Development Studio.</p><p>ARC International</p><p>2099 Gateway Place, Suite 220</p><p>San Jose, CA 95110 </p><p>408-437-3400</p><p>http://www.arc.com/</p><p>QStudio for Java is a source-code  quality-assessment tool that integrates with JBuilder, Oracle 9i JDeveloper, Eclipse, WebSphere Studio, and Visual Age. QStudio for Java Pro 1.9 also lets you write your own rules in Java using the PMD specification. PMD users can extend their rule sets with the ISO quality model by importing them into QStudio and adding the ISO Model attributes. Naming conventions can be established by using regular expressions and customized rule instantiations can be created using rule templates. QStudio is available for Windows, Linux, and Solaris.</p><p>QA Systems BV</p><p>Kosterijland 70-78</p><p>3981 AJ, Bunnik</p><p>The Netherlands</p><p>31-0-30-699-7022</p><p>http://www.qa-systems.com/</p><p>InterACTIVE-Technology has released Version 2.12 of ActiveDeveloper, a run-time Objective-C and C IDE, JIT compiler, and debugger with support for Cocoa. The tool allows incremental compilation of applications as they are edited, thereby speeding testing cycles. Completed applications run natively with no ActiveDeveloper dependency. ActiveDeveloper is available for Mac OS X, Windows, and OpenStep.</p><p>InterActive Technology</p><p>Gyldenrisvej 24</p><p>9380 Vestbjerg</p><p>Denmark</p><p>45-98-29-7400</p><p>http://www.interactive-technology.com/</p><p>EiffelStudio, an Eiffel language plug-in for Microsoft VisualStudio, is available for Mac OS X as a free download. (Windows, Linux, UNIX, VMS, and several embedded systems are already supported.) Features of EiffelStudio 5.3 include: plain English syntax; an object model that includes Design by Contract, multiple inheritance, and genericity; a framework for producing software applications that includes a graphic modeling tool integrated with the implementation (code) view for seamless roundtrip engineering, and a multiplatform GUI builder that generates Eiffel code; and portability to any platform for which EiffelStudio is available.</p><p>Eiffel Software Inc.</p><p>356 Storke Road</p><p>Goleta, CA 93117</p><p>805-685-1006</p><p>http://www.eiffel.com/</p><p>Wavelink has introduced Wavelink Studio EDGE, a mobile application development platform targeting Windows CE, Pocket PC, Java-enabled, and legacy DOS-based wireless devices. Applications built with Studio EDGE can be deployed and administered on J2EE application servers, including IBM WebSphere, BEA WebLogic, and Apache Tomcat. Wavelink offers Wavelink Studio COM (formerly Studio 3.6) for building constantly connected applications for dedicated Windows-based client-server environments. Studio COM supports C, C++, Visual Basic, and other COM programming environments, and is compatible with all current and past versions of Wavelink Studio.</p><p>Wavelink Inc.</p><p>11332 NE 122nd Way, Suite 300 </p><p>Kirkland, WA 98034 </p><p>425-823-0111</p><p>http://www.wavelink.com/</p><p>SIXNET's IPm toolset combines industrial hardware with embedded Linux firmware. With the freely available Linux IPm Application Development Kit, you can write applications to run in SIXNET's LINUX IPm controllers and remote terminal units (RTUs). The IPm applications can be developed in either Red Hat Linux (7.0 or higher) or Windows running on an i386 platform. The IPm Application Development Kit's cross-compiler generates applications to run on the PowerPC in IPm stations. A remote debugger performs diagnostics from Linux.</p><p>SIXNET</p><p>331 Ushers Road, PO Box 767</p><p>Clifton Park, NY 12065</p><p>518-877-5173</p><p>http://www.sixnetio.com/</p><p><b>DDJ</b></p><hr></body></html>
