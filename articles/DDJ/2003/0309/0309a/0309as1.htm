GGF produces technical specifications and guidelines that organizations such as the Globus Project can follow in their own grid-development efforts. Globus Toolkit 3, for example, is based on the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA; http://gridforum.org/ogsa-wg/) specification developed by GGF to provide interoperability of grid services at the architectural level. An important component of this architecture is the Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI; http://gridforum.org/ogsi-wg/), which specifies how standard web services can be used to support grid computing. Globus Toolkit 3 is a reference implementation of the OGSI 1.0 specification, and as such, enables next-generation computing grids. </p><p>&#151;A.E.W.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><a href="0309a.htm#rs1">Back to Article</a></body></html>
