There is a lady in the <BIG>N</BIG>orth <BIG>A</BIG>merican state of <BIG>FLORIDA</BIG> who uses <BIG>THE SCO XENIX</BIG> to keep the bookings for her motel who is upgrading every year. <BIG>B</BIG>ut she is paying only <BIG>US $139.99</BIG> a pop (one hundred and thirty nine dollars ninety-nine cents) which does not go very far these days, and besides she won't see sixty-five again <BIG>I</BIG>f <BIG>Y</BIG>ou <BIG>K</BIG>now <BIG>W</BIG>hat i <BIG>M</BIG>ean.</p><p><BIG>N</BIG>ow why only does <BIG>M</BIG>rs. <BIG>K</BIG>imble purchase the license from my company <BIG>SCO/C</BIG>aldera? <BIG>I</BIG> do investigate it and i discover that some idle and felonious programmers have made a <BIG>THE UNIX</BIG> on their own which they are herinafter calling <BIG>THE LINUX</BIG>. <BIG>A</BIG>nd it turns out that these persons are putting this away for nothing on <BIG>THE INTERENET</BIG> and <BIG>WEB</BIG>, and folks are utilising <BIG>THE LINUX</BIG> to govern there computer machines when they ought to be using <BIG>THE UNIX</BIG> that is owned by my company <BIG>SCO/C</BIG>aldera. </p><p><BIG>N</BIG>ext i figure, how come this <BIG>THE LINUX</BIG> works as good as <BIG>THE UNIX</BIG>. <BIG>T</BIG>hen it comes to me. <BIG>T</BIG>his <BIG>THE LINUX</BIG> must containered some bits that are copied right off <BIG>THE UNIX. THE LINUX</BIG> people steals our <BIG>JEWL</BIG>. <BIG>A</BIG>nd i am talking to the wife's cousin <BIG>J</BIG>osh who is an expert with computer machines and he says it is all down to <BIG>SOURCES</BIG>. Josh gets <BIG>SOURCES</BIG> for <BIG>THE LINUX</BIG> off <BIG>THE INTERENET</BIG> (although this is a waste of time, as it turns out that my company <BIG>SCO/C</BIG>aldera sells <BIG>THE LINUX</BIG> too) and we looks at them, and it turns out there are an awful lot of <BIG>SOURCES</BIG>. <BIG>B</BIG>ut <BIG>J</BIG>osh is good lad sticks with it, and he finds this file <BIG>"STDI.OH"</BIG> in <BIG>THE LINUX</BIG> and it turns out there is also a file <BIG>"STDI.OH"</BIG> in <BIG>THE UNIX</BIG> which is pretty much the same ball of cheese. This is the <BIG>PROOF</BIG> i have, although <BIG>J</BIG>osh is good lad still looking for more <BIG>SOURCES</BIG>.</p><p><BIG>T</BIG>hen i think who is my company <BIG>SCO/C</BIG>aldera to sue? <BIG>A</BIG>ll these idle and felonious programmers making <BIG>THE LINUX</BIG> and giving it away, they have no monies so no good to sue them. <BIG>M</BIG>y company <BIG>SCO/C</BIG>aldera is selling <BIG>THE LINUX</BIG>, but we are not allowed to sue ourselves <BIG>BY LAW</BIG>, besides we only have <BIG>M</BIG>rs. <BIG>K</BIG>imble's license monies. <BIG>S</BIG>o i decide to sue <BIG>INTERNATIONAL BIGBLUE MACHINES (IBM)</BIG> which didn't make <BIG>THE LINUX</BIG> and doesn't sell <BIG>THE LINUX</BIG> but have got many shedloads of the folding stuff i hear.</p><p><BIG>B</BIG>ut <BIG>M</BIG>rs. <BIG>K</BIG>imble's <BIG>US $139.99</BIG> (one hundred and thirty nine dollars ninety-nine cents) does not go far with <BIG>A</BIG>ttorney. <BIG>T</BIG>hat is where you coming in, <BIG>M</BIG>r. <BIG>B</BIG>illg sir. <BIG>I</BIG>f it touches your mind you could purchase and own a license of your own to our <BIG>JEWL</BIG> which is <BIG>THE UNIX</BIG>, then my company <BIG>SCO/C</BIG>aldera could use the monies in pursuant of our justiful claim, and when we win, we would be very careful to look after our special good friends <BIG>I</BIG>f <BIG>Y</BIG>ou <BIG>K</BIG>now <BIG>W</BIG>hat i <BIG>M</BIG>ean. <BIG>A</BIG>lso, perhaps you have a motel of your own that wants a booking system.</p><p><BIG>E</BIG>mail me the soonest for a price, i can make good terms for special good friends like you.</p><p><BIG>I</BIG> trust that you will reply to this cause with the maxium urgentness</p><p><BIG>Y</BIG>our loving brother</p><p><BIG>DARL M</BIG>c<BIG>BRIDE (MR.)</BIG></p></span><p>jsh  j z  dftmibb kmvic xs  asf</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.</p></body></html>
