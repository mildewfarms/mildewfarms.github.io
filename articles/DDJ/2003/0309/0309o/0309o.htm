The company claims that GridServer is the first product that provides a scalable platform that hosts web services and applications over a grid of commodity processors, performing thousands of web-service requests in parallel. In other words, GridServer extends applications to operate in a distributed computing environment across a virtual pool of underutilized computing resources. The software creates a self-managed grid-computing infrastructure that runs on Linux, UNIX, or Windows, providing automated process management, a scalable programming architecture, real-time distribution, guaranteed service execution, distributed data caching, and self-recovering adaptive load balancing.</p><p>DataSynapse Inc.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>632 Broadway, 5th Floor</p><p>New York, NY 10012</p><p>212-842-8842</p><p>http://www.datasynapse.com/</p><p>Celoxica's DK Design Suite provides a C language design environment for Xilinx's Spartan-3 FPGAs. With the Celoxica tools, you can partition designs between hardware and software, verify the system using high-level languages, and synthesize from C-based models to Xilinx Spartan-3 devices. The Celoxica methodology uses C, C++, System-C, and Handel-C to raise design abstraction. The common language base facilitates design functionality between hardware and software implementations. The toolset also provides cycle-accurate simulation of C-based models and cosimulation with FSMLab's Real-Time Linux simulators and models developed in The MathWorks Matlab/Simulink environment.</p><p>Celoxica Inc.</p><p>900 East Hamilton Avenue</p><p>Campbell, CA 95008</p><p>800-570-7004</p><p>http://www.celoxica.com/</p><p>Trolltech has released Qt Script for Applications (QSA), which makes Qt applications scriptable. QSA lets you prototype changes in already-compiled applications; write test scripts; customize applications; script-enable applications to enable macros; and provide script-based fixes for previously released applications. The QSA toolkit includes: QSA SDK, which lets you make applications scriptable; Qt Script, a multiplatform interpreted scripting language based on the ECMAScript standard; QSA Workbench, a lightweight scripting environment that provides code formatting, syntax highlighting, code completion, and stack-trace output; and Input Dialog Framework, a high-level GUI API for writing dialogs.</p><p>Trolltech Inc.</p><p>1860 Embarcadero Road, Suite 100</p><p>Palo Alto, CA 94303</p><p>650-813-1676</p><p>http://www.trolltech.com/</p><p>The dtSearch Text Retrieval Engine lets you add dtSearch's text retrieval capabilities to web-based and other applications. The dtSearch Engine supports SQL, ADO, C++, .NET, Delphi, and Java. The 6.2 release adds a Linux version of the dtSearch Engine for C++ and Java developers and has additional Java, C++, and .NET (ASP.NET, VB.NET, C++.NET, C#) code samples and extensions to the developer APIs. dtSearch offers over two dozen indexed, unindexed, fielded, and full-text search options, and the new release also includes forensic search enhancements: Text segments in large data blocks, such as those recovered through an "undelete" process, can be automatically parsed. Language recognition algorithms can detect text in a variety of languages.</p><p>dtSearch Corporation</p><p>6852 Tulip Hill Terrace</p><p>Bethesda, MD 20816</p><p>301-263-0731</p><p>http://www.dtsearch.com/</p><p>FairCom has released the new c-treeSQL Server for Windows, a database server incorporating a SQL engine built on the core of the c-tree Server. This new technology includes embedded SQL and interactive SQL utilities as well as JDBC and ODBC drivers. In conjunction with this release, FairCom released a new edition of its c-tree Plus embedded database development system with new VCL and CLX components for working in Borland environments and new C and C++ interfaces simplifying the development and management of databases.</p><p>FairCom Corporation</p><p>2100 Forum Blvd., Suite C</p><p>Columbia, MO 65203-5456</p><p>573-445-6833</p><p>http://www.faircom.com/</p><p>pure-systems has launched AspectC++ Add-In for Visual Studio, designed to facilitate the modular implementation of software aspects in C++. Aspects can be used to implement crosscutting concerns like error checking and handling, synchronization, or caching. AspectC++ Add-In allows the separated development of program code and aspect code; program code is unaffected by crosscutting concerns and is only merged with aspect code when being compiled.</p><p>pure-systems GmbH</p><p>Agnetenstr. 14</p><p>39106 Magdeburg, Germany</p><p>+49-391-544-569-0</p><p>http://www.pure-systems.com/</p><p>Amzi! has adopted the Eclipse IDE for its Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server. The Eclipse open-source project IDE supports features such as syntax coloring in the editor, source-file outlining, source-level debugging, and seamless integration with source-control systems. The Amzi! extensions for Eclipse provide the ability to run/debug both interpreted and compiled Prolog code; full source code debugging showing variable bindings at each level in the call stack; full source debugging of Prolog components embedded in other languages and tools, and those running on remote machines. </p><p>Amzi!

Version 6.2 allows you to create custom Build Types using any of the available ANT attributes, then dynamically generate ANT build scripts at build time. It also features expanded support for .NET, an Eclipse Plug-in, and Ready for WebSphere Studio Validation. Openmake 6.2 supports builds on Z/OS, USS, OS/390, LINUX, HP/UX, AIX, Solaris, Windows, and Mac OS.</p><p>Catalyst Systems Corporation</p><p>5385 Hollister Ave., Suite 207</p><p>Santa Barbara, CA 93111</p><p>805-696-6866</p><p>http://www.openmake.com/</p><p><b>DDJ</b></p><hr></body></html>
