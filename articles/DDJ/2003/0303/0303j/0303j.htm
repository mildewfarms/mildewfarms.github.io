Job one, of course, is <i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i>&#151;the magazine. In terms of focus, scheduling, and every other important issue, <i>DDJ</i> is&#151;and always will be&#151;da man. Still, special projects abound, and at times, we even enlist former editors to help out. So if what follows comes across as a thinly veiled sales pitch, well, step right up&#151;and would you like fries with that CD?</p><p>For starters, in conjunction with this issue's focus on XML, we're launching <i>Dr. Dobb's XML Resource CD-ROM.</i> Developed by former <i>DDJ</i> executive editor and <i>Web Techniques</i> magazine editor-in-chief Michael Floyd, <i>Dr. Dobb's XML Resource CD-ROM</i> has the full-text to Michael's bestselling books<i> Building Web Sites with XML</i> and <i>Special Edition Using XSLT, </i>along with his industry-leading "Beyond HTML" and "XML@ Large" columns from <i>Web Techniques </i>(1998-2001). In addition, the CD-ROM has full source and documentation for Michael's Rocket XML Framework, a tool that enables Internet Information Servers (IIS) as XML document servers, and includes the Document Type Definitions (DTDs), XSLT style sheets, and Document Object Model (DOM) scripts that let web servers serve XML documents. Also, the CD contains an XML tools database, a comprehensive list of XML resources with links, and much more. You can find out more about <i>Dr. Dobb's XML Resource CD-ROM </i>at http://www.ddj.com/ and http://store.yahoo.com/ddjcdroms/. </p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>Then there's the e-book<i> .NET Programming With Visual C++ </i>that managing editor Deirdre Blake and senior production editor Monica Berg have been working on. Written by well-known game designer and <i>DDJ</i> author Max Fomitchev, <i>.NET Programming With Visual C++ </i>is delivered in PDF format, delves into the .NET Framework and Managed Extensions to C++, and provides a complete reference to the basic and advanced types contained in the .NET Framework System namespace. Max also examines .NET collections, the <i>System::IO </i>namespace, ADO.NET, ASP.NET web services, web service protocols (HTTP-GET, HTTP-POST, and SOAP), and the Web Services Definition Language (WSDL).<i> .NET Programming with Visual C++</i> is available either on CD-ROM (see http://store.yahoo.com/ddjcdroms/) or as a download (http://www.ddj.com/).</p><p>For their part, Kevin Carlson and Della Song have been wearing not one, not two, but at least three (or more) hats. In addition to building <i>Dr. Dobb's CD-ROM Release 14,</i> which includes all of <i>Dr. Dobb's Journal </i>from January 1988 through December 2002 (again see http://store.yahoo.com/ddjcdroms/), Kevin is executive editor, and Della managing editor, of <i>The Perl Journal,</i> an  e-zine that focuses on the Perl language. <i>TPJ</i> is also delivered in PDF format and can be downloaded at http://www.tpj.com/. To entice new subscribers (and reward current ones), they've arranged to make available, at a big discount, the recently released <i>Computer Science &amp; Perl Programming,</i> published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates. Edited by <i>TPJ</i> founding editor Jon Orwant, <i>Computer Science &amp; Perl Programming</i> includes 70 articles from the early years of <i>TPJ</i> covering hardcore computer science, advanced programming techniques, and the underlying mechanics of Perl. You can find out more at http://store.yahoo.com/sdmgcd-store/comscienandp1.html.</p><p>In addition to writing his long-running "Programming Paradigms" and long-irritating "Swaine's Flames" columns, editor-at-large Michael Swaine coordinates a slew of e-mail newsletters, including the recently launched <i>AI Expert Newsletter,</i> edited by Dennis Merritt, and <i>Al Stevens's C Programming Newsletter,</i> by (you guessed it) senior contributing editor Al Stevens. The <i>AI Expert Newsletter, </i>for instance, is based on the now-defunct<i> AI Expert</i> magazine, and includes commentary, articles, news, and more about current goings-on in the artificial intelligence field. Other free newsletters that Michael works on include the: <i>Data Compression Newsletter, </i>edited by Mark Nelson; <i>Active Scripting Newsletter,</i> edited by Mark Baker;<i> Math Power Newsletter, </i>edited by Homer Tilton;<i> Linux Digest Newsletter, </i>edited by Steven Gibson; and <i>Dr. Dobb's Software Tools Newsletter,</i> an expanded version of the "Of Interest" section of the magazine. To subscribe to any of these free e-publications (available in both text and HTML format), go to http://www.ddj.com/maillists/.</p><p>Not to be left out, news editor Shannon Cochran is doing double-duty as managing editor of BYTE.com (http://www.byte.com/). The good news is that with the recent shift of BYTE.com to a fee-based model, we can start publishing more and more articles. However, it also means that Shannon has more work to do than she originally bargained for. The upside, of course, is that Shannon gets to talk to Jerry Pournelle whenever she wants. To encourage readers to sign up for BYTE.com access, Shannon is offering a package deal that includes the BYTE CD-ROM, with full content of the venerable <i>BYTE</i> magazine from 1990 through March 1998.

Hey, it's a dirty job, but someone has to do it.</p><p><br>Jonathan Erickson<br>editor-in-chief<br>jerickson@ddj.com<br></p></body></html>
