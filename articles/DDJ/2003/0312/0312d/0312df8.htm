I show two copies of F for clarity. Working right-to-left, the copy on the right represents the previous range, and the one on the left is new. To search: 1. Take all blocks  starting with b; 2. search this set for the first i where FL[i]³startp, and the last j where FL[j]&lt;=endp; everything in this [i,j] range must map into the target interval between startp and endp. This [i,j] interval identifies all bs that are followed by r; in other words, all blocks starting with "br." i and j become the new startp/endp for the next step.</h4><a href="0312d.htm#rf8">Back to Article</a></body></html>
