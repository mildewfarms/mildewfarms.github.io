Systems engineers and C programmers can create functional block diagrams while remaining inside the UML 2.0 environment. You can also select options to optimize the code size to reduce required ROM and RAM, or to generate code compliant with the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association's guidelines. In addition, Rhapsody 5.0 features enhanced Sequence Diagrams, Ports, Tags, Information Flows, Statechart Inheritance, and Structured Classes. </p><p>I-Logix</p><p>Three Riverside Drive</p><p>Andover, MA 01810</p><p>978-682-2100</p><p>http://www.ilogix.com/</p><p>Parasoft has updated both its SOAPtest and .TEST error prevention tools. SOAPtest 2.1 includes support for ebXML and automatically performs server testing, load testing, and client testing as well as creating test suites from WSDL documents. SOAPtest runs on Windows 2000/XP, Linux, and Solaris. .TEST is a set of over 200 built-in coding standards for Visual C# .NET, Visual Basic .NET, and managed Visual C++ .NET; and it now includes RuleWizard, a tool for designing custom-coding standards. </p><p>Parasoft</p><p>101 E.

Adept ActiveV+ lets a PC issue direct real-time robot motion and monitor commands over an Ethernet- or FireWire-based high-speed bus. Using Microsoft's ActiveX controls, ActiveV+ lets you develop programs in native PC languages (like Visual Basic and C++) to integrate Adept HexSight PC-based machine vision software and third-party PC-based automation.</p><p>Adept Technology Inc.</p><p>3011 Triad Drive</p><p>Livermore, CA 94551</p><p>925-245-3400</p><p>http://www.adept.com/</p><p>Workstate has announced Codify 1.3, an add-in for Visual Studio .NET that generates code from templates, replacing repetitive code patterns in projects. New to Version 1.3 is C++ embedded code generation, in addition to C# and VB .NET; file-based code generation, regardless of language; a template editor that runs as a standalone application, outside of Visual Studio; and enhanced workgroup features such as networked template locations.</p><p>Workstate</p><p>760 South Third Street</p><p>Columbus, OH 43206</p><p>412-436-0603</p><p>http://www.workstate.com/</p><p>Aonix has released PERC 4.1, a JVM that provides a pacing agent and profiling tools designed to help you achieve real-time control of your applications. Using a new garbage-collection pacing API, the PERC 4.1 pacing agent monitors the memory allocation behavior of the application workload and automatically adjusts the timing and ratios of CPU-time increments dedicated to garbage collection activities. Source code for the pacing agent is provided if you need to fine-tune your code for specialized system needs. PERC 4.1 also includes AOT and JIT compiler optimizations, as well as new platform support.</p><p>Aonix North America Inc.</p><p>5040 Shoreham Place, Suite 100</p><p>San Diego, CA 92122</p><p>858-457-2700</p><p>http://www.aonix.com/</p><p>M7 Application Assembly Suite Version 4.0 provides rapid application development (RAD) support for building web apps with Java.
