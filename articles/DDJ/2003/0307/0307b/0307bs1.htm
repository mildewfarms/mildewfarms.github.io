Environment variable names are operating-system dependent.</p><p></p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><ul>  <li>Linux machines. The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a colon-separated list of directories to be searched for libCJavaInterface.so. For example, if you use the C shell and your library is in /home, the command<i> setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home </i>ensures that the directory /home gets searched.  <li>Other UNIX machines. The environment variable is likely discussed in the man page for the <i>ld</i> command, or in a command referenced by that man page. Common names include LD_LIBRARY_PATH and SHLIB_PATH.  <li>Microsoft Windows. There is no separate environment variable used for locating DLLs. The PATH variable is searched, so CJavaInterface.dll must reside somewhere in your path.</ul><p>&#151;M.P.</p><a href="0307b.htm#rs1">Back to Article</a></body></html>
