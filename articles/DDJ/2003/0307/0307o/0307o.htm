JProfiler integrates CPU, memory, and thread profiling, and works with IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA and Borland JBuilder 8. Version 2.2 adds a session type for profiling Java Web Start applications, a class-resolved real-time allocations monitor, offline profiling for scripted profiling runs, a profiling API for controlling JProfiler at run time, reworked session configuration, new and improved application server integration wizards, and performance improvements.</p><p>ej-technologies GmbH</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>Schwanthalerstr. 178</p><p>D-80399 Munich</p><p>Germany</p><p>206-984-9405</p><p>http://www.ej-technologies.com/</p><p>XMLSPY 5 Release 4 from Altova adds new features to the XML development tool. WebDAV support has been enhanced with Delta-V, an extension to the WebDAV protocol that enables check-in/check-out functionality when used in conjunction with a WebDAV server. The Stylesheet Designer, which presents a template-based UI for editing XML files, supports conditional statements, supports PDF header or cover pages, and direct use of global templates. Also, when creating XML Bindings, the XMLSPY code generator supports Xerces (a popular XML parser), Standard Template Library (STL), and additional XML Schema simple types in Java/C# code generation.</p><p>Altova Inc.</p><p>900 Cummings Center, Suite 314 T</p><p>Beverly, MA 01915-6181</p><p>978-816-1600</p><p>http://www.altova.com/</p><p>Intel has released two versions of its VTune Performance Analyzer 7.0 and VTune Enterprise Analyzer 2.0 performance analyzers for .NET. The Performance Analyzer supports Visual Studio .NET 2003, while the Enterprise Analyzer finds bottlenecks in multitier apps running across multiple Intel machines and provides transaction-level analysis and .NET object-level diagnostics. Intel has also updated its open-source compiler tools for Linux. Version 2.0 of the Open Research Compiler, developed in partnership with the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is aimed at advanced compiler and microarchitecture research. Finally, the Intel Thread Checker 1.0 is designed to help locate bugs in applications that incorporate Hyper-Threading Technology.</p><p>Intel Corp.</p><p>2200 Mission College Boulevard</p><p>Santa Clara, CA 95052</p><p>408-765-8080</p><p>http://www.intel.com/</p><p>Relativity Technologies' Modernization Workbench suite (formerly RescueWare) is a set of tools for maintaining and modernizing mainframe applications. The Modernization Workbench consists of four customizable modules. The Application Analyzer is a non-invasive interactive tool that creates a comprehensive repository of all system relationships including source code, system files, DDL, and screen maps. The Application Architect lets you automatically componentize large Cobol programs into multiple structure, computational, or domain-based components. The Business Rule Manager is used to identify, document, and classify business rules. The fourth module is the Transformation Assistant, which supports migration of legacy application components using Java, C++, Visual Basic, XML, or DDL.</p><p>Relativity Technologies Inc.</p><p>1001 Winstead Drive</p><p>Cary, NC 27513</p><p>919-678-1500</p><p>http://www.relativity.com/</p><p></p><p>REALbasic 5 for Windows is a tool for Windows users of all levels, which supports the development of custom applications and can compile them for both Windows and Macintosh. The product supports Windows-specific features such as ActiveX/COM, Registry access, and Win32 API calls. Windows apps created with REALbasic do not require an installer or DLLs. REALBasic is similar to Visual Basic in design and syntax, and includes a VB project conversion utility. REALBasic 5.1 for Macintosh is also available.</p><p>REAL Software Inc.</p><p>1705 South Capital of Texas Highway, </p><p>Suite 310</p><p>Austin, Texas 78746</p><p>512-328-7325</p><p>http://www.realsoftware.com/</p><p>DarkBASIC is a version of Basic tailored for game development, offering commands that can control 3D objects, landscape terrains, sprites, sound, music, and multiplayer features. It has over 700 commands. The low-resolution default program editor is not based in a Windows environment, and allows fast development swapping between the program and the game. If you prefer a more traditional Windows application, you can choose from third-party editors; a command-line interface is also available. DarkBASIC ships with tutorials and an integrated help system.</p><p>Dark Basic Software Ltd</p><p>"Rockville," Warrington Road</p><p>Lower Ince, Wigan</p><p>Lancashire WN3 4QG</p><p>UK</p><p>+44 8451275338</p><p>http://www.darkbasic.com/</p><p>Metrowerks is shipping CodeTEST Software Analysis Tools 4.0, designed to let you view the execution history of your embedded systems at the source or RTOS level. Instrumentation tags are inserted in the source code during compilation, allowing these tags to be captured as the software is executed. The suite includes performance and memory analysis, code coverage, and software execution trace tools, available in three variations: native, software probe, and hardware probe configurations.</p><p>Metrowerks</p><p>9801 Metric Boulevard</p><p>Austin, TX 78758</p><p>512-997-4700</p><p>http://www.metrowerks.com/</p><p>Parasoft's Global Reporting System is a support infrastructure that collects and correlates all information within Parasoft Enterprise Solutions. It consists of a relational database that stores information from different testing and monitoring tools, used for statistical analysis and evaluation of historical system behavior; a data collector that receives data from all Parasoft and third party tools; and a reporting engine that correlates all collected data into a single unit.</p><p>Parasoft</p><p>2031 South Myrtle Avenue</p><p>Monrovia, CA 91016</p><p>626-256-3680</p><p>http://www.parasoft.com/</p><p><b>DDJ</b></p><hr></body></html>
