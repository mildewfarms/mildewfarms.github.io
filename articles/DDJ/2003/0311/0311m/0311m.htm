The big problem with crashes, they say, is not the actual fault itself so much as the time taken to reboot. Inevitably there is an -oriented name for this approach&#151;recovery-oriented computing or "ROC." A ROC/rock pun is included in the text. Instead of a single system reboot, there are lots of automatic microreboots, which isolate the part of the system that had failed and simply...</p><blockquote><p><b>Programmers of the World:</b> Hey there!</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p><b>Myself:</b> ...and simply and swiftly cause that subsystem and its dependent subsystems<b></p><p>Programmers of the World:</b> Hey there, Verity Stob!<b></p><p>Myself, </b><i><b>irritably</i></b><b>: </b>Yes, what is it?<b></p><p>Programmers of the World:</b> Is it going to be like this all the way? <b></p><p>Myself: </b>The change will do you good.

The great attraction of the fair was a wonderful roller coaster that had been built with this unusual design feature: The change of height over any short section of track was proportional to the cosine of theta. </p><p>The party of three enjoyed many turns on this ride, until Chapman's daughter began to complain of feeling unwell, with a strange blocking sensation inside her nose. Chapman was all for letting her go off and seek medical attention by herself, but Keats spoke against this plan.</p><p>"Best to stay with her," advised the poet. "I think she's a bit sinusoidal."</p><hr><h3>Catechism of Clichi</h3><blockquote><p>Just where in [corporal|corporate] terms have IT<sup>1</sup> directors been playing their cards?</p><p>Close to their chests.</p><p>And from which direction might these persons expect a lash against IT<sup>2</sup>?</p><p>They expect a backlash against IT<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>And what item of software applications from this same direction stimulated this lash?</p><p>A backlog of software applications.</p><p>Correct.

(<i>Reader's voice: Off-topic? How can we tell?</i>) It is also the 40th anniversary of my contemporary, <i>Doctor Who</i>, and doubtless there will be much Who-har concerning which of his girlfriends tripped up and gave the game away most stupidly, which actor played The Doctor best (Patrick Troughton), and so on. Amid this festival of trivia and joy, I would strike a more serious note.</p><p>Although everybody is familiar with the small, light, white cylinders so often used as a packing material for computers and electronic goods, an astonishing proportion of the population is ignorant of their origin. With a whole industry dependent on them, it is time everybody knew the ugly truth about Dalek droppings. Daleks have been farmed for their guano since 1965, when a certain entrepreneur purchased a breeding pair from a Dr. Banardos home, where the BBC had callously abandoned them after it had finished filming. Today there are many Dalek farms across the developed world; their ray guns are cruelly docked for "safety reasons," their movements restricted to a small concrete compound by a vicious two-foot-wide gravel path. Just <IMG SRC="euro.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="14">12,000 trillion is sufficient to send a Dalek home to the planet Skaro. With your help, we could soon see many of these creatures breathing once more the poisonous radioactive atmosphere of their world and exterminating the annoying blond Thal people.
