Looking at the number of features in many modern software applications, it's clear that all features cannot be tested in a finite amount of time. Therefore, to hone in on features most likely to contain security vulnerabilities, we use a scoring mechanism that assigns weights to features to help allocate testing resources. Application scoring is not new. Michael Howard and David LeBlanc present an excellent feature-scoring scheme based on source-code access in their book <i>Writing Secure Code</i>, Second Edition (Microsoft Press, 2002). Our scoring has the requirement that features must be assigned values quickly&#151;without access to, or analysis of, the application's source. In our approach, testers simply mark-off against a list of properties that may have security implications. </p><ul>  <li>Is it a security feature? [+4]  <li>Is it a new feature? [+3]  <li>Does it use the network? [+3]  <li>Does it use permissions? [+2]  <li>Does it run as a privileged user? [+1]  <li>Are there known vulnerabilities in previous versions? [+1]  <li>Does it use a Database Management System (DBMS) such as SQL? [+2]  <li>Does the feature use structured data? [+2]  <li>Are there severe consequences of failure of this component to the rest of the application? [+3]  <li>Does this feature use concepts of persistent state? [+3]  <li>Are there any dynamic conversions? [+2]  <li>Are certain categories of inputs/actions blocked (as malicious)? [+2]</ul><p>The weightings have been derived through iterative refinement on multiple testing projects. The score an application receives as a result is highly correlated to the number and severity of security vulnerabilities discovered, not just during our testing, but also by the user community after software release. </p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>&#151;H.H.T. and S.G.C.</p><a href="0311a.htm#rs1">Back to Article</a></body></html>
