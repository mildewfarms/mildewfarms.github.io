The PGI Workstation 5.Beta release includes the PGF77, PGF90, PGCC, and PGC++ compilers that take advantage of the 64-bit processing capabilities of AMD Opteron processors. This includes the ability to operate on data sets that are too large for 32-bit X86-compatible processors. The compilers also take advantage of the expanded register sets and processor features of the AMD Opteron to enable more efficient execution of compute-intensive applications. The toolset will also be updated to include PGI Workstation 5.0 32-bit compilers, optimized for Opteron, and 32-bit X86 processors.</p><p>STMicroelectronics</p><p>8338 NE Alderwood Road, Suite 195</p><p>Portland, OR 97220 </p><p>503-282-4941 </p><p>http://www.pgroup.com/AMD64/</p><p>ThinPrint GmbH has announced the availability of a free SDK for ThinPrint .print, a Windows-based infrastructure for printing and delivering content to mobile devices via the Internet.
