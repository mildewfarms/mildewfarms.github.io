The bad news is that it is not a trivial procedure to configure FreeS/WAN under Windows. Still, there are some good documentation sites and utilities that minimize the pain.</p><p>Here are the general steps required to set up a secure wireless network with a Windows machine as the client. A Linux box running FreeS/WAN is still the security gateway. </p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>1.	Apply an X.509 patch to the FreeS/WAN distribution on the Linux security gateway.</p><p>2.	Set up a Certificate Authority (CA) on the security gateway (requires OpenSSL).</p><p>3.	Install a Root certificate on the Linux security gateway.</p><p>4.	Generate a certificate (in the appropriate format) for the Windows client.</p><p>5.	Configure FreeS/WAN on the security gateway to use X.509 certificates (generally).</p><p>6.	Configure FreeS/WAN to reference the certificate for the Windows client.</p><p>7.	Create an IPSEC and Certificates Microsoft Management Console.</p><p>8.	Import the generated certificate on the Windows client.</p><p>9.	Configure Marcus Mueller's IPsec utility for Windows (see http://vpn .ebootis.de/).</p><p>10.	Establish the IPsec connection from the client to the security gateway.</p><p></p><p>&#151;M.S.</p><a href="0306c.htm#rs1">Back to Article</a></body></html>
