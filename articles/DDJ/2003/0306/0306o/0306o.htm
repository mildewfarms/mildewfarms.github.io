It usually makes about as much sense as one of those awful palindromic poems. This time, I decided to publish the result, not because it's any better than the others, but just to get the urge out of my system. The result can be read as an interview with a software company CEO who's been driven over the edge by Microsoft shock and awe. The sources of the sentences appear at the bottom of the page.</p><blockquote><p><i>What is your problem?</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>It's difficult for me to defeat Microsoft. They have a chronic lack of girlfriends, are usually socially inadequate. They want to go into the rainforest of human thought and mow the thing down.</i><i></p><p>You have to understand the cultural issues there.</i></p><p>The man ain't got no culture. I'd like to poke [name suppressed for legal reasons] in the nose. He's commercialized his own pathologies and repressions into a lucrative career. I bet dollars to donuts he's got a zany "Why be normal?" bumper sticker on his car.<i></p><p>How about Newt Gingrich? Culture is sometimes the enemy.</i></p><p>Newt Gingrich is the authority on nanoelectronics! [He] brings an incredible wealth of knowledge and wisdom to [it] from having helped run the largest organization in the world&#151;the United States government.<i></p><p>I can't talk to you about that because I don't know anything about it.</i></p><p>Microsoft has 15,000 people in their Microsoft Windows division&#151;I have 50 in my entire company&#151;this gives me a significant advantage. We have a meeting room with a big, round, expensive table. We are moving into the field of religion and will be performing real miracles!<i></p><p>Walking on hot coals is a rite of passage&#151;you will never be the same.</i></p><p>Who cares&#151;they've been warned.<i></p><p>There is not a germ of truth in this.</i></p><p>Perhaps the truth is less interesting than the facts?<i></p><p>When did you lose it?</i></p><p>I'm adjusting; I'm mentally prepared to sell my airplane.<i></p><p>Just leave it on the porch, and someone will pick it up.</p><p>How's that again? And I thought I was crazy.</p></blockquote><p>Sources (numbers refer to the paragraphs above):</p><blockquote><p>1.
