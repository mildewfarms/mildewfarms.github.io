It supports standards such as SOAP and XML; and features map data covering the world and the ability to find street addresses in the U.S., Canada, and many Western European countries. New features in Version 3.0 include broader geographic coverage, more points of interest, and reverse geocoding.</p><p>Microsoft Corp.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>1 Microsoft Way</p><p>Redmond WA 98052</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/</p><p>Littlearth has announced the release of an Internet language called "Document Markup Language" (DML) and a web site, http://www.formshere.com/, which lets you use the Internet to create DML web pages that are connected to databases so that information can be collected, stored, retrieved, displayed, and provided in a customized format. DML is a higher level language for the Internet that is fully compatible with HTML and lets you create web pages on-the-fly. The web site lets nontechnical or novice Internet users build or modify custom web forms/documents that contain fields for data entry so that data can be entered by anyone with Internet access, stored in a database, and retrieved in customized format via the Internet. </p><p>Littlearth Inc.</p><p>10513 Mercado Way</p><p>Montgomery Village, MD 20886</p><p>301-806-8991</p><p>http://www.formshere.com/</p><p>Realtime Soft has released Version 2.0 of the UltraMon Developer Edition, a collection of components that lets you add multimonitor support to your applications. It is a COM-based multimonitor API, which can be used from most programming languages and environments, including Visual Basic, C++, and .NET. With UltraMon Developer 2.0, you can get and set monitor properties (resolution, enabled, primary, and so on), move or desktop-maximize windows, provide a UI for visually selecting a monitor, and treat a monitor as if it is detached from the desktop (Virtual Independent Displays feature). It is available for Windows 98 and later.</p><p>Realtime Soft</p><p>Neufeldstrasse 27</p><p>3012 Bern</p><p>Switzerland</p><p>41-31-301-79-18</p><p>http://www.realtimesoft.com/</p><p>SimBionic, from Stottler Henke Associates, is a visual authoring tool and run-time engine for creating complex behaviors through the use of artificial intelligence. It lets you easily define how computer-generated people, systems, or other entities act and respond to virtual situations. The visual authoring tool is a standard Windows application that presents its logic graphically, thereby communicating more information to more people compared to textual methods. The run-time engine takes the behavior description and makes it operational within a game or training simulation. The engine is scalable and provides a C++ API so you can easily interface it with simulations and games. The SimBionic authoring tool runs on Windows 98/NT/2000/XP. The SimBionic run-time engine runs on the aforementioned operating systems, as well as Linux. </p><p>Stottler Henke Associates Inc.</p><p>1660 South Amphlett Blvd., Suite 350 </p><p>San Mateo, CA 94402</p><p>650-655-7242</p><p>http://www.stottlerhenke.com/</p><p>Intel has introduced Version 7.0 of its Intel C++ and Intel Fortran compilers for Windows and Linux. The compilers support many features of Compaq Visual Fortran, including command-line compatibility, and also include integration into Microsoft Visual Studio. The Linux version provides GNU compatibility to C++ with the adoption of the C++ application binary interface. Also new in Version 7.0 is an auto-parallelization option that automatically looks for opportunities in applications to create multiple execution threads and enhancements to OpenMP support.</p><p>Intel Corp.</p><p>2200 Mission College Boulevard</p><p>Santa Clara, CA 95052</p><p>408-765-8080</p><p>http://www.intel.com/</p><p>Browsersoft has released its eQ! Foundation, a declarative development framework for designing, developing, and maintaining Java-based systems. It provides a flexible, architect-friendly development environment that reduces resource, timeline, and maintenance requirements by allowing applications to be primarily configured rather than written from scratch. </p><p>Browsersoft Inc.</p><p>450 Navajo Lane</p><p>Shawnee Mission, KS 66217</p><p>913-851-2453</p><p>http://www.browsersoft.com/</p><p>IDAutomation.com has announced the release of Linear .NET Barcode Forms Control, which allows for integration of barcode technology directly into .NET Framework applications. Managed code control is provided with sample projects in C# and VB.NET. It is compatible with any development environment that can utilize .NET Forms Controls. Several bar code symbologies are supported including Code 39, Code 128, UCC-128, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPC, EAN, Codabar, and POSTNET. The control can be used to create barcodes in WMF, JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, and other image files. It also includes many other features including device-independent graphics, data binding, adjustable orientation, and strong name support. </p><p>IDAutomation.com Inc.</p><p>550 N.
