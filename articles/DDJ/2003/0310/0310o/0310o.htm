Over 100 new algorithms for symbolic and numeric computation have been implemented by in-house developers. In addition to updated versions of J/Link and MathLink, Mathematica's standard connections to Java and C/C++, Mathematica 5 comes with the .NET/Link, letting you integrate Mathematica into applications using .NET framework.</p><p>Wolfram Research Inc.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>100 Trade Center Drive</p><p>Champaign, IL 61820-7237</p><p>http://www.wolfram.com/</p><p></p><p>SmartDraw.com has released VisualScript XML, a visual scripting tool for XML that lets you program XML statements into graphical symbols, then drag-and-drop the symbols to sketch the flow of a business process. VisualScript translates that sketch into a working XML script. VisualScript XML promotes drag-and-drop diagramming with symbols and intelligent connectors, and is intended to let you build libraries of reusable, preprogrammed symbols to promote your own scripting standards. Other features include the ability to automatically insert user-entered data into XML script output; support multiple XML standards with the same models and templates; and automatically validate XML scripts for proper syntax.</p><p>SmartDraw.com</p><p>10085 Carroll Canyon Road, Suite 220</p><p>San Diego, CA 92131</p><p>858-549-0314</p><p>http://www.smartdraw.com/</p><p></p><p>IronTrack SQL generates data comparisons that can pinpoint the cause of SQL performance delays in an application's JDBC performance. IronTrack SQL lets you search for problems resulting from query interactions, or to locate unexplained spikes in database utilization. The tool displays GANTT-style charts of queries as they occur over time, letting you overlay and compare query performance and activity between two or more sets of query-performance data. You can also search for performance problems that result from query interactions, such as when two queries are executed at the same time, and run automated local unit tests to check for a build's variance from an established performance baseline.</p><p>IronGrid Inc.</p><p>205 Brazos, Suite A</p><p>Austin, TX 78701</p><p>512-474-7400</p><p>http://www.irongrid.com/</p><p></p><p>Recursion Software has announced C++ &lt;ToolKit&gt; 3.0.2, which supports Windows XP using Microsoft's Visual C++ .NET, and the Pocket PC using eMbedded Visual C++ 3.0.
