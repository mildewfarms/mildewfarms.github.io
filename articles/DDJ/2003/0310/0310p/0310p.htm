I'm better when I move." Some basketball players can't shoot free throws, but they make every shot when the clock is running.</p><p>Motorcycles and spinning tops fall over if they slow down. </p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>Your eyes are constantly moving. If they stopped, your retinal cells would adapt to the incoming light levels and you would be effectively blind.</p><p>Sundance drops into a crouch, the gun flies from its holster, he snaps off a few quick shots from the hip, and the tin can dances.</p><p>The weblog exemplifies a Sundance Kid model of publishing: 1. The weblog is a constantly moving window on its author's thoughts; 2. Webloggers shoot from hip.</p><p>All of our most important decision making is unconscious.</p><p>If braking a car in an emergency required conscious intelligent decision making, you'd be dead by now.</p><p>In <i>The Way of Zen,</i> Alan Watts recounts the story of the caterpillar that was perfectly happy until a toad asked it which leg came after which. After this, the poor caterpillar "lay distracted in the ditch, considering how to run."</p><p>You can think faster than you can type, but you can type faster than you can think how to type.</p><p>We are not born knowing how to type. Or dance. Or fly jets. What are the limits to the kinds of behaviors that can be turned into reflexes?</p><p>Is a reduced attention span a positive adaptation to a world that is more and more a flickering magic-lantern show?</p><p>Saccadic motion: The constant movement of the eye as it jumps from detail to detail of a scene. Not the same as the low-level movement that prevents retinal adaptation.</p><p>Saccadic masking: Because vision is blurred during the saccadic movement, the visual system masks out this degraded data. In effect, the eye is blind while moving.</p><p>So we can't see if our eyes are not constantly moving, and we can't see while they are moving. Vision is a series of evanescent instants.</p><p>So, some would say, is life.</p><p>Saccadic search algorithm: A pattern-recognition algorithm for detecting facial features, face detection, and real-time head tracking. It draws upon understanding of the human saccadic system and the arrangement of photoreceptors on the retina.</p><p>The moving electronic ticker and the scrolling web-site banner add a third motion to the low-level twitching and the saccadic motion the eye insists upon. We seem to be adapting to this third motion very well.</p><p>A day is surely coming when we won't be able to read anything that sits still.</p><p>The logical next stage in weblogs: The one-character moving window. We only see each successive character as it is typed. Typing as performance art.</p><p>Businesses, like sharks, die if they stop moving.</p><p>There are many ways for a company to die.</p><p>Sometimes it's just the name that has to go.</p><p>International Business Machines is no more, but IBM is healthy. American Telephone and Telegraph had to go when the telegraph became an archaism. Dell Computer is a thing of the past, but Dell is going strong.</p><p>But <i>Dr. Dobb's Journal </i>is still <i>Dr. Dobb's Journal.</i></p><p>Some things don't have to change.</p><p>The rate of expansion of the universe is increasing.</p><p>The pace of change in technology is increasing.</p><p>Surely there is a physical limit to these increases.</p><p>Isn't there?</p><p>The endpoint of the flashlight beam can move faster than the speed of light.</p><p>These have been just a few quick shots from the hip.</p><p><br>Michael Swaine<br>editor-at-large<br>mike@swaine.com<br></p></body></html>
