<p>The good news coming out of JavaOne was that I didn't get sick. The bad news is that a lot of people did, leading the San Francisco Department of Public Health to issue a rare public health warning. According to the SFDPH, the suspected culprit was something called "Norovirus" that caused stomach-flu-like symptoms. I'll leave it up to you to guess what those symptoms were. However, I do have it on good authority that most of the people running for the exits and up-chucking their lunch were Yahoo! stockholders watching the value of their stock yo-yo, thanks to Yahoo!'s management brushing aside Microsoft's $44 billion takeover offer.</p>

<p>While there are a lot of angles to this deal&#151;including just maybe the futures of both Yahoo!'s Jerry Yang and Microsoft's Steve Ballmer&#151;open source has a role that can't be ignored. If the acquisition of Zimbra (www.zimbra.com), an open-source message and collaboration company; the support for the Hadoop (hadoop.apache.org) open-source distributed file system and parallel execution environment; the Yahoo! User Interface Library (developer.yahoo.com/yui); and the commitment to the OpenSocial Foundation (www.opensocial.org) tells us anything, it is that Yahoo! means to walk the open-source walk. Which makes you wonder how this would work in the world of Microsoft. Could the two business models and cultures coexist? Would a "Microsoft Yahoo!" mean a more closed Yahoo! or more open Microsoft? Or is Microsoft just talking the open-source talk?</p>

<p>Of course, Microsoft has taken some open steps by publishing more than 30,000 pages of documentation for its Windows client/server protocols. And in addition to new, presumably more-open, APIs for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, Microsoft continues to back the Open Source Interoperability Initiative (www.microsoft.com/opensource). But does all this add up to <i>open source</i>? Sure, Microsoft has talked about "greater transparency" but that doesn't necessarily translate to "open source." Nor, for that matter, does the idea and practice of "shared source." </p>

<p>So why does Microsoft, via an acquisition of Yahoo!, want to become an open-source company? Well, my guess is that deep-down Microsoft doesn't want to be an open-source company at all. Rather, what Microsoft wants to be is an "Internet" company, in addition to a "Desktop" company. And in today's world, Internet means "open source" and "Desktop" translates to "proprietary." But to become an Internet company means an alternative mindset, a different DNA. That's what Microsoft wants: That Internet DNA stuff&#151;and the market share that goes with it&#151;that people have been talking about for years. And the fastest way of making this happen is to buy it. </p>

<p>Now if Microsoft could figure out a way to hook up the desktop to the Internet (maybe using tools like Adobe's AIR, Mozilla's Prism, Curl's Nitro, or whatever)&#151;that might solve the problem without having to worry about open-source this or open-source that. </p>

<p>Who knows but by the time you read this, Yahoo! management might have rethought the deal and gone back hat-in-hand to Microsoft. Or Microsoft may have acquired another Internet company for its Internet DNA. Or Microsoft might even have opted to open-source its product lines (not likely). I don't know. I keep waiting for the phone to ring, but Yang and Ballmer haven't yet confided in me. But what I do know is that I've said to heck with Yahoo! stock; instead, I've been loading up on shares of Pepto-Bismol (www.pepto-bismol.com). That's the only safe bet these days, as lots of people who attended JavaOne will tell you.</p>
