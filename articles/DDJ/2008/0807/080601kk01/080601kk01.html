<p>A B-Tree can locate keys with a specified prefix; for example, finding all stock symbols starting with "<i>AAA.</i>" But some applications require the opposite search&#151;locating keys that represent the longest prefixes of a specified value. Here a B-tree could perform several iterations, searching for different prefixes of the specified value starting from the longest, but this is inefficient. A much better index for prefix searches is the Patricia trie, which is a variation of a binary tree. Typically, the Patricia trie is used for performing two tasks&#151;phone routing and IP filtering. In the first case, given an incoming phone call and a table of operators with known prefixes, the right operator must be selected to handle the call. The second case deals with IP addresses: Given IP masks for valid/rejected domains, a received HTTP request should be classified as accepted, rejected, redirected, and so on. The following is a schema definition for a routing table. The mask is represented by a vector of bits (Booleans).</p>

<pre class="code">
class Route
{
	Vector&lt;bool&gt; dest;
	uint4 gateway;
	uint4 interf;
	uint2 metric;
	unique patricia&lt;dest&gt; by_dest;
};

</pre>
<p>To locate the proper route for the received IP address, the following search is performed in eXtremeDB using a Patricia trie:</p>

<pre class="code">

mco_cursor_t csr;
if (MCO_S_OK == Route_by_dest_index_cursor(trans, &amp;csr)) {
    uint1 mask[4];
    make_mask(mask, ip, 32);
    /* find routes which mask match this IP address */
    if (MCO_S_OK == Route_by_dest_prefix_match(trans, &amp;csr, mask,32);
        Route route;
        Route_from_cursor(trans, &amp;csr, &amp;route);
        ...
    }
}

</pre>
<p>The following code (from McObject's eXtremeDB embedded database; www.mcobject.com) converts the integer number representing the IP address into an array of bits:</p>

<pre class="code">

void make_mask(uint1* mask, uint4 val, int bitnum)
{
    int i;
    val = val &gt;&gt; (32-bitnum);
    memset(mask, 0, 4);
    for (i = 0; i &lt; bitnum; i++, val = val &gt;&gt; 1)
    {
         mask[i &gt;&gt; 3] |= (val&amp;1) &lt;&lt; (i&amp;7);
    }
}
