<h2>GUIdancer 2.0</h2>

<p>Bredex GmbH has released GUIdancer 2.0, an automated GUI test tool for testing Java (Swing, SWT/RCP) and web (HTML) applications. Test specification in GUIdancer is carried out by defining what component to test, with what action, and with which data. These specifications form reusable modules that can be combined to create complex, yet maintainable, tests. <a href="http://www.guidancer.com">www.guidancer.com</a></p>

<h2>Distributed Refreshable Objects 3.1</h2>

<p>Fusionsoft has introduced its Distributed Refreshable Objects 3.1, a Java library for interobject communication in local and distributed environments. All distributed objects in DRO 3.1 are cached on client side, so repeated use of object properties does not result in network exchange. However, when a server object is modified, all its cached client copies become updated; no stale data are possible. <a href="http://www.fusionsoft-online.com">www.fusionsoft-online.com</a></p>
