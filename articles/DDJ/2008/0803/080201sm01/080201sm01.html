<h1>Automating Release Notifications</h1>
<h2>Keeping up-to-date with application and library releases</h2>


<h3>By Scott Miller</h3>

<p>With the proliferation of open-source libraries and frameworks, it is easy to find solutions to common programming needs. However, given the rapid release rate of many open-source projects, it can be difficult to ensure that applications always ship with the latest libraries. There are many ways to receive notifications of library updates, ranging from subscribing to e-mail distribution lists or RSS feeds, to periodically visiting project websites or blogs. But all of these activities require "manual information processing." In this article, I present an automated approach to notification. </p>

<p>While many applications have built-in online update capabilities, the drawback is that users aren't notified of updates until they run the application! Running applications periodically to merely check for updates can be time consuming, especially if you wish to keep all of your installed applications updated.</p>

<p>Luckily, there are tools that can help automate the update notification and installation process. Like the ubiquitous Windows Update, these tools scan your system to detect out-of-date software and facilitate the downloading and installation of needed updates. These tools include:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Version Tracker (<a href="http://www.versiontracker.com">www.versiontracker.com</a>)</li>
  <li>Google Pack's Google Updater (<a href="http://pack.google.com">pack.google.com</a>)</li>
  <li>FileHippo's Update Checker (<a href="http://filehippo.com/updatechecker/">filehippo.com/updatechecker/</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>But what if the software you wish to track isn't monitored by one of these tools; it might be an in-house application, a single-purpose domain-specific library, or the like? What if the software you wish to track doesn't have an auto update feature? You're back where you started&#151;manually checking websites, blogs, and e-mails.</p>

<p>There are websites and utilities that monitor web pages for changes. A quick Google search for "monitor website changes" shows many promising options. However, you still may not necessarily have control of what part of a page is monitored and how frequently this page is monitored. Another potential problem is monitoring pages that aren't publicly available (intranet websites, for instance). </p>

<p>It has been said that good programmers are lazy programmers. In other words, good programmers work hard to automate tasks. Such is the case with checking websites for changes. After frequently checking multiple websites daily for new releases of software I use in my projects, I decided to automate.</p>











<h3>Command-Line Example</h3>

<p>I initially began the automation process at the command line. A variety of tools can be used to retrieve web pages from the command line, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cURL (<a href="http://curl.haxx.se">curl.haxx.se</a>)</li>
  <li>wget (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">www.gnu.org/software/wget/</a>)</li>
  <li>Netcat (<a href="http://netcat.sourceforge.net">netcat.sourceforge.net</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you retrieve a page, you can parse its content using the ever-useful combination of sed/awk/grep and regular expressions.</p>

<p>So suppose you want to be notified when a new version of Microsoft's Process Explorer is released. Figure 1 is the web page for Process Explorer showing the version information you wish to monitor (v11.04) (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/processexplorer.mspx">www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/processexplorer.mspx</a>). The following one-line script determines the current version of Microsoft's Process Explorer. I ran this from a cygwin (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">www.cygwin.com</a>) bash session:</p>



<pre class="code">

wget -qO- http://www.microsoft.com/technet/
sysinternals/utilities/processexplorer.mspx | sed
's/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;//g' - | grep -o -m1 -P "v[\d\.]{4,}"

</pre>

<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>


<p>The output (at this writing) is as expected: <i>v11.04</i>. Note that: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The <i>wget -qO-</i> option causes the retrieved page to be sent to stdout instead of a file.</li>
  <li>The <i>sed 's/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;//g' </i>command deletes HTML tags (any text beginning with "&lt;" and ending with "&gt;"). Because you're after the page content, you dutifully ignore HTML tags.</li>
  <li>The <i>grep -o -m1 -P "v[\d\.]{4,}"</i> command outputs the first match of the given Perl regular expression. You look for the "v" character followed by four or more digits or "." characters.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The script relies on a common editorial pattern: The most current information should appear first, hence the ability to simply use the first match. If the page listed multiple releases in chronologically ascending order, then additional processing would be required to grab the last match instead of the first match.</p>

<p>The command-line approach works well and can be readily incorporated into other scripts to provide additional functionality (automatic downloading, sending e-mail notifications, and so on). However, there are inherent limitations to this command-line approach:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Checking and processing multiple websites must be done sequentially.</li>
  <li>A nonresponsive website can slow down the entire process if you check multiple websites sequentially.</li>
  <li>Reviewing, sorting, and filtering results requires additional work.</li>
  <li>Skipping a specific website from a set of websites to monitor is problematic.</li>
</ul>














<h3>UI Example</h3>

<p>With all this in mind, I created a graphical Java application to overcome the limitations I encountered when doing command-line update checking. This allows for checking/parsing multiple websites concurrently, easy sorting and filtering of results, and the like. It lets me add, edit, and remove websites and their associated matching rules easily. For example, I can validate regular expression syntax when the regular expression is added instead of troubleshooting garbled results caused by an invalid regular expression at runtime. I also get a side-by-side view of the previous match with the current match. The tool, App2Date (<a href="http://www.app2date.com">www.app2date.com</a>), is free for personal use and by nonprofit organizations. App2Date uses the same techniques as the aforementioned command-line approach: It retrieves web pages and applies a series of regular expressions to determine the relevant data (version number, release date, and the like). Figure 2 is the tool, while Figure 3 shows the rules used to determine the current version of the Process Explorer.</p>

<h3>Java Tools for  Web Page Retrieval and Text Extraction</h3>

<p>The Jakarta Commons <i>HTTPClient</i> class can be used to efficiently retrieve web pages. Listing One is code to get web page content. Java has built-in support for parsing HTML text. The <i>HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback</i> class allows for text extraction. The Jericho HTML Parser (<a href="http://jerichohtml.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html">jerichohtml.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html</a>) is another option. Regular expression parsing can be done using Java's <i>java.util.regex.Matcher</i> and <i>Pattern</i> classes. If full Perl 5 syntax support is required, the Jakarta ORO classes can be used. Multithreading to retrieve multiple website pages concurrently is greatly simplified by the java.util.concurrent package and <i>HTTPClient</i>'s <i>MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager</i> class. Java 6 introduced additional features that aid in the UI implementation: results are stored using Java 6's built-in JAXB support. The <i>TableRowSorter</i> and <i>RowFilter</i> classes are used for sorting and filtering the table of results.</p>

<p>Last of all, the Substance Look and Feel (<a href="https://substance.dev.java.net">https://substance.dev.java.net</a>) is used to give the application a polished appearance.</p>
