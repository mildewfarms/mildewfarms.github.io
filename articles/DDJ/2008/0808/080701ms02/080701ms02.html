<h3>1. Is it getting crowded in here, or is it just me?</h3>

<p>So I was at this party in Happy Camp the other day and got into this conversation about ubiquitous nanobots...</p>

<p>Happy Camp, in case you aren't in the know, is a town of 2182 hermits in the precise middle of impenetrable nowhere, California. Actually, 2182 is the estimated population of what I suppose you might laughingly call the Happy Camp metropolitan area. The population of Happy Camp is probably a few hundred. </p>

<p>In fact I wasn't in Happy Camp at all, I was in Seiad Valley, a much smaller community near Happy Camp. I just said Happy Camp because I figured you wouldn't know what I was talking about if I said Seiad Valley. But Happy Camp or Seiad Valley, neither is exactly the sort of place you expect to get into a discussion about the latest writings of Eric Drexler with an engineer and a Python coder.</p>

<p>A few days later, I was having dinner on the farm when I got a call from Phil the Mushroom Man. I like Phil. He used to forage mushrooms in the mountains and show up in his beat-up VW van to sell them to our restaurant, but I hadn't seen him in a while. Turns out, Phil is a software developer now.</p>

<p>Remember when what we do was sort of obscure? Now it's a second career for mushroom foragers.</p>


<h3>2. We are the sultans of ping.</h3>

<p>Ping, the UNIX utility, was written in 1983 by Mike Muuss to probe a target machine and see if the network path to it is functioning correctly. It is one of the most ubiquitous of programs, and has gifted the vernacular with a number of neologisms. Many, but not all, of the following pingterms are derived from Muuss's creation:</p>



<p><i>Ping storm:</i> A flurry of ping requests sent either to test a server's response to high traffic or as a form of DOS attack. </p>

<p>Ping of death: A malformed ping sent in an attempt to crash a machine.</p>

<p>Ping pong door: A ping pong table that fits in a doorway, designed by Tobias Franzel. Players stand in different rooms as they play.</p>

<p>Ping server: Blogs notify a ping server when their content has been updated.</p>

<p>Ping spam (or sping): Misusing a ping server to lure traffic to a site that is not a recent blog post.</p>

<p>No Self Pings: A Wordpress plug-in to make Wordpress stop sending pings from your site to your site when you post.</p>

<p>Sonar pingtones: Yes, you can make your cell phone ping you like submarine sonar.</p>

<p>Ping Zine: An online magazine about Web hosting (recent story: "Netfirms Now Accepting Applications for New .me Domain Names".)</p>

<p>Ping Records: A doowop label that operated out of the back of a record store at 4648 South Cottage Grove in Chicago for a few months in 1956.</p>

<p>Ping attribute: In &lt;A&gt; tags in HTML 5, gives the URIs of the resources that are interested in being notified if the user follows the hyperlink.</p>

<p>Ping tunnel: A covert connection between two remote computers using ICMP echo requests and reply packets.</p>

<p>The Story About Ping: A beloved book in which a duck has adventures on the Yangtze river; the book received a different kind of fame when reviewed on Slashdot as though it were documentation for the UNIX utility.</p>

<p>The Sultans of Ping are available on iTunes.</p>


<h3>3. We are all living under Marshall's laws.</h3>

<p>Marshall McLuhan forsaw it all 40 years ago: </p>



<p>The age of automation is going to be the age of 'do it yourself.'</p>



<p>In this electronic age we see ourselves being translated more and more into the form of information, moving toward the technological extension of consciousness. </p>



<p>It is the framework that changes with each new technology and not just the picture within the frame. </p>



<p>One of the effects of living with electric information is that we live habitually in a state of information overload.</p>



<p>Publication is a self-invasion of privacy. </p>



<p>The new electronic independence re-creates the world in the image of a global village. </p>



<p>We shape our tools and then our tools shape us. </p>


<h3>4. Let x = x.</h3>

<p>Sky-blue sky, satellites are out tonight; yadda yadda yadda and thingum doohickey; these are a few of my favorite metasyntactic variables: lorem ipsum; Alice and Bob; Tom, Dick, and Harry; John Doe; George Spelvin; doohickey; foo, bar, baz, qux, quux, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, thud; yadda yadda yadda; Macguffin; spam, ham, eggs. Written in honor of the wedding of Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson. </p>
