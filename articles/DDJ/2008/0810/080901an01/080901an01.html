<p>Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text retrieval library. Originally written in Java, it has since been ported to C++, C#, Perl, and Python. In this article, I show how Lucene.NET can be used to index and search image files captured by digital cameras. What makes this possible is that digital photos embed the camera settings and scene information as metadata. The specification for this metadata is the Exchangeable Image File Format (<a href="http://www.exif.org">www.exif.org</a>). Examples of stored information include shutter speed, exposure settings, date and time, focal length, metering mode, and whether the flash was fired. Here I show how the EXIF information can be extracted from the images through some user-specified criteria. These user-specified search criteria are then used as an index to search your image library. To keep the example simple, I limited the EXIF search criteria to date range and user comments fields. All images that satisfy the search criteria are displayed as thumbnails.</p>

<h3>ImageSearcher</h3>

<p>The ImageSearcher utility I present here was developed in C# using Visual Studio 2008. (The complete source code for ImageSearcher is available online at <a href="http://www.ddj.com/code/">www.ddj.com/code/</a>.) It also makes use of a number of open-source libraries and components such as Lucene.NET 2.0 (<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net">incubator.apache.org/lucene.net</a>), NLog 1.0 (<a href="http://www.nlog-project.org">www.nlog-project.org</a>), and ExifExtractor (<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/graphics/exifextractor.aspx">www.codeproject.com/KB/graphics/exifextractor.aspx</a>).</p>

<p>Although a number of open-source search libraries such as DotLucene.net (<a href="http://www.dotlucene.net">www.dotlucene.net</a>) and NLucene (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57306">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57306</a>) are available, the search library I selected was Lucene.NET because the DotLucene.NET project has been closed since May 2007 and NLucene has not been updated since 2002. </p>

<p>In addition to Lucene, I use the NLog logging library, which has a programming interface similar to Apache log4net (<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net">logging.apache.org/log4net</a>). I use NLog to write diagnostic messages to a file for logging and tracing purposes. To extract EXIF information, I use the ExifExtractor library. Although .NET already has utilities to extract EXIF information, it returns raw data and tags. More processing would be required for this to be used in this application. For example, if I wanted to extract shutter speed information, I would need to know the tag number, extract the tag, and then convert the data from ASCII to a number. ExifExtractor abstracts all these steps. To display the thumbnail images that have been returned by the search engine, I make use of Marc Lievin's Image Thumbnail Viewer (<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/thumbnaildotnet2.aspx">www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/thumbnaildotnet2.aspx</a>). </p>

<p>As Figure 1 illustrates, the ImageSearcher application is made up of six main classes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ImageSearcherForm</li>
  <li>ImageDialog</li>
  <li>ImageViewer</li>
  <li>ThumbnailController</li>
  <li>ThumbnailImageEventHandler</li>
  <li>BuildIndex</li>
  </ul>

<p><i>ImageSearcherForm</i> is the main point of entry into the application. It lets users enter the directory where the images are stored, where the index directory is to be created, and what search parameters (start and end dates, user comments, and so on) to use. The remaining classes control the display of the thumbnail images in the status window. This portion makes extensive reuse of code from Lieven's Image Thumbnail Viewer.</p>

<p>The <i>BuildIndex</i> class is where the index creation and searching takes place. To use Lucene, I first create an index by instantiating an <i>IndexWriter().</i> An <i>IndexWriter</i> is created using the following constructor:</p>

<pre class="code">

IndexWriter idxWriter = new IndexWriter(indexDir, 
    new StandardAnalyzer(), true);


</pre>
<p>where <i>indexDir</i> represents the path to the index directory. Text is analyzed with the <i>StandardAnalyzer</i>; the last argument is a Boolean variable that, if set to True, creates the index or overwrites the existing one. If set to False, it appends to the existing index.</p>

<p>Analyzers in Lucene can be used to tokenize text, extract relevant words, remove common words, stem the words (that is, reduce them to the root form; for example,  "edits," "editor," and "editing" are condensed to "edit"), and perform any other processing before storing it into the index. The common analyzers provided by Lucene are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>WhiteSpaceAnalyzer, which separates tokens based on whitespace.</li>
  <li>SimpleAnalyzer, which tokenizes the string to a set of words and converts them to lowercase.</li>
  <li>StandardAnalyzer, which tokenizes the string to a set of words identifying acronyms, e-mail addresses, host names, and so on, discarding the basic English stop words (a, an, the, to) and stemming the words.</li>
</ul>

<p>A Lucene index is a sequence of files. All searching is done on this index. The raw EXIF metadata associated with the image files has to be read and extracted from my image files, and passed to Lucene where it can be indexed and searched. The <i>IndexWriter</i> object is created in the <i>BuildIndex</i> constructor, which takes in two arguments; the first is the directory containing your image files, the second is the directory in which the index files are created.</p>

<p>Next, the <i>IndexDocs()</i> method is called. This method has one argument, which is the name of the directory containing your image files. It runs through each file in the specified directory, checks that it is a JPEG file, and creates an <i>Image</i> object from the file, using the call <i>Image.FromFile(filename)</i> from the System.Drawing package:</p>

<pre class="code">

Image img = Image.FromFile(file)

</pre>
<p>Next, the ExifExtractor library is used to extract EXIF information from the image files. To keep the application simple, I extract only "Date Time" and "User Comment" EXIF data. EXIF data is extracted as follows:</p>

<p>First, create the <i>EXIFExtractor</i> instance,</p>

<pre class="code">

Goheer.EXIF.EXIFextractor er = new Goheer.EXIF.
   EXIFextractor(ref img, "\n");

</pre>
<p>Next, retrieve Date/Time EXIF data:</p>

<pre class="code">

string s1 = (String)er["Date Time"];

</pre>
<p>Likewise, to extract the user comments EXIF information, we access the <i>er</i> object as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">

string s2 = (String)er["User Comment"];

</pre>

<p>The aforementioned EXIF tags are extracted from each image file. For each image file processed, a <i>Document()</i> object is created. This is created using the <i>Document</i> constructor as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">

Document d = new Document();

</pre>

<p><i>Document</i>s are the primary retrievable items from a Lucene query. Each <i>Document</i> object is made up of one or more <i>field</i> objects. </p>

<p><i>Field</i>s represent a section of the <i>Document</i>. They contain the name of the section and actual data associated with the section. Each <i>field</i> contains information that you query against or display in your search results. Because I will be using the filename, date, and time the picture was taken and user comments in the search results, these keywords would be added to the <i>Document</i> object as a <i>field</i>. Each of these keywords has an associated value. These values are the EXIF data extracted from the image file. <i>Field</i> values are a sequence of terms. I construct the <i>Field</i> object using the constructor: </p>

<pre class="code">

new Field(String name, String value, Field.Store store, Field.Index index))

</pre>
<p>where the first argument is the name of the <i>field</i>, the second argument is the value associated with this <i>field</i> name, the third argument indicates how the <i>field</i> is stored, and the last argument denotes how the <i>field</i> is indexed. In this application, the store is set to<i> Field.Store.YES</i> and the index is set to <i>Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED</i>. The former stores the original <i>field</i> value in the index. The latter indexes the f<i>ield</i>'s value without using an <i>Analyzer</i>, so it can be searched.<i> Field</i>s are added to the <i>Document</i> object using the <i>Add</i> method:</p>

<pre class="code">

d.Add(new Field("path", filename, Field.Store.YES,      Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED))

</pre>

<p>The <i>Document</i> object is then added to the <i>IndexWriter</i> instance using the following method:</p>

<pre class="code">

idxWriter.AddDocument(d)

</pre>

<p>When indexing is complete, we optimize the index for search,</p>

<pre class="code">

idxWriter.Optimize()

</pre>

<p>Finally, we close the index:</p>

<pre class="code">

idxWriter.Close()

</pre>

<p>Once the index has been built, it can be searched. In this application, the search is activated by the user. After users have entered all the search parameters, they activate the search by clicking on the search button. To do the search, we first create an <i>IndexSearcher</i> instance that points to the directory containing the indices that have been created previously:</p>

<pre class="code">

IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(idxDir.FullName)

</pre>

<p>I use the <i>RangeQuery</i> object to search for documents that match documents within an exclusive range. An instance of <i>RangeQuery</i> is created as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">

Term sTerm = new Term("datetime", startDateSearchString);
Term eTerm = new Term("datetime", endDateSearchString);
RangeQuery query = new RangeQuery(sTerm, eTerm, true);

</pre>

<p>The last argument to the <i>RangeQuery</i> constructor is a Boolean flag, which is set to True if the query constructed is inclusive, or otherwise set to False. The <i>query</i> instance is then passed as an argument to the <i>search</i> method of <i>IndexSearcher</i> instance,</p>

<pre class="code">

Hits oHitColl = searcher.Search(query)

</pre>

<p>This returns the documents that match the query. I extract the <i>Document</i> objects from the <i>Hits</i> object by calling the <i>doc</i> method as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">

string[] filesFound = null;
if (oHitColl.Length() &gt; 0)
   filesFound = new string[oHitColl.Length()];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; oHitColl.Length(); i++) {
   Document oDoc = oHitColl.Doc(i);
   filesFound[i] = (string)oDoc.Get("path");
}

</pre>

<p>In addition to the date/time fields, if I want to add the comments field to the search, I create a new <i>Term</i> query containing the user comments data. </p>

<pre class="code">

TermQuery tQuery = new TermQuery(new Term("comments", comments))

</pre>

<p>Then I create a <i>BooleanQuery</i> object,</p>

<pre class="code">

BooleanQuery bQuery = new BooleanQuery();
bQuery.Add(rQuery, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
bQuery.Add(tQuery, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);

</pre>

<p>I add both the <i>TermQuery</i> and <i>RangeQuery</i> objects to the <i>BooleanQuery</i> and pass this to the <i>Search</i> method of the <i>IndexSearcher</i> instance. This returns the documents that match the query.</p>











<h3>User Interface Flow</h3>

<p>Double clicking on the ImageSearcher application brings up Figure 2. Next, I enter the directory name where the image files are stored or click the "..." button (circled in green) and select the directory where the index will be created. If the index directory does not exist, it is created (Figure 3).</p>


<p>I then enter the date ranges of the images I am interested in viewing (Figure 4). The "Search" text box contains the user comments stored in the images that I am interested in locating. This is optional. Once the search criteria have been entered, I click the "Search Me" button (Figure 4). Any images that satisfy the search criteria will be displayed in the Results panel.</p>


<p>Figure 5 shows the results of a successful search being displayed in the results panel.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>As you can see, the Lucene.NET and EXIFExtractor libraries can quickly be used to build an application that searches for images according to user-specified criteria, then display those images that match the search conditions on the results panel. Moreover, the application can be easily extended to include other search criteria such as shutter speed and camera make and model.</p>
