<hr>




<p>Many software applications&#151;including websites&#151;offer features that are only available to users who first log-in to the system. In a typical application, user identity is confirmed ("authenticated") upon entering the username and password for the account. This approach is straightforward and works, but there are drawbacks. For instance, most apps reinvent the wheel when it comes to authentication, and many do-it-yourself implementations are easily exploited because developers may not have expertise in security. Users are usually required to remember a username/password for every application they use, which can be problematic.</p>

<p>OpenID (<a href="http://www.openid.net">www.openid.net</a>) is an open standard that defines a way that web-based applications ("consumers") can authenticate users by delegating the responsibility of authentication to identity providers. With OpenID, users have a single identity that can be used on any OpenID-enabled application, and they only need to remember one password.</p>

<p>In this article, I describe the OpenID authentication system and show how a web application built with Ruby on Rails can use OpenID to authenticate its users.</p>


<h3>How OpenID Works</h3>

<p>OpenID relies on the HTTP protocol to exchange messages between "consumers" and "identity providers." Consider a user named Bob, whose identity provider is myOpenID (www.myopenid.com). Bob uses the Drupal content-management system that happens to be an OpenID consumer. Here's the general workflow when Bob logs into his Drupal account through OpenID:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Bob visits his Drupal-driven website.</li>
  <li>Bob enters his OpenID identity URI, "bobs-id.myopenid.com," in the login form and clicks a Submit button. That's his OpenID identity URI, which looks like a website address, but identifies Bob and his identity provider.</li>
  <li>Bob's web browser is redirected to a web page served by myOpenID, where he is prompted for his password.</li>
  <li>Bob enters his OpenID password and clicks a Submit button.</li>
  <li>myOpenID confirms Bob's password, and his web browser is redirected to Drupal with some information about Bob.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bob entered his password only on the identity provider website, and never on the consumer website. The user's password is not shared with the consumer and only needs to be submitted once by users to the identity provider, preferably over a secure connection.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>OpenID provides several benefits to users and developers. Users only need to remember one username (their identity URI) and password to access multiple applications. With a simple cookie and Remember Me checkbox, an OpenID identity provider can act as a convenient Single Sign-On (SSO) solution for someone who uses multiple OpenID consumers. </p>

<p>OpenID identity providers are responsible for the authentication of users, giving web developers one less thing to understand, implement, and maintain, and letting them focus on core business. Supporting OpenID removes a barrier to entry for many potential users who balk at yet another website asking them to sign up. </p>

<p>It's not uncommon for web apps to offer OpenID support as an alternative to traditional authentication methods, but letting experts handle password security reduces the risk of accounts being compromised.</p>










<h3>Issues</h3>

<p>But there is a chicken-and-egg problem: Many website developers choose not to support OpenID because there aren't enough users who understand or use it&#151;and many users don't understand or use OpenID because few websites support it. However, OpenID support and adoption appears to be growing, and there is a growing base of web users who prefer OpenID to traditional authentication.</p>

<p>There are potential risks associated with OpenID as well, such as losing the "keys to the kingdom." If an OpenID password is compromised, a user's online identity and any data on consumer websites may also be compromised. For this reason, I recommend you choose an identity provider you trust, or configure your own identity provider. Also, users who use the same username/password on multiple apps (often including their e-mail account) expose themselves to even greater risks.</p>

<p>One way a user's identity can be compromised is through phishing, such as when a nefarious website claims to support OpenID but only provides a fake authentication form to collect the identity URI and password of unsuspecting users. A web browser with anti-phishing features can help, and I recommend visually confirming that the web address of the page where you enter your password matches that of your identity provider, especially when visiting an unfamiliar site. </p>

<p>The centralized identity provided by OpenID can be a drawback depending on the user's agenda, but users who prefer to remain anonymous can use a different identity URI. Also, since a centralized third party performs authentication for potentially many different websites, identity providers can be aware of some of the websites users visit. Again, choosing an identity provider you trust can alleviate this concern. </p>
<h3>An OpenID-Enabled Ruby on Rails Application </h3>

<p>The example I present here demonstrates how an OpenID consumer can be implemented with the Ruby on Rails framework. Libraries that make it easy to enable OpenID in web applications are also available for Java, C#, PHP, Python, and other languages and frameworks.</p>

<p>To illustrate, I assume you've installed Ruby 1.8, RubyGems, Rake, Rails 2.0 (or later), a database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite, for instance), and the adapter for your database. </p>

<p>I also assume you are familiar with Ruby and Rails and UNIX-style command-line interface and text editors. I indicate command-line actions with a dollar-sign ($) prefix, which should not be typed as part of the command. The complete source for this project is available online; see "Resource Center," page 5.</p>

<p>First, install the ruby-openid gem (this example was tested with version 2.0.4):</p>

<pre class="code">

$ sudo gem install ruby-openid

</pre>
<p>Next, create a Rails application at the command line, and perform a bit of cleanup:</p>

<pre class="code">

$ rails openid_demo
$ cd openid_demo
$ rm public/index.html

</pre>
<p>David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Rails, wrote a plug-in (github.com/rails/ open_id_authentication/tree/master/README) that uses the ruby-openid gem and makes it easy to add OpenID support to Rails applications, so I install it now:</p>

<pre class="code">

$ ./script/plugin install open_id_authentication 

</pre>
<p>Once the plug-in is installed, run this Rake task to create a database migration:</p>

<pre class="code">

$ rake open_id_authentication:db:create

</pre>
<p>If you're curious, take a look at the migration that was created. It creates two database tables, "open_id_authentication_associations" and "open_id_authentication_nonces", which store information about the messages received from OpenID identity providers, including authentication keys.</p>

<p>Next, generate a User model with a few basic attributes: </p>

<pre class="code">

$ ./script/generate model user identity_url:string email:string full_name:string date_of_birth:date

</pre>
<p>This generates a migration to create a table to store users. It's a good idea to add an index on the <i>identity_url</i> column because it can fetch data. To do so, add this line to the end of the <i>up</i> class method in the <i>create_users</i> migration:</p>

<pre class="code">

add_index :users, :identity_url, :unique =&gt; true

</pre>
<p>Configure a development database in config/database.yml and run this Rake task to create the development database and run the migrations:</p>

<pre class="code">

$ rake db:migrate

</pre>
<p>Next, create a session controller, which handles login (with OpenID, of course) and logout for your users:</p>

<pre class="code">

$ ./script/generate controller session new

</pre>
<p>Open app/controllers/session_controller.rb in your text editor or IDE and implement the <i>create</i> and <i>destroy</i> actions (Example 1). The <i>destroy</i> action stands on its own, but the <i>create</i> action delegates to another method, <i>open_id_authentication</i> (Example 2). This method has lots of responsibility, so let's examine it:</p>

<pre class="code">

if params[:openid_url].blank? &amp;&amp; params[:open_id_complete].blank?
  return failed_login("Please enter your OpenID")
end

</pre>

<br><br>
<div>

<pre class="code">
def create
  open_id_authentication
end
def destroy
  reset_session
  self.current_user = nil
  flash.now[:notice] = 'You have logged out.'
  render :action =&gt; 'new'
end
</pre>

<div class="caption">
Example 1: Creating and destroying sessions.
</div>
</div>


<div>

<pre class="code">
def open_id_authentication
  if params[:openid_url].blank? &amp;&amp; params[:open_id_complete].blank?
    return failed_login("Please enter your OpenID")
  end
  @openid_url = params[:openid_url]
  # Pass optional :required and :optional keys to specify what sreg fields 
  # you want. Be sure to yield registration, a third argument in the block.
  authenticate_with_open_id(@openid_url, 
      :required =&gt; [:email],
      :optional =&gt; [:dob, :fullname]
      ) do |result, identity_url, registration|

    if result.successful?
      user = User.find_by_identity_url(identity_url)
      if user.nil?
        user = User.new
        user.identity_url = identity_url
      
        unless assign_registration_attributes(user, registration)
         return failed_login("Your OpenID registration failed: " +
            user.errors.full_messages.to_sentence)
        end
      end
      self.current_user = user
      successful_login
    else
      failed_login(result.message || "Sorry, could not authenticate 
        #{identity_url}")
    end
  end
end
</pre>

<div class="caption">
Example 2: OpenID authentication.
</div>
</div>


<p>The aforementioned condition checks that users entered an identity URI, which is accessed through <i>params[:openid_url]</i>, where <i>openid_url</i> is the name recommended for the HTML form element where users enter their identity URI. (In Rails, the <i>blank?</i> method returns True for either a nil value or empty string.) </p>

<p>The other check, for a blank <i>params[:open_id_complete]</i> value, is needed because identity providers redirect back to this action after authentication is done with this <i>complete</i> flag set, but without the <i>openid_url</i> parameter. </p>

<p>The <i>failed_login</i> method (Example 3) adds the error message to the response and renders the login form:</p>

<pre class="code">

authenticate_with_open_id(@openid_url, 
    :required =&gt; [:email],
    :optional =&gt; [:dob, :fullname]
    ) do |result, identity_url, registration|

</pre>
<br><br>
<div>

<pre class="code">
(app/controllers/session_controller.rb)

def failed_login(message)
  flash.now[:error] = message
  render :action =&gt; 'new'
end
</pre>

<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>


<p>This method, <i>authenticate_with_open_id</i>, is provided by the <i>open_id_authentication</i> plug-in you installed earlier. Simply pass in the identity URI entered by users and specify any required or optional fields, as well as a Ruby block that handles the result. The plug-in does the heavy lifting&#151;it takes care of all communication with the identity provider.</p>

<p>The required and optional fields used in this example&#151;e-mail, date of birth, and full name&#151;are a subset of those defined by the Simple Registration ("sreg") extension, which gets some basic, commonly used information about users from their identity providers. Other <i>sreg</i> attributes include nickname, language, timezone, postcode, gender, and country.</p>

<p>The method passes a <i>result</i> object, a clean version of the identity URI, and a hash of <i>sreg</i> attributes into the block:</p>

<pre class="code">

if result.successful?
  user = User.find_by_identity_url(identity_url)

</pre>
<p>A successful result indicates that users have been authenticated. Find the user in your database by his identity URI (taking advantage of that index you added earlier):</p>

<pre class="code">

if user.nil?
  user = User.new
  user.identity_url = identity_url
  unless assign_registration_attributes(user,       registration)
    return failed_login "Your        OpenID registration failed: " +
  user.errors.full_messages.to_sentence
  end
end

</pre>
<p>If you didn't find a user with the authenticated identity URI, create a new <i>User</i> object, set the identity URI, and assign any <i>sreg</i> attributes that were returned. Example 4 shows the method <i>assign_registration_attributes</i>; note that it saves the new <i>User</i> object to the database, performing any validation defined in the model:</p>

<pre class="code">

   self.current_user = user
successful_login

</pre>

<br><br>
<div>

<pre class="code">
# Maps OpenID sreg keys to fields of your user model.
# registration is a hash containing valid sreg keys
def assign_registration_attributes(user, registration)
  { 
    :email =&gt; 'email', 
    :date_of_birth =&gt; 'dob', 
    :full_name =&gt; 'fullname' 
  }.each do |model_attr, registration_attr|
    unless registration[registration_attr].blank?
      user.send "#{model_attr}=", registration[registration_attr]
    end
  end
  user.save
end
</pre>

<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>


<p>At this point, you have a valid user (either found or created). The user should have a session so that the application knows who he is when he submits another HTTP request. A common approach is to manage a <i>current_user</i> object in <i>ApplicationController</i> (Example 5). Reward the user's successful login by calling <i>successful_login</i> (Example 6), which simply redirects to <i>WelcomeController#index</i>.</p>


<div>

<pre class="code">
class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  helper_method :current_user
  protected
  # Accesses the current user from the session.
  def current_user
    @current_user ||= 
      (session[:user_id] &amp;&amp; User.find_by_id(session[:user_id]))
  end
  # Store the given user in the session.
  def current_user=(new_user)
    session[:user_id] = new_user &amp;&amp; new_user.id
    @current_user = new_user
  end     
end
</pre>

<div class="caption">

</div>


<div>

<pre class="code">
def successful_login
  redirect_to :controller =&gt; 'welcome'
end
</pre>

<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>


<p>Authentication can be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including an invalid identity URI, if users canceled, or if they failed to enter the correct password. Handle an unsuccessful result by passing the result's message to <i>failed_login</i>:</p>

<pre class="code">

else
  failed_login result.message || "Sorry, could not authenticate 
    #{identity_url}"
end

</pre>
<p>The next step is to build a login form like Figure 1. At a minimum, you need a form with a text field named <i>openid_url</i> and a Submit button that posts to the <i>session/create</i> action (Example 7) in app/views/session/new.html.erb. </p>


<div>
    
<div class="smallcap">&#91;Click image to view at full size&#93;</div>
<!--  -->    
<img class="illowide" src="080901jw01_f1.gif" onclick = "popimage(this,'www.ddj.com - OpenID Single Sign-On - Figure 1')">

<div class="caption">
Figure 1: Login form.
</div>
</div>


<div>

<pre class="code">
&lt;% form_tag session_path do -%&gt;
&lt;dl class="form"&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;&lt;label for="openid_url"&gt;OpenID&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
     &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= text_field_tag "openid_url", @openid_url, :size =&gt; 30 %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
     &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= submit_tag 'Log in', :disable_with =&gt; "Logging in&amp;hellip;" %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;% end -%&gt;
</pre>

<div class="caption">
Example 7: Login form.
</div>
</div>



<p>Your users will probably expect to land somewhere after they log in, welcoming them to the app. The <i>SessionController#successful_login</i> method redirects users to "welcome/index", so create the controller:</p>

<pre class="code">

$ ./script/generate controller welcome index

</pre>
<p>Next, update the welcome template (Example 8) to give users a slightly personalized page.</p>


<div>

<pre class="code">

&lt;p&gt;
     Your OpenID identity URL is 
     &lt;strong&gt;&lt;%= current_user.identity_url %&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
     &lt;%= link_to 'Log out', logout_path %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<div class="caption">
Example 8: Welcome! 
</div>
</div>


<p>You just need to map some routes, including one named <i>open_id_complete</i> to catch the responses from identity providers. Open config/routes.rb in your text editor and add the routes in Example 9, then start your Rails app:</p>

<pre class="code">

$ ./script/server

</pre>
<br><br>

<div>

<pre class="code">
ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  map.login  'login',  :controller =&gt; 'session', :action =&gt; 'new'
  map.logout 'logout', :controller =&gt; 'session', :action =&gt; 'destroy'
  # You can have the root of your site routed with map.root -- 
  # just remember to delete public/index.html.
  map.root :controller =&gt; 'welcome', :action =&gt; 'index'
  map.open_id_complete 'session', :controller =&gt; 'session', 
    :action =&gt; 'create', :requirements =&gt; { :method =&gt; :get }
  map.resource :session
  # Install the default route as the lowest priority.
  map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.:format'
  map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'
end
</pre>

<div class="caption">
Example 9: Routes. 
</div>
</div>



<p>Go to http://localhost:3000/login in your web browser and you should see a simple login form. If you have an OpenID, you should be able to log in!</p>

<p>This isn't the prettiest app ever. I didn't build a custom layout with any colors or images, and there's little value in the User model since it's only a copy of some data returned by identity providers. Again, the complete (and better looking) project is available online.</p>

<p>Registration is transparent in this example. Users are automatically "registered" the first time their identity URI is encountered by the app. That may not be right for your application. A few other common strategies for registration include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prompt new users for additional information, required or not, to complete registration.</li>
  <li>Require up-front registration to ask for additional information, where OpenID authentication is the final step.</li>
  <li>Require up-front registration where OpenID is optional, supplementing another type of authentication, such as traditional username/password login. (If you do this, try to leverage an established authentication library for your language or framework. At a minimum, store salted hashes instead of plaintext passwords!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>OpenID is a straightforward way to add authentication to your web application, whether it's built with Ruby on Rails or another framework. OpenID is still evolving. New features are being standardized, new extensions are being developed, identity providers are continuously improving their support, and more applications support it everyday, either as the primary means of authentication or to supplement another method.</p>
