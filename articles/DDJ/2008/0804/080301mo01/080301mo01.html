<p>Consider the generation of random numbers in an interval, say the generation of an integer in {0,1,...,m-1} where the probability of each integer is 1/m. Usually, you have a source of randomness that provides random bits in chunks of architecture word size&#151;something like the wrapper around the mtrand library (bedaux.net/mtrand); see Listing One.</p>

<p>Mtrand implements the Mersenne Twister random-number generator (<a href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html">www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html</a>), which is a high-quality source of randomness. By "high quality," I mean that you don't need to consider low-order bits of words produced by the generator to be of inferior quality than high-order bits. In principle, you can take the value returned by <i>next()</i> <i>modulo</i> <i>m</i> to produce an integer in the range [<i>0,m-1</i>].  </p>

<p>However, this approach is problematic when <i>m</i> is comparable in size to the number of values representable by <i>value_t</i>. For instance, assume that the type of <i>value_t</i> is an unsigned 10-bit integer, and can thus contain values in the [<i>0,1023</i>] range. Consider <i>m=684</i>, which is approximately 2/3 of 1024. Taking a random <i>value_t</i> <i>modulo</i> <i>m</i> results in the lower half of [<i>0,m-1</i>] range having twice the probability of its upper half.</p>

<p>The regular approach to this problem is to ignore it (effectively assuming that <i>m</i> is low enough that the difference in probabilities is insignificant), or to reject the values in the "remainder" portion of the <i>value_t</i> range; see Listing Two. </p>

<p>Taking the previous example with <i>m=684</i>, the constants in Listing Two are: </p>

<ul>
  <li><i>M=1023</i>, the maximal value representable by <i>value_t</i>.</li>
  <li><i>rem=340</i>, the remainder size.</li>
  <li><i>last=683</i>, the last value in the range of "safe" values returned by <i>next()</i>.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Is the remainder values rejection approach costly? It is, especially for values of <i>m</i> close to, but above, the half-range of <i>value_t</i>. For such values, the expected number of calls to <i>next()</i> for each call to <i>next(max)</i> is 2 (this follows from the probability of rejection being 1/2). Because the cost of random bits varies between "moderate" (for Mersenne Twister) to "expensive" (for cryptography-oriented generators, especially hardware implementations), the running time of the relevant program portions doubles in such cases (unless you settle for the low-quality linear congruential generators). </p>

<p>Is it wasteful? The rejected values are thrown away, but perhaps their inherent entropy can still be used&#151;maybe to reduce the probability of rejection on the next iteration of the <i>do/while</i> loop? For instance, in the example, once <i>rnd</i> is rejected, and just before the next loop iteration, <i>rnd-last-1</i> is uniformly distributed in the [<i>0,rem-1</i>] range. You could partition the [<i>0,m-1</i>] range into exact <i>rem</i> buckets, and in the next iteration draw a value in the corresponding bucket using <i>m=rem</i>. What's problematic in this solution is that the conditions for its application are quite rare because it requires that <i>rem</i> divides <i>m</i>. It can happen&#151;with a <i>value_t</i> type of 10 bits, two possibilities are <i>m=768</i> and<i> m=320</i>&#151;however, it is possible to do a little better using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) algorithm.</p>

<p>Recall that the GCD algorithm computes the maximal number that divides its two arguments, in logarithmic number of arithmetic operations. Let's return to <i>m=684</i> and <i>rem=340</i>. Both are divisible by 4 (which is the GCD). Thus, if <i>rnd</i> is rejected in the first loop iteration, you can find out in which quarter of the remainder values <i>rnd</i> is located, map it to the corresponding quarter of values in the [<i>0,m-1</i>] range, and let <i>m=684/4=171</i> in the next iteration. Then, the probability of rejection becomes 1/6 instead of 1/3 (and can in general drop to a much lower value). </p>

<p>It turns out, however, that for randomness sources that are only moderately expensive, the GCD computation cancels any running time benefit attained by reducing the expected number of calls to <i>next().</i> If you are writing this code for a library, you could specify that it assumes usage with only "expensive" random-number generators, or implement memoization. However, in the first case, the code's generic nature suffers, and in the second case, a penalty is incurred on users who don't need perfect distribution of values in the [<i>0,m-1</i>] range.</p>

<p>This gloomy situation does have a win-win solution if you are using a language that allows compile-time computations (C++, for instance), and if you are willing to limit the approach outlined earlier to values of <i>m</i> known at compile time. </p>

<h3>Templatized Implementation</h3>

<p>Because all the constants computed in Listing Two need to be available at compile time, you need to replace <i>std::numeric_limits&lt;...&gt;::max()</i> with integer traits; see Listing Three.</p>

<p>GCD computation is easy with C++ templates; see Listing Four.</p>

<p>Now you can compute the constants that were defined in Listing Two. Because these constants are derived from <i>m</i>, the parameter to <i>next(max),</i> they are also kept in a traits structure specialized on <i>max</i>; see Listing Five.</p>

<p>You don't just compute <i>rem</i>, <i>last</i>, and <i>gcd</i>, but also determine the dispatch ID, which is used to select one of the three variants of <i>next(max)</i> implementations&#151;actually, <i>next&lt;max&gt;() because</i> <i>m</i> is now a compile-time constant. The NO_LOOP variant is selected when there are no remainder values in the <i>value_t</i> range, and no loop is necessary. Unless a very strange platform is used, <i>m</i> is a power of 2. The RETRY_SAME variant is actually the <i>SimpleRange</i> implementation, and is selected when <i>m</i> and <i>rem</i> are relatively prime, and <i>m</i> cannot be reduced once a random value is rejected. Finally, the REDUCE_MAX variant is selected when <i>m</i> and <i>rem</i> share a common factor, which allows reduction of <i>m</i>&#151;as in the <i>m=684</i> and <i>rem=340</i> example discussed previously. Because C++ doesn't allow partial specialization for member functions, and you need partial specialization on a dispatch ID, a private class <i>Dispatch</i> is used. Because <i>Dispatch</i> is specialized on all three values of <i>dispatch_t</i>, only a declaration is necessary for the nonspecialized template (see Listing Six).</p>

<p>Listings Seven and Eight show the straightforward specializations for the NO_LOOP and RETRY_SAME dispatch IDs.</p>

<p>Listing Nine shows the REDUCE_MAX specialization, which implements the previously described buckets-based approach, with a small variation&#151;the remainder range is not partitioned into GCD subranges, but instead a modulo GCD value is used. That is, low-order bits of <i>rnd</i> are used instead of the high-order bits.</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>The supplied code (available online at <a href="http://www.ddj.com/code/">www.ddj.com/code/</a>) can be used to estimate the runtime optimization resulting from the use of SmartRange. The theoretical limit is 25 percent off the original runtime: Going down from the expected 2 calls to <i>next()</i> per each call to <i>next(max)</i> when the probability of rejection is 1/2, to 1.5 expected calls to <i>next()</i> when the probability of the first rejection is 1/2 , and after reduction of <i>m</i> the probability of another rejection is 0 (one call &times; probability of 1/2 , plus two calls &times; probability of 1/2).</p>

<p>This result is what happens with the chosen Mersenne Twister implementation, when defining, for instance, <i>m=2</i><sup>31<i></sup>+32</i> on 32-bit platforms. Actually, SmartRange favors even better than the aforementioned 25 percent, probably due to more information being available to the compiler in this case; see Table 1.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The computation of the remainder range size <i>rem</i> is carefully written to avoid overflows when <i>value_t</i> is an unsigned integer (as it is in the <i>Random</i> wrapper class). Mathematically, if you define <i>m</i> as the desired range exclusive maximum, <i>M</i> as the maximum number representable by <i>value_t</i> plus 1 (that is, making the previously used <i>M</i> greater by 1), and <i>r</i> as the remainder range size, then <i>r=M</i> mod <i>m</i>. Moreover, the GCD value that we compute in <i>random_traits</i> is actually:</p>

<pre class="code">

g=gcd(m,r)=gcd(m,M mod m)=gcd(M,m)

</pre>
<p>Because on most architectures <i>M</i> is a power of 2 (do you know a platform on which it is not true?), <i>g</i> is actually 2 to the power of the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of <i>m</i>. Thus, if we wish to forgo platform neutrality, the approach I present in this article might be efficient even when <i>m</i> is not known at compile time, especially if appropriate bit-twiddling hacks are employed (graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html).</p>

<p>Can REDUCE_MAX happen more than once for a single call to <i>next(max)</i>? The answer is no, but proving it is left as an exercise to interested readers.</p>
