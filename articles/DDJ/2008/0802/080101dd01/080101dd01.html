<p><i>Employer:</i> IBM</p>

<p><i>Job:</i> Software Developer</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What's your job at IBM?</p>

<p><b>AZ:</b> I'm a software developer for the Rational Systems Delivery Platform. I work on tools for modeling and real-time systems development.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you like about your job?</p>

<p><b>AZ:</b> I'm working on the first release of a product, so I've gotten to see it being developed almost from the very beginning; it's been really neat to see it go from where we started out to now, when everything's starting to come together.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you find challenging about your job?</p>

<p><b>AZ:</b> Working in a team environment always presents some challenges; keeping up good communication within our team and with other teams is very important.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What have you found that makes your job easier?</p>

<p><b>AZ:</b> We use an Eclipse-based IDE for development, and learning all the tricks and features that Eclipse has to offer, especially in terms of organizing and searching through large amounts of code, has definitely made my life as a developer much easier.</p>

<p><i>Employer:</i> Seapine Software</p>

<p><i>Job:</i> Technology Evangelist</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> Where do you work?</p>

<p><b>GL:</b> I've been at Seapine Software for about the last six years.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What's your job there?</p>

<p><b>GL:</b> I'm the Technology Evangelist. That's a fancy way of saying  that I do a great deal of writing, evaluate new tools and technology, and help set product direction. In my previous life I was a  developer, so sometimes I even sneak in some coding.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you like about your job?</p>

<p><b>GL:</b> I like that it sits between our development organization and our business organization. That means I get to see the whole picture all they way from the sales initiatives to the deep down technical issues. It also provides variety&#151;I could be going over advertisement copy one minute and answering  technical questions the next.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you find challenging about your job?</p>

<p><b>GL:</b> Making sure I get all the things done for all the people I deal with is probably my biggest challenge. There's also a lot of  self-imposed pressure to make sure that all my decisions are good ones since they could impact all areas of the organization.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What have you found that makes your job easier?</p>

<p><b>GL:</b> A couple things: First,I lean heavily on search technology, whether it be Google, Spotlight, or Quicksilver. This way I don't have to worry about where I put things. Second, on my to-do list I always try having the very next action I need to do listed out for all my projects. Both of these things help take away the stress and let me be productive.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What's your hobby?</p>

<p><b>GL:</b> I'm on a soccer team and I like to play pick-up basketball,  although I don't expect the NBA to call anytime soon.</p>

For Artifact, I am their Product Director, responsible for product direction, customer interaction, technical marketing and community development.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you find challenging about them?</p>

<p><b>JP:</b> Time management. With so much activity going on, it is easy to get lost in the weeds.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What have you found that makes your work easier?</p>
