<p><i>Employer: </i>Bespoke Software</p>

<p><i>Job: </i>Owner</p>

<p><b>DDJ: </b>What's your job at Bespoke Software?</p>

<p><b>WC:</b> We make software for managing volunteers for all kinds of organizations and another tool for running large competitive events like the Special Olympics. I'm the chief architect, programmer, and bottle washer. Though I've mostly pawned the bottle duties off on my assistant, it's good to get my hands dirty once in a while. I've been told by my staff and others that the easiest way to get me to code something is to make me go through the existing process.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you like about your job?</p>

<p><b>WC:</b> Continuous challenges, customer interaction, and freedom. I started this company primarily to be able to design and code on my own terms, and work on projects that interested me. I never want to go back to the real world.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you find challenging about your job?</p>

<p><b>WC:</b> Sales. Marketing. Management. All of the nongeek parts!</p>

<p><b>DDJ: </b>What have you found that makes your job easier?</p>

<p><b>WC:</b> Delphi: It's not sexy but it's fast, well supported and a great tool for writing desktop apps. VMWare: There's nothing like being able to drag your entire development environment onto your laptop in just a few files, and having clean test sessions every time.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What's your hobby?</p>

<p><b>WC:</b> Photography&#151;it's my "sanity." I just got back from a weeklong trip to Hong Kong just for that. I don't go anywhere in the world without my 5D, tripod, and bag of lenses.</p>

<h2>World-Class Commerce</h2>

<h3>David Johnson</h3>

<p><i>Employer:</i> IP Commerce</p>

<p><i>Job:</i> CTO</p>



<p><b>DDJ:</b> What's your job there at IP Commerce?</p>

<p><b>DJ:</b> IP Commerce is the software company behind the world's first open commerce network delivering on-demand access to the next generation of commerce services. I am responsible for technology and product strategy and delivery. We design, build, and deliver all of the software and associated educational materials that power our technology, the IP Commerce Platform.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you like about your job?</p>

<p><b>DJ:</b> The electronic commerce industry is currently experiencing massive evolution. This is fostering innovation, growth, and opportunity. At the same time, SOA has reached maturity and broadband Internet connectivity has become pervasive for business. There is no better market and no better time for a software and services strategy.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you find challenging about your job?</p>

<p><b>DJ:</b> The speed at which our industry is changing is incredible. Our greatest challenge is timing. Every "component" of the commerce ecosystem is evolving, but not necessarily on the same timeline or with alignment of objectives. Balancing the dynamic "evolution appetite" of each ecosystem participant against the demand and consumption capability of commerce service end-users requires complex planning and execution.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What have you found that makes your job easier?</p>

<p><b>DJ:</b> Our team and partners. We have a world-class team here at IP Commerce. We also have great partners. Some of them are big financial companies, and unlike the assumed image, they move quickly, and are willing to explore unfamiliar territory.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you do away from work? Do you have a hobby?</p>

<p><b>DJ:</b> I used to be an active musician and outdoor "thrill seeker" so my free time is mostly centered around music and outdoor activities, but it's more about fostering my kids' interests right now.</p>

<h2>Realizing Dreams Globally</h2>
<h3>Andrew Revvo</h3>
<img src="080401dd01_f3.gif" width="150" height="100" border="0" align="left">
<p><i>Employer:</i> Self</p>

<p><i>Job:</i> Independent software developer</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> Where do you work?</p>

<p><b>AR:</b> I am an independent software developer (full-time shareware since 2001). I live in Russia, Voronezh. Most times I have full software development and support [responsibility] including management, programming, design, marketing, support service, etc. I use third-party services and external developers for some jobs.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you like about your job?</p>

<p><b>AR:</b> I like to be free and to realize my dreams, often, in a global sense. Shareware development is probably the best way to [do this]. </p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you find challenging about your job?</p>

<p><b>AR:</b> I have only a limited way to get information about my users, so most time I decide "at random." Today many software areas have many developers, so it is hard to [compete] alone. So I must be very inventive and flexible.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What have you found that makes your job easier?</p>

<p><b>AR:</b> Understanding. It is the right word, because only our brain is a leader in any situations. We must learn always and our brain must be very efficient. So I have many psychological methods to growth: systemic thinking, NLP, Four Quadrant Thinking, systemic psychology, self-culture methods, schools of great esoteric leaders: Peter Demianovich Ouspensky, Georges Ivanovitch Gurdjieff, Carlos Castaneda, and some other.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What's your hobby?</p>

<p><b>AR:</b> My primary hobby currently is psychology. Also I like to make photos and music. I have a CD release. Some of my nature photos are available on the Internet.</p>
