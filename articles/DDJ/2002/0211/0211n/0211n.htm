It autodiscovers domains, servers, and workstations, and analyzes existing patch configurations for each system. It compares what's installed with the latest available patches for Windows NT4/2000/XP Pro as well as applications such as Internet Explorer, IIS, and SQL Server running on workstations and servers. With PatchMeister, you can view patches by host, product, or by a particular patch. PatchMeister uses both remote registry and file signature checks to validate if patches are installed. The program reports are in HTML and can be exported into a CSV file for manipulation of data.</p><p>Ecora Software</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>500 Spaulding Turnpike, Suite W310</p><p>Portsmouth, NH 03801</p><p>603-436-1616</p><p>http://www.ecora.com/</p><p>Hurricane Software has released WinGREP 4.0, a search utility that locates and displays text.

With FTN95 for .NET, all standard and most vendor-specific legacy language features are supported. Fortran code can be combined in a documented manner with new code written in other .NET languages, such as C# and Visual Basic for .NET. Salford CHECKMATE technology (implemented at the heart of FTN95 for .NET) enables a range of run-time checks for common Fortran usage errors while code is under development.</p><p>Salford Software Ltd.</p><p>Lancastrian Office Centre</p><p>Talbot Road, Old Trafford</p><p>Manchester M32 0FP</p><p>United Kingdom</p><p>44-0-161-906-1002</p><p>http://www.salfordsoftware.co.uk/</p><p>Flux 3.5, from Sims Computing, is a lightweight software component that provides time-based and event-driven job scheduling. Version 3.5 of the Flux job scheduler introduces file-driven jobs, which provide software applications the necessary infrastructure to react to change and to transport files within the enterprise and between businesses. Using short expressions to describe large sets of files, you can create, delete, copy, move, and rename files and directories on the local file system, on remote FTP servers, or between the two. </p><p>Sims Computing</p><p>One South Broadway</p><p>Billings, MT 59101</p><p>406-656-7398</p><p>http://www.simscomputing.com/</p><p>PKZIP 5.0 is data compression software that uses an extended .ZIP file format to provide both certificate-based and traditional password-based encryption and authentication by incorporating strong encryption algorithms (up to 3 DES 168-bit encryption). PKZIP 5.0 integrates support for standard X.509 v3 digital certificates with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to sign and encrypt compressed files, turning traditional .ZIP files into secure .ZIP files for storage or transmission. It offers integration with Microsoft Outlook to provide automatic compression, digital signing, and encryption of files that are attachments to e-mail messages. PKZIP 5.0 is available for Windows 98/Me/NT 4.0/2000/XP, UNIX (Linux, HP-UX, SPARC Solaris, IBM-AIX), Mainframe, AS/400, and DOS.</p><p>PKWARE Inc.</p><p>9025 N.
