<h1>The New Adventures of Verity Stob</h1>

Verity is the pseudonym of a programmer based in the UK. She can be contacted at <a href="mailto:VerityStob@ddj.com">VerityStob@ddj.com</a>.</I>

<hr>

<p>Ms. Stob was recently persuaded by a kind friend to watch Mike Leigh's film <i>Topsy-Turvy</i> on DVD, and now preaches Gilbert and Sullivan with the tiresome zest of the newly converted. And we seem to detect their influence in her work...</p>


<h3>Patter Song</h3>


<p>I'm admin of a porn site:<br>
<DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Pervy punters pull my pages down.<br>

A mastermind of mark-up</br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Working hard to keep our poor renown.<br>

Whichever is your browser<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I make sure that I'm compatible.<br>

I always keep the best stuff where<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn't quite get-at-able.<br>

To make the navigation mono-manual<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not eas'ly done;<br>

But this is what you must do to maintain<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Your place in sleazy-dom.<br>

On each PC that comes to see<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure to leave a cookie file:<br>

And this is how I track who is <br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;A kinky kooky nookie-phile.</p>


<p>CHORUS:<br>


On each PC that comes to see<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He's sure to leave a cookie file:<br>

And that is how he tracks who is <br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;A kinky kooky nookie-phile.<br>


<p>To keep the GIF pics tiny<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I must minimize the palette size:<br>

On just one blonde, one brown, one black<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;And twenty pinks I compromise.<br>

Our many net connections need<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad-banded one direction feed;<br>

We must have some redundancy <br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;To satisfy selection speed.<br>

I'm friends with all our "acting" crew,<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Take meal breaks with a foxy pal,<br>

(Sometime I'll ask her how it feels <br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;To always make love through proxy wall.)<br>

But some days I'm frustrated and<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't help aggravating it:<br>

It's me does all the work round here<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Except the actual bonking bit.<br>


<p>CHORUS:<br>


On some days he's frustrated and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't help aggravating it:<br>

He does all the work round here<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Except the actual bonking bit.<br>


<p>If you should want to see our wares &#151;  <br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm being hypothetical &#151; <br>

The law requires I check your age,<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this is theoretical.<br>

Don't think I've lost the techie touch.<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm always scripting server-side.<br>

Just thirty lines of Perl ensure<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Your credit card is verified.<br>

And though our first time prices are<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Too good to be sustainable,<br>

I'm shocked the lengths that cheats go<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;To attain the unattainable.<br>

Please know we have "connections."<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;We've made sure we're not attackable.<br>

Remember it's my firewall &#151; not your arm &#151; <br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;That is uncrackable.</p>


<p>CHORUS:<br>


Please know we have "connections."<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;We've made sure we're not attackable.<br>

Remember it's my firewall &#151; not your arm &#151; <br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;That is uncrackable.</p>



<h3>PC Maintenance</h3>


<p>As some day it may happen that some disk space I must gain:<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got a little list &#151; I've got a little list<br>

Of apps and files and folders that really are a pain<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll zap 'em without risk &#151; I'll zap 'em without risk.<br>

There's a certain audio player, puts its tendrils everywhere.<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Its departure will leave silence and &#151; guess what? &#151; I just don't care.<br>

The shareware e-mail monitor for IMAP and for POP,<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes it so annoying is its window stays on top.<br>

And what about those poxy progs that when closed won't desist?<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got 'em on my list &#151; they'll none of 'em be missed.<br>

The background virus scanner slows my PC to a crawl,<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got that on my list &#151; I've got that on my list.<br>

And heaps of buggy beta stuff that hardly works at all<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll zap 'em without risk &#151; I'll zap 'em without risk.<br>

The alternative compiler that I meant to try some time,<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;I think its thirty days expired in 1999.<br>

The magic disk resizer that I'm much too scared to use,<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;The spyware and the adware that installed itself by ruse,<br>

And of course that bloody paper clip, to which I'll give a twist<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;The damn thing can't resist &#151; the damn thing can't resist.<br>

<p></p>


<p>Verity Stob apologies to Gilbert and Sullivan for defiling "I am the very model of a modern Major-General" from <i>The Pirates of Penzance,</i> and the List song and "For He's Gone and Married Yum-Yum" from <i>The Mikado</i>. She also acknowledges the influence of Mr. Dick Van Dyke, whose performance in <i>Mary Poppins</i> has sustained her in many a dark hour.</p>
