<p>Anysoft has released Digital Cortex, a software sequencing system that creates an open windows environment where applications become accessible and externally programmable to transcend standards and programming languages. It noninvasively exposes windows (console applications, terminal emulators, Java, client-server, desktop, and web based) as programmable objects at run time, in real time. The Digital Cortex system works with any programming language that supports COM/ActiveX to leverage existing toolsets to create programmatic access to applications without requiring source code, extend applications to new delivery platforms (Web and wireless), and reuse functionality and data from existing applications to create new applications and web services. </p>
