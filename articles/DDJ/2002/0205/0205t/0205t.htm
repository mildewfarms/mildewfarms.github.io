<p>ConeXL has announced the availability of PTest+ and CTest+, a set of test benches that allow independent testing of message brokers built to the Java Message Server (JMS) specifications. PTest+ implements use cases that describe typical real-world scenarios where the use of messaging is a key requirement. The tests perform multiple Pub/Sub and Queuing tests, latency tests, the effect of message rules on performance, varying load, burst messaging (e-commerce), flow control, and other tests. CTest+ is a comprehensive test suite for testing the quality of product implementation against the JMS API standard. The test includes positive tests for each line of the JMS 1.0.2 API and provides profiling of all JMS features. These tests allow independent verification of the implementation, as well as help to identify bugs in brokers.</p>
