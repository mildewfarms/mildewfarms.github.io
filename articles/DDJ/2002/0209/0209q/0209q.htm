<p>GrammaTech has released CodeSurfer 1.6, a maintenance, understanding, inspection, and analysis tool. Its program-analysis techniques precompute program properties allowing the quick and precise analysis of ANSI C source code. The new Version 1.6 features include the ability to inspect type information &#151; a variable's type is now shown in the property sheet for that variable; the ability to surf to macro definition from their use in the code and a fully expanded macro; new functionality that lets you do queries on the points-to-set of actual parameters of functions; and enhanced scalability and build performance. CodeSurfer runs under Windows, Linux, and Solaris 2.5 and later.</p>

<p>Prosentia has developed ProCrypt, which lets you control the number of machines on which customers install your software. It avoids the difficulties of dongles and copy protection because licensing is done via the Internet. Public/private key cryptography is used to store the licensing information on the customer's computer in a form that cannot be tampered with. The software consists of an ActiveX control that you embed in your application, and a set of Active Server Pages that you run on your web server. ProCrypt runs on all Windows platforms and requires that the application can contain ActiveX controls. </p>
