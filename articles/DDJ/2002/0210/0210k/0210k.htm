<h1>Taking Care of Business...</h1>
<p><i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i> October 2002</p>

<p>In step with falling leaves, yellow school buses, and midterm elections, autumn is the time we traditionally publish <i>DDJ'</i>s upcoming editorial calendar. As you can see, the topics we'll be examining in 2003 run the gamut of issues that are of interest and importance to programmers. What, you say&#151;no .NET, no Python, no data compression, no wireless communication, no Linux? Hey, no problem. In all likelihood, these topics (and others) will be covered in just about every issue of <i>DDJ</i>. And if you've come across an invaluable development tool or unique programming technique and would like to share it with your fellow <i>DDJ</i> readers, we want to hear from you. Drop us a note at either editors@ddj.com or jerickson@ddj.com; we generally like to start with an abstract or outline. That said, you can find details about writing <i>DDJ</i> articles at http://www.ddj.com/ddj/authors.htm. </p>
<p>With this issue, you'll also notice some changes inside <i>DDJ.</i> For starters, we're sorry to report that, after this issue, Dr. Ecco and Liane will no longer be appearing on a regular basis. What with consulting, teaching, books, his<i> Scientific American</i> puzzle column, and a new start-up, contributing editor Dennis Shasha (Dr. Ecco's alter ego) discovered that there are only so many hours in the day. We hope Dr. Ecco will return upon occasion&#151;when Dennis has time, of course.</p>

<p>Also beginning this month, another change you'll notice is that Michael Swaine's "Programming Paradigms" and Al Stevens's "C Programming" columns will appear in print on alternate months. Al got dibs on print this month, which means you can find Michael's column online at http://www.ddj.com/. This experiment gives Michael the opportunity to do some things he hasn't been able to in print&#151;link to articles, to say the heck with length constraints and the like. As for Al, he is looking for more time to wrap up his new book (see this month's column) and reacquaint himself with his new stick bass,...uh, bull fiddle,...er, contra bass&#151;whatever (see his June 2002 column).</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might think from perusing this month's table of contents, we haven't dropped "Algorithm Alley," "Programmer's Toolchest," "Java Q&amp;A," or "Internet Programming." Instead, Margaret Anderson, <i>DDJ'</i>s art director, decided to clean up the page, making it easier to read, providing you with more information in the process. After all, it seemed like overkill to tell you that an article on, say, Apache servers or TCP/IP is about the Internet.</p>

<p>We hope that these changes continue to make <i>DDJ</i> a valuable (and enjoyable) resource for you. If you like the modifications, don't hesitate to let me know. However, if you don't like the changes&#151;well, they were all Margaret's ideas and you can give her a piece of your mind at manderson@ddj.com.</p>
