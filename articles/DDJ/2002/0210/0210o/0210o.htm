<p>eXcelon has released Stylus Studio 4.0, a development environment for creating, validating, and debugging XSL stylesheets and XML-to-XML mappings. It contains a visual schema diagram editor that eases the creation and modification of XML Schema. It provides synchronized views of source XML Schema--a tree view and the XML Schema diagram--that enable you to work with XML Schema at multiple levels. In addition, Stylus Studio 4.0 supports Xalan-J-based debugging; and is the only XML/XSLT IDE with back mapping, which associates a defect with the related piece of XSLT source code to automate the process of debugging XSLT applications. Also from eXcelon is the Verity Search add-on for its native XML DBMS, the Extensible Information Server (XIS), which lets you integrate unstructured corporate information with structured XML data that can then be leveraged and extended by applications both inside the enterprise and beyond.</p>
