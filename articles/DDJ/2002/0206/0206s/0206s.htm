<p>Demeanor, from WiseOwl, is a code obfuscator for .NET applications. It secures .NET applications by making them difficult to reverse engineer. Demeanor also removes unnecessary information and obfuscates and shortens required symbolic names for loading/downloading of .NET assemblies. There are two versions of Demeanor available: Demeanor .NET Lite, which performs symbol and metadata obfuscation, and Demeanor .NET Enterprise, which performs these functions as well as control-flow obfuscation.</p>

<p>Sagantec has released SiFix, a tool for automatic correction and optimization of physical designs. With SiFix, you can implement layouts using simple rules and rely on SiFix to handle the additional complex rules. You can also begin physical implementation before final design rules values are fully available. SiFix scans through layout files, using quality and reliability rules to adjust width, spacing, and increase strapping in selected nets and segments. When it finds errors and hazards, it fixes them locally, leaving the rest of the physical design untouched. SiFix works equally well on full-custom layout or cell-based designs. It is available on Solaris, HP-UX, and Linux platforms.</p>
