<p>The Matisse 5.0 database from Fresher Information combines native object support with server-based SQL. Applications and services that include Matisse can use a single object model rather than O/R mapping, and Matisse also supports gradual migration for existing SQL applications. A versioning engine improves throughput and minimizes logging burden; dynamic schema evolution is designed to eliminate schema modification downtime; and ODBC and JDBC support is provided for access to external data sources. Language support is handled through an open API and a range of language bindings, including Java, C++, C, Python, Perl, PHP, Smalltalk, Visual Basic, and Eiffel. Most of the language bindings are open source. Matisse runs on Solaris, Linux, Windows, and FreeBSD server platforms.</p>

<p>Lazy Software has released Version 2 of its Sentences DBMS. Sentences is built around an associative model of data, which is based on the triple store model. The software consists of a database engine written in Java and a deployment environment which runs as a Java applet. A Java interface allows users to maintain, access, and query data in Sentences via the web. Once developed, browser-based Sentences applications can run independently of the deployment environment.  </p>
