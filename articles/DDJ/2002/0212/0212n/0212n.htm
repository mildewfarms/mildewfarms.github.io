<p>RDM XML, from Birdstep Technology, is a native XML database that supports both Java and C++. The company also released RDM Mobile 2.0, an embeddable database that includes native C++ and Java interfaces. Both tools offer database functionality in a small footprint using an architecture based on an object-oriented internal structure and COM-based programming interfaces. The architecture is optimized to handle hierarchical data. RDM XML provides interfaces such as SAX, DOM, and XPATH for storage and retrieval of data, and implements the DOM/XPATH integration standard. Features of RDM Mobile 2.0 include the regular expressions tool for evaluating arbitrary expressions and matching string attribute data, and casual attributes for unstructured XML documents. Both databases are deployed with the developer's applications. </p>
