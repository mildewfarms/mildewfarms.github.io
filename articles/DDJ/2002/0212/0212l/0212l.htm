<h3>Fragments from a New Finnish Epic</h3>
<blockquote><p>
"[Longfellow's] 'Song of Hiawatha' adapted its meter from the Finnish national epic 'Kalevala'"</p>

<p>
<i>[From the prologue]</i><br>
In a city called Helsinki,<br>
Capital of icy Finland,<br>
Where the days are dark in winter,<br>
Where the nights are bright in summer,<br>
Where no mother's son drops litter,<br>
(Finns are very down on litter)<br>
Dwelt a Swedish-speaking youngster<br>
By the name of Linus Torvalds.<br>
"Linus" being Schulz for blanket,<br>
"Torvalds" simply meaning Torvalds.
</p>


<p>
<i>[Formative years]</i><br>
Teenage Linus was precocious,<br>
He outgrew his old Vic 20,<br>
Got himself a Sinclair QL,<br>
Crazy, quirky Brit computer.<br>
CPU by Motorola:<br>
Rich in indirect addressing<br>
Great for quick assembler hacking<br>
And it wrote RAM big end forwards:<br>
High byte, mid byte, low byte, bot byte,<br>
That's the way that God intended.
</p>


<p>
<i>[An early battle]</i><br>
What of Tanebaum, the warrior?<br>
He, a wise old Dutch professor,<br>
Flamer like a mighty dragon,<br>
Guardian of his precious Minix.<br>
But he made a grievous error,<br>
Biggest boob for 30 seasons<br>
When the man who worked for Decca<br>
Showed the door to Epstein's Beatles.<br>
Tanebaum poured scorn on Linux,<br>
Said he knew about OSes,<br>
Said he knew where things were going.<br>
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
</p>


<p>
<i>[Leaving Finland]</i><br>
Goodbye Linus, you must leave us<br>
Westward-ho to get a RealJobTM<br>
Managed now by Tove Monni<br>
Champion Finn karate lady.<br>
Does she dance nude round each upgrade<br>
Just as Hiawatha's missus,<br>
Minnehaha, Laughing Water, <br>
Did "debug" the precious maize crop?<br>
This and other pressing questions<br>
Are not answered in this poem,<br>
Poem of untested Booleans,<br>
Poem with and without Fin[n]ish.<br>
</p>




<h3>GEE OH OH, GEE ELL EEE</h3>


<p>
I'm a Google majorette<br>
Marching on the Internet<br>
Techies all, come march with me<br>
G-O-O, G-L-E!<br>
</p>

<p>
SuSEr at your <code>bash</code> prompt: Hey!<br>
Look how <code>man</code> gets in the way.<br>
Stoop to Konqueror and then<br>
Twirl those batons once again.<br>
</p>

<p>
Microsoftie in your den<br>
Searching through M-S-D-N<br>
<i>Don't</i> wait for your CD-ROM:<br>
Google user's been and gone.<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesser engines: off you go!<br>
Advert-ridden, poor and slow<br>
Google is the one for me:<br>
G-O-O, G-L-E!<br>
</p>

<p>
Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy<br>
<i>Ev'rybody</i> hear my cry<br>
Fall in line and chant with me<br>
G-O-O, G-L-E!<br>
</p>

<p>
German language, Latin, Thai,<br>
Nothing can your skills defy,<br>
PDF stuff, Usenet, pics,<br>
Kick your legs, girls! Flash those knicks!<br>
</p>

<p>
Google, Google, we love thee<br>
From way beyond each shining sea<br>
Google, Google, I love you<br>
I will never be untrue<br>
Google, Google, Google, Google,<br>
GOOOOOO-TWO-THREE-FOUR-<br>
<big>GUL!</big><br>
</p>

<p>
Pompoms at ease, you may rest now.
</p>

<h3>Strange Occurrence in the Small Hours</h3>


<p>
When I was a-coding just last Tuesday night,<br>
I hit on a rhythm and worked past midnight.<br>
The code that I wrote was so good and so fine<br>
It compiled straight off as I typed in each line.<br>
But just as I thought, 'Time to lay down my head,'<br>
The lights flickered once and the PC went dead.<br>
I cried out in pain, for my work had gone bang<br>
And a bright Cockney angel manifested and sang:<br>
</p>

<p>
"Your program 'as gone dahn the bitsream,<br>
Not a byte of it's sived on your disks.<br>
It was too luverly to rahn in this bad world of ours,<br>
Man Upstairs wasn't takin' no risks.<br>
'E's spiri'ed your program away from you,<br>
'E so much admired wot you wrought- <br>
Your program 'as gone dahn the bitsream<br>
'Ow much is tech support?"
</p>



<h3>Lullaby</h3>


<p>
In his little cradle <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My little palmtop sleeps.<br>
Suddenly he trembles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With plaintive little bleeps.<br>
Hush, little palmtop!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep on another day.<br>
It's just a little deadline<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set by DDJ.
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Verity Stob wishes to apologise to H.W. "Laughing Water" Longfellow for inflicting yet more damage on "The Song of Hiawatha," a work that might reasonably be claimed to have suffered enough already.</p>
