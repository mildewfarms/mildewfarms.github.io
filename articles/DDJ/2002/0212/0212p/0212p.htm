<h1>
It Brings on Many Changes
</h1>

<i>by Michael Swaine</i>
<hr>

<p>
Thanks for dropping in on the online edition of "Programming
Paradigms"&$151;a 21st Century innovation in a column that, in its print
form, is now in its 15th year. "Programming Paradigms"  is
written by me, Michael Swaine, editor-at-large for <i>Dr. Dobb's
Journal</i>, and it covers... well, let's see. The things that are on my
mind this month are: <a href="#video">suicide</a>, <a
href="#changes">changes</a>, <a href="#video">video post-processing</a>,
<a href="#intentional">intentional programming</a>, <a
href="#wolfram">Stephen Wolfram versus Ed Fredkin</a>, <a
href="#changes">online columns versus print columns</a>, <a
href="#quantum">a challenge to the Church-Turing thesis</a>, and <a
href="#plop">the popularity of PLoP</a>.
</p>

<h3>
A New Paradigm for Paradigms

</h3></a>

<p>
"Programming Paradigms" now appears in the print version of
<i>DDJ</i> in odd months, and here online in even months. Or is it the
other way around? Anyway, "Paradigms" alternates between a
print column and an online column. And I'm just coming to understand the
implications of this innovation.
</p>

<p>
I have been writing both print and online columns for years, so I think
I know the difference. But writing a single column bimedially is a new
twist, and I'm just starting to find my way. Deadlines are interesting.
"C Programming" columnist Al Stevens is grappling with the same
challenge. I'll be interested to see how he deals with it.
</p>

<p>
My tentative plan is to present shorter, more timely items here online,
such as this month's short takes on Darbee Labs and the list of links to
subjects Simonyian. Same theme, programming paradigms, but different
approach. I'll also present more interactive material. Reader
contributions will more likely appear here than in the print column,
such as this month's two letters on the Wolfram-Fredkin theme. And I'll
use some of this flexible online column space to keep you apprised of
what I'm up to.
</p>

<p>
I'm also using shorter paragraphs.
</p>

<p>
Let's dispense with what I'm up to right now. Briefly, though. I don't
want to make this column excessively narcissistic. That's what my Web
site is for.
</p>

<p>
I have a book coming out in January (knock wood) on developing
applications in REALbasic. It's from <a
href="http://www.peachpit.com/">Peachpit Press</a> and is called <i>The
Visual QuickStart Guide to REALbasic.</i> For most <i>DDJ</i> readers
it'll probably be too, uh, basic. What can I say? I'm a Saturday-morning
programmer and I needed to learn a Saturday-morning programming
language. So I wrote a book about one.
</p>

<p>
You learn a lot from writing a book. I learned what I always learn when
I write a book: writing a book differs from other forms of torture only
in that you do it to yourself. I recommend writing a book if you are,
say, a would-be terrorist with a lot of idle time. The Unabomber
counterexample notwithstanding, there are very few people who could
carry out a campaign of terror while writing a book. Especially a book
on programming.
</p>

<p>
While I'm going on about me, I'll let you in on a secret. Those asides
attributed to someone called ed in the <i>DDJ</i> <a
href="http://www.ddj.com/maillists/">newsletters</a> recently are mine.
I took over the editing of the newsletters with the October issues. To a
writer, doing a stint as an editor is the sweetest revenge. <I>DDJ</i>
newsletter authors: I'm only kidding. Everyone else: &lt;evil grin&gt;.

<h3>
Visions of the things to be

</h3></a>

<p>
But enough about me. <a href="http://www.darbeelabs.com">Darbee Labs</a>
is a startup company with technology that is supposed to add realism to
movies and DVDs. Its CEO claims to be the inventor of the universal
remote control and its President is the person who, many years ago,
wrote the following:
</p>

<p>
Through early morning fog I see<br>
Visions of the things to be<br>
The pains that are withheld for me<br>
I realize and I can see<br>
That suicide is painless....
</p>

<p>
...when he was 14 years old.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if Robert Altman's son Michael knows anything about
software, but "Suicide Is Painless" has always appealed to the
14-year-old boy in me and I'd wondered off and on over the years what
its author was doing since writing the theme for <i>M.A.S.H.</i> Working in
the movie industry, is the unsurprising answer. Until this year, that
is, when, surprisingly, he left Fox to become the President of this tech
startup.
</p>

<p>
So what's Darbee Labs all about? CEO and founder Paul Darbee answers:
"Think of it as 'pre-emphasizing' an image for the human brain."
</p>

<p>
The product, DarbeeVision, is a filter that you apply to a movie after
it has been digitized. It uses knowledge of how humans process visual
information to emphasize depth of field and improve clarity in all
images during film/video postproduction, even giving a subtle 3D-ish
effect. The first big customer for the technology was legendary director
Robert Altman, who insisted on using DarbeeVision to enhance his Academy
Award-winning movie <i>Gosford Park</i>; when it went to DVD. I
<i>think</i> this was before his son joined the firm.
</p>

<p>
Darbee has applied for a patent on the technology, and the company hopes
to see it adopted for high-definition broadcasts, theatrical film
prints, still photography, standard television broadcast, advertising,
and games.
</p>

<p>
Darbee got the idea behind DarbeeVision while working with 3D images. He
developed a technique that seemed to retain some of the perceived
sharpness and depth of 3D even when the multiple images of 3D data were
collapsed into a single 2D image. Then he found that he could achieve
the same effect starting from a 2D image.
</p>

<p>
So is it any good? Well, if Robert Altman thinks so, that's a pretty
good recommendation. But at least one reviewer of the <i>Gosford
Park</i> DVD disagrees.
</p>

<p>
Reviewer Dan Ramer on May 29, 2002: " [T]he experiment just doesn't
work..... [A]t 55:00, each pheasant, silhouetted against the gray,
overcast sky, is enclosed by a bright halo. The image is also a bit on
the soft side, as the video was filtered to remove the high frequency
textures that would make the compression more challenging. Pity."
</p>

<p>
Still, if Altman likes it....
</p>

<p>
Michael Altman's lyrics can be read at various sites, such as <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/8200/Song.htm">this one</a>.

<h3>
The losing card I'll someday play

</h3></a>

<p>
Charles Simonyi is leaving Microsoft. He wants to pursue his dream of
creating what he calls intentional programming. Is he taking a huge
risk? And what's intentional programming?
</p>

<p>
Risk? He's rich. What's he risking? And Microsoft will license what he
develops if there's anything to it. No, Simonyi's bigger risk would be
if it turns out that his very good friend Martha Stewart turned him on
to Imclone stock and then told him when to sell it on the basis of
insider information. So far as I know that's not the case, but Martha is
in the investigators' crosshairs. But I have no inside information to
impart.
</p>

<p>
So what is intentional programming? Here's the inside information from
Charles:
</p>

<p>
"To enable the ecology, all you have to do is make the abstractions
completely self-describing, so that an abstraction will carry all of its
description, both of how it looks and of what it does. It's called
intentional programming because the abstractions really represent the
programmers' original computational intent."
</p>

<p>
To find out what that means, you might check some of these links:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a
href="http://www.omniscium.com/nerdy/ip/FutureIsIntentional.asp">A 1999
IEEE article by Simonyi explaining intentional programming</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://www.edge.org/digerati/simonyi/simonyi_p1.html">Simonyi, as
one of John Brockman's Digerati, talks intentionally</a></li>

</ul>
...plus these seemingly-related topics:
<ul>
<li><a

<li><a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/hyperspace/">IBM research on
Hyperspaces</a></li>
<li><a href="http://aspectj.org/">and this resource on AspectJ</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course the trick is to decide <i>how</i> any or all of these is
related to intentional programming.

<h3>
The Game of Life is hard to play

</h3></a>

<p>
It would be churlish to characterize the work of Stephen Wolfram and Ed
Fredkin as elaborations on the Game of Life. But both have studied
cellular automata like the Game of Life and think that these simple
program-worlds hold deep insights into the structure of reality. Several
readers sent thoughtful responses to my recent columns on Wolfram and
Fredkin. In the following, DP refers to Fredkin's Digital Philosophy and
NKS refers to Wolfram's <i>A New Kind of Science</i>.

Mike Naegele wrote:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Where DP proponents are trying to build a basis for 'real
physics', NKS is trying to kick the props out from under the whole
shebang. DP tries to distance itself from lattice gas models, for
instance, which are seen as just an approximation of the real equations.
NKS is saying that (I am stretching a point here) a lattice model *is*
the real physics, or at least may be one of many valid rule sets.
</p>

<p>
"In short, Wolfram's vision is much broader, and certainly not
limited to physics. In the Theory-of-Everything department, however,
Wolfram goes considerably beyond DP. If you put together causality
digraphs, mobile automata, and node-replacement rules, you might get the
Node and the Rule. The Rule operated on the Node, which begat more
nodes, creating a causal graph of the world. It does't get more elegant
than that."

<p>
"The difference between Fredkin's and Wolfram's approach is as
follows. Fredkin tries to challenge the assumption of continuity in the
fundamental physical quantities. Wolfram tries to challenge the
assumption of fundamentalness in the same quantities.
While this leads to a slew of differences, a particularly important one
is that Fredkin and others make a fundamental distinction between space
and its contents which Wolfram does not - and for this reason alone I
believe Wolfram makes an original contribution. In my opinion, Wolfram's
proposals are also more tangible: despite obliterating time, space, and
matter he is able to reproduce special and general relativity, with the
ideas coming up again in his discussion on how quantum mechanics has the
potential to work in the deterministic setup.
</p>

<p>
"But Fundamental Physics is not a chapter about principles but a
demonstration of method, and by itself does not come close to
encompassing the most important points of Wolfram's thought. And so, to
fully understand Wolfram's rather direct criticism of the "Universe
as CA" proposal it becomes necessary to understand Wolfram's ideas
about the correspondence between models and reality, which in turns
requires understanding the PCE and its implications for perception and
analysis."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Wolfram's work can be explored in his book <a
href+"http://www.wolframscience.com/index.html"><i>A New Kind of
Science</i></a> and through a software package from <a
href="http://www.wolfram.com">Wolfram Research</a>, A New Kind of
Science Explorer. Fredkin's work can be found at his <a
href="http://www.digitalphilosophy.org">Digital Philosophy</a> Website.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I still think that Fredkin had some of the key ideas first,
but I also agree that Wolfram is after something bigger. Bigger than
just about anybody.

The only way to win is cheat

<p>
I've been weaving a thread on quantum computing in this column for about
a year, but for this installment I just want to point you to <a
href="http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/19601.html">this good
article</a> on why a quantum computer could undermine the Church-Turing
thesis, crack uncrackable codes, and solve unsolvable problems.

Sounds good, but then she goes on:

<p>
"In the recently arrived November 2002 issue you are writing about
writers workshops. A few weeks ago we had the first Nordic PLoP
conference - VikingPLoP, which I had the honour of being conference
chair for. I wonder why you do not mention the PLoP series of
conferences that has taken place several times a year since the mid 90s.
At these conferences software people from industry and a minority from
academia bring their patterns papers to be workshopped in writers
workshops."
