Hypercube has announced HyperView++ for MFC 1.0, a class library for adding dialog/view editor capability into an application. HyperView++ comes with a base set of default objects and controls. Custom objects and controls can be easily created for use within the editor and run time. <P>
For instance, according to Hypercube, the <I>CHyperView</I> class, which is based on MFC's <I>CView</I>, is somewhat like a &quot;supercharged&quot; <I>CFormView</I>. <I>CHyperView</I> provides additional functionality for editing, creating, and using dialogs/views without recompiling, and creating new custom objects using inheritance. The class library, which is compatible with Win16/Win32/DBCS, sells for $2000.00 and comes with C++ source code.<P>

Motorola's Advanced Microcontroller Division has announced a real-time embedded kernel called RTEK for 68300 32-bit microcontrollers based on the CPU32 core. The RTEK kernel offers a real-time operating-system framework for a broad range of embedded software applications. This kernel supports both static and dynamic kernel objects.<P>
Motorola's RTEK kernel provides over 180 services to manage system resources such as the CPU, program tasks, memory, and time. The kernel services are divided into eight classes: task, semaphore, queue, mailbox and message, memory, mutex, timer, and interrupt processing services. You can also choose from three methods for scheduling tasks: preemptive, time-sliced, and round robin. <P>
The RTEK API for the 68300 family is written in both C and assembly languages; the API for the PowerPC MPC500 family is written in C. Included with the RTEK package is a graphical-system generation program called RTEKgen for configuring the system. It also lets you specify System and Object Class properties and define the properties of static objects. RTEKgen produces source-language structures that can be compiled or assembled to give accurate, error-free system tables. <P>
The PowerPC RTEK SDK for the MPC500 family runs on a Sun workstation host and is priced at $3950.00 per seat. The 68300 (CPU32) RTEK SDK runs on a PC (Windows 3.1) host and is priced at $3450.00 per seat. Both SDKs include RTEK object code, source code for drivers and utilities, the RTEKgen system-generation utility, language interface libraries, and complete documentation. <P>

Atemi's recently released AtemiConnect software lets you connect Macintoshes to remote AppleTalk LANs via the Internet, giving you access to all the data, programs, and services on that LAN. When used with NetShade, Atemi's network-security utility, AtemiConnect sets up a secure virtual network across the Internet.<P>
Once you have established an AtemiConnect link to a remote LAN, all of the services available on that network--file servers, databases, groupware applications, AppleTalk e-mail systems, network printers, network games, and the like--can be accessed as if you were locally connected to that network. The client and server must both be running the AtemiConnect software before the link can be established, and the remote LAN's AppleShare security settings will apply to the link.<P>
Atemi will include a free copy of NetShade 1.1--an AppleTalk encryptor that combines RSA's public key technology with secure ciphers such as DES and Triple DES--with every purchase of AtemiConnect through March 1996. The AtemiConnect Personal Server (allowing one in-bound or out-bound connection at a time) sells for about $200.00, and includes a two-user license for NetShade; the Small Business Server (allowing up to five simultaneous connections) sells for about $400.00. <P>

Qualitas is shipping Qualitas MAX 8, Version 8 of memory manager. In addition to providing traditional DOS-memory management, MAX 8 also manages Windows resources through its new &quot;Go Ahead&quot; technology, which uses extended memory instead of low-DOS memory for DLLs. Instead of using RAM compression techniques to manage Windows resources, Go Ahead helps Windows use global DOS memory more efficiently by managing low DOS resources. The memory manager supports Windows 95 and Plug and Play machines. Included in MAX 8 is DOSMAX for Windows 95 which provides up to 736-KB low DOS memory. Also included is a set of Windows tools to make memory management easier: a Windows resource monitor called &quot;MAXmeter,&quot; a Windows file editor called &quot;MAXedit,&quot; and a MAX 8 configuration utility called &quot;Toolbox.&quot; The package is available for a suggested retail price of $99.95; the upgrade price is $29.95.<P>

HiTecSoft has announced release of a Network Management Extension (NMX) standard for creating open architecture NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) libraries. The NMX spec creates open architecture NLM libraries for sharing NLM functionality through a set of common APIs. These APIs let you create NLMs that share common libraries and call on other NLMs from other vendors as if they were part of their own library. The libraries are created using Novell's NLM SDK and C/C++ compiler.<P>
NMX libraries can be accessed within applications developed using C/C++ and ManageWare or any other NetWare-based languages (including scripting languages). They can automatically load and unload into and out of memory, providing functionality similar to DLLs. They also support dynamic parameter passing allowing for development of high-level routines that can perform multiple tasks based on type and number of passed parameters (parameter overloading, similar to C++). Finally, they provide run-time parameter type checking allowing applications to guard against abnormal termination due to type mismatch errors.<P>

Hewlett-Packard has introduced Version 5.0 of its SoftBench development environment for C/C++ and Cobol programmers. SoftBench 5.0 includes a new Graphical Class Editor that lets you create and manipulate C++ code, then automatically generate that code. Extending the browsing and navigation capabilities of the C++ SoftBench Static Analyzer's Class Graph, the Graphical Class Editor enables the graphical creation, deletion, and modification of classes, relationships, member functions, and data members. Changes are reflected throughout the source code, not just in the module being edited. <P>
The tool also incorporates a CodeAdvisor, which provides rule-based C++ code checking that identifies and locates potentially serious problems in C++ code. CodeAdvisor comes with a shared library of common C++ rules and can be extended to include additional user-defined rule sets.<P>
Finally, SoftBench CM gives geographically dispersed development teams the ability to work together on the same software project. Available for all programming languages, SoftBench CM snaps into existing SoftBench environments and is accessible from SoftBench tools, including the Editor, Builder or Static Analyzer. SoftBench CM is built on the Revision Control System (RCS) standard.<P>
At the same time, HP introduced a SoftBench SDK that lets you extend and customize SoftBench environments. The SoftBench SDK consists of the existing SoftBench Encapsulator, the SoftBench Static Read API, and instructions for creating user-defined rules for C++ SoftBench CodeAdvisor. <P>
The SoftBench suite is available for HP-UX and Solaris platforms starting at $1895.00.<P>

Lead Technologies has introduced Leadtools OCX, an imaging SDK that enables the integration of black/white (1-bit), grayscale (8-bit) and color (4-,8-,16-,24-and 32-bit) images into applications. Designed as an OLE Custom Control, Lead's OCX is available in a 16-bit version for Windows 3.1, and a 32-bit version for Windows 95, Windows NT, and WIN 32s for Windows 3.1. Leadtools OCX contains over 130 methods and properties, and is compatible with any application that can make use of an OCX. Specific examples are provided for Visual C/C++, Visual Basic 4.0, Visual FoxPro, and Access.<P>
Leadtools OCX provides methods and properties which read, write, compress (JPEG, CMP, CCITT G3/G4, and more), convert, and display images. Developers can scroll, zoom, dither, and process images (such as resize, rotate, flip, invert, reverse, transpose, crop, sharpen, blur, edge and line detection, mosaic, hue and saturation, combine, histogram equalize, gamma correction and intensity detection, shear, grayscale, halftone, auto-deskew, despeckle, and more). Leadtools OCX can import and export over 40 standard-image file formats including JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, WMF, EPS, PCX, TGA, RAW FAX, WINFAX, CALS, IOCA, PICT, PCD, PSD, GEM, RAS, WPG, and more. This toolkit also supports printing (multi-image and text), TWAIN-compliant single and multi-page scanning devices, video capture, and the Windows clipboard. <P>
The toolkit starts at $295.00, and is available free of royalties or license fees. <P>
