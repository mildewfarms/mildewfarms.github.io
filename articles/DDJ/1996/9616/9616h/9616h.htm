In general, there are three kinds of tape backups: the ones made by system
administrators for servers on your office network, those you make on your PC, and
the ones you should make on your PC, but don't. The first of these doesn't cost
you any money, time, or effort, so you probably don't care whether or not MIS
uses digital audio tape (DAT), linear DAT, or whatever.<P>

Like many of you, I bought my first tape backup three years ago. (The December 7,
1993 <I>PC Magazine</I> included a full-page Colorado Memory Systems ad that
urged readers to stop using floppy disks for backup!) But hard-disk capacities
have gone up by a factor of 8 in that time, so you probably have a 120/250-MB
tape backup but are using a 2.5-GB hard drive.<P>

The problem has two solutions. One is to buy a new tape drive (and new media).
This may cost a lot less than you think. The second solutionavailable to anyone
currently using 2120, 2120XL, or 3020XL tape cartridgesis to upgrade to a longer
tape with a lot more capacity.<P>

<h3>Native Versus Compressed Capacity</h3><P>

Tape systems (drive, minicartridge, and format) are rated for both native
(uncompressed) and compressed capacity. By a gentlemen's agreement among
manufacturers, the rated compressed capacity is roughly double the native
capacity. If only one capacity is mentioned in an ad, it is the compressed
capacity. The actual compressed capacity is file-type dependent, but most folk
find they can store at least 1.6 times the native capacity using compression.<P>

I just bought a 3.2-GB tape-backup drive. This tells me the native capacity is
1.6 GB and that I can probably store at least 2.56 GB using compression. For the
purposes of this column, I'll give capacity as native/compressed (rated); for
instance "120/250 MB."<P>

If you thumb through ads in the most recent <I>Computer Shopper</I>, you'll find
a dizzying variety of tape drives, formats, media, capacities, and price points.
Rather than review a few particular drives, I'll try to help you make sense of
this variety.<P>

<h3>Two Tapes</h3><P>

Since we have banished expensive DAT drives to the outer darkness, there are only
two kinds of tape available550 Oe (Oersteds) tape rated at up to 15K flux
transitions per inch (FTPI, a.k.a. flux reversals per inch, or FRPI), and 900 Oe
tape rated at up to 45K FPTI. In general, <I>1 flux transition = 1 bit</I>,
except that data bits require extra formatting overhead.<P>

<h3>Two Widths</h3><P>

Minicartridge tapes are either 0.315 inches (8 mm) wide or 0.25 inches wide.<P>

<h3>Three Minicartridges</h3><P>

There are three basic types of minicartridges: QIC using 0.25-inch wide tape,
QIC-W using 0.315-inch wide tape, and the Travan using 0.315-inch (8-mm) wide
tape.<P>

QIC is short for "Quarter-Inch Committee," and QIC-W for "Quarter-Inch Committee
Wide." Travan is a newer standard set by a consortium of tape-backup suppliers to
provide a longer tape for higher data capacity, while remaining compatible with
QIC-W.<P>

<h3>Four Densities (Formats)</h3><P>

Each of the two kinds of tape (550 or 900 Oe) comes in two basic formats. The
higher format has twice the data density of the lower format. QIC-W and Travan
tapes have 25 percent more tracks than 0.25-inch tapes because the tapes are 25
percent wider; technically, these are different formats.<P>

550 Oe 0.25-inch tape uses either QIC-40 ("Thetamat") or QIC-80 ("Ximat")
formats. The first uses 20 tracks and 10K FTPI for 60/120 MB on a 307-foot tape;
the second, 28 tracks and about 14.7K FTPI for 125/250 MB on a 307-foot tape. The
QIC-40 format is obsolete. 900 Oe 0.25-inch tape uses either the 3010 ("Pimat")
or 3020 ("Taumat") format. Both use 40 tracks. 3010 uses about 22.125K FTPI, 3020
about 44.25K FTPI.<P>

Tapes are recorded in a serpentine fashion. The first track is recorded from the
start of the tape to the end; tape motion is then reversed and the second track
is written in the reverse direction.<P>

Why use the lower-density format on a given tape cartridge? So you can use a tape
drive that has a cheaper read/write head. The r/w head is the most expensive part
of a high-density tape drive. Why use the higher density? You can store twice as
much data on a given tape cartridge, lowering your media costs. My advice is to
go for the higher density.<P>

<h3>Travan Tape Cartridges</h3><P>

These tapes are 750 feet long and 0.315 inch wide. Tr-1 uses 550 Oe media and is
roughly equivalent to the QIC-80 format. Tr-2 and Tr-3 use 900 Oe media and are
equivalent to the QIC-W (3010 and 3020) formats. The Tr-4 is for DAT drives.<P>

Travan tapes are a standardized way to cram a lot of tape (0.315 inchx750 feet) into a single cartridge, while retaining the ability to read QIC
and QIC-W tapes.<P>

Tr-1EX and Tr-3EX tapes, presumably 1000-feet long, have just been introduced.<P>

<h3>Tape Lengths</h3><P>

0.25-inch tape is available in 205-, 307-, 400-, and 1000-foot lengths.
0.315-inch tape is available in 400- and 1000-foot lengths, plus the 750-foot
Travan cartridges.<P>

The new 2120EX(tra) and 3020EX tape cartridges are recent developments by
Verbatim. The 400-foot tape length of a 2120XL cartridge is determined by the
width of the two side-by-side tape bobbins in the cartridge. Verbatim's 2120EX
cartridges hold 1000 feet by using larger bobbins that are staggered, not
side-by-side. The physical cartridge is a heck of a lot longer than a standard
2120, but the height and width are unchanged.<P>

Verbatim's 3020EX is to the 3020XL as the 2120EX is to the 2120.<P>

Travan modifies the size and shape of the cartridge to hold more tape; the "neck"
of the cartridge is the same as a QIC cartridge, but the part that remains
outside the tape drive is slightly larger in all three dimensions. (Although the
lengths and widths of the Tr-1 and 2120EX cartridges differ, the area of the
enclosed tape is about the same, thus the capacities are the same.)<P>

<h3>1000-Foot Tapes on Your Drive</h3><P>

If you have a 120/250- or 680/1360-MB tape drive, it can use the newer cartridges
with longer tapes if you update the software.<P>

The Verbatim 2120EX and 3020EX tapes come with Arcada Backup 5.0 for Windows
3.1/95 on a 3.5-inch floppy, plus a 24-page manual. You can record 400/800 MB on
your old 120/250-MB drive or 1.6/3.2 GB on your old 680/1320-MB drive! (A
four-page info card tells you where to write for free DOS-compatible
software.)<P>

<h3>Formatted or Unformatted Tapes?</h3><P>

Most tape cartridges are sold with preformatted media. A 3000XL cartridge is
unformatted; you can format it as either a 3010XL or 3020XL cartridge (with the
right tape drive and software).<P>

<h3>Internal or External?</h3><P>

If you have only one computer, internal tape drives are usually cheaper. If you
have more than one computer (or if you don't have another available front-panel
slot) an external drive will be best.<P>

<h3>Backup Speeds</h3><P>

All tape-backup drives are slow. You are definitely not going to sit in front of
your computer waiting for completion of a full backup/verify. With hard-disk
capacities of 850 MB and up, you can perform an incremental backup/verify over
lunch, but a full backup/verify should be considered an overnight operation. (An
incremental backup is a backup of only those files more recent than the last
backup. Incremental backups, plus the occasional full backup, are a way to
provide frequent backups without going broke buying tape cartridges.)<P>

You should always verify after backing up, even though this doubles the elapsed
time.<P>

Some tape drives, such as my old Trakker 250, are noisy. Close a door between
your bedroom and your computer. No door? Make sure you buy a quiet drive.<P>

<h3>Data Recording Rates</h3><P>

The backup time depends mostly on how fast data is recorded onto the tape. The
data rates are standardized: 500 Kbits, 1 Mbit, or 2 Mbits/sec.<P>

If you have an internal drive that uses the floppy controller, you're limited to
500 Kbits unless your floppy controller is 2.88-MB compatible, in which case
1-Mbit data rates are available. To provide the 2-Mbit/sec data rates of which
3020 and Tr-3 tapes are capable, you need a special controller card. Special
controller cards usually include a data buffer that allows continuous recording.
Absent that buffer, there will be pauses while software builds the next block of
data to be recorded.<P>

External drives use the parallel port. An ordinary unidirectional printer port is
limited to 500 Kbits/sec. If bidirectional, 1 Mbit/sec. The newer EPP/ECP printer
ports are compatible with 2-Mbit/sec data rates (or even-faster data rates when
new tapes and drives permit).<P>

SCSI tape drives are usually too expensive to be considered for personal use and
hence are excluded from this article.<P>

<h3>Recording Throughput</h3><P>

A 500-Kbit/sec rate results in 2.5-MB/ minute native-formatted data recording if
your interface has a buffer, or (roughly) 1.8 MB/minute without a buffer. 1
Mbit/sec = 5-MB/minute native throughput with a buffer or 3.6-MB/minute without;
2 Mbit/sec doubles the 1-Mbit/sec numbers. Using compression can (up to) double
the native data rate.<P>

The maximum bit rate depends on the media and format: QIC-80, 3010, Tr-1, and
Tr-2 tapes are limited to 1 Mbit/sec, while 3020 and Tr-3 tapes are capable of 2
Mbit/sec. Slower data rates are possible to accommodate nonoptimum interfaces;
most (all?) manufacturer's software/hardware packages allow using the next-lower
bit rate when nonoptimum interfaces are involved.<P>

<h3>Double Compression</h3><P>

If you're using compression on your hard disk, remember that the "native" data is
the uncompressed data. Plus, it may take a lot longer to uncompress the files on
the hard disk and then recompress them for the tape drive. <P>

<h3>My New Tape Drive</h3><P>

I recently bought a new Exabyte Eagle 96 internal tape drive, locally on sale at
Fry's, for a munificent $119.95 plus tax. When I opened the box I found the drive
(which fits a standard 5.25-inch slot), a 2-Mbit/sec controller card with buffer
and connecting cable, and an apparently complete Arcada Backup software package
for DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows 95. It didn't come with a tape cartridge.<P>

The Eagle 96 uses 0.25-inch tapes and records 680/1360 MB on a 3020XL, or 1.6/3.2
GB on a 3020EX. It will read old QIC-80 tapes. I've seen this drive advertised at
another local retail outlet for $153.00 and in the May 1996 <I>Computer
Shopper</I> for $172.00.<P>

3020EX cartridges are available via mail order for under $25.00. That means my
media costs are just under a penny per megabyte using compression.<P>

<h3>2120 Price and Demand</h3><P>

Perhaps half of tape minicartridge sales coincide with the purchase of the tape
drive itself. Since shipments of 120/250-MB drives are almost nil, shipments of
2120 tapes are also down, and there may be lots of 2120s gathering dust on
manufacturer's shelves.<P>

I've seen sales of name-brand 2120 tapes at $0.00 (!) (after mail-in rebate) and
also at $3.98 with no mail-in rebate. If you hold your hard-disk partitions to
the capacity of one of these tapes, this is another cheap way to store data
without buying a new tape drive.<P>

<h3>Tape Compatibility</h3><P>

If you buy a new tape drive, the tapes with which it is compatible will be
prominently printed on the outside of the box. Here's what you'll find:<P>

<P>
<ul>
<li>Drives designed for 0.25-inch tape, such as my new one, cannot use any
0.315-inch tape cartridge. 0.315-inch drives can, however use 0.25-inch
tape.</li>
<li>Drives designed for 550 Oe media cannot read or write 900 Oe tapes. Drives
designed for 900 Oe media can read but not write 550 Oe tapes.</li>
<li>Drives cannot read or write cartridges that are formatted for densities
higher than the drive's nominal density.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Summary</h3><P>

The tape-backup market is unsettled to say the least, with new models appearing
in rapid succession. Like hard drives, anything you buy this year will be
obsolescent and overpriced next year. The problem is, you need to back up your
hard drive now.<P>

Tape drives and cartridges are considered accessories and are subject to large
retail markups (my $120 drive apparently has an MSRP of $235). You should shop
around and watch for sales unless you like to pay high prices.<P>

The information in this column and in <a href="9616h.htm#02a2_0149">Table 1</A>
should help you choose among the large variety of competing tape backups. <P>
