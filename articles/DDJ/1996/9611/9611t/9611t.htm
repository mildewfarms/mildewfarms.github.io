Diamond Multimedia Systems will begin offering its Monster 3D graphics subsystem to OEMs looking to create high-performance PC gaming machines. Monster 3D, based on the 3Dfx Interactive Voodoo Graphics technology, is a 3-D-only pass-through graphics subsystem that provides high frame rates for 3-D games. The PCI-bus architecture allows 3-D to work seamlessly with existing 2-D graphics accelerators. <P>
In addition to the Microsoft Direct3D API, Monster 3D also supports 3DR, Renderware, Brender, and the Glide API, an interface widely utilized in the creation of coin-op/arcade titles. The 3D-only accelerator operates transparently with popular VGA and Windows accelerators via an analog pass-through connector on Intel-based platforms. With dedicated texture memory architecture, Monster 3D allows for advanced 3-D rendering. The subsystem provides 3-D features such as full-speed Z-buffer, perspective-corrected texture mapping, bilinear and advanced composite texture filtering, MIP-mapping; double-buffered Gouraud shading, texture compositing, morphing and animation, and per-pixel special effects for transparent and translucent objects. <P>
