<h1><i>DDJ</i> Client/Server Programming</h1><hr>
<h2>FEATURES</h2><P>

<h3><a href="9611a/9611a.htm">MIDDLEWARE AND THREE-TIER CLIENT/SERVER DEVELOPMENT</A></h3><P>

<i>by Timothy E. Carone</i><P>

Transaction managers-server-based software that enable the development and management of application programs-are key to the success of distributed processing. Timothy develops a typical three-tier, client/server system, using Tuxedo as the transaction manager and the Oracle Database Server as a resource manager. <P>

<h3><a href="9611b/9611b.htm">OPTIMIZING CLIENT/SERVER DATABASE APPLICATIONS</A></h3><P>

<i>by Gary Bist</i><P>

Gary examines two coding methods-the Compound SQL statement and stored procedures-to reduce and reuse embedded SQL code to increase performance and productivity.<P>

<h3><a href="9611c/9611c.htm">THE DBPERL RELATIONAL DATABASE API</A></h3><P>

by Perry Scherer<P>

DBperl is a Perl 5 package that implements a relational database API for a variety of database engines, including Oracle, Informix, Ingres, Interbase, Postgres, Sybase, and Unify 5.0. <P>

<h3><a href="9611d/9611d.htm">JAVA AND WEB-EXECUTABLE OBJECT SECURITY</A></h3><P>

<i>by Michael Shoffner and Merlin Hughes </i><P>

Our authors examine the general problems with Web-embedded executable objects and how Java's security model attempts to resolve them. <P>

<h3><a href="9611e/9611e.htm">SPEECH RESEARCH WITH WAVE-GL</A></h3><P>

<i>by Petra Lutter, Michael Muller-Wernhart, Jurgen Ramharter, Frank Rattay, and Peter Slowik</i><P>

WAVE-GL, short for &quot;Wave Generation Language,&quot; is a system designed for generating new sounds from mathematical descriptions. Our authors describe the tools they developed to create and manipulate WAV-format sound files.<P>

<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS </h2><P>

<h3><a href="9611f/9611f.htm">RESTARTING EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</A></h3><P>

<i>by Fredrik Bredberg, Ola Liljedahl, and Bengt Eliasson </i><P>

&quot;Hot&quot; starts allow a computer system to pick up at exactly the spot where it was before a system crash occurred. Operating systems such as the OSE RTOS from Enea Data make these hot starts possible.<P>

<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS </h2><P>

<h3><a href="9611g/9611g.htm">UNDOCUMENTED WINDOWS NT AND THE NETWARE CORE PROTOCOL     </A></h3><P>

<i>by Sven B. Schreiber</i><P>

NT's NetWare client API support leaves a lot to be desired. Sven shows you how to overcome this limitation by exploiting undocumented features of the NT NetWare redirector to send and receive NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) packets.<P>

<h2>PROGRAMMER'S TOOLCHEST</h2><P>

<h3><a href="9611h/9611h.htm">EXAMINING THE SYSTEMS&lt;TOOLKIT&gt; LIBRARY </A></h3><P>

<i>by Michael J. Vilot</i><P>

Systems&lt;ToolKit&gt; is a library that builds on the expressive foundation of the C++ Standard Library. It also adds iostream support to distributed C++ applications using sockets (and pipes, in the UNIX version) for IPC connections. Mike uses Systems&lt;ToolKit&gt; to develop a pair of distributed client/server applications for environments such as the Internet. <P>

<h3><a href="9611i/9611i.htm">EXAMINING FORTE EXPRESS</A></h3><P>

<i>by Nabil Hijazi</i><P>

Forte Express is a visual tool for client/server application development that generates the UI and database-access components of object-oriented, multi-tier applications. <P>

<h2>COLUMNS </h2><P>

<h3><a href="9611j/9611j.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</A> </h3><P>

<i>by Michael Swaine </i><P>

While examining multimedia-authoring tools, Michael realizes that if you give your users four ways to solve a problem, you don't really know what the problem is.<P>

<h3><a href="9611k/9611k.htm">C PROGRAMMING</A> </h3><P>

<i>by Al Stevens </i><P>

Years of piano playing and programming finally pay off, as Al breaks into the exciting world of late-night TV. Not quite ready to give up his day gig, however, Al also shows how he converted a dialog-based MFC application to use the Property Sheet/Property Page idiom.<P>

<h3><a href="9611l/9611l.htm">JAVA Q&amp;A</A></h3><P>

<h3><a href="9611m/9611m.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY </A></h3><P>

<i>by John Swartz</i><P>

The main idea behind LISP is that any data structure can be constructed from lists. Consequently, John turns to this language when in need of a simple solution to complex combination problems.<P>

<h3><a href="9611n/9611n.htm">UNDOCUMENTED CORNER </A></h3><P>

<i>by Robert R. Collins</i><P>

Robert presents a processor-detection algorithm that doesn't use Intel's CPUID instruction. <P>
