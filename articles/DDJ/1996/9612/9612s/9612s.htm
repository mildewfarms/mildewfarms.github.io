Apiary has announced OCX Expert, an add-on utility for Borland Delphi 2.0 that lets you create 32-bit ActiveX custom controls directly in Delphi. OCX Expert converts most existing Delphi 2.0 VCL components into ActiveX controls with little or no change. Integrated into the Delphi environment, the Expert steps you through a series of questions that determine which properties and methods should be exposed in the ActiveX control. MFC or separate run-time libraries are not needed to create or distribute these controls.<P>

Eastern Systems has announced TestBed 5.0 for Windows 95/NT 4.0. TestBed analyzes C, C++, Ada, Cobol, and Pascal source code and highlights areas of concern for attention. TestBed's Static Analysis capabilities include programming-standards verification, structured-programming verification, complexity-metric measurement, variable cross-reference, unreached-code reporting, static control-flow tracing, and procedure-call analysis. TestBed Dynamic Analysis executes an instrumented version of the source code to detect code-coverage defects, statement-execution frequency analysis, LCSAJ subpath coverage, and multiple subcondition coverage. TestBed options such as Tbsafe help users achieve quality certifications including RTCA/DO178B and BS EN ISO9000/TickelT. TestBed 5.0 itself was produced under an ISO9000 quality-management system.<P>
