<h3><a href="9612c/9612c.htm">LUA: AN EXTENSIBLE EMBEDDED LANGUAGE     </A></h3><P>

<i>by Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, Roberto Ierusalimschy, Waldemar Celes</i><P>

Lua is a freely-available, general-purpose embedded programming language designed to support procedural programming with data-description facilities. Its code compiles without change in most ANSI C compilers, including gcc (on AIX, IRIX, Linux, Solaris, SunOS, and ULTRIX), Turbo C (on DOS), Visual C++ (on Windows 3.1/95/NT), Think C (MacOS), and CodeWarrior (MacOS).<P>

<h3><a href="9612d/9612d.htm">VIRTUAL AUDIO THROUGH RAY TRACING     </A></h3><P>

<i>by Tom Zudock</i><P>

By understanding how we hear and the cues we use to identify the relative location of sound, you can process sound that's perceived as &quot;virtual audio.&quot; In this article, Tom focuses on how you determine the early reflections of a sound source that reach a listener in a simple room.<P>
