Apple Computer has announced a developer's release of Apple Game Sprockets, an SDK for creating multimedia and Internet-enabled games for Mac OS-based computers. Using the SDK, all Mac OScompatible games can feature real-time 3-D graphics, 3-D sound, Internet support, speech recognition, and input device/monitor control. Available royalty-free to developers, Game Sprockets includes the final release of QuickDraw 3D RAVE (Rendering Acceleration Virtual Engine), a multiplatform technology that enables you to incorporate plug-and-play 3-D acceleration hardware.<P>
The Apple Game Sprockets is a set of APIs designed to work with other Apple multimedia technologies such as QuickTime, QuickTime VR, QuickTime Conferencing, and QuickDraw 3D. You can mix-and-match individual sprockets to best enhance and complement the existing features of your title.  <P>
The current Apple Game Sprockets SDK includes: NetSprocket, an Internet connectivity and multiplayer gaming API; SoundSprocket, a 3-D sound and Sound Manager API; SpeechSprocket speech-recognition API; InputSprocket, digital-joystick control and input-device API; DrawSprocket, multiple buffering/display control API; and QuickDraw 3D RAVE, a multiplatform 3-D graphics API.<P>

AstraTek is previewing its Visual LAN Probe (VLP) for Sybase, a design and debugging tool used for Sybase-based client/server network development. Using frame recognition technology, VLP decodes network frames into Sybase SQL API calls. VLP translates network frames into Sybase SQL API calls so that you can view the data stream in the Sybase SQL language, instead of in strings of cryptic hex code. <P>
VLP analyzes the network stack from the datalink layer to the application layer, showing SQL API calls in ODBC, DBLib, or CTLib. VLP runs on any Windows NT workstation or server in a Sybase environment. VLP starts at $995.00.<P>

NobleNet has announced its EZ-API family of Component APIs. EZ-APIs supposedly simplify the integration of industry-standard and custom APIs and enable you to enhance API functions. With the tool, multiple APIs can share client, server, and network resources. Component API technology automatically multiplexes API calls over a single network connection between client and server and presents them to the server as a single-user process. By tightly integrating multiple APIs on the server, application efficiency is increased and servers can take on multiple API personalities. Additionally, EZ-APIs encapsulate each API function call in a modifiable source-code wrapper on both the client and server, allowing you to add enhancements to standard APIs such as security, auditing, compression, naming, and caching. This is achieved without modifying API behavior.  <P>
The first member of the EZ-API family, the OneDriver ODBC SDK, relocates the ODBC API from the Windows client to NT or to a variety of UNIX platforms. The SDK includes all necessary communications software to connect Microsoft Windows 3.1/95/NT clients to any standard TCP/IP server platform. OneDriver ODBC works with any ODBC-compliant database or front-end development tool including Visual Basic, PowerBuilder, Delphi, and Microsoft Access. The NobleNet OneDriver ODBC SDK is priced at $2500.00 per server for an unlimited number of users. Supported client platforms include Windows 3.1/95/NT, and server platforms include NT, Sun Solaris, HP/UX, and IBM AIX<P>

ILOG and SunSoft have announced an alliance to build a bridge between Java and C++. The TwinPeaks project will pave the way for Java-ready C++ components. The technology will support both standard C++ and ANSI C components. The bridge is a gateway program that allows C++ components to be recognized and used by Java through an automatically generated interface. A C++ component has two elements: an interface or header file and the object code. The TwinPeaks bridge will read and analyze the header file and produce both a Java interface file and a thin layer of Java/C++ bridge code, which translates API calls and data formats between Java and the object code of the existing component. Through this translation, Java will be able to recognize and use existing C++ components. <P>
