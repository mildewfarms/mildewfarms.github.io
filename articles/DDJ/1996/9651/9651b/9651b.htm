The ColoradOS/2 Conference, held October 15-20 at Keystone, Colorado's  Keystone Village Resort, attracted more than 400 of the world's foremost  programmers, system engineers, and client/server architects. About 40  percent were veterans of previous ColoradOS/2 Conferences, and one third  came from outside the United States.
 <P> 
    With a few exceptions, marketing types were absent (or, if they were there,  they were incognito). Conference organizers Wayne and Peggy Kovsky routinely  decline offers from vendors who want to help underwrite the event so that  commercialism and hype won't compromise its technical value. A measure of  their success is that most of the IBM technicians attending and/or  presenting say they feel free to be more candid at ColoradOS/2 than they  would at a company-sponsored event. IBMers were there because they asked to  be, not because they were told to go. Some even took personal vacation time  to attend. The quality of the technical content and the value of the  personal networking is that good.
 <P> 
    One of the few marketing types present was IBM Personal Software Products  Division's Director of Strategic Relations, John Soyring. He's one of those  who took vacation time to make his keynote presentation and to stick around  for personal enlightenment and networking. Soyring, as well as most of the  conferees, is still fighting brush fires ignited by IBM Chairman Lou  Gerstner's faux pas that fueled an "OS/2 is dead" mantra. The Gerstner  comment, quoted out of context by a major national publication, suggested  that IBM has given up on the desktop as a target for its flagship operating  system. Soyring told the group that "We (IBM) must make our communications  on OS/2 clear and concise. IBM is 100 percent committed to OS/2 on the  network and on the desktop. Period." He then candidly addressed a few of the  key components envisioned for the technological evolution of the next  decade.
 <P> 
    Using the equation "Cost of Ownership = acquisition + testing +  integration," Soyring said the recently announced Warp LAN Client and Warp  Server packages (along with others yet to come) move the testing and  integration costs out of the customers' budgets and make them the supplier's  (IBM's) responsibility. The pre-integrated packages also reduce the  customers' acquisition costs while simplifying installation and decision  making, according to Soyring.
 <P> 
    The initial packaging of Warp with networking components emphasizes a  strategy that looks well beyond desktop operating system skirmishes. "The  network is the platform," was the catch phrase first voiced by Soyring at  the conference. Later in the week two other keynote presenters offered the  same vision.
 <P> 
    Soyring said that issues of paramount importance for developers, both ISV  and corporate, include source-code portability and compliance with open  standards such as OSF and DCE blueprints.
 <P> 
    Between each morning's keynote address, conferees divided their time among  23 lectures. The conference agenda listed 78 distinct topics, ranging from  introductory sessions on specific CUA '91 GUI controls to the internals of  just about any 32-bit subsystem or C/C++ component. The sessions were  presented by the experts who wrote the code or invented the technology, and  required listeners to be up to speed with C, 32-bit multitasking, or  multithreaded, graphical, event-driven programming.
 <P> 
    One impressive subject at this year's event was Object REXX. Fully  compatible with classic REXX, O-REXX is like a Smalltalk or C++ command  line. Using the rexxtry.cmd script, O-REXX creator Rick McGuire demonstrated  what is probably the smallest-footprint, object-oriented programming  environment in the world. The size is very misleading. In less than 600  lines of code, McGuire built a sophisticated, "net-centric" application  suite which utilized a WWW browser and intelligent agents to conduct a  real-time, online auction. Look for O-REXX to appear on all IBM platforms,  as well as some UNIX-like environments (including Linux!), sometime in 1996.  Under OS/2, it benchmarks about 20 percent faster than classic REXX.
 <P> 
    IBM Fellow Mike Cowlishaw (creator of the REXX scripting language) stepped  away from REXX this year to talk about Web Browser Internals.
 <P> 
    Jay Benayon's presentations on "Heaps, Shared Memory, and Application  Performance in C/C++" zeroed in on major enhancements made to the C/C++  compiler's memory-management subsystem with release 3.0. (The compiler is  packaged as Visual Age C/C++ with a very nice visual builder and development  environment.) Besides tightening up allocations and giving you more control,  Benayon's improvements include private heaps on a per-thread basis. Careful  exploitation of Jay's improvements should yield dramatic performance  improvements for apps coded with the Visual Age C/C++ (VACPP) compiler and  libraries.
 <P> 
    Speaking of libraries, the Developers' API Extensions (DAX) are in beta and  were dissected at ColoradOS/2. This API set will let developers maintain a  single set of source code for all platforms. IBM platforms, including AIX  and many other UNIX-like implementations, will be directly supported by the  same API set as OS/2. The same goes for minis and mainframes from IBM as  well as most other open-systems-compliant OEMs. Proprietary platforms, such  as Windows 95 and Windows NT, will be supported by extensions to the base  API set. To port an app to almost any modern OS, you simply transfer the  source code to a target-platform machine and recompile it. Yes, the VACPP  compiler and DAX libraries will be, or already are available for non-IBM  environments.
 <P> 
    Ian Ameline (Jay Benayon's predecessor on the memory subsystem) paired up  with Suzy Deffeyes and added OpenGL programming to his presentation suite  this year. By popular demand, Ian also repeated some of his "Writing High  Performance Apps Using..." presentations. HPFS internals were dissected by one  of the key coders of the HPFS subsystem, Doug Azzarito. Mike Kapley's talks  on the future of hyperdocumentation showed how documentation will look,  behave, and be created in the near future. Steve Mastrianni's talks took his  audience to the inner bits of device drivers and the outer limits of  exploiting Warp's robust architecture by writing real-time apps. Roger  Sessions, writer of SOM and DSOM, who recently retired from IBM to seek a  more entrepreneurial lifestyle, updated the conference on SOM, DSOM, and  allied disciplines.
 <P> 
    As this year's ColoradOS/2 drove toward its close, IBM Vice President Lois  Dempfel gave a talk on "The Network as a Server." Dempfel's presentation  grew from two predictions about "network-centric" computing: 
 <P><DL>
    <DD> 1. The Internet will affect what you do.
 <P> 
    <DD> 2. Decisions about networking will be independent from decisions about the  protocols. 
 </DL>  <P>
    Dempfel predicted that the headaches of dealing with protocol stacks will  soon go away, as protocols will be written into the operating system. She  revealed that connectivity software that runs under OS/2 is "the largest  revenue generator in IBM." The net-centric talks from Dempfel and others  spawned an appreciation of the possibilities of the network-as-server  paradigm. Maybe the desktop isn't the alpha and omega after all. Maybe the  desktop fad really is dead.
 <P> 
    The conference closed with a "Today and Tomorrow" presentation by senior  architect and OS/2 2.x lead designer Paul Giangarra and senior product  manager David Barnes, in which Giangarra revved up his laptop to show some  kernel-level and GUI improvements slated for Warp in the near future.
