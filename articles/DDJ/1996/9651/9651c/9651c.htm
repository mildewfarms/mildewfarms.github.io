<H1>The Last Word</H1>
January 1996 <I>Dr. Dobb's Developer Update</I>
<HR>

Two years ago, we began publishing Dr. Dobb's Developer Update and included it as part of your Dr. Dobb's Journal subscription. In examining emerging  trends and technologies influencing software-development, this monthly  newsletter carved out a unique niche, presenting informed opinions and  relevant news.
 <P> 
    The success of the Developer Update can be attributed to the insight and  efforts of Ray Valdes and Kevin Carlson. As the team responsible for  developing and producing the newsletter, they unfailingly got the news to  you under the tightest of deadlines. Unfortunately, all good things must  come to an end, and so it goes with Dr. Dobb's Developer Update. Due to  dramatic increases in the cost of postage and paper, this is the last issue  of the newsletter. All of us at Dr. Dobb's Journal have derived great  satisfaction in producing a one-of-a-kind publication that served the  special needs of software developers. Still, the greatest satisfaction has  been the many positive letters you've sent us in response to Dr. Dobb's  Developer Update. Thanks for your support.
