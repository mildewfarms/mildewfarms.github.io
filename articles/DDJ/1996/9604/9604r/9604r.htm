Azalea Software has begun shipping Carrick 1.0, a Windows-based encryption tool. Carrick works as both a stand-alone app or from within any Windows application that can access a DLL. Carrick is based on the Blowfish algorithm that was designed by cryptographer Bruce Schneier, author of <I>Applied Cryptography</I> and columnist for <I>Dr. Dobb's Journal</I>. Blowfish is several orders of magnitude stronger than DES, the current standard private-key encryption algorithm. <P>
The Carrick DLL can be called from within C/C++, Visual Basic, and other development tools. Carrick doubles as an SDK, which includes four API calls, a standardized file header, a default file extension (.CAR), and a complete cryptographic protocol that insures file security. Carrick allows optional sender authentication, date/time stamping, and other features. There are hooks for you to add functionality within the Carrick framework. <P>
Carrick is priced at $159.00 for single users and $199.00 for a two-copy bundle. The DLL is also available for licensing. Carrick currently supports Macintosh, DOS, UNIX, and VAX/VMS. <P>
A working demo, which encrypts and decrypts files using a limited set of passwords (001-999) can be downloaded from Azalea's home page. <P>

Willows Software has announced availability of its TWIN cross-platform development software and services. The APIW-based TWIN Technology for UNIX is available in both source and binary forms directly from Willows and on the Internet. The company also announced a four-tier Professional Services program (Basic Subscription Service, Standard Support, Premium Support, and Strategic Consulting) designed to assist as you use TWIN XPDK 1.5 for UNIX to build and deploy applications based on the technology. Professional Services programs are purchased on a yearly basis, and include a basic subscription to Willows Software updates on a quarterly CD-ROM. <P>
The Willows TWIN XPDK for UNIX allows you to build Windows applications that will run on most UNIX variants. TWIN XPDK is a source-porting kit that allows you to migrate applications to SCO UNIX and UnixWare, SunOS and Solaris, SGI UNIX, IBM AIX, HP HPUX, MIPS ABI, Dec Alpha OSF/1, Linux, and Macintosh. <P>
TWIN is the first product based on Application Programming Interface for Windows (APIW), a European standard adopted on December 15, 1995 by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). The APIW is waiting for approval by the International Standards Organization (ISO) to become an international standard for cross-platform development.<P>
The Willows XPDK for 1.5 UNIX is available from Willows Software and on the Internet. Willows' Professional Services are priced at U.S. $250.00 for a basic subscription, $1000.00 for standard, and $5000.00 for premium support. Pricing for strategic consulting services is negotiable. The software also is available in source and binary form on a single CD-ROM for $79.00. Individual, noncommercial users who wish only to download the source and binary versions of the technology may do so at no charge from the Willows Web site. The noncommercial license does not allow distribution for commercial purposes.  <P>

Netscape Communications has announced that a number of companies have created software components that extend the capabilities of the Netscape Navigator 2.0 platform using the Netscape Navigator Plug-In API. The Plug-Ins are available from the Netscape Plug-In Clearinghouse on the Netscape Web site.  <P>
The Netscape Navigator Plug-In API lets you extend the functionality of Netscape Navigator 2.0 with native support for new data types and additional features. Plug-Ins appear as additional capabilities of Netscape Navigator and can add multimedia capability such as streaming audio and video, VRML-based 3-D graphics, and animation to Web sites. Additionally, utility Plug-Ins enable OLE objects, VBXs, and OCXs to be embedded in Netscape Navigator. <P>
Among the new Plug-Ins are: Shockwave for Director from Macromedia; VDOLive from VDONet (compresses video images without compromising quality on the receiving end); RealAudio from Progressive Networks provides live and on-demand real-time audio straight from a Web site into Netscape Navigator; ToolVox for The Web from Voxware lets you stream high-compression (53:1) speech audio from Web pages without the need for an audio server; WebFX from Paper Software, a 3-D VRML platform that lets users fly through VRML worlds on the Web and run interactive, multiuser VRML applications written in Java; VR Scout VRML Plug-In from Chaco Communications, a VRML viewer that sends users through 3-D graphical scenes and uses multithreading to enable users to view scenes while they are downloading; WIRL from VREAM lets users experience interactive virtual reality within a Web page; Corel Vector Graphics CMX Viewer enables you to use scaleable, high-resolution vector graphics files; Lightning Strike from IION, an optimized wavelet image codec; OpenScape Toolkit from Object Power, a component-based rapid application development Plug-In built with OpenScape's Visual Basic-compatible scripting language; OLE Control Plug-In from NCompass lets you embed OLE controls as applets created using tools such as Visual C++, Visual Basic, and the Microsoft Windows Game SDK. <P>
The Netscape Navigator Plug-In SDK contains the tools and documentation to develop Plug-Ins for supported platforms, and is freely available on the Netscape Web site.<P>

RSA Data Security has announced it is working with leading firewall and TCP/IP stack vendors to bring the Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) proposed &quot;IPSec&quot; security standard to realization. The initiative, called S/WAN, designates specifications for implementing IPSec to ensure interoperability among firewall and TCP/IP products.<P>
S/WAN's goal is to use IPSec to allow companies to mix-and-match the firewall and TCP/IP stack products to build Internet-based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). S/WAN is based on the IETF's Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol, RFC 1825-1829 known as &quot;IPSec.&quot; S/WAN supports encryption at the IP level, which provides more lower-level security than higher-level protocols, such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (S/HTTP). <P>
To guarantee IPSec interoperability, S/WAN defines a common set of algorithms, modes, and options. In addition, S/WAN uses RSA's most-advanced block-encryption cipher, RC5 Symmetric Block Cipher. S/WAN uses RC5 at key sizes ranging from 40 bits for exportability to 128 bits that can withstand trillions of MIPS-years of computer attack. S/WAN can also be implemented using the government's DES algorithm. <P>
RSA Data Security also announced BSAFE 3.0 cryptography engine and Version 2.0 of its TIPEM toolkit. BSAFE 3.0 is built around RSA's Layered Open Crypto Toolkit (LOCT) architecture. This architecture comprises four layers including: application-specific tools, token interface, cryptography engine, and certificate engine. <P>
BSAFE includes modules for popular encryption techniques, such as RSA, DES, Diffie-Hellman, RC2, and RC4, and also supports improved routines for pseudorandom number generation, as well as digital signatures and certificates. <P>
BSAFE 3.0 now supports the RC5 algorithm for implementing secure, high-bandwidth applications (such as secure video) without resorting to expensive special-purpose crypto hardware. <P>
TIPEM 2.0 is a toolkit for interoperable privacy-enhanced messaging that facilitates development of secure e-mail and other messaging applications. TIPEM 2.0's API simplifies implementation of authentication via RSA Digital Signatures, encryption using RSA Digital Envelopes, and certificate-based key management. TIPEM 2.0 supports CCITT X.509 V1 and V3 Certificates, PKCS, PEM message formats, and also complies with the new S/MIME specification. TIPEM 2.0 features an expanded algorithm palette, allowing for support of SHA1, RC5, and Triple-DES. <P>
BSAFE 3.0 and TIPEM 2.0 sell for $290.00 each.<P>
