<h2>FEATURES </h2><P>

<h3><a href="9604a/9604a.htm">AN INTERVIEW WITH DONALD KNUTH </A></h3><P>

<i>by Jack Woehr</i><P>

Don Knuth, one of the world's preeminent computer scientists, takes time out to chat with us about topics ranging from algorithms to the status of volume four of his <I>The</I> <I>Art of Computer Programming</I>.<P>

<h3><a href="9604b/9604b.htm">HASHING REHASHED</A></h3><P>

<i>by Andrew Binstock</i><P>

Even tried and tested algorithms can be more efficient. Andrew presents one optimization, then examines the effect of high-performance hardware on hashing.<P>

<h3><a href="9604c/9604c.htm">A CUBIC SPLINE EXTREMA ALGORITHM</A></h3><P>

<i>by Mike J. Courtney</i><P>

Finding the maxima and minima of a function can be tricky, especially when all you have to work with are a few points. Mike shows how cubic splines can fill in the gaps.<P>

<h3><a href="9604d/9604d.htm">CALLING 16-BIT DLLs FROM WINDOWS 95</A></h3><P>

<i>by Steve Sipe</i><P>

Porting 16-bit Windows 3.x applications to 32-bit Windows 95 can be difficult, especially if the 16-bit apps depend on third-party DLLs. Steve presents a technique that lets you incorporate 16-bit DLLs into 32-bit applications. <P>

<h3><a href="9604e/9604e.htm">TUNING JAVA PERFORMANCE</A></h3><P>

<i>by Paul Tyma</i><P>

Given that Java is architecture neutral and interpreted, writing code that performs well isn't necessarily a slam dunk. Paul examines how compiled Java runs, then presents techniques for speeding things up. <P>

<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS </h2><P>

<h3><a href="9604f/9604f.htm">USING THE PARALLEL ADAPTER AS A HOST INTERFACE PORT</A></h3><P>

<i>by Dhananjay V. Gadre</i><P>

Dhananjay uses the PC's parallel-printer port as a link to the CCD camera controller for data acquisition in astronomy-related applications. While his technique is based on DSP, the design can accommodate any microprocessor or controller.<P>

<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS </h2><P>

<h3><a href="9604g/9604g.htm">THE HARVEST OBJECT CACHE</A></h3><P>

<i>by Peter B. Danzig</i><P>

The Harvest cache is a hierarchical object cache designed to make Internet information systems scale better. As an httpd accelerator, the cache works in conjunction with existing Web server software to increase throughput. <P>

<h2>EXAMINING ROOM </h2><P>

<h3><a href="9604h/9604h.htm">SPEEDING UP C-TREE PLUS DATABASE SEARCHES</A></h3><P>

<i>by John Mudd</i><P>

The algorithm John presents here enhances searches using FairCom's c-tree Plus cross-platform C function library for database I/O. <P>

<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH </h2><P>

<h3><a href="9604i/9604i.htm">HTML CONVERSION AND FTP AUTOMATION</A></h3><P>

<i>by Lauren Hightower</i><P>

Lauren's HTML Automator program--built using IST's OpenExchange file conversion DLL, Distinct's TCP/IP Winsock library and SDK, and Borland's Delphi development environment--automates the process of converting data to HTML format and posting pages to a Web server.<P>

<h2>COLUMNS </h2><P>

<h3><a href="9604j/9604j.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</A></h3><P>

<i>by Michael Swaine </i><P>

Reading Andrew Davison's <I>Humor the Computer</I> sends Michael down the road of Paradigms Past.<P>

<h3><a href="9604k/9604k.htm">C PROGRAMMING</A></h3><P>

<i>by Al Stevens </i><P>

After mulling over the two modes for <I>fopen</I> that Standard C supports, Al continues building Quincy 96, adding an expression parser to the debugger and the ability for external programs to send commands.<P>

<h3><a href="9604l/9604l.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY</A></h3><P>

<i>by Peter Heinrich</i><P>

When developing high-performance code, complex mathematical calculation is not always practical. The algorithm Peter presents here computes an integer square root suitable for just such situations. <P>

<h3><a href="9604m/9604m.htm">UNDOCUMENTED CORNER</A></h3><P>

<i>by Scot Wingo and George Shepherd</i><P>

Scot and George kick off an examination of undocumented MFC, this month focusing on its document/view architecture. In particular, they examine the MFC <I>CMirrorFile</I>, <I>CPreviewView</I>, and <I>CPreviewDC</I> classes. <P>

<h3><a href="9604n/9604n.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF</A></h3><P>

<i>by John H. McCoy</i><P>

<I>Hooked On Java</I>, by Java development-team members Arthur van Hoff, Sami Shaio, and Orca Starbuck, is a book/CD combination that can get you up and running with Java programming.<P>
