Efficient Networks has introduced ENcontrol, an API that sets up connections and handles data as it passes through the various layers of an ATM network. Part of an SDK, ENcontrol resides across the ATM architecture where the user-network interface layer, the call-management layer, and the application layer are located. ENcontrol facilitates transmission and reception of data, call setup, and call parameters, providing faster and better access to the network. This improves performance because it removes operating-systems overhead incurred by existing protocol stacks.  <P>

Centigram Communications has announced that its TruVoice 5.0 supports the Win32 Speech API. TruVoice, in fact, will be distributed in Microsoft's beta Speech SDKs to developers who want to create speech-enabled apps under both Windows 95 and Windows NT. <P>
TruVoice features advanced intelligence that includes context-sensitive rules for correctly reading data from spreadsheets, address book applications, e-mail messages, and faxes. The rules eliminate time-consuming editing before the text can be accurately read in these applications. The preprocessor also strips out unwanted header information in e-mail messages and appropriately expands multifunction punctuation, multi-expansion abbreviations, nonstandard abbreviations, and multiple date and time formats. Other enhancements include improvement of the voice quality in American English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish, as well as new voices (eight male, two female) across all available languages.  <P>

NewCode Technology has released a C++ interpreter called &quot;NCi&quot; that's designed to be embedded within an application. Part of NCi is a library of functions your app can use to call the interpreter. In addition, a stand-alone C++ parser is provided to process <I>include</I> files and create type information used by the interpreter at run time.  <P>
The NCi interpreter allows interpreted code to call compiled code with full type checking. It also allows new variables, functions, and types (including subclasses) to be created at run time. NCi is X3J16 compliant. However, it will not interpret namespaces, type ids, catch/throw, or dynamic arguments to member functions that exist in the compiler scope of the class in which they are declared. NCi supports HP and Sun workstations, and Windows NT and Windows 95.<P>
