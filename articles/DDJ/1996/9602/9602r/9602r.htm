Microsoft has announced two new SDKs for Internet-related development. The online Internet SDK is for content providers and Webmasters who create both Web content and Web sites, while the Internet Business Development Kit is targeted for resellers and system integrators. <P>
The Internet SDK will provide--in an online format-- information and tools traditionally delivered by disk-based SDKs. You will get access to authoring tools, such as &quot;Blackbird;&quot; server software, including &quot;Gibraltar;&quot; browser software such as the Internet Explorer; technologies such as Internet Server API (ISAPI) and OLE; and libraries with current Internet product betas.  <P>
The Internet Business Development Kit will include a beta version of the Microsoft Windows NT Internet server (code-named &quot;Gibraltar&quot;) the Internet Assistant for Word, Word Viewer, which allows people who don't use Word to view, print, and follow hyperlinks in Word documents posted on the Internet, the Internet Explorer 2.0, an Internet browser designed for Windows 95, and a beta version of &quot;Blackbird,&quot; which includes components for design, authoring, and distribution of multimedia applications.

Great Circle, from Geodesic Systems, is an automatic memory-management system for C/C++ programmers. The tool is designed to automatically eliminate bugs in C/C++ programs. Unlike manual memory management, which relies heavily on debugging, Great Circle automatically fixes memory bugs without programmer intervention. The tool supports all C/C++ constructs, including unions, multiple inheritance, polymorphism, interior pointers, arrays, composition, and exceptions. The tool, which supports most popular operating systems and C/C++ compilers, sells (in object-code format) for $300.00-$500.00 for PCs and for $700.00-$1200.00 for workstations. C++ source code is also available.<P>

Atemi has announced the release of its NetShade 2.0 network encryption software. NetShade 2.0 can be used in conjunction with Web browsers, e-mail systems, and other applications to secure information sent over the Internet. NetShade v2.0 is designed to work across different platforms: For example, a Windows user will be able to communicate securely with a Macintosh user.<P>
NetShade combines the RSA public-key cryptosystem with a collection of encryption ciphers, including DES and Triple DES.

Starfish Software, the new company headed by Philippe Kahn, has released its Dashboard SDK, an API with C/C++ and Delphi 32 source code. The Dashboard SDK will let you create Dashboard Loadable Modules (DLMs) that can be executed from Dashboard 95, a Windows 95 application that gives users better organization of their work area, instant access to frequently used applications, and a common interface across Windows 3.x, Windows NT, and Windows 95. One benefit of DLMs is that they provide single-click access to a custom or vertical-market application. <P>

IST's OpenExchange DLL 1.0, a programming library for importing and exporting data, lets you read and write spreadsheet files in all major formats without the overhead of OLE or DDE. You can use the DLL, for instance, to read data into memory variables, then use that data to update your database with your own existing drivers. Likewise, you can output data to a new file from memory, or transfer data directly from one file into another. The DLL is compatible with Visual Basic, C++, Delphi, PowerBuilder, Visual FoxPro, Clarion, and other development environments, and supports all major spreadsheet files (Excel, Lotus, Quattro Pro, dBase, and others). The DLL sells for $295.00.<P>

Gryphon Microproducts has released W3MAGIC for World Wide Web development. W3MAGIC is a programming language that adds over 100 new high-level tags and functions to HTML, from animation and dynamic buttons to counters and user logs. It allows you to protect your data and code by encrypting it. Encrypted code can be executed just like normal HTML, but appears unintelligible when copied. The language works with all browsers.<P>
In addition to providing special effects such as animation, wipes, fades, and pushes, W3MAGIC lets you gather statistical information about visitors to your page, including counters and user identification by country, originating link, browser type, and pages accessed. It can display random text, random GIFs, and dynamically generated graphs, and can perform table lookups. <P>
W3MAGIC, which sells for $399.00, is available for Solaris, Sun, PC Linux, BSDI UNIX, AIX, BSDI, FreeBSD, and Novell UNIX. An account with cgi-bin access is required to use this tool.<P>

SuccessWare has announced an SDK for its SuccessWare Database Engine 2.0 (SDE2) (formerly known as ROCK-E-T), a replaceable database engine for Visual Basic 4.0, Visual C++, and any DLL/OCX development environment. The SuccessWare Database Engine technology allows for a common xbase-style (record-based) data navigation and syntax during program development with minimal concern for the ultimate format of the database. This leads to movement between database environments with little or no code modification. Also supported is database-compatible concurrent-access locking on networks. <P>
SDE2 supports table, index, and memo files for CA-Clipper (NTX), FoxPro 2.x (IDX/CDX), and HiPer-SIx (NSX) systems. It also supports freeform-text searching; fixed-length fields that automatically expand to meet the input requirements; image/BLOBs storage and retrieval without any intermediate files; conditional indexes; instant index filters for absolute control over the database views; and record-level data encryption. <P>
The SuccessWare Database Engine 2.0 SDK is priced at $299.00 per developer license for multiuser-application creation. It is royalty-free.<P>

NobleNet has announced its OneDriver ODBC SDK, which allows you to customize external functions on either the client side or server side (or both) of a client/server database application. This permits deployment of applications in two-sided (thin or fat client) and two-model (two or three tier) architectures, including Oracle, Sybase SQL Server, Informix, and others.<P>
The SDK conforms to Microsoft ODBC 2.0 and is backward compatible with 1.0. The OneDriver ODBC SDK provides a universal, client-based ODBC-2.0 driver that automatically receives and interprets database calls and responses and an SQL-based source-code module that lets you customize access to external functions. Depending on the application functionality desired, processing is directly or indirectly remote to a server-based ODBC driver library. The library is used to access the selected database or databases via C source code that mirrors the SQL code on the client. The OneDriver ODBC client-side driver is WinSock compliant, runs on both TCP and IPX, and has been certified on over 20 WinSock-compliant products.   <P>
