Template Graphics Software (TGS) has announced a 3-D graphics ActiveX control for Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0. The 3Space Explorer control enables interactive 3-D content (including file support for VRML, Open Inventor, and DXF) to be incorporated into Web homepages. The control is programmable via VBScript and JavaScript. 3Space Explorer exposes over 150 programmable properties and methods for manipulating and viewing 3-D content. Three-Dimensional geometry can be easily modified using high-level tools for setting light sources, background colors, material properties, camera positions, and so on. With VBScript and JavaScript, interaction with a 3-D scene can be tied to other elements on the page, and can enable other elements on the page to drive the 3-D scene. This is useful in building 3-D user interfaces and front ends to such applications as online training, architectural walk-throughs, and the like. The tool sells for $150.00.<P>

Expersoft has introduced PowerBroker CORBAplus for C++, an implementation of the OMG's Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) 2.0 specification. CORBAplus is a development system which provides a bridge between CORBA and Microsoft OLE, and an event-driven distributed-object model. This release includes a CORBA Naming Service, multithreaded support, and a suite of developer-oriented tools. CORBAplus supports asynchronous object requests, providing event-driven throughput while preserving the benefits of the object-oriented programming model. This lets programs continue processing while remote objects service their requests.<P>

CORBAplus includes tools such as the CORBAplus IFR Explorer, a visual tool that lets you browse, select, and edit components of the Interface Repository. CORBAplus also offers a variety of configuration utilities for the NT run-time environment. CORBAplus for C++ runs on Windows NT/95 and several UNIX platforms.<P>

Lucent Technologies, formerly Bell Labs, has announced Inferno, an operating system that supports highly interactive applications for almost any computer or entertainment system, over any communications network, from telephony and cable television to satellite broadcast and the Internet. With Inferno, you only need to create one program to run on a variety of devices (computers, TVs, telephones, and the like). Inferno software requires minimal hardware and uses less than 1 MB of memory.<P>

The Inferno offer includes the network operating system; the communications protocols (Styx), network API, programming language (Limbo), and virtual machine Dis). Inferno runs as a stand-alone operating system on Intel x86, MIPS and ARM processors, or can be hosted as a virtual system on UNIX, Windows 95/NT.<P>

Inferno was developed by Rob Pike, Phil Winterbottom, and Sean Dorward of the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center, where UNIX and C/C++ were invented. A detailed description of Inferno is available on the Bell Labs Web site.<P>

The Object Management Group (OMG) has announced a book entitled CORBA Fundamentals and Programming, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons. CORBA Fundamentals and Programming provides an introduction to distributed-object computing, a description of CORBA and the Object Management Architecture (OMA), and a multi-object tutorial example. Jon Siegel, director of domain technology for the OMG, and coauthors Dan Frantz, Hal Mirsky, Raghu Hudli, Alex Thomas, Wilf Coles, Peter De Jong, Alan Klein, Brent Wilkins, Sean Baker, and Maurice Balick wrote the book, which includes eight code examples from seven vendors. They all implement identical functionality using the same IDL interfaces. All of the code has been used at IBM, Hewlett-Packard, SunSoft, ICL, Digital Equipment, Expersoft, and IONA Technologies. The book includes a disk containing all IDL interfaces, source code in C, C++, and Smalltalk, and makefiles for eight ORB environments.<P>
