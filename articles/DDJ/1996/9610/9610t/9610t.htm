Island Way has announced TeamWay, a project collaboration package for workgroups. A client-server application, TeamWay makes it easy for team members to track personal responsibilities across projects, as well as manage non-project obligations. When projects are defined, the scheduling of all component tasks is based on each team member's existing constraints. This eliminates ambiguities and ensures that each individual has time available for each assigned task. As changes occur anywhere in the project, everyone involved is updated immediately and remains in sync. TeamWay also provides flexibility in selecting planning algorithms, display filters, and graphical reports. The server is available for Windows NT, Windows for Workgroups, and several UNIX platforms. Clients are available for Windows 3.1/NT/95, and several UNIX platforms.<P>

The IBM Salutation Manager has been enhanced to support Version 2 of the Salutation Architecture, a network interface specification that sharply increases the interoperability of intelligent peripherals, office machines, applications, and services. The Salutation Manager helps developers build devices, services, and applications that interoperate in ways not otherwise possible. A networked user, for example, can broadcast a query in order to locate a particular network resource such as a color copier or a printer with a legal-size paper tray. The Salutation Architecture is independent of network transport, hardware platform, and operating-system software. <P>

Pure Software has announced Purify for Windows NT. Purify automatically pinpoints run-time errors and memory leaks throughout C and C++ applications, including ActiveX controls, OLE components, and third-party DLLs and libraries that are the building blocks of 32-bit Windows applications. Purify is based on a patented technology called Object Code Insertion (OCI). Because OCI does not require access to source code, Purify can locate errors throughout the ever-widening range of third-party components with which many Windows applications are built. With Purify, you can collect run-time data and pinpoint the exact origin of a bug. The program also identifies where memory is not accessible through any pointer in the program.<P>

Sense8 is now shipping Release 6 of its WorldToolKit of visual simulation and virtual reality software. WorldToolKit R6 offers a broadened range of nodes that can be hierarchically arranged in the scene graph. Each node represents a part of the simulation, and while scene graphs are constructed node-by-node, they are done so in WorldToolKit through the use of high-level API calls. Loading a VRML file from the Internet into a scene graph, for instance, only requires a single function call. These function calls allow users to prototype, develop, and reconfigure applications as needed. A special version of WorldToolKit Release 6 provides support for rendering to multiple graphics pipes or screens.<P>
