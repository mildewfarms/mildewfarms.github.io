<h1>Copy this Page!</h1><P>

Applying intellectual-property rights to software and other electronic
assets is hardly a simple matter. However, the rapid growth of the
&quot;information economy&quot; and the ease of copying material over
the Internet makes it increasingly important that we untangle this
knotty issue.<P>

The problems are varied and subtle. Most obvious are the technical
questions of tracking and licensing material electronically. The more
difficult questions are ethical and legal. These issues are not easily
separable. Determining when copying is permissible requires an
understanding of the underlying technology. Conversely, fashioning
suitable technology requires an appreciation of the legal and ethical
concerns.<P>

The debate over the proper protection for software is an old one, and
the various points have been pretty clearly stated. One argument in
favor of software patents, for example, holds that patents are necessary
to protect the R&amp;D investments of software developers. Without this
protection, the theory goes, competitors will be able to copy your work
and sell competing products without comparable investments. On the other
hand, opponents of software patents argue that software development is
incremental, and that excellence is achieved when people can freely
borrow and copy good ideas.<P>

One problem with this debate is that people invariably start by assuming
only certain existing types of intellectual-property protection. It
might make more sense to think carefully about software and the features
of software that require protection, and fashion a suitable mechanism
from scratch.<P>

This is precisely the approach taken by Randall Davis, Pamela Samuelson,
Mitchell Kapor, and Jerome Reichman in &quot;A New View of Intellectual
Property and Software&quot; (Communications of the ACM, March 1996).
They note: &quot;The problem is fundamental: Intellectual property law
gives us three traditional mechanisms, yet the value in software is not
well protected by any of them.&quot; Their conclusions are equally
thought provoking: They recommend a new kind of intellectual-property
protection--one geared specifically to the demands of software. <P>

The broader questions of intellectual-property laws in cyberspace are
just now being considered by lawmakers. The U.S. Government has
published a white paper (http://www.ladas.com) on the National
Information Infrastructure, which, among other things, discusses the
role of copyright in a networked society. Congress is currently
considering legislation based on the NII white paper.<P>

Unfortunately, the originally proposed legislation has some subtle
flaws. For example, David M. Ostfeld, in his testimony before Congress
(http://www.ieee.org), criticizes the proposed legislation's use of the
word &quot;transmission&quot; to specify what types of copies are
protected. Web browsers routinely cache documents to allow more rapid
navigation; since this cache contains a &quot;transmitted copy,&quot; it
might be considered a copyright violation under the bill's original
wording, even if simply viewing the document is not.<P>

My major concern with the NII white paper is somewhat more fundamental.
In attempting to clarify the responsibilities of electronic services,
the NII white paper treats all service providers essentially the same.
Personally, I see a major difference between a public FTP archive and a
network passthrough, even if they're being <P>

handled by the same company on the same hardware. When ISPs are behaving
as common carriers, they deserve common-carrier protection, just as
AT&amp;T's telephone operations wouldn't suddenly lose their
common-carrier privileges if AT&amp;T were to operate a bookstore (which
lacks such privileges). Specific protections and liabilities should be
associated with specific business activities. The current approach
simply tries to blanket all service providers with a single,
one-size-fits-none policy.<P>
