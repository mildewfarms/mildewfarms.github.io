Litigation over software usually comes in two flavors: disputes over
intellectual-property rights (patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and
trademarks) and disputes over contracts. Typically, both types of
disputes are involved in a single lawsuit.<P>

<h3>Pre-Litigation Considerations</h3><P>

Before going into a lawsuit, whether as a plaintiff or defendant, you
need to study the facts and applicable law. Only then can you determine
whether or not litigation is worthwhile. Except in exigent
circumstances, efforts to resolve a dispute before proceeding with
litigation should be made. A letter fairly outlining the problems should
be sent to the other side. Diplomacy is critical. The letter should be
prepared by an attorney. (Whether it should be sent under the signature
of the attorney will depend on the circumstances.) Don't make the
mistake of trying to save money at this critical stage by preparing the
letter yourself. More often than not, such a letter is ineffective or,
worse, unknowingly makes damaging statements which end up being quoted
to the jury. <P>

Always formulate clear objectives before taking the final plunge.
Litigation is like a long ocean voyage. There are good days and bad.
Knowing where you are going and keeping your eye on that destination
will give you comfort and make the voyage meaningful. Never act out of
anger. If you do, you are likely to regret it.<P>

<h3>The Complaint</h3><P>

You begin a lawsuit by filing a "Complaint" with a court and paying a
filing fee, typically a few hundred dollars. That is all it takes! The
clerk of the court will issue an order to the defendant (Summons) to
file his response to the Complaint with the court within a stated number
of days. Copies of the Summons and Complaint are then delivered to
(served on) the defendant.  <P>

Plaintiffs have the initial choice of courts. Typically, plaintiffs
choose a court that is convenient or favorable to the plaintiff, or
inconvenient or unfavorable to the defendant. If the plaintiff is
seeking to enforce a patent or copyright, the Complaint must be filed in
a federal court. Otherwise, the Complaint must be filed in a state
court, unless the plaintiff and defendant are citizens of different
states, in which case the plaintiff can usually sue in either a federal
or state court.<P>

<h3>Responding to the Complaint</h3><P>

The defendant must respond to the Complaint by filing papers with the
court within the deadline stated in the Summons. If he does not, his
"default" will be entered, and the case will proceed without his
position being heard.<P>

One way to respond is to file an "Answer." This is a document that
either admits or denies each allegation in the Complaint and alleges
defenses. At this time, the defendant is usually entitled to assert any
claims he has against the plaintiff in what is called a "counterclaim"
or a "cross-complaint."<P>

Instead of filing an "Answer," the defendant can sometimes move to
dismiss the case. One reason might be that he has not had sufficient
contact with the location in which the court sits. Defects in the
allegations in the Complaint can also often be raised at this time.<P>

Proving either of these claims does not necessarily ensure dismissal of
the lawsuit. In some cases, the court will transfer the lawsuit to a
more convenient location or give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend
his Complaint to correct the deficiencies.<P>

<h3>Temporary Injunctions</h3><P>

In software lawsuits, a battle over a "temporary injunction" is often
waged in the beginning of the case. Frequently, it ends the case.<P>

A "temporary injunction" is an order from the court restraining the
defendant from committing some act. In software cases, it typically bars
the defendant from selling his software or using information he obtained
from the plaintiff. It is usually sought immediately when the lawsuit is
filed, or shortly thereafter.<P>

Temporary injunctions also come in two flavors. One is the "preliminary
injunction," which usually can be obtained within a few weeks after the
lawsuit is filed and lasts until the case is over (that is, until the
court can decide whether it will enter a "permanent injunction"
following trial). The other is a "temporary restraining order," which
can sometimes be obtained within a matter of hours after the lawsuit is
filed and usually lasts for about ten days (until the court can
determine whether it will issue a "preliminary injunction").<P>

Temporary injunctions give the plaintiff a tremendous advantage. Within
a very short time after the lawsuit is filed, a plaintiff can shut down
a competitor without ever presenting his case to a jury.<P>

To protect the defendant, the plaintiff is usually required to make a
strong showing that he is likely to prevail at trial. Usually, he must
also demonstrate that he would suffer "irreparable harm" if he is forced
to wait until trial to obtain a permanent injunction. Usually, the court
will only issue a temporary injunction if the defendant has not yet
begun the objectionable activity or, if he has, only did so very
recently. The court also usually considers whether the harm to the
defendant from the injunction would outweigh the benefit to the
plaintiff.<P>

To obtain a temporary injunction, the plaintiff must post a "bond." This
is a commitment--typically by a bonding company--to pay the damages which
the defendant might suffer if the Court ultimately determines that the
injunction should not have been issued. A bond can usually be purchased
for a few percent of its face value. Except for extremely wealthy
companies, however, bonding companies usually require the plaintiff to
fully collateralize the bond. A plaintiff who does not have sufficient
assets to collateralize the anticipated bond (or a sufficiently strong
stomach to bear the risk of losing his collateral) should not apply for
a temporary injunction. He would just be wasting his time and money.<P>

Settlement often follows the decision on whether to issue a preliminary
injunction. If it is issued, the prospect of having the injunction
lifted--typically one or two years later at trial--is often of little
value to the defendant. If the preliminary injunction is denied, on the
other hand, the denial often signals that the plaintiff is likely to
lose at trial, making continued litigation unattractive. Winning the
fight over a preliminary injunction, therefore, is often of decisive
importance.<P>

<h3>Discovery</h3><P>

"Discovery" is the name given to the formal legal process of obtaining
information needed for trial.<P>

There are several types of discovery. One is the "deposition," a process
during which a witness answers questions under oath in front of the
lawyers and a court reporter, but not in front of the judge or jury or
in a courtroom. This is the type of discovery that received publicity in
the O.J. Simpson civil case. A transcript (and sometimes even a
videotape) is made of the testimony and can be presented at trial. A
deposition can be taken of any witness, whether or not he is a party to
the case.<P>

Written requests to examine documents and tangible things (computers and
software, for instance) can also be made. In response, the documents and
tangible things usually must be produced for inspection and copying.
This type of discovery can usually be obtained from any individual or
company, whether or not the individual or company is a party to the
suit.<P>

A third type of discovery is called "interrogatories." These are written
questions which must be answered in writing and sworn to as being
accurate. Unlike depositions and document productions, only a party to
the lawsuit may be compelled to answer interrogatories.<P>

Discovery begins after the Complaint is filed and typically proceeds up
until the time of trial. The intensity of the efforts which are made
vary widely. Responding to discovery can be quite time consuming and
disruptive to business.<P>

<h3>Experts</h3><P>

Software litigation often involves a dispute over technical issues.
Infringement cases often examine whether the software utilizes a
particular technology. Contract cases often focus on whether the
software is functioning correctly. A software expert is typically needed
to provide testimony on these issues.<P>

Experts in other fields are also often required. An accountant, for
example, may be needed to give testimony about the amount of damages
that have been incurred. In patent cases, a legal expert may be needed
to give testimony about the patent procurement process. <P>

Selection of the right experts is very important in software cases. The
technical issues are usually well beyond the ability of the judge or
jury to understand. Their only recourse is to decide whether to trust
your expert or your opponent's. PhDs and university affiliations are
among the most coveted credentials. Extensive practical experience in
the technology is also impressive. Although a litigant is sometimes
tempted to use one of his own employees as an expert, this is usually
ill advised, even if the employee is well qualified. The close
relationship is likely to adversely impact the credibility of whatever
is said.<P>

It is often advantageous to hire the experts in the beginning of the
case. They can help guide the discovery process, assist in the
assessment of the case, and provide testimony if a temporary injunction
is sought.<P>

<h3>Summary Judgment</h3><P>

If there is no credible basis to a particular claim or defense, that
claim or defense can sometimes be removed from the case by asking the
court to enter "summary judgment" against it.<P>

Summary judgment can be sought at almost any stage of the proceeding. If
the defect is a substantial and pervasive one, obtaining summary
judgment against the defect can often radically alter the strength of
one side's position. If the defect is of sufficient significance,
summary judgment can end the entire case. Obtaining summary judgment
against a claim or defense, therefore, can often be of great
importance.<P>

The absence of credibility is not the criterion for obtaining summary
judgment. Rather, the party seeking summary judgment must demonstrate
that there is "no genuine issue as to any material fact."<P>

Clients often have a great deal of difficulty understanding when a
particular defect is appropriate for summary judgment. Although I have
just accurately quoted the rule, its application is sometimes difficult
to appreciate. The key is to distinguish between a dispute over a
"legal" issue and a dispute over a "factual" issue.  <P>

Consider, for example, a lawsuit for copyright infringement. The
plaintiff alleges that the defendant reverse-<P>
engineered his object code, extracted the underlying algorithm, and
incorporated this algorithm in a competing product.<P>

Having written the code himself, the defendant knows that he did not
reverse-engineer the plaintiff's code and, in fact, has never even seen
the plaintiff's software. The defendant has also been reading my columns
and knows that it might not even be a copyright infringement to do
exactly what the plaintiff is contending, namely, to reverse-engineer
someone else's software and to use the underlying algorithms.<P>

The defendant therefore files a motion for summary judgment. He submits
his own affidavit in which he states that he never saw the plaintiff's
software, let alone decompiled it. He also submits the affidavits of
five of the most renown experts in the field who state that the
algorithms in the plaintiff's and the defendant's software are not
similar in any way.  <P>

In opposition to this motion, the plaintiff submits only his affidavit.
He states that he saw the defendant running his software and that two of
the algorithms in the defendant's software are absolutely identical.<P>

The defendant then introduces a criminal record showing that the
plaintiff has five felony convictions for perjury and has served 20
years in San Quentin for these crimes. The record shows that, in the
past, the plaintiff sued five software companies and, in each case,
perjured himself by falsely claiming that he witnessed copying.<P>

So how should the judge rule on the question of summary judgment? Let's
break the problem down.<P>

First, it is obvious that the plaintiff's claim of copying is very
unlikely to be believed. Notwithstanding, the affidavit that the
plaintiff has submitted (although obviously lacking credibility) has
nevertheless demonstrated that two material factual issues are in
dispute--whether the defendant saw the plaintiff's software and whether
the defendant's software contains the same algorithms. Summary judgment
on this basis cannot be granted.<P>

On the other hand, the summary judgment motion raises a legal
issue--whether one company is entitled to reverse-<P>
engineer object code, extract its underlying algorithms, and use those
extracted algorithms. Although this issue is also in dispute, it is not
a factual issue. It is a legal issue. Legal issues can and will be
resolved on summary judgment. If the judge believes that copyright law
does not bar this type of copying (which is a distinct possibility),
summary judgment will be granted. It doesn't matter whether the
defendant copied, because the court can conclude that this type of
copying would be legal in any event.<P>

<h3>Trial</h3><P>

Television has already done my job in this area. What you may not know
is that the court has the authority to break the case into pieces and to
try certain pieces first. This is known as "bifurcation."<P>

Bifurcation can be very useful. For example, suppose the court concluded
in the aforementioned hypothetical case that the type of copying alleged
by the plaintiff would, if proven, constitute copyright infringement.
Although the court would therefore have to deny summary judgment, it
could nevertheless bifurcate the issue of copying and try it first. This
would, at least, give the defendant the opportunity to dispose of the
case without having to spend time and money developing and trying all of
the other issues which are normally involved in a copyright case.<P>

Generally, it takes between six months and four years for a case to come
to trial. The average is about one and one-half years.<P>

<h3>Appeal</h3><P>

Every civil litigant usually has an absolute right to one appeal.
However, there is usually no right to have the appellate court's
decision reviewed, but a second review can sometimes be obtained.<P>

During the course of a lawsuit, the judge usually makes many decisions.
Usually, however, no decision can be appealed until the trial has
concluded.<P>

If the defendant loses, a judgment for money is normally entered against
the defendant. In intellectual-property cases, as well as certain types
of contract cases, a permanent injunction is also usually entered
against the defendant.<P>

The filing of an appeal normally does not excuse the defendant from
complying with the permanent injunction pending appeal, nor the
plaintiff from executing upon the judgment for money. Usually, however,
the defendant can prevent execution of the monetary portion of the
judgment during appeal by posting a bond. The trial judge also usually
has the discretion to stay enforcement of the permanent injunction
pending appeal, although this discretion is not normally exercised.<P>

<h3>$$$$$</h3><P>

Now I come to the part that nobody wants to talk about.<P>

Let me put it in the simplest terms: Software lawsuits usually cost lots
of money. In an effort to ensure fairness, our judicial system has
created too many procedures. Although some judges are beginning to
realize that the system has gone "too far," many are unwilling or unable
to take active control of their cases, allowing one side to be at the
mercy of the other.<P>

It costs between $100,000 and $1 million to take most software cases
through trial. Some cases will even cost more, much more. Although you
can control the efforts your attorney makes, you usually cannot control
the efforts that the opposing side makes. For this reason, it is very
difficult to estimate the costs of a case.<P>

Copyright cases tend to be the least expensive; patent cases, the most
expensive. Trade secret and contract cases usually fall somewhere in
between.<P>

The amount at stake usually is more important than the type of case. If
$100 million is at stake, several million dollars in litigation expenses
should be expected. Small amounts at stake, on the other hand, do not
necessarily mean a small bill. The required procedures are numerous and
must be followed, no matter how little is in controversy. Some
litigants, moreover, use lawsuits as a means to financially drain their
competitors, resulting in efforts disproportionate to what is
involved.<P>

<h3>Conclusion</h3><P>

Lawsuits are one of the few ways to lawfully protect individual rights
in an organized society.<P>

During the past quarter of this century, this laudatory purpose has been
badly tarnished by escalating costs. Today, lawsuits are so expensive
that only the rich can afford them.<P>

Tell your Congressman or your state legislator that you want the costs
reduced. Most lawyers should not mind simpler procedures, because they
will simply be performing more of them. This is the way it should be.<P>

In the meantime, proceed cautiously before filing or fighting a lawsuit.
Seriously consider settlement at every stage. If you must litigate,
discuss the various available procedures with your lawyer, and use them
wisely.<P>
