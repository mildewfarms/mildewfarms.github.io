Once upon a time, Bill the software entrepreneur decided that he'd
migrate MS-DOS towards UNIX. This happened many years ago, and most
folks have forgotten. But, in addition to being <I>Forbes</I> magazine's
richest man in the world, Bill has a <I>very</I> long attention span.<P>

AT&amp;T gripped UNIX with a fierce intensity. Bill had to hire away
DEC's operating-system guru so Bill's company could develop a GUI-based
UNIX-wannabe. We know this operating system as "Windows NT." (Wouldn't
you know it, after NT was developed, AT&amp;T sold UNIX to Novell cheap.
Novell then dumped it to SCO even cheaper.)<P>

Anyhow, NT is here and it works, but it isn't selling as well as Bill
would like. How is the blame to be placed? Last year, it was decided
that the problem was the high price of memory. At a street price of
$35/MB, 32 MB would set users back $1120. And if the 32 MB were
purchased as part of a Compaq system, for instance, the cost would be
much higher. (Gotta pay them dealer markups.)<P>

About the time Bill's marketeers proclaimed, "NT isn't selling because
DRAM costs too much," his company released Windows 95, which needed 16
MB, or so said Bill and all the Ziff publications. Non-Ziff publications
discovered that, while Windows 95 ran with 16 MB, it ran much faster
with 32 MB. <P>

Windows 95 has caught on with home users, but is being boycotted by
corporate MIS types, who are sticking with Windows 3.x. Why? One reason
is memory cost--Windows 95 needs more DRAM than Windows 3.x.<P>

<h3>DRAM Prices Held Fast...</h3><P>

The thing is, beginning in 1991, DRAM prices remained constant for over
four years. DRAMs and CPUs are made in the same clean rooms, use the
same silicon wafers, and the same semiconductor production
equipment--steppers, diffusion ovens, and such. While DRAM prices held,
CPU makers (such as Intel) provided more and more complex CPUs without
raising prices. Translation: Toward the end of that four-year period,
the DRAM makers had a license to print money. They were fabulously
profitable.<P>

Fabulous profits attract competition, but it takes two years to build a
modern semiconductor fab. The fabs that came online in 1995 cost $2
billion each; those started in 1995 are budgeted at $2.3 billion. The
fabs in the Far East are about 10 percent cheaper for some reason (maybe
no campus and fancy landscaping).<P>

That's <I>one</I> reason why DRAM production has only recently caught up
with demand--with a vengeance! For a DRAM manufacturer,<a href="199703a1.htm"> Figure 1</A> is scary. This isn't a free fall, it's
a power dive. In the old days, the tail would come off the P-38 in a
dive this steep.<P>

<a href="199703a2.htm">Figure 2</A> places recent DRAM price trends in
historic perspective. Our very own Feds ("I'm from the government, I'm
here to help you.") interrupted a nice, steady 17-year price decline by
forcing Japan to sell us DRAMs at higher prices in the late '80s. (The
Japanese reluctantly acceded.)<P>

History repeats. Micron, the Utah-based DRAM maker, recently petitioned
the government to keep Korea from selling 16-MB DRAMs in this country
too cheaply. I am not making this up.<P>

<h3>...Until Now</h3><P>

Suddenly, DRAM supply far exceeds demand. The classic solution to this
problem is to cut back production. But the interest payments on $2
billion fabs continue even when the fabs aren't being used. The life of
a fab is short, because advancing technology obsoletes it in a very few
years. And if you don't build DRAMs, you quickly lose your trained
workforce. This is strong motivation to continue producing DRAMs.<P>

Suppose I have a computer system that has too little memory for NT.
Today (June 30), I can drive down to Fry's and buy two 16-MB 60-nsec
72-pin SIMMs for $210 plus tax. That's $210 for <I>both</I> SIMMs; 32 MB
of DRAM for the price of a mid-level IDE hard drive. I might have to
toss out the old memory (maybe the old memory can be combined with the
new SIMMs, maybe it can't). But, now that the memory needed to run
Windows NT is downright cheap, everybody is going to switch to
NT--right?<P>

<h3><I>DTACK Grounded</I> and UNIX</h3><P>

In a previous column (<I>Dr. Dobb's Sourcebook</I>, March/April 1996), I
mentioned my former newsletter <I>DTACK Grounded</I>. Coverage was not
limited to 68000 stuff; I wrote about whatever interested me. In 1982,
UNIX prognosticator Jean Yates predicted that, in 1983, Microsoft would
sell $2 billion in Xenix licenses. (Xenix was Bill's first try at
cloning UNIX, in this case to run on 4.77-MHz 8088 systems!) I thought
Yates' forecast was utterly ridiculous, and I said so. I added that UNIX
was most certainly never going to take over the personal computer
operating-system market.<P>

Talk about kicking over a hornet's nest! This became a continuing thread
in my newsletter, and I got more and more letters and phone calls from
self-appointed "experts" telling me that I was flat wrong. Few noticed
that Xenix's annual license revenues fell about $2 billion short in
1983. In the early 1980s, I seemed to be the only person in the PC world
who was asserting in print that UNIX wasn't going to take over. (Later,
I learned of a computer-science professor who was publishing the same
opinion, but we never crossed paths. No, I don't know his name.)<P>

About the time it was beginning to dawn on some of my readers that I
might be right, AT&amp;T announced the 68000-based UNIX PC. (Remember
the <I>BYTE</I> cover story?) In the months leading up to the
introduction, I read article after article in the computer and business
press about AT&amp;T pressuring Convergent Technologies, which was
contracted to build the UNIX PC, to prepare for production of enormous
numbers of systems. The production capability was eventually set at
125,000 UNIX PCs per year (according to published reports).<P>

"Hmm," I thought, "If I were running Convergent, I wouldn't set up such
a production line unless AT&amp;T had guaranteed to buy at least 50,000
units." And I didn't think that anywhere near that number of UNIX PCs
could be sold, even with AT&amp;T being its own best customer--something
I speculated on in my June 1985 newsletter, just before the UNIX PC was
introduced.<P>

<h3>FNE Emerges Triumphant</h3><P>

A year later, <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> ran a feature article on
how sales of the UNIX PC had progressed. My prediction turned out to be
dead on the mark (surely you aren't surprised?), and I wrote this up in
my newsletter, which had by then devolved to the free Junk Mail Flyer.
An unknown <I>Dr. Dobb's Journal</I> editor picked up and expanded this
in <I>Dr. Dobb's Journal</I> (August 1986, page 8) under the heading
"FNE Well Grounded."<P>

<i>In a few months, AT&amp;T will surely notice that the Unix PC (built by Convergent Technologies) is not
selling. Let us assume that AT&amp;T succeeds in stopping production
after only 50,000 Unix PCs have been built. Of that 50,000 about 10,000
will have been sold. AT&amp;T will purchase 8,500 itself, the recently
divested [Bell] operating companies, many of which have not yet wised
up, will buy 1,483 units, and the rest of the world will buy 17.--Hal
Hardenbergh (a.k.a FNE), </I>dTACK Grounded<I>, June 1985.</i><P>

   Last year, Convergent shipped some 40,000 to 50,000 of the Unix PC
units. But AT&amp;T has sold only 10,000...and many of those were sold
to AT&amp;T's own divisions. AT&amp;T has said that the Unix PC...is
"ahead of its time."--Brenton R. Schlender, <I>The Wall Street
Journal</I>, May 30, 1986.<P>

Since the UNIX PC debacle, almost nobody thinks UNIX is going to take
over the personal-computer world. AT&amp;T had to unload all those
unsold systems into the liquidator market. 40,000 of them. I gleefully
subscribed to the late <I>UNIX World</I> for years afterward so I could
see the small-print ads offering UNIX PCs at lower and lower prices in a
desperate search for customers. I think the last price I saw was $495
for a complete system <I>with</I> the UNIX operating system, which was
normally sold separately. I wonder how much the liquidators paid
AT&amp;T for those turkeys?<P>

I was recently asked what I got for my correct UNIX prediction. I
replied, "Not a (darn) thing. I lost a lot of readers who otherwise
would have stuck with my newsletter and maybe even bought one of the
68000 boards we were selling."<P>

<h3>The Future of Windows NT</h3><P>

I hope this gives me some credibility in predicting sales or market
penetration of complex operating systems in the personal-computer world.
Windows NT is a slightly cleaner, more modern UNIX with a graphics
interface. But NT has the same baggage as UNIX: It's so complex that a
Systems Administrator is needed, something individual computer users
rarely have. NT isn't going to make it in truly personal computing. Not
even with cheap DRAM. <P>

NT will find its success in the same corporate MIS arena as UNIX, VMS,
CMS II, and other, similarly complex networking OSs. Right now, NT, with
the Intel Pentium Pro, is generally regarded as serious competition for
UNIX. There is some evidence of large applications being converted from
UNIX to NT. <I>This is not a mass marketplace</I>.<P>

<h3>Seeking Public Censure</h3><P>

I miss getting mail telling me how wrong I am. (Well, my e-mail address
<I>is</I> listed here nowadays.) So I'm going to tell you another reason
why DRAM supply suddenly exceeds demand. Simple. PC system sales are
down. Way down.<P>

Why? Take a look at the PCs all them smart folks are trying to push at
us: multimedia, loudspeakers, 3-D, TV displayed on your SVGA (or VGA)
monitor. Wow! Terrific! Uh, who needs this crud? I don't. And I don't
think bosses want to buy super game machines for employees, either.<P>

So if I (and those like me) don't need this stuff at home, and bosses
won't buy this stuff at work, who needs it? Why, those adults who are
willing to pay big-time so they, and/or their children, can play really
neat arcade-type games on their PC.<P>

The problem is, the PC market is a <I>mass</I> market. Vendors can only
sell what the market wants to buy. And while the arcade game-playing PC
market is large, it's a small part of the mass PC market. After this
limited market is satisfied, there's still an awful lot of fancy
multimedia PCs gathering dust in the showroom.<P>

PC makers have cut production way back and are selling their DRAM
inventory, driving down street prices. And once DRAM prices start moving
down, you want to unload your excess inventory <I>fast</I>. Figure 1
shows what happens then.<P>

<h3>Marketplace Lessons</h3><P>

After last Christmas, one company got so many returns of its high-end PC
systems that it had to put up a tent here in Silicon Valley to store
them. Not surprisingly, this company--okay, it's Acer--has just announced
a $500 PC with 100-MB disk storage and DOS/Windows included in that
price!<P>

These events in the PC world are mirrored in the automobile industry.
The auto makers tried to force the public into fancier and fancier cars,
at ever-higher prices. It didn't work; the average automobile selling
price (including leases and sales to rental agencies) never even reached
$20,000, and is actually turning down as consumers go for Saturns rather
than Lexi.<P>

There's more money in Big Macs than in fine French cuisine. Prudent
companies (that is, those that want to be profitable) will pursue the
mass market. This past Christmas proved that Tiffany multimedia machines
ain't it. Intel is terribly disappointed, because it was counting on
multimedia to sop up excess CPU cycles.<P>

What's Bill up to now? His company is preparing a stripped-down
operating system for the upcoming cheap, mass-
market, non-multimedia PCs. No, it's not a mini-NT.<P>
