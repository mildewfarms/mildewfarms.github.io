NobleNet has announced that it is bundling Visigenic's ODBC drivers for Windows NT and UNIX with the NobleNet OneDriver ODBC SDK. The Visigenic ODBC DriverSet has two ODBC componentsthe Driver Manager and a set of database drivers. The Driver Manager dynamically loads ODBC drivers and manages their interaction with the application. The database drivers submit SQL requests to the database and return the results to the application.<P>

Blue Sky Software has announced Visual SQL, a client/server development tool that extends Visual C++ with visual designers, intuitive wizards, and object-oriented data access. Visual SQL provides easy definition of queries, SQL statements, tables, pick lists, and custom screens, as well as instant access to all database objects from a central Component Repository.<P>
The Visual SQL design environment is fully integrated with Microsoft Developer Studio. You can create, modify, compile, and run client/server applications inside Developer Studio just like any Visual C++ application. The Visual SQL AppWizard extends the Visual C++ AppWizard.<P>
Visual SQL includes a set of tools for creating SQL queries: the Query Builder, the SQL Wizard, and the SQL Editor. The Query Builder lets you visually create complex SQL queries without programming. Users simply point-and-click to select the tables and columns to be displayed in the query, set conditions, and execute the query. The SQL Wizard automates the process of defining SQL statements. Preview Mode lets you run the query and manipulate live data at design time. Using the Expression and Function Builder, Visual C++ developers can quickly create and add expressions, functions, and subqueries on-the-fly.<P>

Interactive Software Engineering (ISE) has announced that its ISE Eiffel now supports Eiffel/C++ interoperability. The Eiffel/C++ interface makes it possible to leverage existing C++ code, incorporate third-party C++ class libraries into Eiffel-based development, and develop applications using both Eiffel and C++.<P>
The Eiffel/C++ interoperability includes the following: an encapsulation tool that generates Eiffel code to encapsulate an entire C++ class automatically; extensions to the Eiffel external clause to support direct calls to C++ macros, function prototype casts, the specification of extra include files, and so on; support for the creation and destruction of C++ objects from Eiffel (as well as access to data members of a given class); and a mechanism for calling Eiffel objects from C++ and calling C++ objects from Eiffel.<P>
ISE Eiffel supports cross-platform development across UNIX (SunOS, Solaris, HP 9000, IBM RS/6000, DEC Alpha OSF/1, Data General Avion, Silicon Graphics, Linux, SCO, and UnixWare), Windows 3.1/NT/95, OS/2 Warp, and VMS (DEC and Vax).<P>

Visigenic Software has announced OpenChannel, a database connectivity architecture. Based on the ODBC standard, OpenChannel provides heterogeneous data access through a common infrastructure of multiple systems, multiple applications, and multiple databases. The OpenChannel architecture's core components includes the OpenChannel Client, the OpenChannel Server, the OpenChannel Manager, and the Visigenic ODBC <P>
DriverSet.<P>
Additional modules are available including the OpenChannel Client for Java, which provides support for Java applications and applets, and the OpenChannel Secure module, which provides secure Internet communications.<P>
Tying it all together is the OpenChannel Server, which connects to a data source through the ODBC Driver Manager and database-specific driver that will now exist on the server. Organizations designing and deploying ODBC-based solutions can use a Visigenic ODBC Driver bundled with OpenChannel, substitute other Visigenic ODBC drivers or third-party ODBC drivers, or write their own drivers while still using OpenChannel as the client-to-server connectivity infrastructure. The OpenChannel Server will initially support Windows NT.<P>

EliaShim has announced ViruSafe-WEB, a generic antivirus utility for Web browsers. ViruSafe-WEB is installed as part of the browser; whenever the browser downloads a file, ViruSafe-WEB automatically scans the file before saving to the disk. It can scan programs, compressed files, and Word documents.<P>
ViruSafe-WEB can also be installed in other internet tools, such as FTP and e-mail. ViruSafe-WEB can be downloaded for free from EliaShim Web and FTP sites.<P>

Motorola's Personal Communicator Systems and Software division has announced the FLEXstack SDK that will facilitate integration of the FLEXchip Integrated Circuit for creating paging-capable products. The FLEXstack SDK allows integration of paging capabilities into computers, signs, security systems, or any remotely controlled device.<P>
The SDK consists of four modules: the driver, message filter, message manager, and application interface. The FLEXstack Driver directly manages the FLEXchip IC and constructs FLEX messages. The Message Filter formats the message data into character format. Message Manager stores completed messages. The Application Interface manages the high-level interface to application software.<P>

Hewlett-Packard and Green Hills Software have announced the integration of HP's processor probes with Green Hills' C, C++, and Fortran compilers and Multi Development Environment. Combining the HP processor probe with an HP logic analyzer and the HP B3740A software analyzer provides a debugging solution for hardware and software integration problems such as logic analysis with source-code reference, timing measurements, and run control. When the HP hardware is joined with Green Hills Multi debugger, developers can set breakpoints, single-step through code, examine variables, and modify source-code variables.<P>

Forte Software has released its Forte Web SDK, an add-on tool that supports the Forte Application Environment, an integrated set of object-oriented tools for building client/server applications. The Forte Web SDK enables Netscape Navigator and other browsers to function as Forte clients with full access to the Forte infrastructure.<P>
The first release of the SDK allows Web clients to interact with Forte applications via CGI. The SDK also provides HTML class libraries that format responses to requests made by Web browsers. This includes automatically formatting the results of an SQL database query for display to a user in a table format. Forte also supports client execution of JavaScript. The second phase of Forte's Internet support will automatically generate interfaces to Java, allowing Java applets to interoperate with the Forte infrastructure.<P>

Netscape and Borland have announced that Borland's AppAccelerator &quot;just-in-time&quot; dynamic compiler for Java applications will be incorporated in Netscape Navigator in an effort to improve performance. Borland claims that AppAccelerator technology enables Java applets and applications to run five to ten times faster than unenhanced versions. Borland's AppAccelerator reads the intermediate byte code produced by Java development tools and translates it on-the-fly into machineexecutable instructions on the local client system. Initially, AppAccelerator will be available for Windows95 and Windows NT clients. AppAccelerator is currently shipping with the Borland C++ Development Suite 5.0 and Sun's Java Development Kit.<P>

Oxford Computer has announced a new parallel-programming model and a symbolic parallel-programming method applicable to Intel's new Multimedia Extensions (MMX) to the PentiumPro. With this new programming model, the parallel operations of the MMX architecture can be described and visualized in familiar terms. Also, the parallel operations and data structures can be easily described symbolically in C and other high-level languages.<P>
Oxford's MMX work is based on the company's own A236 Parallel DSP Chip, which is similar to Intel's MMX technology. Oxford's development tools, the Oxford Computer Development Environment for the A236 Parallel DSP Chip, is available on Oxford Computer's Web page. These tools facilitate the symbolic parallel programming in C of the A236 Parallel DSP Chip.<P>
