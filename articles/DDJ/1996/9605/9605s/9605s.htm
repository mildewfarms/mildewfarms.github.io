The recently announced Borland C++ Development Suite includes Borland C++ 5.0, CodeGuard 32/16, PVCS Version Manager, InstallShield Express, and AppAccelerator Just-in-Time for the Java compiler in one integrated package. The package includes a native 32-bit-hosted development environment, which targets Windows 95/NT/3.1 and DOS. You can move between operating systems using TargetExpert, which lets you change the target platform with the click of a mouse. Borland C++ 5.0 also includes a multitarget project manager that lets developers build 32- and 16-bit applications in parallel. <P>
Borland C++ 5.0 includes Object Windows Library (OWL) 5.0. OWL 5.0 also encapsulates many Windows APIs, including WinSock (TCP/IP), MAPI (e-mail), and others. OWL 5.0 is portable to other compilers, including Microsoft Visual C++. The Suite contains a complete implementation of the ANSI/ISO C++ language draft specification. This includes support for namespaces and C++ keywords such as <I>bool</I>, <I>explicit</I>, <I>mutable</I>, and <I>typename</I>. Borland C++ 5.0 also contains the Standard C++ Library, licensed from Rogue Wave. The Standard C++ Library consists of C++ classes such as string, complex, and numeric limits, and the Standard Template Library (STL).<P>
For Internet development, Borland C++ 5.0 includes development tools for Java, including Sun's Java Development Kit (JDK). The JDK is integrated with Borland's IDE, and lets you develop cross-platform code, which can run on operating systems from Windows 95 and Sun Solaris to Macintosh and others. The Borland C++ IDE features complete support for developing Java applets and applications. This includes project manager support; access to Java compiler and debugger options through the IDE's multipage dialog boxes; and color syntax highlighting for Java source code. In addition, Borland C++ 5.0 includes the Borland Debugger for Java and an AppExpert for Java-specific applications and applets.<P>
In addition to OWL 5.0, Borland C++ 5.0 supports MFC 3.2 and 4.0. With Borland C++ 5.0, you can build MFC applications without having to manually modify MFC library source code and move existing MFC applications over to Borland C++. When MFC compilation support is enabled, the compiler uses the necessary Microsoft C++ language extensions and an automated search-and-eplace mechanism to allow proper implementation of the ANSI/ISO C++ <I>bool</I> keyword to compile the MFC library source code. Since MFC support is offered directly, it is not necessary to make individual compiler and linker settings in the IDE.<P>
Finally, Borland C++ 5.0 introduces the native 32-bit ObjectScripting IDE, a programmable and flexible environment that lets you modify and configure Borland's IDE. ObjectScripting is an object-oriented cScript language similar to C++ and the IDE Class Library. The IDE Class Library contains 23 classes with over 600 methods and properties giving you control of the major IDE subsystems, including the editor, build manager, project manager, and debugger.<P>
