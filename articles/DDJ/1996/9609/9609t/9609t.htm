Cedar Ridge Software has announced HypheGrid 2.0, a scrollable grid control for Java. Version 2.0 features include support for a variety of cell types (single line text, multiline text, choice box, button, and image), support for cell level attributes (color, font, alignment), and support for row and column selection. A simple grid object requires only 70 KB of Java bytecode, and the most complex grid needs only 150 KB.<P>

HypheGrid lets you add scrolling grids of tabular data to applications. With HypheGrid, users can scroll through a large set of table rows, move and resize table columns, and edit data in the table directly through the grid. You have extensive control over the appearance and properties of the grid embedded in your code. Functions are available to set colors and fonts for a wide variety of grid features. The data displayed in the grid is supplied by an object created by you and linked to the grid, and a variety of callback functions are available to notify the program about grid events.    <P>

O'Reilly &amp; Associates recently released WebSite Professional, which supports server-side Java programming and ships with a Java software development kit (SDK). The class library at the heart of WebSite Professional's server-side Java support encapsulates all of the details of the interface between the server and server-side applets. Consequently, you work with objects, properties, and methods that represent the Web transaction. For example, HTML form data are represented as Java objects, since the class library exposes WebSite Professional's built-in forms decoder.<P>

In conjunction with the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG), Fujitsu, and Absoft, Imagine1 has introduced the F programming language. F is a subset of the most- recent version of Fortran. F retains the modern features of Fortran--modules and data abstraction, for example--but discards facilities such as EQUIVALENCE, which are difficult to teach, use, or debug. It is a safe, portable programming language. F may be used by the Fortran 77 programmer as a transition to the new concepts in Fortran 95 or in High Performance Fortran (HPF). <P>

F is available for UNIX and Linux platforms, the 68K or PowerPC Macintosh, and PCs running Windows 95/NT. NAG is providing the compiler technology used in the UNIX and Linux implementations of F, Fujitsu the compiler technology used in the Windows implementations, and Absoft the compiler technology used in the Macintosh implementations. <P>

Two books about F, The F Programming Language, by Mike Metcalf and John Reid (Oxford University Press, 1996), and Programmer's Guide to F, by Walt Brainerd, Charlie Goldberg, and Jeanne Adams (Unicomp, 1996), are also available.<P>

F on Linux is free for educational users (via anonymous ftp at ftp.swcp.com in the pub/walt/F directory and at the Web site). Prices include $101.00 for other educational users, $201.00 for professional users, and $301.00 for a three-platform professional package. Site licenses and volume discounts are available.<P>
