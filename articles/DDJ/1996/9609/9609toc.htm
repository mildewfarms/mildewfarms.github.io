<h2>FEATURES</h2><P>

<h3><a href="9609a/9609a.htm">GOAL-DIRECTED SOFTWARE DESIGN     </A></h3><P>

<i>by Alan Cooper</i><P>

Goal Direction is the design methodology GUI guru Alan Cooper devised to cut through the confusion surrounding software-design problems. Using examples from his own design projects, Alan shows how Goal Direction lets you synthesize solutions that would otherwise never have been possible. <P>

<h3><a href="9609b/9609b.htm">CUSTOMIZING THE EXPLORER OPEN DIALOG     </A></h3><P>

<i>by Al Williams</i><P>

Windows 95 uses a special open dialog that allows users to rename files, create directories, and (of course) open files. Al shows how to customize this dialog, using a Delphi 2.0 component. <P>

<h3><a href="9609c/9609c.htm">CREATING SHAPED UI OBJECTS</A></h3><P>

<i>by Steve Sipe</i><P>

CShape, the C++ class Steve presents here, lets you create and manage custom windows, custom controls, and shaped dialog boxes. He then uses the class to build sticky-note and stellar calculator user interfaces.<P>

<h3><a href="9609d/9609d.htm">WRITING USER-DEFINABLE GUIs</A></h3><P>

<i>by Troy A. Schauls</i><P>

User-defined screens let users create and modify data-entry screens. This ability is possible if you use Visual Basic forms that are created, parsed, and compiled into a proprietary format, with only a &quot;system form&quot; in the app's executable file. <P>

<h3><a href="9609e/9609e.htm">THE JAVA ABSTRACT WINDOW TOOLKIT</A></h3><P>

<i>by Anil Hemrajani</i><P>

Anil examines the Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), a portable GUI class library for developing applications and applets. He then builds a text-editor application for Windows 95 and Solaris, along with an applet for Windows 95.<P>

<h3><a href="9609f/9609f.htm">DATA COMPRESSION WITH THE BURROWS WHEELER TRANSFORM</A></h3><P>

<i>by Mark R. Nelson</i><P>

The Burrows Wheeler Transform is an algorithm that takes a block of data and rearranges it using a sorting algorithm. The resulting output block is extremely well-suited for compression.<P>

This file manager lets you adapt the OS-9 real-time operating system's I/O system to provide non-I/O services. <P>

<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS </h2><P>

<P>

<h3><a href="9609h/9609h.htm">IMPLEMENTING A WEB SHOPPING CART</A></h3><P>

<i>by Chris Baron and Bob Weil </i><P>

<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH </h2><P>

<P>

<h3><a href="9609j/9609j.htm">JAVA, JFACTORY, AND NETWORK DEVELOPMENT</A></h3><P>

<i>by Eldon Metz</i><P>

JFactory is a cross-platform screen painter, prototyper, and code generator for Java that lets you concentrate on the design and functionality of your GUI by generating AWT source code. Eldon uses it to build an Internet-based client/server Java application.<P>

<h3><a href="9609n/9609n.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY </A></h3><P>

<i>by Edward Sitarski</i><P>

To overcome the limitations of variable-length arrays, Edward created a data structure that has the fast constant-access time of an array, but avoids copying elements when it grows. He calls this structure a &quot;Hashed-Array Tree&quot; (HAT) because it combines some of the features of hash tables, arrays, and trees.<P>
