A new version (1.62) of the Far Memory Manager library is being shipped by Dolphin Software. The library now provides the ability to identify the line number and source file of a statement that generates any of 27 errors detectable by the Dolphin functions; a utility to display any Dolphin function declaration from the DOS command line; and revised documentation that presents the debugging features in practical detail.<P>
This is added to the previously available enhanced memory allocation functions, multidimensional dynamic array allocation, far heap diagnostic functions, and a memory allocation log for tracking down far memory bugs.<P>
Ben Barron of the University of California School of Medicine in Davis, Calif., said of the Far Memory Manager, &quot;I was most impressed by the fact that it permits you to allocate and deallocate memory in blocks of any size without any penalty, and by the log that shows you how all your far memory was allocated.&quot;<P>
The library supports both Turbo C/C++ and Microsoft C and comes in small, medium, and large memory models.  The price is $99.  Reader service no. 25.<P>

Release 2.0 of NEWT-SDK, a TCP/IP development kit developed specifically for Windows 3.0, is now shipping from NetManage.  NEWT is the only currently available TCP/IP package implemented as a Windows DLL, as opposed to a TSR; thus, it is loaded into memory only when needed. Release 2.0 includes two new Direct Link Libraries: FTP, which provides an API to the Internet File Transfer Protocol for file transfer to and from a remote system; and SMTP, which provides an API to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, allowing mail exchange with Unix workstations, NEWT users, and other supporting systems.<P>
NEWT supports IP routing between networks -- Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI, and now the Serial Line IP (SLIP) -- communicating with multiple network cards simultaneously and routing IPs between them.<P>
DDJ spoke with Brian Holeman of Maxim Technologies in Vienna, Va., who used NEWT to connect a server on a Sparc station to a user interface.  &quot;NEWT was the only product we found with the ability to link into the server as a standard Windows app from within Windows,&quot; said Holeman.<P>
NEWT supports Windows' standard and enhanced modes and all network interface cards based on the NDIS industry standard.  The price is $500; site licenses and multiple-copy discounts are available.  Reader service no. 26.<P>

SLR Systems has announced OPTLINK/Compress 3.0, a linker with compressed, single-level overlays designed to provide greater file compression at higher speed.  It produces self-extract-to-run EXE files, and when the file is executed, an automatically embedded decompression routine instantly takes control and expands the program back to its original form.<P>
Features new to version 3.0 include: up to 8192 overlays, indirect calls, EMS/ XMS caching, compress root and large and small model overlays, and autoallocation of libraries. Furthermore, OPTLINK/Compress allows overlays to a separate file and calls from overlay to overlay.  With OPTLINK, large programs can be stored on a single floppy disk -- its EXE files need less than 1K extra memory for the decompression routine.<P>
Kenneth Kiraly of MultiScope Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., chose the product for its speed.  &quot;Compared to its competitors, OPTLINK saves time in developing large applications and generates smaller executables,&quot; Kiraly commented.<P>
OPTLINK/Compress supports Codeview 3.0 and 3.1 and costs $350.  Upgrades are $75 or free, depending on purchase date.  Reader service no. 28.<P>

New from Machine Independent Software is the Hash Table Generator, for use in compilers, interpreters, and other language recognizers.  The Generator produces a table which results in a &quot;perfect hash,&quot; the fastest way to identify keywords.  One hash function call and one string compare uniquely identify any keyword.  The hash function generation process is automated: You provide a list of keywords in a text file, one keyword per line.  To add a keyword, simply add a line to this file and rerun the Hash Table Generator using the new list.<P>
Features included are: no collisions, each keyword produces a unique hash result; for n keywords, a hash value for each of between 0 and n-1; a fast hash function provided in C source, uses one table lookup and one XOR function for each character in a keyword; a header file including keyword hash value #defines and an array of keyword strings sorted by hash value; and dynamic computation of hash table size.<P>
Available for DOS and OS/2.  $59 includes table generator, sample input file, hash function in C source, and user guide.  Reader service no. 29.<P>

Sequiter Software has released CodeBase++ 1.01, a multiuser, dBase-compatible class library for use with C++ that now comes with a DLL for Microsoft Windows 3.0.  The library works directly with the data, index, and memo files of dBase III-IV, allowing C++ developers to build dBase-compatible applications.  The combination of C++ and CodeBase++ offers high-level database management capabilities, speed, low memory requirements, portability, flexibility, and the advantages of a low-level programming language.<P>
Ray Storer, an independent developer from Fort Knox, Ky., said, &quot;the functions are really powerful and straightforward.  Take the function DATAMEMO, for example: You execute it, and it does everything for you.  It opens up buffers and the database, memo, and index files.  You just need to manipulate the data.&quot;<P>
Codebase++ can be shipped royalty free with any application; price is $295.  Reader service no. 30.<P>
