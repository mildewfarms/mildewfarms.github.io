Visual Basic, a graphical application development system for Microsoft Windows, is now available from Microsoft.  The new programming system provides visual user-interface design capabilities (for creating command buttons, text fields, list boxes, pictures, drop-down menus, and file system controls) with general-purpose programming tools, allowing you to create compiled windows .exe files that can be freely distributed without runtime fees or royalties.<P>
Visual Basic can be used to develop any Windows-based application and is also useful for integrating multiple Windows-based applications and for automating software testing through Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE).<P>
Based on Microsoft QuickBasic, Visual Basic has been modified for the graphical environment and the event-driven programming language.  It uses a threaded p-code incremental compiler and source-level debugging tools, including an interactive immediate window, in an integrated system.<P>
In addition to support for DLLs and the DDE, the control set itself can be extended by developers using C and the Windows SDK and the Visual Basic Control Development Kit (available separately) to provide the ability to integrate new user-interface components into the graphical design and code development environment.<P>
From what we've seen and used, Visual Basic is a powerful, but relatively easy-to-grasp system for developing Windows apps.  Microsoft's most difficult sales pitch might be convincing novice Windows programmers that Visual Basic is an easy entry into Windows development, while convincing experienced Windows developers that it is powerful enough to suit their needs.  Visual Basic fills both bills.  It's a milestone development environment that all Windows programmers should examine.<P>
Runs in Windows 3.0's standard or enhanced modes; requires a 80286 processor or higher; hard disk; mouse; CGA, EGA, VGA, 8514, Hercules or compatible display; MS-DOS 3.1 or later; and one or more megabytes of memory.  Online help, an icon library, and an icon editor are included. The price is $199.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

W5086 is the new single-chip, user-interface controller from Weitek.  Two key functions of Microsoft Windows' Graphical Device Interface (GDI) are incorporated in hardware, thus improving performance of the graphical environment and its applications.  These functions are the Bit Block Transfer (BitBLT), which copies a bitmapped image of a rectangular array of bits that correspond to the pixels of a graphic image from a source device to a destination device; and the LineDrawing function, which draws horizontal and vertical lines on screen one at a time.  With the W5086, the BitBLT is 26 times better than that performed by the system CPU, while the LineDrawing function is five times better.<P>
Compatible also with IBM VGA, W5086 is suitable for 16- or 32-bit systems, offers up to 2048 x 1024 resolution in monochrome; 1024 x 768 with 16 colors; and 800 x 600 and 640 x 480 with 256 colors.  All high resolution modes support non-interlaced or interlaced monitors.<P>
The W5086 costs $30 for 1000 units at 70 MHz in a 100-pin quad-flat-package.  The W5186 for 80 MHz in 144- and 160-pin quad-flat-packages will be released shortly.  Reader service no. 29.<P>

Screen Manager Professional (SMP) is the new interface design toolbox for C programmers from Magee Enterprises.  Using SMP, you can develop windowing, menuing, context sensitive help functions, data entry and keyboard and mouse support.  SMP's unique features are: an unlimited number of windows, event-driven mouse support, context sensitive help, linkable libraries, and a tutorial with over 100 code examples.<P>
Additional features include a comprehensive menu system and shadowing and overlapping of windows.  All windowing libraries are written entirely in hand-optimized assembly language, providing speed and low RAM overhead.<P>
DDJ spoke with Russ Beardall, a systems analyst at Duke University.  Said Beardall, &quot;I like the way the function calls are laid out.  You can define all the attributes and windows at the beginning and simply turn them on instead of using many calls.  On the other hand, you do have the option of using calls to set specific window attributes.&quot;<P>
SMP costs $349.95, $499.95 with source code.  Reader service no. 24.<P>

Tools.h++ 4.0, a foundation class library compatible with Microsoft Windows 3.0, is now available from Rogue Wave.  The new version includes over 60 classes that are not derived from a single root class, making it easy to combine them with other C++ classes from CNS, Glocken-spiel, Zinc, and others.  Classes are provided to handle strings, dates, times, files, Btree, Smalltalk-like collections classes, link lists, queues, stacks, and so on.<P>
There are several features new to the version: It can be run as a DLL, allowing smaller executables, code sharing, and easier maintenance; DDE and Clipboard stream buffer classes make for easy exchange of data with other applications while using stream I/O; a regular expression class makes searches possible to find matches using a regular expression pattern; a tokenizer class makes string parsing easy; expanded virtual I/O streams allow saving and restoring any object into memory, disk, or through the Windows DDE or Clipboard; and error checking allows for structured error handling.<P>
All classes are optimized for speed and size and have an isomorphic persistent store facility that allows complex objects to be stored and restored on heterogeneous networks or through the DDE.<P>
With source code, Tools.h++ for MS-DOS costs $199; $499 for Unix workstation or DOS network.  DOS object code only runs $99.  Reader service no. 26.<P>

Scientific Software Tools has released DriverLINX, a series of real-time data-acquisition drivers for third-party high-speed analog and digital I/O boards for Windows 3.0.  DriverLINX consists of language- and hardware-independent Dynamic Link Libraries designed to support data-acquisition boards from Keithley Metrabyte, Advantech, Computer Boards, and Sotec under real, standard, and enhanced modes.  The DLLs include services to display dialog boxes for configuration management and service request entry, context-sensitive online help, and extensive error-checking and reporting capabilities.<P>
The high-level interface to PC data-acquisition hardware reduces the effort involved in porting data collection, instrumentation, monitoring, and control applications into the Windows environment.<P>
Applications communicate with DriverLINX by passing a &quot;service request&quot; containing the specifications for a data-acquisition task.  DriverLINX acknowledges the request and notifies the application as the task is completed.<P>
There are over 70 services for creating foreground and background tasks to perform analog and digital input and output, time and frequency measurement, event counting, pulse output, and period measurements.  The most common data-acquisition protocols are implemented without sacrificing the hardware's high-speed data-acquisition capabilities.<P>
DriverLINX includes multitasking and multiuser capabilities; it can manage up to six data-acquisition boards and ten concurrent tasks.<P>
DriverLINX costs $400 and requires Windows 3.0, DOS 3.1 or later, 640K of memory, a hard disk, and a 286, 386, or 486 machine.  Reader service no. 27.<P>
