Multiscope Debuggers for Windows, now shipping from Multiscope, provide Microsoft Windows, Version 3.0 and character-mode interfaces for debugging Windows and DOS applications written in Code View-information compatible languages.  Included are the Run-Time debugger for controlling the execution of a program and the Post-Mortem debugger for analyzing the cause of a program crash.  The latter has a Monitor Execution and Dump (MED) system which allows Windows developers to find the reason for an unrecoverable application error, or a hang or crash.  When MED detects an upcoming crash, it puts the computer memory contents into a file. The user can then send this to the developer, who can analyze the problem using the 12 different views of the program (including exact location of the crash and variable contents at crash time) provided by the Post-Mortem Debugger.<P>
Also new to the package is remote debugging, whereby two machines are connected using a serial line or network, with the debugger running on the host computer and the application on the remote computer.  Remote debugging allows the programmer to control the execution of a program from the machine on which it is running.<P>
The Multiscope Debuggers for Windows cost $379.  Reader service no. 22.<P>

Unipress Software has announced PC-Connect 6.01, a Microsoft Windows 3.0-based interface to Unix.  The PC-Connect desktop is displayed in a window and split into two parts: the top portion, which shows up to 20 icons for net-worked Unix computers; and the lower portion, which shows up to 64 icons for both local and host-based applications.  To start an application, you simply click on an icon; PC-Connect automatically locates both local and remote applications and launches them.  You can print to either remote or local printers and make terminal emulation connections to non-Unix hosts, as well.<P>
The package contains a set of Unix utilities with the same look and feel as their Windows counterparts: Unix Exec helps you manage files and directories, and Unix Notepad aids in text editing.<P>
PC-Connect supports Microsoft's DDE, allowing Unix and DOS applications to be hot-linked for automatic updating.  An optional SQL link enables DOS apps to be automatically updated from SQL databases on the Unix system.  XVision, a Windows-based X-Window server for PCs, provides access to X applications.  Also available is the PC-Connect development system, which allows Unix developers to access Windows API facilities so that Unix apps are displayed as Windows applications on PCs<P>
Patrick Montas of Unisys in McLean, Va.  used PC-Connect while creating an e-mail package. One requirement was to notify users when e-mail was received, and PC-Connect did this very well by popping up a dialog box.  Basically, says Montas, &quot;the best thing about the product is that you can create icons for Unix applications, which saves a lot of time.&quot;<P>
PC Connect can be used with RS-232C serial lines, Ethernet, or Token Ring as well as TCP/IP networks.  Prices start at $1140, depending on the Unix host system and the number of PC users.  XVision costs $449 per PC.  Discounts are available for multiple copies.  Reader service no. 23.<P>

The Paged Memory Manager (PMM) development tool for Windows and OS/2 Presentation Manager applications has been released by Emerging Technology Consultants.  PMM uses Windows or OS/2 PM to allocate fixed-size &quot;pages&quot; of memory, then manages the suballocation of memory within those pages, bypassing the native system function calls, and thus eliminating memory management problems.  All this is done in a completely transparent fashion.<P>
PMM features multiple locking at several levels.  In high-level locking, for example, a page is automatically locked whenever memory is allocated on it, while at the heap level, every memory block allocated within a page can be locked multiple times.  This is useful for debugging and allows you to pass parameters via handles without worrying about locking conflicts.<P>
Also supported is memory grouping, which specifies groups of pages containing information you wish to isolate, thus improving program design and implementation.  There are debugging and statistics functions as well as free technical support via phone, fax, and e-mail.<P>
PMM for Windows and PMM for OS/2 PM cost $295 each; a developer's kit containing both runs $495; and source code license, $2500.  A special version for XVT toolkit users is available from XVT Software Inc.  Reader service no. 25.<P>

EASEL's graphical user interface helps you develop PC-based client/server and cooperative processing applications, as well as enhance existing terminal-based business applications.<P>
The tools available for designing GUIs are: A layout editor, with which you can create, place, and size windows, dialog boxes, and dialog controls (supports the SAA CUA guidelines); a drawing editor for designing icons and application-specific graphics; a menu editor to easily build action bars and pull-down and cascading menus; an attribute editor for designing and editing an application's individual component attributes; a built-in text editor; and a librarian.<P>
Also included are an incremental compiler which allows you to compile specific parts of an application; a source-level debugger, which executes the application continuously or statement-by-statement; and trace facilities that allow visual monitoring of an application's execution.  The organizational tools offered are a parts catalog and a project view manager.<P>
EASEL Workbench provides support for Microsoft's SQL Server, IBM's Database Manager, various mainframe communications protocols, advanced program-to-program communications, and the Dynamic Data Exchange.<P>
