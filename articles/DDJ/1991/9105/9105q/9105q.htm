<a name="013a_0002"><a name="013a_0000">Development and debugging for 32-bit Windows 3.0 applications is provided by C8.0/386 for Windows from Watcom.  Unix workstation and Mac applications can be adapted to Windows, as well.  C/386 for Windows includes an optimizing 386 C compiler, debugger, development tools, and special libraries (to access the Windows API from 32-bit code, and a 32-bit C library to enable 32-bit applications to execute under Windows 3.0).  Existing Windows development tools are 16-bit, and so cannot fully exploit the potential of the 386.  32-bit addressing allows GUI apps to use the memory available on these machines and increases speed significantly.<P>
Robert Wenig, scientist at Autodesk in Sausalito, California, told DDJ, &quot;The big thing for us is getting 32-bit debugging support.  The real win for Watcom is the source-level debugger, as well as enabling the technology needed to easily get Mac and Unix applications up to Windows.  It's easier to port 32-bit apps to 32-bit Windows.&quot;<P>
Developers can take existing Windows applications and create 32-bit versions.  The product was designed for use with the Microsoft Windows 3.0 SDK, and a DOS extender is not required. Unlimited royalty-free runtime redistribution rights are included.  The compiler sells for $2,250.  Reader service no. 23.<P>

The DataWindows library from Greenleaf Software now supports the Extended DOS 80386 architecture.  Data-Windows/386 is an integrated library of C functions for building interfaces, and includes logical windows, full-featured menus, list boxes, sophisticated data entry, and a complete user interface toolkit.  Greenleaf DataWindows/386 takes advantage of the improved performance of the 386 and maintains compatibility with DataWindows 2.12 for MS-DOS and Unix.<P>
Mark Edmead, custom software developer in the San Diego area, told DDJ that he's been using DataWindows since version 2 for the 286.  &quot;I'm changing an original application -- converting it from 286 to 386 with the Watcom compiler -- and so far so good.  DataWindows allows you to do graphical interfaces in a fairly easy manner.  You can build your own screens; and each menu or window can be a separate file, so if you want to change something, you don't have to recompile the program.&quot;<P>
Window sizes are virtually unlimited, and enhanced video routines written in C can directly access video memory or write to the display through calls to BIOS functions.  DataWindows supports DOS, Extended DOS/386, unix, Xenix, and OS/2.  The interface remains the same for both the programmer and the user, regardless of the hardware or operating system.  For protected-mode programming in DOS, Datawindows/386 can be used with Watcom C/386 8.0 or MetaWare's High C 2.3 in conjunction with the 386 | DOS Extender from Phar Lap Software. DataWindows/386 retails for $799.  Reader service no. 25.<P>

Developers can design applications using VenturCom's Embedded Venix (a ROMable AT&amp;T Unix operating system) running on Ampro Computers' Little Board/386.<P>
Embedded Venix is AT&amp;T Unix System V Release 3.2 optimized for acquisition and control, and the VenturCom claims it is the only industrial-strength Unix for AT-based computers; they added real-time extensions in order to create a deterministic operating system with a preemptable kernel.<P>
Ampro Computers' Little Board/386 is a compact 32-bit single board computer measuring 5.75&quot; x 8&quot;.  Minimodules provide VGA, modem, and network interfaces in a stackable, miniature configuration.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

Instant-C 5.0 from Rational Systems complements any production compiler with an integrated development environment and reduces the edit-compile-link-text cycle to an edit-test loop. Several new features include a menu and multiwindow user interface with mouse support. Instant-C now supports external editors and includes keystroke emulation for Wordstar, Brief, or EMACS.  The Instant-C editor can now handle large programs, and you can view and edit multiple files and functions.<P>
Also included is a data-watch window for improved debugging and support for the Pascal function calling sequence.  DPMI compatibility allows Instant-C to access up to 16 Mbytes of extended memory and run under Windows 3.0 in a DOS window.  Instant-C also uses Rational's DOS/16M DOS extender and virtual memory manager (VMM).  Instant-C provides automatic error detection at compiler, link, and runtime, and includes source-level debugging, interactive C expression evaluation, and compatibility with Microsoft C.  Version 5.0 is priced at $795; upgrades cost $50, unless you purchased Instant-C after December 1990, in which case you will receive it free.  Reader service no. 27.<P>

GX Graphics, a new member of the Genus Microprogramming GX Development Series of graphics programming tools, is designed for developers adding graphics to applications.  Standard graphics primitive functions are provided, as are more advanced routines such as Super VGA display mode support, mouse programming routines, as well as the ability to draw to virtual buffers in conventional, expanded, or disk memory.<P>
DDJ spoke with David Herman from Island Systems in Burlington, Massachusetts who said, &quot;we have added the Genus GX Graphics library as the newest port for our graphics-MENU GUI toolbox because we believe it offers an excellent alternative to the native graphics that are supplied with the Borland and Microsoft compilers.  Attempts to provide shareware alternatives to these native libraries have fallen short due to lack of mouse support in the higher resolutions. The GX library correctly supports the mouse in the standard and Super VGA modes of operation.&quot;<P>
Genus claims that any application currently using an existing graphics primitives library will improve in speed by replacing the existing library with GX Graphics.  A linkable kernel allows all products within the GX Development Series to share a royalty-free centerpiece of common functions linked directly into applications.  Programmers who are members of the Genus GX Development Series save on code overhead by sharing kernel functions between libraries. Only the required kernel functions will be linked into the programs.  The kernel is responsible for all display adapter interfacing, memory allocation, and virtual bitmap support.  Over 100 routines (written in assembly language) are provided.  GX Graphics sells for $199, and source code is available for $200.  Reader service no. 26.<P>
