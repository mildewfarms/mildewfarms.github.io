With nearly 100 C++ classes, C++/Views also includes a C++ class browser that supports project management, class browsing and editing, class hierarchy management, and integrated compile and go.  With C++/Views you can write your application once and simply recompile and execute it on all the supported platforms.<P>
The Windows version costs $495; Mac and OS/2 versions sell for $895.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

The FUSION TCP/IP Developer's Kit (FDK) for Windows, which allows developers to distribute windows applications across multivendor networks via TCP/IP, has been released by Network Research.  The FDK provides TCP/IP network and transport services by supporting Windows' DLL. Linking the FUSION DLL to the application at runtime allows access to FUSION's TCP/IP protocols.<P>
The FDK's unique feature is a set of modules you can link with your networking interface. The modules help isolate differences between TCP/IP socket-oriented and Windows' message-based communications protocols.  When compiled and linked with a Windows program, the modules improve the interface with the FUSION TCP/IP DLL and help speed up development.<P>
To obtain the FDK, you must purchase FUSION TCP/IP for DOS ($295) and a maintenance contract ($100).  Reader service no. 21.<P>

MULTI, the new source-level debugger from Oasys, is multitarget, multilanguage, multiwindow, and multiprocess, and can be used for native and cross development.  With it, you can simultaneously debug applications written in C++, C, Pascal, Fortran, and assembly.<P>
MULTI lets you display variable, class, and reference windows, and set breakpoints on overloaded or member functions.  It automatically demangles symbol names, associates C++ source lines with addresses in the executable, disambiguates references to overloaded functions and operators, and allows you to debug inline procedures.  In conjunction with the Green Hills native or cross C++ compilers, MULTI also provides automatic resolution of class base types such as virtual functions and displays complex class structures, including multiple inheritance.<P>
MULTI has a completely customizable graphical user interface based on the industry standard X Window environment, making its user interface easy to learn and consistent across platforms.  MULTI can be used to debug single or multiple processes native or remote to the processor it is running on, and the same debugger can interface to several remote devices without relinking or modification.  You can test your applications by configuring MULTI to interface directly with various debug execution environments via a UNIX ptrace command interface or your own ptrace-based interface.<P>
MULTI is available for Sun-4 SPARC and DECstations.  Prices for cross development start at $2000; for native development, $1000.  Reader service no. 24.<P>

First Class Software has announced Profile/V, an interactive performance analysis tool for Smalltalk/V.  Profile/V shows where time is being spent: which methods are most expensive and which statements within each method are the costliest.<P>
Profile/V operates by periodically sampling the Smalltalk activation stack to create a tree of the methods used while executing a block of code, weighted by which methods took the most time.  The tree is displayed as an indented list in a browser.  By selecting a node in the tree you can bring up the source code of the associated method in one text pane and a profile of time spent in the method's statements in another.<P>
Also included is a filtering mechanism called &quot;gathering,&quot; which merges all the profiles of a selected method into a single tree.  This allows you to compare the profile of mutually recursive methods from the perspective of any method and can also collect and show the performance impact of utility routines.<P>
Profile/V comes with a tutorial explaining optimization strategies in Smalltalk and costs $299.  Reader service no. 25.<P>

The LPI-C++ 32-bit compiler for commercial application development in multi-platform UNIX environments is now available from Liant.  Packaged with CodeWatch, Liant's source-level debugger, LPI-C++ allows you to build portable C++ applications.<P>
LPI-C++ is a complete &quot;2.1&quot; implementation of C++ as Ellis and Stroustrop describe it in The Annotated C++ Reference Manual, and has compile-time switch compatibility with Cfront, ANSI C, and K&amp;R C.  The compiler includes an optimizer that reduces program size and improves runtime performance using global common subexpression elimination, branch chaining, loop induction, loop unrolling, and subroutine inlining.  LPI-C++ gives you error messages that clearly identify the type, severity, and exact location of programming errors and attempt to specify probable corrections.<P>
DDJ spoke with Matthias Neugebauer of BKS Software in Berlin, who is developing an OOP database development environment for C++.  &quot;LPI-C++ is good for making the final version of a product but not for development.  There are performance problems with the compiler, but not with the generated code,&quot; says Neugebauer.  &quot;I will use it to test conformance to C++ specifications, because this is the only compiler that has that capability.&quot;<P>
LPI-C++ is initially available on 386- and 486-based systems running UNIX, Version 3, and will soon be available for Version 4 and for SPARC systems running SunOS.  Interaction with the debugger is through either the X-Window graphical interface or a character-based interface.  The introductory price is $695 per copy; $1295 with CodeWatch.  Reader service no. 26.<P>

Magic Fields from Blue Sky Software is a new tool for Windows data field validation.  With it, you can point and click to add pre- and custom-defined data entry fields, instead of writing the code to do input checking.<P>
Magic Fields consists of a collection of objects that perform data field validation, including numeric, text, alphanumeric, date, currency, dollars, phone numbers, social security numbers, and so on.  The custom-defined object can be used to define fields not in the collection.  Magic Fields supports international date and currency formats and can be used with any standard Windows dialog editor.  The price is $295.  Reader service no. 29.<P>
