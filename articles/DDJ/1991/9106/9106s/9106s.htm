Java 1.4, the video analysis software for IBM PCs and compatibles from Jandel Scientific, allows you to capture, process, measure, and analyze video images.<P>
Image arithmetic, snapshots, and bit-map transforms, along with enhanced macro facilities and data worksheet formatting/printing comprise version 1.4's new features.  Image processing time has been reduces by automated area of interest (AOI) features.  AOIs are defined using the new AOI backspace editing feature and can be saved as a template for use across multiple images.  The image arithmetic feature lets you add, subtract, and average images with the current image in the frame grabber buffer; it also measures changes over time and can improve the signal to noise ratio of an image.  Java analyzes data using look-up tables, linear regression, t-tests and descriptive statistics.<P>
The program is priced at $1495.  Updates from version 1.3 run $295.  Reader service no. 31.<P>

Grafmatic, Plotmatic, and Printmatic are the three Fortran libraries now available from Jewell Technologies.  Grafmatic enables you to create video graphics of two- and three-dimensional drawings, plots, or models.  Printmatic and Plotmatic have identical capabilities; Printmatic executes them on various dot-matrix, laser, and inkjet printers, while Plotmatic supports HP and Houston Instruments plotters.  The libraries also feature hidden line removal and shading for three-dimensional objects, as well as sophisticated spline algorithms.<P>
DDJ spoke with Dr. Howard Garon of Aptek Inc. in Silver Springs, Md., who uses the libraries in creating software related to underwater acoustic propagation.  Aptek chose the libraries because they are &quot;comprehensive in terms of the numbers and kinds of routines available.&quot;  Dr. Garon also said that he has found the libraries &quot;well-documented and straightforward to use as part of Microsoft Fortran, QuickBasic, and Pascal.&quot;<P>
All three libraries support the Microsoft, Ryan-McFarland, and Lahey Fortran compilers, run on IBM PCs and compatibles and require DOS 2.0 or later.  Each one can be used as a stand-alone package, or they can be bundled together.<P>
The libraries cost $249.95 apiece; discounts are available for bundling.  Reader service no. 25.<P>

Version 3.0 of the Professional Edition C compiler for the 8051 microcontroller family has been released by Franklin Software.  The new compiler offers reentrant code generation, pointers to speed up your code, registers into which program variables may be loaded directly, and optimizations such as loops and global and local subexpressions.  The new version allows you to mix different types of memory models and affords multiple CPTR and on-chip ALU support when possible as well as compatibility with code created with previous versions.<P>
DDJ spoke with Nick Andrews of Byte-BOS Integrated Systems in San Francisco, who commented, &quot;We've adapted our operating system to work with Franklin's large model and with the external stack.  It's a very efficient compiler in terms of execution and the code size is small.&quot;<P>
The compiler alone sells for $1195; a complete development kit runs $1995.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

ECAL is the new assembly language development system from VST Inc.  ECAL generates code for all 4- through 32-bit microprocessors and features an open architecture.  The package comprises an assembler with full macro capabilities, including parameter passing, local labels and conditional assembly; an integrated linker with a date-stamping make that reassembles only modules edited since the last assembly; a menu-driven editor that features split-screen mode and a file marker system; and diagnostic and context-dependent help facilities.<P>
There is an optional EPROM emulator which replaces the EPROM in the target microprocessor and facilitates fast linkage between host and target.<P>
Mike Appleton of Logical Devices Inc. in Fort Lauderdale said of the product, &quot;ECAL allowed very rapid development of our product, an EPROM/PLD programmer.  With most systems like this, you're limited to one type of microprocessor, but ECAL offers you full development potential across the board, and we plan on using it for other projects, as well.&quot;<P>
The ECAL package runs on IBM PCs and compatibles and includes a source level debugger, ROM emulator, and control files for all microprocessors.  It sells for $1895.  Reader service no. 23.<P>

Oasys has introduced the Green Hills C++ Compiler.  The compiler includes object-oriented features such as multiple inheritance, classes with scope, and operator overloading.  It is compatible with AT&amp;T's C++, Version 2.1 but supports cfront Versions 1.2 and 2.0, ANSI C, and Kernighan and Ritchie C as well.  The compiler offers optimizations such as procedural inlining, register caching, and loop unrolling and provides pragma extensions to permit flexible control over runtime error checking and virtual tables.  The product can be used as a native development tool or as a cross-compiler for cross or embedded development.<P>
Green Hills C++ will run on Sun-3, 386 Unix/System V, and 88open compliant machines.  The compiler comes with ANSI C header files, a single-step post-link program and a name mangler/demangler utility.  Prices begin at $1000.  Reader service no. 28.<P>

Alpha RPL is the new development language just released by Alpha Software.  This resident programming language allows you to create complete memory-resident applications, integrate DOS applications, automate tasks for time sensitive applications, and update user interfaces to give them a modern look and feel.  For existing applications, the RPL can intercept keystrokes and read screens so that you can add functions or change commands.<P>
Multiple DOS applications can exchange data while integrated under a single user interface. While running such applications, Alpha RPL can also read records from .dbf files.  The environment includes a symbolic debugger, librarian, and editor, and is memory-resident, permitting you to debug and test Alpha RPL programs on top of the application they control.<P>
Alpha RPL for DOS costs $595.  With extended or expanded memory, as little as 36 K of conventional memory will suffice.  Reader service no. 29.<P>

Linnaeus, Version 1.0 is the new stand-alone DOS C++ class browser and application development tool from Zircel Software.  It builds application information databases from subsets of any C++ source and requires no third party software.  You can select classes or lists of classes based on regular expression searches, class characteristics, or parent/child classes. Linnaeus provides tree displays of selected classes, along with a window containing such information as the class's data members, methods, comments, parents, children, and source filespec.  Clicking on a class name or icon in either the tree, the window, or the source listing will change that class and display its Detail window.<P>
Also included are the ZLIST utility, which can list any information found in the browser database in any order, and a utility to preload your text processor with the proper source file when you indicate which class you want to edit.<P>
