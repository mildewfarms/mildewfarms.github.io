The Tigre Programming Environment from Tigre Object Systems is a multiplatform application builder that lets you build GUI applications to run on Macintosh, MS-Windows, Sun, IBM R/6000, DEC, HP, and other workstations.  Color applications built with Tigre run without modification on any of these platforms.  Applications generated by Tigre are in Smalltalk, using ParcPlace Systems' Objectworks\Smalltalk Release 4, which must be purchased separately.<P>
Tigre includes a library of tested user interface object classes (or widgets) and tools to manipulate them.  To build an application, choose from a variety of buttons, text editors, and picture viewers; place the widget into your new Tigre program; modify it with drawing tools: connect it to your Smalltalk code; and test it.  Developing with Tigre is quick because an application can be modified while the program is running.  The modification is ready for use immediately, without restarting or recompiling.<P>
Tom Soon, a research scientist at Pacific Bell, commented, &quot;I have been using Smalltalk to create proof-of-concept prototypes for over three years.  With Tigre to help in creating the graphical user interfaces, I now spend significantly less time than it took to program them in Smalltalk.&quot;<P>
Also included is Tigris, Tigre's multi-user, object-oriented persistent-object store.  This database allows access to any arbitrary type of data, including variable length text, icons, images, sounds, or any type of object.  Connections can be established quickly between any interface component and its underlying data representation, making it easy to build even the most complex information processing applications.<P>
Tigre is priced at $3500 for a single user license on any of the above platforms.  Reader service no. 25.<P>

Microsoft has released a Source Profiler that generates four different types of diagnostic information about a program as it executes: the length of time taken to execute selected lines or functions; the number of instances selected lines or functions are executed, thus identifying overly used loops or functions and eliminating the need to insert counters to test code, whether a line or function was exercised; and a relative comparison of the time spent in each of the program symbols.  Output files of statistics from individual Profiler sessions can be combined to reveal how the program behaves during test suites.<P>
The profiler features choice of lines or functions, a low memory requirement, and extensive capacity and invocation options.  It uses compiler-generated input from Microsoft's CodeView debugger to determine line and function symbols.  You can profile all a program's lines or functions or specify only certain parts.<P>
Because the profiler occupies only about 80K, you can test memory-intensive applications. Also, by using virtual memory for its own data collection, the Source Profiler can keep track of an unlimited number of lines or functions.<P>
Also available is the Windows Debugging Version.  A standard component of the Windows SDK, the debugging version can now be purchased separately, and used with any Microsoft or third-party Windows development tool.  The debugging version displays information on a second monitor or COM port, which alerts programmers to problems with the use or management of Windows resources during application development.  It validates parameters, checks API calls, performs check/sums on code segments, tracks Windows handles, and provides other types of feedback.<P>
The Source Profiler costs $79 ($49.95 for registered Microsoft product users); it can be used with the following Microsoft products: Microsoft C, Fortran, Basic, Macro Assembler, Cobol, Pascal compiler, QuickBasic, and QuickC Compiler with QuickAssembler.  The debugging version is $195.  Reader service no. 26.<P>

Rational Systems recently released four new products: DOS/4G, BigWin, WinServe, and DOS/16M. DOS/4G is a 32-bit DOS extender for 80386/486 architecture.  It allows DOS extended applications to run as DOS programs under any DPMI-compliant operating system.  Thus, you can run 32-bit applications in protected mode.  DOS/4G requires little memory, and its linear addressing model provides a single address, making extended memory easier to access and resulting in better compiler code.  It supports real-time applications and TSRs and is compatible with Virtual control Program Interface and XMS extended memory standards.<P>
BigWin is a DOS extender for 32-bit windows programs, with which you can use Windows' enhanced mode.  Features include source code compatibility, compiler independence, and zero-based flat model addressing.  Applications created using BigWin can be linked with 16- or 32-bit industry standard DLLs, allowing you to call and debug other programs from within Windows.<P>
The WinServe toolkit is for transforming existing programs into Windows 3.0 applications. It supports communication between Windows front-end and DOS back-end programs; memory sharing; a standard DLL that exports an API for Windows application use; an object file containing an API for use by DOS/16M applications; a built-in debugger; and a Windows 3.0 virtual device driver.<P>
DOS/16M is a 16-bit DOS extender for creating DOS programs that require large amounts of memory.  Using it, you can expand the functionality of DOS applications with little modification.<P>
Prices for DOS/4G range from $5000-25,000, depending on configuration; Big-Win, WinServe, and DOS/16M begin at $5000.  Reader service no. 28.<P>

Wanim, a sprite animation DLL designed for building multimedia, educational, and video game software, is AND-XOR Systems' latest release.  Wanim is a fast multitasking DLL that can be used with any Windows 3.0-compatible language.<P>
Using Wanim you can change sprite display priority on-the-fly, create and position multiple animation zones anywhere within a window, scroll background images, detect collisions, and generate masks.  Algorithmic sprites allow you to create animation objects using Windows' text, line, rectangle, and ellipse drawing functions.  Algorithmic and bitmap sprites may be combined.<P>
Wanim works with any Windows-supported graphics mode.  The price is $69, with source code $99.  Demo disks cost $5.  Reader service no. 29.<P>
