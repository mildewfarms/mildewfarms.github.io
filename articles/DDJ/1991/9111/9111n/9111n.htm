Digital Research has released DR DOS 6.0.  This latest version has several significant new features, including advanced memory management and disk caching, password protection for files and directories, and on-the-fly compression.  For instance, using Memory-MAX memory management, DR DOS 6.0 automatically loads itself--including buffers, device drivers, memory-resident programs, and network drivers--into upper and high memory, freeing up to 628K of main memory for applications.<P>
The DiskMAX compression feature provides a file compression system that can be optionally invoked to increase disk space by 100 percent or more.  Also present is a disk cache based on Super PC Kwick (from Multisoft), which helps DOS and Windows applications run faster by keeping data in memory.  Data to be written to disk is buffered in memory, resulting in faster write operations.  DiskMAX can also defragment hard disks, safely reorganizing files into contiguous blocks.<P>
TaskMAX is a task switcher that allows you to load up to 20 applications simultaneously and switch between them.  It can run both from the operating system's graphical shell and the command line through a fully configurable hotkey selection.  DR DOS 6.0 can use extended or expanded memory to speed task switching.<P>
Additionally, Version 6.0 enables you to protect files, subdirectories, and disk partitions, or even entire environments through a power-on password function and software keyboard lock; to recover accidentally erased files; and to consult online documentation via a full hypertext facility.<P>
DR DOS 6.0 costs $99; upgrades are $24.95.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

QuickC for Windows is the new Windows applications development system from Microsoft that does not require use of the Windows SDK.  It includes an interface drawing and code generation tool, a C compiler, an integrated debugger, an editor, and resource tools such as an image editor, a dialog editor, and a resource compiler.  All these tools run from within an integrated Windows-hosted environment and are incorporated in a Toolbar to simplify selection of development tasks such as launching the building of a program, setting breakpoints, and single-stepping through code.<P>
Also included in the package are QuickCASE:W and the QuickWin library.  QuickCASE:W simplifies the interface-building process: You can select standard interface parts and it will generate the C code required for the interface and the related files.  The code regeneration technology in QuickCASE:W lets you move back and forth between QuickCASE:W and the QuickC for Windows environment, hand-customizing C code and making visual changes, and have all changes automatically incorporated after the C code is generated again.<P>
QuickC offers easy conversion of existing DOS applications to the Windows environment through two different channels: With the QuickWin runtime library you can convert DOS C programs directly to Windows programs in minutes, just by relinking the program; otherwise you can change a DOS application into a Windows DLL, then build a Windows application interface with QuickCASE:W.  This is convenient if you wish to use different languages for different tasks.<P>
QuickC for Windows includes complete documentation for the environment, Windows APIs, the C language, and C runtime libraries, and is priced at $199 ($89.95 for registered users of selected Microsoft products).  Reader service no. 22.<P>

The Whitewater Group has released Actor 4.0, a new version of its object-oriented programming platform.  The new object-oriented interface to SQL lets database developers use Windows-based OOP.  DLLs to uniformly access Paradox, dBase, and Excel are provided, and for an additional fee you can purchase them for SQL Server, DB2, Oracle, and OS/2 Extended Edition Database.<P>
Other enhancements to Version 4.0 include an improved ObjectWindows, the class library that facilitates quick and easy creation of Windows interfaces and safe multiple inheritance via protocols.  The protocols keep all shared data in one location, making code maintenance easier and eliminating unexpected dependencies.  Data encapsulation is preserved because protocols cannot directly modify data variables--they request their subscribing classes to make the changes instead.  There is a Protocol Browser for creating, editing, and tracking protocols.<P>
Two versions are available: Actor 4.0 retails for $249 (upgrades $75); Actor 4.0 Professional costs $495.  (Upgrades from previous professional versions are $75, and from previous Actor versions, $195.)  DLLs for access to DB2, Oracle, SQL Server, and OS/2 Extended Edition Database are priced at $395.  Reader service no. 23.<P>

The Numerical Algorithms Group's Fortran 90 compiler, which supports the new ISO Fortran 90 standard, is now shipping.  The compiler is portable and provides reusable compiler technology.  Compilation is achieved in a four-pass process, the final of which, the code generation pass, generates K&amp;R C code.  As a result, the compiler will be available in an increasing number of computing environments, allowing users to migrate their programs.  The generated executable can perform well, by relying on the optimization that is built into the host system's native C compiler.<P>
The NAG compiler is available for SUN 3s and 4s and HP/Apollo workstations.  License fees begin at $895; academic discounts available.  Reader service no. 25.<P>
