<h2>Solution to March Dr. Ecco</h2>
<h3>Solution to "Grab Bag," DDJ, March 2005.</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>1.</b> Yes. Player <i>A</i> can force a win. Here is how:<br>
Player <i>A</i>: 5<br>
Player <i>B</i>: 0 (forced; grabs 5)
Player <i>A</i>: 3 (grabs 3)<br>
Player <i>B</i>: 1 (forced; grabs 4)<br>
Player <i>A</i>: 1 (grabs 1 and 2)<br>
<b>2</b>. Player <i>B</i> wins when <i>n</i>=1 and <i>n</i>=3, and there is a draw when <i>n</i>=2 (obvious cases). <i>A</i> can force a draw when <i>n</i>=4 and <i>n</i>=6, although <i>A</i> might lose if he plays badly. When <i>n</i> is 5 or at least 7, the first player (player <i>A</i>) can always force a win by playing this series of numbers: <i>n</i>, <i>n</i>-2, <i>n</i>-(2+3), <i>n</i>-(2+3+4),..., but he should depart from this strategy once he can grab all the remaining numbers. This strategy forces <i>B</i> to play 0, then 1, then 2, etc., and <i>A</i> grabs more and more. This works for any even or odd number. Consider <i>n</i>=11:<br>
Player <i>A</i>:  11 (first move, grabs nothing)<br>
Player <i>B</i>:  0 (forced; grabs 11) (<i>Bgrab</i>={11})<br>
Player <i>A</i>:  9 (grabs 9) (<i>Agrab</i>={9})<br>
Player <i>B</i>:  1 (forced; grabs 10) (<i>Bgrab</i>={11,10})<br>
Player <i>A</i>:  6 (grabs 6 and 7) (<i>Agrab</i>={9,6,7})<br>
Player <i>B</i>:  2 (forced; grabs 8) (<i>Bgrab</i>={11,10,8})<br>
Player <i>A</i>:  2 (grabs 2, 3, and 4)(<i>Agrab</i>={9,6,7,2,3,4})<br>
Player <i>B</i>:  3 (forced; grabs 5) (<i>Bgrab</i>={11,10,8,5}) FINAL, with four numbers grabbed<br>
Player <i>A</i>:  0 (grabs the rest, 1) (<i>Agrab</i>={9,6,7,2,3,4,1}) FINAL, with seven numbers grabbed<br>
<b>3.</b> The winning situations remain the same, but the strategy changes a little. That is, <i>B</i> still wins for <i>n</i>=1 and <i>n</i>=3, there is a draw for <i>n</i>=2, A can force a draw for <i>n</i>=4 and <i>n</i>=6, and <i>A</i> can force a win for <i>n</i>=5 and for <i>n</i>=7 or greater.<br>
The strategy is similar, but <i>A</i> will follow this series when seeding: (-<i>n</i>)+1, (-<i>n</i>)+1+2, (-<i>n</i>)+1+2+3, (-<i>n</i>)+1+2+3+4... As before, <i>A</i> will depart from this strategy when able to grab all the remaining numbers. This will force <i>B</i> to seed the series <i>n</i>, <i>n-</i>1, <i>n-</i>2, <i>n</i>-3..., playing forced as before. Note that <i>A</i> can block the game by seeding -<i>n</i> in the first turn or by following this strategy and then grabbing the lowest nongrabbed number, but then <i>A</i> would lose.<br>
Example with <i>n</i>=5<br>
<i>A</i> seeds -4 and grabs nothing.<br>
<i>B</i> seeds 5 (forced) and grabs 1<br>
<i>A</i> seeds -2 and grabs 3<br>
<i>B</i> seeds 4 (forced) and grabs 2<br>
<i>A</i> seeds 0 and grabs 5 and 4.<br>
<i>A</i> wins with three grabbed numbers while <i>B</i> grabbed 2.<br>
<br>
Cristian Richart and Tomas Rokicki contributed to these solutions. Cristian found the solution to question 3 and proved that in the setting of the second question, it's always possible to grab a number if there are ungrabbed ones available after the first move.<br>
