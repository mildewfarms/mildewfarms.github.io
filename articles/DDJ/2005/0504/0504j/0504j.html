<h2>Suggested changes  to std::map</h2>


<h3>By Matthew Wilson</h3>


<I></I>

<hr>





<p>In this article, I suggest that the current language definition of the C++ subscript operator <i>operator [] </i>is too coarse grained. To illustrate this point, I examine <i>std::map</i> and describe several problems with its design. While these problems could have been avoided without changes to the language, they nonetheless provide stimulus for a discussion of the utility of a new operator&#151;the assigning subscript operator <i>operator []=</i>. Like a lot of programmers, I don't like language-imposed constraints or compiler-specific solutions, so I also examine several measures that may be used to implement custom associative containers and/or address the shortcomings in <i>std::map </i>within the bounds of the current definition of the C++ language and the constraints of current compiler technology.</p>
<h3>State-Dependent Semantics</h3>

<p>The C++ Standard Library associative container <i>std::map</i> supports mapping between unique keys and their corresponding values. An element in the map is a key-value pair. (The type of the container's key is <i>key_type</i>, and the type of the values is <i>mapped_type</i>. Slightly confusingly, the container's <i>value_type</i> is the key-value pair&#151;<i>pair&lt;const key_type, value_type&gt;</i>&#151;in keeping with the STL convention that a container's <i>value_type</i> is the type of a dereferenced iterator.) <i>std::map</i> provides a subscript operator for accessing elements via an array-like syntax. Alas, the semantics provided are something of a double-edged sword. When used for the insertion/update of a new/existing element, the syntax is both convenient and elegant, as it is meaningful and safe:</p>

<blockquote>
std::map&lt;std::string, short&gt;  iqs; <br>
                // A { name =&gt; IQ } mapping<br>
iqs["Albert"] = 732;<br>

</blockquote>

<p>This statement does one of two things, both with the same result (if successful). If no element exists with the key <i>"Albert"</i>, then a new element is inserted. If one does exist with that key, then its value is changed to <i>732</i>. In this context, the overloading of the subscript operator tallies with the semantics you observe with built-in arrays:</p>

<blockquote>
char  letters[26];<br>
letters[0] = "a";<br>
 ...<br>
letters[25] = "z";<br>

</blockquote>

<p>However, the other, equally common, use for the subscript operator is to access the element already existing at the given index:</p>

<blockquote>
std::cout &lt;&lt; letters[8] &lt;&lt; letters[16]; <br>
                                // prints "iq"<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, this is where the <i>std::map</i> falls down. Its subscript operator takes a key (of its <i>key_type</i>) and returns a mutable reference to its corresponding value (of its <i>mapped_type</i>):</p>

<blockquote>
template &lt;...&gt;<br>
class map<br>
{<br>
  ...<br>
  mapped_type &amp;operator  <br>
                       [](key_type const &amp;key);<br>

</blockquote>

<p>If no slot exists, one is created. The problem occurs when there is no existing entry for the key. Thus:</p>

<blockquote>
cout &lt;&lt; "Matthew's IQ: " &lt;&lt; iqs["Matty"] &lt;&lt; endl; <br>
                                        // prints "0"<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Because I have not yet inserted a value, the apparent access of my IQ in the earlier statement actually causes a new entry to be made, whose value is set to the default initialized value for a<i> short</i> (<i>0</i>). This is admittedly a little parsimonious, but arguably appropriate commentary for my having made such a misuse of the <i>std::map</i>.</p>

<p>It appears that we have a serious problem. The subscript operator serves element insertion/update perfectly, but it only serves element retrieval if insertion has already occurred. If not, then it serves as a kind of default insertion, very easily missed. This is bad because it violates the Rule of Transparency (see <i>The Art Of UNIX Programming</i>, by Eric Raymond, Addison-Wesley, 2003) of code: You cannot tell by examining a particular fragment of code whether it's using an <i>std::map</i> correctly. <i>std::map</i> appears to "do as the <i>int</i>s do" (see <i>More Effective C++</i>, Scott Meyers, Addison-Wesley, 1996) some of the time, but does not do so at other times&#151;and the compiler cannot help you. Indeed, the compiler is positively prevented from being of assistance.</p>
<h3>const-truculence</h3>

<p>There's a related problem. Because the subscript operator has to be a mutating (non<i>const</i>) method to support its update and insertion semantics, it cannot be called on <i>const</i> instances:</p>

<blockquote>
inline void dump_my_IQ<br>
       (std::map&lt;std::string, short&gt; const &amp;m)<br>
{<br>
  std::cout &lt;&lt; m["Matty"]; // compile error!<br>
}<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Hence, performing lookup on standard associative containers is a complex operation:</p>

<blockquote>
inline void dump_my_IQ<br>
       (std::map&lt;std::string, short&gt; const &amp;m)<br>
{<br>
  std::map&lt;std::string, short&gt;::const_iterator it = <br>
                                       m.find("Matty");<br>
  if(m.end() != it)<br>
  {<br>
    throw std::out_of_range("invalid key");<br>
  }<br>
  std::cout &lt;&lt; (*it).second;<br>
}<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Yuck! Sadly, there's not even a nonoperator method that performs the lookup and returns a reference to the value, throwing an exception if it's not found. There's the added disadvantage of the potential lack of consistency between uses of this technique, as programmers may potentially elect to use different exception types. Of course, you could generalize in the form of an Attribute Shim ("Generalized String Manipulation: Access Shims and Type Tunneling," <i>C/C++ Users Journal</i>, August 2003; and<i> Imperfect C++,</i> Addison-Wesley 2004, both by Matthew Wilson) to handle this but that has its own set of problems.</p>

<p>Why does <i>std::map</i> not provide both mutating (non<i>const</i>) and nonmutating (<i>const</i>) forms of the subscript operator? The reason is that<i> const</i>/non<i>const</i> overload method resolution is done on the basis of the argument types, and the hidden pointer is treated in the same way as other arguments. Consequently, all other arguments being equivalent, the <i>const</i> overload is only selected when <i>this</i> is <i>const</i>; that is, when the instance is <i>const</i>. Hence:</p>

<blockquote>
std::map&lt;std::string, short&gt;        m1 = ...;<br>
const std::map&lt;std::string, short&gt;  m2 = ...;<br>
m1["Bill"] = 16;<br>
                      // Calls nonconst version<br>
cout &lt;&lt; m2["Ben"] &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
                     // Calls const version<br>
cout &lt;&lt; m1["Bill"] &lt;&lt; endl; <br>
                     // Calls nonconst version!<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Ironically, there is a method that can be used instead of the subscript operator when used for insertion/update: <i>insert().</i> And use of it rather than the subscript operator would result in code that is almost equally clear:</p>

<blockquote>
iqs.insert(std::make_pair("Albert", 732));<br>

</blockquote>

<p>In hindsight, the designers of the associative containers could have opted for<i> insert() + operator []() const</i>, and curtailed all possibilities for hidden semantic gotchas and verbose lookup code. </p>
<h3>Separation Anxiety</h3>

<p>The third problem with the use of the subscript operator is that of the separation of the creation of the element from the setting of the element's value. Looking back to the insertion of <i>"Albert" </i>into the original <i>iqs</i> map, what actually happens is:</p>



<ol>
  <li>You construct an <i>std::string</i> instance from the literal string <i>"Albert"</i>.</li>
  <li>You call <i>std::map::operator []()</i>, passing the string by reference. Assuming <i>"Albert"</i> is not already in the map, a new element is created and inserted whose value is defaulted (for example, <i>=mapped_type()</i>). A reference to that value is then returned.</li>
  <li>The calling code invokes the <i>mapped_type</i>'s assignment operator, passing the right side of the statement. </li>
</ol>



<p>This two-phase operation to the insertion of a new element has three drawbacks:</p>



<ul>
  <li>No validation. The element's value is assigned after the element is created, and outside the map. This is not an issue for <i>std::map</i> because it does not do any kind of value validation. But any custom container that would seek to do validation cannot do so if it follows <i>std::map</i>'s semantics. The same obstacle would be present to a custom container that seeks to avoid redundancy by referring all identical values to the same instance.</li>
  <li>Unsafe exceptions. If the <i>mapped_type</i>'s assignment operator throws in step 3, then you've got a map with meaningless contents. That's not of much help in writing<i> try/catch</i>-free exception-safe code! Using the <i>std::pair&lt;key_type, mapped_type&gt; </i>form of <i>insert()</i> with <i>make_pair()</i> does not have this issue.</li>
  <li>Inefficient. Because the element's value is first constructed and then assigned, there is a potential inefficiency, especially for <i>mapped_type</i>s of class type. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Languages</h3>

<p>Before exploring alternatives, it's worth noting how other languages address this issue. </p>

<p>Java doesn't have operator overloading, so the issue is moot. Although it's disconcertingly ugly and verbose, Java succeeds here in not suffering as C++ does. Its <i>Map/Map&lt;K, V&gt;</i> interface has <i>put() </i>and <i>get()</i> methods to insert/update and lookup, respectively.</p>

<p>C# has indexers, which let a class instance be indexed in a manner syntactically similar to arrays. Essentially, an indexer block encapsulates either or both of <i>get</i> and <i>set</i> subblocks. They are semantically equivalent to two separate functions for insert/update and lookup.</p>

<p>D, Heron, Python, and Ruby all handle the situation with far greater aplomb than C++, making a distinction between insertion/update and retrieval by separating the two into distinct methods. D has <i>opIndexAssign()</i> and <i>opIndex()</i>. Heron has <i>_op_subscript_read</i> and <i>_op_subscript_write.</i> Python has <i>__set_item__</i> and <i>__get_item__</i>. Ruby has <i>"[]="</i> and <i>"[]"</i>. All of these are eminently useful and usable, and I've never had any ambiguous experiences with any of them.</p>
<h3>operator []= for C++</h3>

<p>If I had free reign to extend the language, I might suggest the addition of an assigning subscript operator, <i>operator []=</i>. With this, the compiler could be directed to make a simple and unambiguous choice between insertion/update via the assigning form (<i>operator []=</i>), and lookup via the standard form (<i>operator []</i>). When the subscript appears to the left of an assignment, the assigning form would be called; otherwise, the standard form would be used. The standard form might still come in mutating (non<i>const</i>) and/or nonmutating (<i>const</i>) form, but classes that implemented those methods would not elect to perform insertion when they're invoked: Either the element exists, in which case the operator returns a (<i>const</i>) reference to the value; otherwise, an exception is thrown.</p>

<blockquote>
iqs["Matty"] = 16; // Calls operator []=()<br>
short iq = iqs["Matty"];<br>
                     // Calls operator []() const<br>

</blockquote>

<p>For classes that provide both insertion/update and retrieval, you'd see these two operators defined together as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
class IQMap<br>
{<br>
  ...<br>
/// Subscripting operators<br>
public:<br>
  // Assigning subscript operator<br>
  &lt;whatever-you-want&gt; operator []=<br>
             (key_type const  &amp;key, <br>
                   mapped_type const &amp;val);<br>
  // Subscript operator<br>
  mapped_type  <br>
         &amp;operator [](key_type const &amp;key);<br>
  mapped_type const   <br>
     &amp;operator [](key_type const &amp;key) const;<br>
  ...<br>
};<br>

</blockquote>

<p>It's as simple as that! The further boon is that you can now overload <i>operator [] </i>on <i>const</i>/non<i>const</i> because the two overloads have identical behavior and are only distinguished by the <i>const</i>ness of their return types.</p>

<p>This provides for identical semantics in the subscript operator between standard containers and those that provide collection-like interfaces to third-party libraries (e.g., http://stlsoft.org/), or nonmodifiable views over other collections. The one drawback to current practice is that expressions such as<i> iqs["Frazier"]++ </i>would no longer work in the case where the elements do not currently exist. However, that's a minor loss compared to the big gains to be had.</p>
<h3>Pragmatic Measures in the "Now"</h3>

<p>Okay, <i>operator []=</i> is a (possibly) nice idea, you say, but we don't have it. Moreover, even if it was added to C++ in C++-0x, we're still years away from seeing it in compilers.</p>

<p>Being a pragmatist, I have several ideas for how we might get a safer, more sensible semantic for associative containers now.</p>

<p><b></b></p>

<p>Adopt the <b>operator [] () const approach. </b>This is a great idea. Change <i>operator []</i> to a (throwing) <i>const</i> form, and ambiguity and retrieval inconveniences disappear forever. Unfortunately, there's a rub&#151;the millions of lines of existing C++ code. There'd be no place to hide for the standards committee, and all my friends would stop talking to me. </p>

<p><b>Unambiguous operator [] overloads?</b> Remember, I said that we can't overload <i>std::maps operator[] </i>for <i>const</i>/non<i>const</i>  because they factually do different things, and it's difficult to ensure that the non-mutating (<i>const</i>) form is called at all times when it's intended. Well, there is a way&#151;using argument decoration (see <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a>). Simply put, the two normal <i>operator [] </i>overloads perform the throwing lookup you're after, while the one overloaded to take an <i>inserter&lt;&gt;</i> performs the insertion. You would use it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
umap&lt;std::string, short&gt;    iqs;<br>
iqs["Matty"] = 63;<br>
           // A compiler error at last. Hurrah!<br>
iqs[insert("Matty")] = 63;<br>
          // Works fine, and not the least bit<br>
          // ambiguous<br>
<br>
std::cout &lt;&lt; iqs["Matty"] &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
         // "63"<br>
std::cout &lt;&lt; iqs["Boris"] &lt;&lt; endl; <br>
         // throws std::out_of_range<br>

</blockquote>

<p>There's no ambiguity. It's clear what's going on, and there's no loss of efficiency in the argument because all compilers can easily optimize-out such reference copying. Furthermore, for the argument-forwarding aficionados, there's no ambiguous copying or <i>const </i>subversion (as described in Chapter 21 of <i>Imperfect C++</i>, since the arguments are always <i>key_type const</i>&amp;<i> </i>for both the container's argument and the argument proxy type. This can be used for new containers, but it still can not be retrofitted to <i>std::map </i>without breaking code. Note that this solves the state-dependency and <i>const</i>-lookup issues, but the separation issues remain.</p>

<p><b>Add an at() lookup method.</b> Just because you can't get a better <i>operator [] </i>without getting the C++ world offside, you don't need to give up. You can still have a simple throwing lookup. The sequence (<i>STL Tutorial and Reference Guide</i>, by David Musser et al., Addison-Wesley, 1996) containers&#151;for example, <i>std::basic_string</i>, <i>std::vector</i>&#151;have an<i> at() </i>method that validates the requested index and throws <i>std::out_of_range</i> if it's invalid. Custom containers and <i>std::map</i> could do the same:</p>

<blockquote>
namespace std<br>
{<br>
  template &lt;...&gt;<br>
  class map<br>
  {<br>
    ...<br>
    mapped_type const <br>
            &amp;at(key_type const &amp;key) const;<br>
    mapped_type<br>
            &amp;at(key_type const &amp;key);<br>
    ...<br>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a solution that could work without breaking any existing code, and would make life simpler for users of associative containers. (Incidentally, the <i>at()</i> member function has already been suggested for inclusion in the Standard Library.)</p>

<p>Now you can rewrite the lookup in an equally readable form, which will either correctly look up the element or will kindly throw an exception:</p>

<blockquote>
cout &lt;&lt; "Matthew's IQ:" <br>
                     &lt;&lt; iqs.at("Matty") &lt;&lt; endl;<br>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Use veneers on std::map.</b> This approach arguably has the most practical use because it allows you to modify existing <i>std::map</i> classes now. Basically, you provide alternatives to the standard associative containers that are syntactically and semantically identical, save for the modified <i>operator [] </i>and <i>at()</i> methods. One way to do this is by implementing the map in terms of an <i>std::map</i> member, and forwarding all identical methods directly to the contained member (see <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a>).</p>

<p>An alternative is to define a veneer for associative containers that provides the required semantic adjustments/enhancements. Veneers (which are a specialized form of the Adapter pattern; see <i>Design Patterns,</i> Erich Gamma et al., Addison-Wesley, 1995) are templates that derive from their primary parameterizing types, add no nonstatic member variables, and respect the polymorphic nature of their primary parameterizing type. <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a> implements a veneer.</p>

<p>Both of these approaches are useful now, and will reveal any issues at compile time. The state dependency and<i> const</i>-lookup issues are handled as shown in <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listings Two</a> and <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Three</a>, and you can easily overload (or hide) the <i>insert()</i> methods such that you have a two-parameter form taking key and value, should you so choose.</p>

<p><b>Return proxies from operator [].</b> One of my reviewers suggested that <i>operator []</i> can be written to return a proxy object, which will then only cause an insertion if subject to an assignment. (Scott Meyers describes a similar technique for deferring changes to reference-counted strings in Item #29 of<i> More Effective C++</i>.) That's a nice idea, with some unfortunate flaws.</p>

<p>First, a conforming container must return by reference to support the taking of the address of the returned value, so the proxy object would have to overload the address of operator <i>operator </i>&amp;<i>.</i> I have such deep antipathy to overloading the <i>operator </i>&amp;, that I simply couldn't live with that option. (See Chapter 26 of <i>Imperfect C++ </i>for the complete rant and rave.)</p>

<p>The other objection is that to support the two semantics&#151;insertion/update and lookup&#151;the proxy would have to have nontrivial logic. As a library writer, I know that complex implementations are not appreciated, neither by myself who has to write and maintain them, nor by users who have to understand them.</p>

<p>Furthermore, such things are potentially inefficient. Although it's unlikely to be the case with most modern compilers, there is still the possibility that the implementations may not be fully inlined and elided during the optimization phase of code generation. What is likely to be much less avoidable is the cost of separate initialization and assignment forced by the assignment to the reference </p>

<p>The obvious theoretical objection is that proxies can no more help with validation of the value than does the current non<i>const</i> subscript operator provided by <i>std::map.</i> Of course, you could write a specific proxy class, or the validation policy could be specified as an additional template parameter to your container template, but that's just adding even more to the complexity of the implementation.</p>

<p>There's not a single killer objection to the use of the proxy, but I'd suggest that the combination of these points represents a pretty unattractive picture.</p>

<p><b>Use std::map as is, remembering your lookup shims. </b>The path of least resistance is, of course, to go with current semantics, which may be the only option for people who are not in a position to adopt new tools. In this case, I'd suggest using <i>insert()</i> for insertion and update, and either the <i>m.find() == m.end() ? "no-op":"dereference"</i> idiom or the <i>std::out_of_range-</i>throwing attribute shims for retrieval. In this way, you can avoid <i>std::map</i>'s<i> operator []() </i>entirely, and dispense with the heartache. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I've illustrated the problems inherent in the design of the Standard Library <i>std::map</i> containers, and deficiencies in the language itself, in so far as the subscript operator does not adequately reflect the semantics of built-in types. There are hidden semantic pitfalls and tedious lookup logic. I've suggested that a simple enhancement to the language&#151;the addition of <i>operator []=</i>&#151;would resolve all these issues. Given the likely long lead times for any such language changes, even if adopted, to filter down to real programmers, I've suggested other, more practical and immediately realizable measures that can help clear the semantic fog of <i>operator []</i> and <i>std::map</i> right now.</p>
