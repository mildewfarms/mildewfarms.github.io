<p>On a recent project, I found myself facing a perplexing design problem. I needed a data structure that provided very high, random-access performance, while simultaneously providing high performance when iterating through the entire structure. Because the project was being developed in C++, I first turned to the Standard Template Library (STL). However, I couldn't find a single data structure that satisfied both requirements. Undeterred, I decided to create my own STL-compatible structure&#151;a hybrid linked-list/hash-map class I call "<i>linked_hash</i>."</p>
<h3>The Not-Quite-Sufficient STL Structures</h3>

<p>My requirements for a data structure were clear. I needed to support a large number of random accesses to individual items in the structure, followed by an iteration through the whole structure&#151;and I needed to support it hundreds of times per second. Performance was, therefore, a top priority, but (being lazy) I first examined the STL to see if there were any existing data structures that met my needs. In this case, the specific STL implementation I used was the GNU libstdc++ Library (http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/).</p>

<p>The data structure that I looked at was a hash map. The hash map would provide me with constant-time random access, meaning that in the average case, the amount of time required to access a single element would be constant, regardless of how many items were stored in the data structure. However, the problem with a hash map is the nonaverage case. If the keys for two or more items end up having the same hash value, then they all end up in the same hash bucket. The random access time for the hash map then starts to go down, as the bucket has to be searched linearly for the proper key. The solution is to use a good hashing function, and ensure that you have plenty of distinct buckets. In the case of the GNU <i>hash_map</i> implementation, though, iteration through the structure is proportional to the number of buckets, as well as the number of items. Consequently, a sparsely populated hash map with lots of buckets can't be efficiently iterated through. So the <i>hash_map</i> failed the iteration requirement and was unusable for my structure.</p>

<p>The next structure I considered was just a plain old map. Since it uses a tree for its underlying storage (at least in the GNU implementation), it can be iterated through linearly. It also has decent performance for random access, since the tree never gets very tall (the height is the log of the tree's size). However, in my particular situation, decent performance wasn't good enough. Even if the height of the tree was only four or five levels, that was still four or five comparisons for each of the thousands of random accesses per second. It just didn't quite meet my requirements for scalable performance.</p>

<p>Finally, I briefly considered a linked list or an array, but the random access for a list provides a totally unacceptable linear search performance, and an array would be too costly to expand or shrink as new items were added or deleted. Instead, I was faced with the certainty that I'd have to push aside my laziness and create a new data structure. Since I didn't want my laziness to go too far, I decided to create my data structure as a reusable, STL-compatible class instead of some tightly coupled specialty structure. That way, I know I can be lazy the next time I need this type of structure.</p>
<h3>Implementing the Structure</h3>

<p>To meet both a constant-time random access and linear iteration, I decided to make a data structure that is essentially a hybrid linked-list/hash-map. Acting as a hash map, it lets individual elements be accessed in constant time, using a key. In addition to storing the individual elements in a hash map, the structure supports linear-time iteration through the elements by linking them together in a linked list.</p>

<p>The interface to the <i>linked_hash</i> structure follows the interface for the GNU STL's <i>hash_map</i> (the <i>hash_map</i> isn't a part of the STL Standard, but the GNU implementation follows the SGI STL, which has become somewhat of a de facto standard). Although iteration through the structure behaves like a linked list, the class does not support list-specific methods such as <i>push_front()</i> or <i>push_back()</i>, or insertion at a specific position in the list.</p>

<p>To store data in the structure, I decided to make use of the existing <i>hash_map</i> and <i>list</i> classes, and provide the <i>linked_hash</i> class as a wrapper around these two structures. Instead of directly storing my key/item pairs in either the hash map or list, I created a <i>_linked_hash_node</i> structure to contain the data (see <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a>). The internal list and <i>hash_map</i> then stores pointers to nodes; each node will be simultaneously stored in both the <i>hash_map</i> and the list. Each node then stores iterators that point to the location where the node is stored in the list and <i>hash_map</i>. This way, the linked hash can fully manipulate the node, regardless of whether it was located through the list or the hash map. For example, if the <i>erase()</i> method is called with a key, the correct node will be located using that key to look it up in the internal hash map. Once found, the iterator to the list that is stored inside the node will be used to also remove the node from the list. Without the iterators, <i>erase()</i> would have to search linearly through the list to remove the reference there, which would destroy the constant-time access performance.</p>

<p>Once I set up the data structures to hold the linked hash's data, I needed to create an iterator for the class. <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a> is the iterator I developed, which is fairly straightforward. All I do is store a pointer to the node that is associated with the given iterator. Implementing the dereferencing operations for the iterator then becomes a simple task of going through the node to access the underlying data pairs that are stored therein. For the increment and decrement methods, I then simply make use of the list iterator stored in the node, and call its increment and decrement methods.</p>

<p>The <i>linked_hash</i> class itself has template parameters that match those of the <i>hash_map</i> class, namely a key, data type, hash function, class for testing the equality of two keys, and an allocator class. Inside the <i>linked_hash</i> class, I put several private <i>typedef</i>s that I'll use later in the class definition, such as the <i>_linked_hash_node</i>, the <i>hash_map</i>, and the list (see <a name="re1"></a><a href="0508ke1.html">Example 1</a>). You'll also see that I have two <i>typedef</i>s that use the <i>Alloc::rebind&lt;&gt;::other </i>class. The allocator rebind lets you take an allocator of arbitrary type (in this case, the one supplied as a template parameter to the <i>linked_hash</i> class) and create an allocator for a different data type, but of the same allocator type. For instance, if you provide <i>linked_hash</i> with a shared memory allocator for integers, the rebind gives you a shared memory allocator that (for example) allocates <i>_linked_hash_nodes</i>. In this case, the two rebound allocators that I <i>typedef</i> are for creating <i>_linked_hash_nodes</i>, and pointers to <i>_linked_hash_nodes</i>. I'll use the former for allocating nodes to store the data, and the latter as template parameters to the internal <i>hash_map</i> and list that stores the nodes.</p>

<p>The constructors for the <i>linked_hash</i> class also match the <i>hash_map</i> class, and in most cases simply pass the constructor parameters on to the constructor for the underlying <i>hash_map</i>. In the case of the set of constructors that also take a range of elements, the constructors also use the <i>linked_hash</i> class's <i>insert()</i> operation to load the elements into the <i>linked_hash</i> as the object is being constructed. For full details on the <i>linked_hash</i> constructors, see the full source for the <i>linked_hash</i> class (available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 5).</p>

<p>For many of the simpler methods in the <i>linked_hash</i> class, I was able to directly make use of the corresponding method in the underlying <i>hash_map</i> class. The <i>bucket_count()</i> or <i>hash_funct()</i> methods, for instance, are concepts wholly used by the <i>hash_map</i>, and so it is trivial to just call the <i>hash_map</i> method. Similarly, for methods like <i>size()</i> and <i>empty()</i>, I can use the underlying <i>hash_map</i> function because each item in the <i>linked_hash</i> has exactly one corresponding node in the <i>hash_map</i>. Of course, that also holds true for the underlying list, so I could have just as easily used <i>list::size()</i> and <i>list::empty()</i>. As with the <i>linked_hash</i> constructors, you can see each of these method implementations in the source code for the <i>linked_hash</i> class.</p>

<p>With other methods, there was not a direct one-to-one correlation for the method implementations, but the <i>linked_hash</i> method implementation was still nearly trivial because of methods available in list or <i>hash_map</i>. For example, the <i>swap()</i> method was able to work by swapping both the <i>hash_map</i> and the list. Iterators, too, were simple. All I needed to do for the beginning iterator was to create a new <i>linked_hash</i> iterator from the beginning iterator of the underlying list object, and the ending iterator is just created with a NULL pointer instead of a list iterator pointer.</p>

<p>Now look at the <i>insert()</i> method in <a name="re2"></a><a href="0508ke2.html">Example 2</a>. When inserting a new data item, the first thing to do is to create a new node for holding the data. I do that using the node allocator that I created when I instantiated the class. This ensures that the memory will be allocated from the proper location (for example, using <i>new</i>, from shared memory, from a pool, and so on). Once I've allocated an empty node, I try to insert it into my internal <i>hash_map</i>. If that succeeds, I add the pointer to my list and construct a full node. If the insertion into the <i>hash_map</i> fails, then I know the key already existed; instead of constructing a new node, I deallocate the node pointer because I won't need it. Finally, the <i>insert()</i> method returns a pair with either the newly inserted data or the data that was already present for the supplied key, and a Boolean indicating success or failure.</p>

<p>Another interesting method to implement was <i>erase()</i> (<a name="re3"></a><a href="0508ke3.html">Example 3</a>). When a program goes to erase an element from the <i>linked_hash</i>, the object needs to remove the node references from both the internal <i>hash_map</i> and the internal list, then destroy the node itself. To examine exactly how this is done, look at the <i>erase()</i> method that takes a key and erases the element stored under that key (if it exists). To start, the method needs to see if such an element does indeed exist, so it calls <i>find()</i> on the internal <i>hash_map</i>. If the element does not exist, the method simply returns zero (the number of elements erased). If the element does exist, I first store a pointer to the node. Once I have the node stored, I then remove it from both the <i>hash_map</i> and the list, using the iterators that were stored in the node itself (that way, both erasures are constant time operations). With the node removed from both internal data structures, I then use my allocator to destroy the object and deallocate its memory. Finally, the method returns a 1, since one item was erased.</p>

<p>Finally, look at the implementation for the <i>operator[]</i> method (<a name="re4"></a><a href="0508ke4.html">Example 4</a>). It's only one line, but worth a brief discussion. Since the <i>insert()</i> method returns the existing element for a key, if there is one, you can implement the subscripting operator by attempting to insert a new element with a default value. If no element with that key exists, the new element will be inserted. If one does exist, it will be returned. Regardless, you can extract the data portion from the return value and return it.</p>
<h3>Using the Linked Hash</h3>

<p>Because the <i>linked_hash</i> class conforms to an STL-compatible interface, you can use it just about anywhere you might use an STL map or a <i>hash_map</i>. For instance, say you have a bunch of devices that need to be able to receive and process events. Events are received asynchronously, but you want to process the events for all of the devices at a fixed interval. <a name="re5"></a><a href="0508ke5.html">Example 5</a> shows how you could use a <i>linked_hash</i> to store all of your devices, keyed by a name string. When an event is received, it can be inserted into the queue for the appropriate device, using <i>insert_event()</i>. A processing thread would then be able to periodically call <i>process()</i> to iterate through all of the queues and process the received events. </p>
<h3>How Does its Performance Compare?</h3>

<p>Since my primary motivation for creating the <i>linked_hash</i> class was to maximize performance for the set of use cases I needed to support, it makes sense to take a look at how the performance for the <i>linked_hash</i> class really compares to other data structures. So, to test the performance, I wrote three test programs that test insertions, modifications, and iterations, using <i>linked_hashes</i>, <i>hash_maps</i>, and <i>maps</i>. For the <i>linked_hash</i> and <i>hash_map</i>, I also tested against instances with very large bucket counts set to ensure no memory reallocations would be needed.</p>

<p>The first test I ran was an insertion test, which inserts new items into an empty data structure. <a name="rf1"></a><a href="0508kf1.html">Figure 1</a> presents the results, showing the time necessary for insertions as the number of items inserted increases. With a large bucket count, you can see that the insertion time for the <i>linked_hash</i> increases linearly. Although the insertion performance is worse than a <i>hash_map</i> that also has a large bucket count, you can see that the <i>linked_hash</i> performance is usually better and much more predictable than the insertion times for a <i>hash_map</i> that doesn't have a large bucket count.</p>

<p>The next test that I ran was a test of modification times. Since the <i>linked_hash</i> and the <i>hash_map</i> should both have constant access times, I only did a comparison between the <i>linked_hash</i> and the <i>map</i>. For the test, I measured how long it took to perform a direct access of each item in the data structure, using the subscript operator. As you can see in <a name="rf2"></a><a href="0508kf2.html">Figure 2</a>, the time necessary to access each item with the map increases much more quickly than the <i>linked_hash</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, I ran a test of iterations. For this test, I tested how long it took to iterate through the entire data structure, as the number of items in the data structure increased. <a name="rf3"></a><a href="0508kf3.html">Figure 3</a> has the results, which clearly show that iteration through the <i>linked_hash</i> is vastly more efficient than iteration through the <i>hash_map</i>, especially if the <i>hash_map</i> has a large bucket count.</p>

<p>For each of the individual tests, the <i>linked_hash</i> was never the best performer. Overall, though, there was no other data structure that was able to consistently outperform the <i>linked_hash</i>. If you need to optimize for a single use case among those tested, the <i>linked_hash</i> is probably not your best choice. However, if you need a data structure that has predictable, decent performance over all three, the <i>linked_hash</i> may be a good choice. If you have a good hash function that lets you keep your keys from colliding, it is a very good choice for soft real-time systems that have a stack of things that need to support asynchronous random access and iteration (it would probably only be a good choice for a hard real-time system if you can guarantee no hashing collisions).</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Although the <i>linked_hash</i> met my needs perfectly, there are a few areas where improvements could be made. One big area is ordering. For now, items inserted into the <i>linked_hash</i> are unordered, so iteration is not guaranteed to be in any particular order (in reality, the order is based on the order of insertion). If you needed the iteration order to be sorted, you could use a sorted data structure to replace the list. Or, you might find that you need to have multiple items with the same key (for example, a set instead of a map). Currently, only one item is supported, but multiple items could be supported with a <i>hash_set</i> instead of a <i>hash_map.</i></p>
