<p>Iwas crying on the shoulder of a customer at Foo Bar, the late-night Silicon Valley hangout where I occasionally moonlight as relief bartender for the tips. Not the money kind of tips&#151;of which, for some reason, I don't get many&#151;but the Valley insider kind of tips: Things I overhear in conversations, things customers let slip when they've had one too many.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think I lack all the requisite social skills for being a bartender," I told him.</p>

<p>"You're being too hard on yourself," he said. "Do you have any more peanuts?"</p>

<p>"No, it's true," I said. "I didn't realize it until I started working behind a real bar."</p>

<p>"Oh, here they are," he said, rummaging behind the unreal bar. "By 'real bar' you mean&#151;?"</p>

<p>"Tangible, actual, not a figment of my imagination like this one."</p>

<p>"A figment of your imagination. Like this one. Right." He pushed his glass forward. "I think I may need another of these."</p>

<p>"See, I've been working nights behind the bar at Summer Jo's, my real-life partner's southern Oregon restaurant," I explained as I replenished his Lavender Lemondrop, "and it's given me some insight into the fictional bartending that I do here."</p>

<p>"Fictional. Right." He looked at me from under his eyebrows as he sipped his Lemondrop. "Maybe you should pour yourself one of these. But what's this about lacking social skills?"</p>

<p>"As bartender, I should be listening to customer complaints," I said as I shook up the vodka and lavender-infused lemonade. "I should be offering ambiguous advice and saying sympathetic things like 'Why the long face?' and 'You're being too hard on yourself' and 'You don't say.'"</p>

<p>"Rather than, say, unloading your neuroses on your customers?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. And I should be telling bar jokes. That's a biggie. But it's the customers who tell me the jokes."</p>

<p>"You don't say."</p>

<p>"I do say. Just the other day a magazine publisher walked into the bar and said, 'A horse walked in to a bar and the bartender said, "Why the long face?"'</p>

<p>"'That's a good one,' I said." "That's an old one," he said. "You don't say," I said.</p>

<p>"I do say. Now, was that the real bar," he asked, "or this purportedly fictional bar that I'm sitting in at this allegedly imaginary moment?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," I said, sipping thoughtfully at my Lemondrop. "But it was the same bar where Larry Tesler walked in the other night."</p>

<p>"Larry Tesler, the Xerox PARC programmer who became Chief Scientist at Apple?" he asked. "Thin guy, soft-spoken?" </p>

<p>"Yeah, that Larry Tesler."</p>

<p>"The Larry Tesler who wrote a markup language back in 1969 or thereabouts that was a kind of predecessor to HTML?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, what was that called? Oh, right, PUB. According to John Markoff the manual had a picture of a British pub."</p>

<p>"Must have been this bar then. What would Larry Tesler be doing in southern Oregon?"</p>

<p>"But he was. It turns out he's owned property in the area since about 1969. Back then he was planning to live on a commune in Takilma."</p>

<p>"But he went to PARC instead?"</p>

<p>"More or less."</p>

<p>"I suppose working at PARC in the '70s wasn't that different from living on a commune in southern Oregon. So he was visiting his property?"</p>

<p>"In passing. He was actually in the process of moving from Seattle to the Bay Area."</p>

<p>"Larry Tesler was living in Seattle?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, he's been VP of Shopping Experience at Amazon for the past few years."</p>

<p>"I did not know that. And he was moving to the Bay Area to&#151;"</p>

<p>"To do the same for Yahoo, he told me. As VP of their User Experience and Design Group."</p>

<p>"But Mike, that sounds like one of those Silicon Valley insider tips that you moonlight here to pick up. It must have been this bar."</p>

<p>I scrutinized him. "You seem to know a lot about me. Just who are you, anyway?"</p>

<p>"A figment of your imagination, apparently."</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Still, thanks for letting me cry on your shoulder."</p>

<p>"Not a problem," he said as he stood up and didn't leave a tip. "It's been real."</p>

<p>I wasn't so sure. </p>
