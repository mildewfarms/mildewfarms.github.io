<p>Wibu-Systems AG has launched updated versions of its Wibu-Key 5.0 and CodeMeter 2.10 antipiracy tools. Wibu-Key offers copy protection and license-management using hardware-based encryption. Wibu-Key 5.0 supports "Hot Plugging," which lets you "plug-in" and "plug-out" of the Wibu-Boxes at any time. The CodeMeter 2.10 Digital Rights Management system includes a daemon mode that can be used for special system services. At the heart  of CodeMeter is the CM-Stick, a USB-based encryption and storage device. The CM-Stick is available without flash disk or in different memory sizes starting with 128 MB. Wibu-Key and CodeMeter are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>

<p>Hit Software has released Allora 4.1, its middleware reference for XML to database integration projects. Allora lets you export data from any relational database to XML, or map and transform XML data to relational data. Among other features, Allora 4.1 introduces a multiple SELECT feature, which lets you work with multiple submaps that are then joined in real time with XSL. Multiple SQL query also competes in the heterogeneous database migration market. Rather than using database-specific SQL dumps or flat files that cannot contain table relationships or constraints, the complete database structure and data can be persisted into XML for easy access or transport, and recreated on any other database platform at minimal cost. Other enhancements in the Allora 4.1 Mapper include support for namespace definitions, complex database expressions, NetBeans 4.1, and stored procedures in Oracle packages. </p>

<p>PrismTech has announced the launch of its Spectra Power Tools productivity suite for Software Defined Radio (SDR) developers, which addresses the software development and deployment lifecycle for SDR development. Spectra Modeling Tools provide a visual approach to waveform and radio platform development. They support modular development, the outsourcing of relevant functionality (if desired), and a common reference methodology for developers and systems engineers. Furthermore, Spectra Power Tools inherently facilitate reconfiguration and reuse, thus independently extending the life of both the radio platform and software applications (waveforms).</p>

<p>OC Systems has released Hitchhiker for Eclipse, an Eclipse plug-in and runtime engine that provides tracing, profiling, memory leak, tracking, and function coverage tools for C/C++ applications. Hitchhiker collects performance and control flow data by automatically inserting machine code instrumentation into an application. Data collection is configured using the Eclipse Workbench. The application can be launched either manually on the target machine or from the Eclipse Workbench; in either case, Hitchhiker detects and instruments the target application. Hitchhiker is nonintrusive; the application can be traced and profiled at near full execution speed. Collected data is sent back to the Eclipse Workbench and viewed in real time using a variety of data visualization schemes.</p>
