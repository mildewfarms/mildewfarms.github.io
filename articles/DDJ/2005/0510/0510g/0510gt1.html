		<td>API</td> <td>Description</td> <td>Preferred Programming Language</td> <td>Pros</td> <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Carbon</td> <td>Interfaces used for Mac OS 8/9 applications. OO interfaces/classes for Mac OS X</td> <td>C, with C++ supported</td> <td>Familiar APIs, allows reuse of Mac application code or program code written on other procedural systems</td> <td>Not every API call available, older Carbon apps must be converted to Mach-O format</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cocoa</td> <td>Traces its roots to the NeXTSTEP framework</td> <td>Objective-C, Objective-C++, although C and C++ can be integrated into code</td> <td>NeXTSTEP framework field-tested for over a decade offers a rich set of services</td> <td>You're starting from scratch adapting code to this API</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Java</td> <td>Uses J2SE 1.4.2</td> <td>Java</td> <td>Can reuse Java programs written on other platforms with little modification</td> <td>Won't have full access to all of the OS features as do the other APIs, performance may be an issue</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>BSD UNIX</td> <td>Based on the System V IA-32 Application Binary Interface (ABI)</td> <td>C</td> <td>Good for writing CLI tools or low-level services such as daemons or root processes</td> <td>Mac version of IA-32 ABI still in preliminary form, and there are some minor differences in it from the Intel version</td>
