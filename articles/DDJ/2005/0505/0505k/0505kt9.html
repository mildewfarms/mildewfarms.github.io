<table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Pros</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Works very well if the application has isolated functional parts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Works well together with a parallel extension of existing functionality using .NET.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. No interoperability overhead between migrated ASP and COM components through all the layers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. No conversion between complex data types, like dataset and recordset is needed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5. Usually less risky, compared with complete layer horizontal migration.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6. Vertically migrated application part can be redesigned and take advantage of .NET benefits through all migrated layers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Interoperability overhead to communicate with the rest of the nonmigrated unmanaged code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Additional effort to refactor independent functionality for vertical migration.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Migrated shared code has to be accessed through interoperability or duplicated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. State synchronization is still needed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5. Security for a mixed environment has to be addressed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6. Deployment should be done for the mixed environment.</td>
  </tr>
