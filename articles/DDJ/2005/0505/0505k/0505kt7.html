<table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Pros</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1.  State synchronization problem does not exist. Savings on side-by-side state synchronization development, incorporation, and testing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.  Native state management.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3.  Full load balancing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4.  .NET security mechanisms can be used.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5.  Ease of integration with other .NET technologies.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6.  Better performance by using page compilation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7.  Better performance by using caching.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8.  Can utilize .NET configuration and maintenance benefits.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9.  Can utilize .NET deployment benefits.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10. All other .NET managed code benefits.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>11. Ready for step-by-step optimization.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Power of .NET is not fully used. Server controls, data binding, and so on, are not utilized.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Communicates with business and data layers through COM interoperability, causing possible performance degradation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Old ASP design stays in place. This makes it difficult to support and extend the code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Increased risk, cost, and time compared to "as is side-by-side" presentation layer usage.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5. ASP.NET pages must use single-threaded apartment (STA) to communicate with COM objects.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6. Interoperability assemblies have to be deployed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7. .NET Framework has to be deployed on all web servers.</td>
  </tr>
