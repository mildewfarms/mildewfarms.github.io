<table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Pros</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Consistent solution for all web sites taking a side-by-side path.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Full load balancing can be achieved. Affinity restriction is not applied any more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Can be easily switched to native ASP.NET state management by the end of migration.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Better security; data remains on the server side.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5. Does not consume bandwidth; data remains on the server side.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Development cost and time. Custom state management has to be implemented for both ASP and ASP.NET (if third-party software is not acquired).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Native state management has to be replaced with a custom one. Minor code changes are necessary.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Will become obsolete after all the web sites are migrated.</td>
  </tr>
