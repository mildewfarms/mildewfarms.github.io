<table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Pros</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. No interoperability overhead to access the legacy part of application business logic from the .NET part of application business logic and vice versa.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Less risky, lower cost and time if it is difficult to slice business logic for local or vertical migration.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Good opportunity to redesign the application business layer in order to take advantage of .NET.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Migrating COM objects to .NET classes improves scalability.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Additional interoperability overhead to access the business logic from the presentation layer of a legacy part of an application (if the presentation layer is not migrated yet).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Additional conversion to a recordset or other COM data formats for a nonoptimized presentation layer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Generally higher risk, time and cost compared to the interoperability option.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. .NET Framework has to be deployed on all servers, where business logic assemblies are deployed.</td>
  </tr>
