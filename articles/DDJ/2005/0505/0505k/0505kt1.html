<table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Pros</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. The investment in legacy code is preserved.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Relatively small risk associated with the migration process.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Relatively low cost of migration.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Personnel are in place, trained, and the application delivers a service today.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5. New functionality can be added separately, minimally affecting existing code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6. New functionality added in .NET, gains .NET benefits.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Legacy code and .NET code have to coexist. This adds additional cost in maintaining two different environments. Both environments have to be deployed and supported.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Application and session states of ASP and ASP.NET live in different processes and have to be synchronized. This involves additional cost in development, testing, and support.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Legacy code does not gain productivity, maintainability, extensibility, performance, and other .NET benefits.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Performance of interoperability between legacy code and .NET can possibly be an issue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5. Application architecture as a whole is not consistent. Legacy and .NET application parts have different architectures.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6. The common functionality for legacy and new .NET code has to be maintained. Possible solutions are discussed below.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7. Some legacy code changes are necessary to communicate with the .NET part of the application.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8. The problem of adding new functionality that affects legacy code can achieve significant magnitude, possibly resulting in migration or rewrite anyway.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9. The timeout problem should be resolved.  ASP and  ASP.NET application parts have separate timeout settings.</td>
  </tr>
