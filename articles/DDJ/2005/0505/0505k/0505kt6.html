<table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Pros</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Minimum legacy code is migrated, preserving investment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Opens possibility to improve performance for performance-critical code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Opens possibility to improve design for design-critical code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Smaller risk compared to other migration strategies.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5. Less time needed for every local migration step compared to other migration strategies.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6. A sequence of local migration steps decreases the risk, compared to other, more revolutionary migration strategies.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. .NET migration benefits are applied only locally.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Total cost and time to migrate the same amount of code in stages is higher, compared to migration of this code using other, one shot, migration strategies.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Often difficult or impossible to separate functionality to be migrated because of its loose coupling with other parts of the application.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. A legacy code change may be needed to access migrated functionality.</td>
  </tr>
