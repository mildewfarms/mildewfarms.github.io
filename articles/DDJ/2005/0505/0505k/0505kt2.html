<table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Pros</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Easy to implement. Development time is negligible if only strings and numbers have to be passed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Good for a small state.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Good for nonsensitive data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Especially good for static synchronization (see "Static versus Dynamic Synchronization").</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue">
    <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Security problem. State is passed through the wire and state encryption for sensitive data is now necessary.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Security problem. Even with encryption, passing such data as database connection strings imposes a security risk. Internet web sites are especially vulnerable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. Passing a relatively large state affects bandwidth and response time. Especially important for 56K modem users and mobile users.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Custom code is needed to send and receive a state.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5. Works for a Web Farm if affinity for load balancing is in place.</td>
  </tr>
