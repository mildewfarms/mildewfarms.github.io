<p>Windows Forms technology is built over Win32 windowing. To effectively use Windows Forms, you have to understand the principles of Win32 windowing&#151;including the relationship of windows classes, message queues, and threads. In this article, I touch upon some Windows Forms topics and explain why you need a good understanding of Win32 windowing to write the best Windows Forms code.</p>
<h3>Creating Windows and Forms</h3>

<p>When you create a new Form, you haven't created a window&#151;all you've done is create a .NET object. The object's constructor just creates the .NET object's side of things; that is, fields and event handlers are initialized. The actual Win32 window is only created the first time that the form is made visible. The <i>Visible</i> property calls the protected method <i>SetVisibleCore</i>. This method attempts to read the form's <i>Handle,</i> and the property <i>get</i> handler calls the protected method <i>CreateHandle,</i> which creates the window.</p>

<p>This two-stage construction means that the constructor should be used to initialize items that are not dependent upon the window's handle. In light of this, some controls cache data that requires a Windows handle to be used when the control handle has been created. For example, the <i>ListView</i> control is based on the list view common control. If you want to add an item to the control, you do so through the <i>Items</i> property, which is a <i>ListViewItemCollection</i>. The <i>Add</i> method of this class actually delegates the task to the <i>ListView.InsertItem</i> method, which tests to see if the list view control has been created. If so, it inserts a new <i>LVITEM</i> by sending the control the <i>LVM_INSERTITEM</i> message. If the control has not been created, then the <i>ListViewItem</i> objects are stored in an <i>ArrayList</i>. When the control is created, the <i>HandleCreated</i> event is raised, the handler for this code iterates through all the items in the cached <i>ArrayList,</i> adding those items to the control. </p>

<p>To create your own control, factor your code so that the operations that require the control to have a Windows handle can only be called after the handle is created. Or if the operations could be called before, cache the operations and replay them on the <i>HandleCreated</i> event handler. </p>
<h3>Indented Items in a ListView</h3>

<p>For example, one feature I want to use with the <i>ListView</i> class (available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 5) is the ability to indent the main item. If you use Outlook Express, you know what I mean. When you click on Local Folders, you see a list view that shows all the folders that you have, and nested folders are indented from their parent folders. To do this with Win32 is simple. Your list view must be in report view (<i>LVS_REPORT</i>, which Windows Forms calls <i>View.Details</i>) and it must have at least one column. Your items must also have icons because the indentation is in units of the width of an item's image. Then all you need to do is provide a value for the <i>LVITEM.iIndent</i> field that is passed to the control using the <i>LVM_INSERTITEM</i> message.</p>

<p>There is no mechanism to do this with the Windows Forms <i>ListView</i> class, so you have to derive from this class and create your own implementation. <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a> is a partial listing of a class to do this. The <i>InsertIndented</i> method inserts a <i>ListViewItem</i> with the specified indentation. <i>InsertItem</i> is the method that does the actual work by sending the <i>LVM_INSERTITEM</i> message. Because an item may have subitems, the <i>SetItemText</i> is a helper method to set the text of each subitem. Finally, if the list view has not been created, the information is put into an <i>LVIData</i> object and stored in the <i>operations</i> member. When the list view is created, the <i>OnHandleCreated</i> method is called, which iterates through the items in the <i>operations</i> field and inserts them into the list view.</p>

<p>You must first create the code to insert an item, and so you need to write the managed version of <i>LVITEM</i> and gain access to <i>SendMessage</i> using Platform Invoke; see <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a>. There are just two points to make about this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>LVM_INSERTITEM</i> is passed a pointer to an unmanaged <i>LVITEM</i> structure, but you do not have to worry about this because Platform Invoke does the work for you when you declare the final parameter as <i>ref LVITEM.</i> The <i>ref</i> indicates that a pointer is passed and <i>LVITEM</i> refers to the managed class. </li>
  <li>This class is marked with <i>[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]</i>,<i> </i>which indicates that the fields are placed in memory in the order you specify. These items have the same size as the fields in the unmanaged <i>LVITEM</i> structure.</li>
</ul>



<p><a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a> accesses the list view control. <i>InsertItem</i> simply initializes an <i>LVITEM</i> object and calls <i>SendMessage</i>. The <i>ListView</i> class uses the <i>lParam</i> member to hold a unique ID to identify the item. To generate this ID, I need to use the same mechanism as the <i>ListView</i> class uses. It does this with a private method called <i>GenerateUniqueID</i>. Because this is private, I use reflection to access it from the base class. When the item is added to the control, I also add it to the private <i>Hashtable</i> in the base class called <i>listItemsTable</i> and update a field that holds the number of items. I don't like using reflection like this, but there is no other way to get access to private members.</p>

<p>The <i>Items</i> collection of the <i>ListView</i> class is based on a <i>Hashtable</i> of <i>ListViewItem</i> objects, each containing information about the item in the control including its display ID and the unique ID assigned to the item. These values are stored in private fields in <i>ListViewItem</i> and are assigned using the private method <i>Host</i>. The <i>UpdateItem</i> method uses reflection to call this method.  </p>

<p><a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a> is the remaining code. <i>InsertIndented</i> is the public method used to insert items into the list view control. First, it checks to see if the control has been created. If not, then the information is stored in the <i>operations</i> container; otherwise, <i>InsertItem</i> is called. The implementation of <i>OnHandleCreated</i> merely checks to see if there are any cached items, and if so, these are inserted using <i>InsertItem</i>. There is one caveat to this method. If you intersperse calls to <i>InsertIndented</i> with calls to <i>ListView.Items.Add</i>, then if the operations are cached, the final order of the items in the control will not be preserved. It is prudent to only use <i>InsertIndented</i>. <a name="rl5"></a><a href="#l5">Listing Five</a> shows code that uses this control; the <i>LoadIconFromResources</i> method is not shown&#151;you should implement it to load an icon from a file or obtain one from the application's resources.</p>

<p>A fair amount of code had to be written to let you add a simple functionality. Most of this code was required to let you bypass the existing mechanism to insert items into the control, while still allowing the existing functions to continue to work. It's a pity that Microsoft did not add this functionality to the <i>ListView</i> class.</p>
<h3>Application Contexts</h3>

<p><a name="rl5"></a><a href="#l5">Listing Five</a> shows the standard way to create a form: Pass a new instance of the form object to the <i>Application.Run</i> method. I mentioned earlier that the form's window is not created until the <i>Visible</i> property is set to True, so where does this happen? This is one of the responsibilities of the <i>Run</i> method, although this method does a lot more. Every Windows application needs a "message pump." In its simplest form, this calls the Win32 <i>GetMessage</i> function to retrieve the next message in the thread's message queue, then calls <i>DispatchMessage</i> to call the window procedure of the window that the message is intended for. Notice that I said the thread's message queue. Message queues, and hence windows, have thread affinity. If a window is created on a specific thread, then its messages will be sent to the message queue for that thread.</p>

<p>The application's main thread (or indeed, any thread with <i>Thread.IsBackground</i> set to <i>false</i>) will keep the application alive. If the main thread dies, so will the application's process. Similarly, if the thread keeps alive then, so will the process. However, windows have a different lifetime mechanism. Windows that have a caption bar have an adornment (the "X" button), and if users click this they expect the window to close. If the application has just one window, users expect closing this window to kill the application's process. Win32 developers handle this by implementing the message pump as a loop that breaks if <i>GetMessage</i> returns <i>false</i>. This happens if <i>GetMessage</i> reads the <i>WM_QUIT</i> message from the message queue. Consequently, you control the application's lifetime by posting this message to the main thread's message queue.</p>

<p><i>Application.Run</i> is called on the main thread, and it implements the message pump. This means that the main thread is kept alive, handling the pump and dispatching messages to the various windows in the application. When this method stops reading messages and returns, the main thread dies and the application's process dies. However, this does bring up the question of how the message pump loop is broken. The answer lies in application contexts.</p>

<p>The <i>Application</i> class lets you register a main form for the thread where <i>Application.Run</i> is called. If you look at the documentation for this class, you'll see that all the members are static, which raises the question of where this information is held. <i>Application</i> has a nested class called <i>ThreadContext</i> and instances of this class are held in thread local storage; that is, each thread has a different instance. When you call <i>Application.Run</i>, the current thread's <i>ThreadContext</i> object is obtained.</p>

<p>The <i>Application</i> class has the method <i>ExitThread,</i> which a form could use to close down the message pump. <a name="rl6"></a><a href="#l6">Listing Six</a> is a simple forms application that creates a form, makes it visible, and calls <i>Application.Run</i> with no parameters. The call to <i>Run</i> provides the message pump, which is stopped with a call to <i>ExitThread</i> in the <i>Closed</i> event handler. If you comment out this line and run this application, you see that clicking on the X adornment box closes the window. However, if you run Task Manager, you see that the process continues to run; without a window, you'll have to use Task Manager to close this process.</p>

<p>The version of <i>Run</i> that you usually call is the overload that takes a <i>Form</i> object. However, all this does is wrap the <i>Form</i> object in an <i>ApplicationContext</i> object and pass it to another overload of the <i>Run</i> method, which starts up the message pump. The <i>ApplicationContext</i> class is used as a bridge between a form and the implementation of the message pump, so that if the message pump ends, the main form closes, and if the main form closes, the message loop dies. </p>

<p>The message pump is on the <i>ThreadContext</i> object for the current thread (a method called <i>RunMessageLoopInner</i>). In addition, the <i>ApplicationContext</i> and its <i>MainForm</i> are cached as fields in the <i>ThreadContext</i>. When the message pump loop finishes, <i>Dispose</i> is called on the <i>ThreadContext</i> object, which enumerates all the windows created on the current thread and then disposes each one. This means that when the message pump ends, the forms are allowed to clean up their resources. </p>

<p>The other requirement is that if the form closes, then the message loop should be stopped. The <i>ApplicationContext</i> object has a method called <i>OnMainFormDestroy,</i> which is added to the form's <i>HandleDestroyed</i> event when the context object's <i>MainForm</i> property is set in the constructor. This event is the last one raised when a form window is destroyed; at this point, the form object is alive. <i>OnMainFormDestroy</i> calls <i>ExitThread</i>, which stops the message pump. Again, when the message pump loop finishes, all the forms created on the thread are disposed, and their <i>Dispose</i> methods are called to clean up the components they hold.</p>

<p>The first thing that <i>ExitThread</i> does is obtain the thread's <i>ThreadContext</i> object, then it tests to see if there is a context object. If so, <i>Dispose</i> is called on this object. <i>ApplicationContext.Dispose</i> merely releases the reference for the main form (if it has a reference) so that there is one less reference to prevent the form from being finalized. If there is no application context object, then the thread context object is disposed and if there are no messages in the message queue, then all the windows created on the thread are disposed as mentioned earlier. If there are messages in the message queue, the message pump should handle those messages, but no more, so <i>ThreadContext.Dispose</i> provides an asynchronous shutdown mechanism. It works like this: <i>Dispose</i> posts the custom message <i>MSG_APPQUIT</i> (an operation that does not block) to the thread's message queue. The message pump is still active at this point and so after it has handled all the other messages in the queue, the <i>MSG_APPQUIT</i> message is handled by disposing all the thread's windows, then posting the <i>WM_QUIT</i> message, which will finally end the loop. </p>

<p>As you can see, the mechanism to close down the message loop and handle windows disposal is ordered, and much of the code is similar to the code that you'll see in a Win32 application.</p>
<h3>Threading</h3>

<p>The final issue I want to mention is threading. The messages for a window are placed in the message queue for the thread that created the window, so if you interact with a control, you must do this on the GUI thread. On the other hand, the GUI thread (usually the main thread) spends all of its time pumping the message queue. When a message is retrieved, it is dispatched to the windows procedure for the appropriate window. The actual windows procedure is registered to be a method called <i>WndProc</i> in a class called <i>ControlNativeWindow</i>, a nested class in <i>Control</i>. This method does little processing and passes the message onto the <i>WndProc</i> method defined for the .NET control. This method, and the method it overrides in the control's base class, is effectively a huge switch statement that handles individual messages by raising events, just like any Win32 process. </p>

<p>To generate events, the control usually has a method with the prefix <i>On</i> (for example, <i>OnResize</i>), which obtains the delegate for the event (for example, <i>Resize</i>) and invokes it. You can handle the message either by overriding the <i>On</i> method or by adding a delegate to the event. If you override the <i>On</i> method, you must make sure that you call the base class implementation so that the event delegate is still invoked. The important point is that the thread that pumps the message queue is the same thread that runs the <i>WndProc</i>, which is the same thread that invokes the event delegate. So if your event handlers are lengthy, then you are preventing the pumping of the message queue, which means that messages intended to update the UI are not handled in a timely fashion. It makes sense to execute lengthy operations on another thread. </p>

<p>However, when an operation interacts with the UI, it does so by generating messages, and as I have already mentioned those messages must be sent and handled on the correct thread. Windows Forms provides a mechanism to do this. The <i>Control</i> class implements an interface called <i>ISynchronizedInvoke</i> with three methods and a property. The <i>InvokeRequired</i> property indicates whether the control is thread safe. If you try to access it from another thread, you should use <i>Invoke. Invoke</i> is passed a delegate and an array of arguments; the delegate is the code that you want to be invoked on the GUI thread. In effect, this method checks to see if the current thread is the GUI thread. If it is, no marshaling is required and the delegate is invoked straight away. If the thread is not the GUI thread, then the delegate and parameters are put into a separate "job" object and added to a queue maintained by the control. The GUI thread is then informed by posting a custom message to its message queue. The handler for this message reads all the job objects in the control's queue and invokes the delegate on each one. </p>

<p>The other two methods on the interface are <i>BeginInvoke</i> and <i>EndInvoke</i>, which let you invoke the delegate synchronously. Of course, the whole point about <i>Invoke</i> is that the delegate is invoked on another thread, and the difference between this and the asynchronous methods is that <i>Invoke</i> blocks until the delegate has completed, whereas <i>BeginInvoke</i> returns as soon as the message is posted to the GUI thread and provides a call object that you can test for completion of the invocation. This only makes a difference if the delegate returns a value, in which case you should call <i>EndInvoke</i> to retrieve the data at a later time.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>To effectively use Windows Forms, you need to have an understanding of how Win32 windowing works. Merely knowing the mechanics of Windows Forms is not enough. To be able to use the library effectively and to prevent you from writing code that could have serious effects on the responsiveness of your user interface, you have to know and apply Win32 windowing principles.</p>
