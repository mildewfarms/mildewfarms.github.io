<p>The latest version of the NAG Fortran Library includes over 300 new functions, taking the total number of routines in Mark 21 to 1500. New functions include a chapter covering mesh generation that incorporates routines for generating 2D meshes together with a number of associated utility routines. Extensions have been included in the areas of zeros of polynomials, partial differential equations, eigenvalue problems (LAPACK), sparse linear algebra, and a significant expansion of the G05 (Random Number Generation) function. </p>

<p>Coverity Prevent and Coverity Extend are designed to improve software quality&#151;reducing or eliminating computer system crashes, security vulnerabilities, and performance degradation&#151;by discovering defects in software code during development. Coverity Prevent provides automatic analysis while Coverity Extend supports creation and enforcement of custom coding rules. Both tools work with source code written in C or C++ for FreeBSD, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, or Windows. The tools are an upgrade to the older Coverity SWAT solution. </p>

<p>A Fixed-Point Toolbox is available from The MathWorks, bringing fixed-point design capabilities to MATLAB. The Fixed-Point Toolbox lets you develop fixed-point algorithms using bit-true arithmetic and logical operations with word lengths ranging from 2 to 65,535 bits. Paired with Simulink Fixed Point, the Fixed-Point Toolbox can create test benches in MATLAB for bit-true testing of fixed-point Simulink models. The new toolbox also enables input and output of fixed-point data types from Simulink models.</p>

<p>Aonix has optimized performance in its 4.2 version of PERC, a clean room virtual machine that was created to manage the complexity of large, dynamic real-time systems. By improving class-loading technology, Aonix has boosted PERC's performance on representative benchmarks by up to 30 percent. PERC 4.2 also adds support for the GNU Classpath implementation of AWT graphics libraries, providing a complement to the Eclipse SWT graphical library support.</p>

<p>The Flash Edition of Xamlon Pro lets you write Flash applications in XAML, Microsoft's XML-based markup language, rather than being limited to Macromedia's ActionScript. In addition to offering XAML for simplified development, Xamlon Pro, Flash Edition lets you program back-end logic with any .NET language, including Visual Basic.NET, C#, C++, or JScript. Although .NET languages are used for the application logic, the .NET runtime is not required; deployed applications only require the Flash runtime on the client. </p>
