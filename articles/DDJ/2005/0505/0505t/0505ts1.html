<h2>Solution to Last Month's Dr. Ecco </h2>
<h3>Solution to "Jam Session," DDJ, April 2005.</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>1. </b>We represent the 6 data bits followed by 4 check bits as follows: <br>
b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 c1 c2 c3 c4<br>
Here is one possibility of what the check bits could do:<br>
 c1 is odd parity on b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, c1, c4<br>
 c2 is odd parity on b1, b2, b3, b4, c3, c2<br>
 c3 is odd parity on b1, b2, c1, c3, c4<br>
 c4 is odd parity on b1, b5, b4, c4<br>
The trick is to locate the parity tests that don't work if any bit has been flipped and to make sure these are all different. If all the parities are correct, then no single bit has been flipped. If there is an error in <i>b</i>1, then the parities corresponding to <i>c</i>1, <i>c</i>2, <i>c</i>3, and <i>c</i>4 will all be bad.<br>
Error in b2, then c1, c2, and c3 will be bad.<br>
b3: c1, c2.<br>
b4: c1, c2, c4.<br>
b5: c1, c4.<br>
b6: c1<br>
c1: c1, c3<br>
c2: c2<br>
c3: c2, c3<br>
c4: c3, c4.<br>
<b></b><br>
2. If you know the offset between the bit flip to the first receiver and to the second is an odd number, then you can use:<br>
b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, Podd, Peven<br>
where <i>Podd</i> ensures that there are an odd number of 1s among <i>b</i>1, <i>b</i>3, <i>b</i>5, <i>b</i>7, <i>Podd</i> and <i>Peven</i> ensures that there are an odd number of 1s among <i>b</i>2, <i>b</i>4, <i>b</i>6, <i>b</i>8, and <i>Peven</i>. Here is why this works: If no error is detected, then the data bits are correct. If the first receiver detects an error, say for <i>Podd</i>, then the second can detect an error only for <i>Peven</i> because of the odd offset. Therefore, one of the two receivers will receive an error-free <i>Podd</i> group and and an error-free <i>Peven</i> group.<br>
<b></b><br>
3. If you know the offset is 4 bits, then Ivan Rezanka showed how 3 check bits are enough. First note that with an offset of 4, the bits that could flip are bit 1 for the first receiver and bit 5 for the second&#151;denoted (1,5)&#151;or (2,6), (3,7), (4,8), (5,9), (6, 10), (7,1), (8,2), (9,3), or (10,4).<br>
Here is a three check bit solution:<br>
 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 c1 c2 c3<br>
 c1 is odd parity on b1, b4, b6, b7<br>
 c2 is odd parity on b2, b4, b5, b7<br>
 c3 is odd parity on b3, b4, b5, b6<br>
If all parity bits check out for either receiver, we are done. If some pair changes, we detect as follows: If bit 1 to the first receiver and bit 5 to the second is flipped then <i>c</i>1 for the first receiver and <i>c</i>2 for the second will be incorrect. We denote this by (<i>c</i>1, <i>c</i>2). Note that when merging these two signals, the reconstructor must recognize this ordering. So, we abbreviate this first situation as follows:<br>
(1,5)  -- (c1, c2, and c3)<br>
and continue as follows:<br>
(2,6)  -- (c2, c1 and c3)<br>
(3,7)  -- (c3, c1 and c2)<br>
(4,8)  -- (c1 and c2 and c3, c1)<br>
(5,9)  -- (c2 and c3, c2)<br>
(6,10) -- (c3, c3)<br>
(7,1)  -- (c1 and c2, c1)<br>
(8,2)  -- (c1, c2)<br>
(9,3)  -- (c2, c3)<br>
(10,4) -- (c3, c1 and c2 and c3)<br>
Note that each diagnostic is different.<br>
