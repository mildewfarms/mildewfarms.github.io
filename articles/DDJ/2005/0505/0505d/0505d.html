<p>When developing the Top Secret Journal procedure for my Top Secret Crypto Gold communications and file-encryption program, I wanted to display the contents of the journal in a tree-view control that users could use to select and display a specific page of the journal. I needed it sorted by two major categories&#151;By Date and By Keyword. Within each major category, I needed it sorted by keywords and then by dates within keywords. Each journal page would have one entry in the By Date category, and up to six entries under the By Keyword category; see <a name="rf1"></a><a href="0505df1.html">Figures 1</a> and <a name="rf2"></a><a href="0505df2.html">2</a>.</p>

<p>To do this, I create an index file each time a journal is opened, with one entry for each journal page under the By Date category, and up to six entries for each journal page in the By Keyword category. All By Date category entries have their <i>KeyWord</i> entry set to the single character <i>A</i> for sorting purposes. Each journal page has six <i>KeyWord</i> entries that you can enter when the page is created or edited, so you can group pages with similar content together in the tree-view control. I then have to sort it on three different fields to get it into the order required to create the entries for the tree-view control. Looking at the index file structure (<a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a>), I have to sort on the <i>Type_Entry</i> field, which is a word value, then on the <i>KeyWord</i> field, which is a null-terminated string, and finally on the <i>dwCreated</i> field, which consists of two <i>dwords</i>, most significant <i>dword</i> followed by least significant <i>dword</i>. (The <i>dwCreated</i> field contains the date and time the journal page was created as the number of seconds since midnight 1 January 1970, which makes it easy to sort.)</p>

<p>I chose to use the shell sort algorithm and modify it to suit my needs because overall, it usually turns in the best times for worst and average cases, with the worst case beating the average case for sorting time. I also needed to modify the algorithm to sort on <i>byte</i>, <i>word</i>, or <i>dword</i> arrays, and null-terminated strings, and on a single signed <i>byte</i>, <i>word</i>, or <i>dword</i>. And finally, I wanted to be able to sort in ascending or descending order, and forward or backward within a field. To accomplish all of this, the basic shell sort algorithm proved easily modifiable to accomplish the task.</p>
<h3>Shell Sort Template Structure</h3>

<p>To provide a template for the modified shell sort algorithm to follow, I created a shell sort template structure (<a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a>) to instruct the shell sort algorithm how to sort the data. The first item in the structure is <i>TYPE_SORT</i>, which can be set to <i>SORT_BYTES, SORT_WORDS, SORT_DWORDS</i> for unsigned data; <i>SORT_STRINGS</i> for null-terminated strings; and <i>SORT_SBYTES, SORT_SWORDS,</i> and <i>SORT_SDWORDS</i> for signed data. Sorting signed data is limited to a single byte, word, or dword in a field; otherwise, it will not sort properly. The second item in the structure is <i>COMPARE_DIRECTION</i>, which can be set to <i>FORWARD</i> or <i>BACKWARD</i> and that lets you compare from the low-to-the-high address in a field or the high-to-the-low address. The third item in the structure is <i>RECORD_SIZE</i>, which holds the size of each record to sort. The fourth item in the structure is <i>COMPARE_SIZE</i>. If the field you want to compare is 1 byte long, or one word long, or one dword long, set <i>COMPARE_SIZE</i> to 1. If you have a 30-byte field to compare, set it to 30. If you have a two-word field to compare, set it to 2; if you have a four-dword field to compare, set it to 4. The fifth field in the structure is <i>COMPARE_OFFSET</i>. This is the zero-based offset of the start of the field within the record size you want to compare. If you are comparing the field in the <i>FORWARD</i> direction, this is the zero-based offset of the first byte, word, dword, or string within the record. If you are comparing the field in the <i>BACKWARD</i> direction, this is the offset to the last byte, word, or dword in the field. You cannot compare null-terminated strings in the backward direction. (Refer to Sort.h, available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 5.)</p>

<p>Because I want to sort my index file on three different fields, I extend the shell sort template structure to accommodate three different sort fields. The final item in the structure is the <i>END_MARKER</i> that must be set to <i>SORT_END (-1)</i>. This informs the sort algorithm that there are no more fields to sort on. If you have different sorting tasks within a program that call for only one or two fields to be sorted, you can place the end marker in any <i>TYPE_SORT</i> item, which informs the sort algorithm that there are no more fields to sort on. You can extend this structure to accommodate any number of fields. </p>

<p>Filling in a sort template structure is easy. Following the structure of the journal index file (<a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a>), I set up a sort template for each of the three fields I want to sort on using the shell sort template structure (<a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a>). The first field to sort on is the <i>TYPE_ENTRY</i> field. Since the type of this field is a word, <i>TYPE_SORT</i> is set to <i>SORT_WORDS</i>, <i>COMPARE_DIRECTION</i> is set to <i>FORWARD</i>, <i>RECORD_SIZE</i> is set to <i>sizeof(DIARYENTRY</i>), <i>COMPARE_SIZE</i> is set to 1, and <i>COMPARE_OFFSET</i> is set to 38 (<a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>).</p>

<p>The second field to sort on is <i>KeyWord,</i> which is a null-terminated string up to 130 bytes long. Because of this, <i>TYPE_SORT</i> is set to<i> SORT_STRINGS, COMPARE_DIRECTION</i> is set to<i> FORWARD, RECORD_SIZE </i>remains at <i>sizeof(DIARYENTRY</i>), <i>COMPARE_SIZE</i> is set to 130, and <i>COMPARE_OFFSET</i> is set to 40. I know the size of the <i>KeyWord</i> field is 132, but I leave myself a little bit of wiggle room.</p>

<p>The third field to sort on is <i>dwCreated</i>, which contains the date and time the journal entry was created as a 64-bit value in two <i>dwords</i>, the most significant <i>dword</i> first. In the sort template structure <i>TYPE_SORT</i> is set to <i>SORT_DWORDS</i>, <i>COMPARE_DIRECTION</i> is set to <i>FORWARD</i>, <i>RECORD_SIZE</i> remains at <i>sizeof(DIARYENTRY</i>), <i>COMPARE_SIZE</i> is set to 2, and <i>COMPARE_OFFSET</i> is set to 172.</p>

<p>The <i>END_MARKER</i> in the sort template structure is set to <i>SORT_END</i>, which tells the sort algorithm that there are no more fields to sort on. </p>
<h3>Shell Sort Algorithm</h3>

<p>Most of the shell sort algorithm is written in 80x86 assembly language for 80386 or better processors. The rest is written in Microsoft Visual C 6.0 using Windows API functions for the Win32 environment. Most of the Windows API functions can be converted to Standard C functions to make the sort algorithm more generic. </p>

<p>For the sort algorithm to sort the KeyWord strings in any language, thereby displaying the sorted key words in the proper order according to the sort criteria for each language, I chose to use the Windows API <i>CompareString</i> function with the locale set to <i>LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT</i> and <i>dwCmpFlags</i> set to <i>NORM_IGNORECASE</i>.</p>

<p>The one Windows API function that would be hard to replace is the <i>CompareString</i> function. I say this because, to sort strings for any language, you need a locale that specifies how strings in the user's language are sorted. The <i>CompareString</i> function gives you this, while the Standard C runtime library <i>compare</i> function does not.</p>

<p>I follow the standard shell sort algorithm by dividing the list into two partitions of equal size, comparing each element in the first partition with the corresponding element in the second, and swapping them if necessary. I then divide each of these partitions into two partitions and proceed as above. When the partition size reaches zero, the sort is completed.</p>

<p>What I have added to the shell sort algorithm is the ability to sort on different types of fields, and to sort on more than one field in a single call to the sort procedure. In the heart of the sort procedure I have included a <i>while (True)</i> loop where all of this is accomplished (<a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a>). (See Sort.c, available electronically.)</p>

<p>At the beginning of the <i>while (True) </i>loop, I set up the address of the shell sort template structure in <i>edx</i>, and the offset to the current sort field in the shell sort structure in <i>ebx.</i> The addresses for the two records in the partitions are then placed in <i>esi</i> and <i>edi</i>. The compare offset for the field we want to sort within the record is then added to <i>esi</i> and <i>edi</i>, then these addresses are placed in temporary storage locations. The size of the field we are comparing is then placed in <i>ecx</i>. I then determine if we are sorting a signed field by testing bit 7 of <i>TYPE_SORT</i> in the sort template structure. I use the <i>btr</i> instruction, which copies the bit to the carry flag and resets (clears) the bit in <i>TYPE_SORT</i>. It is necessary to clear this bit so you can easily determine the type of field you are sorting on&#151;bytes, words, dwords, or strings. I then set the signed flag using the setc instruction, which sets it to 1 if the carry bit is set, and 0 if not.</p>

<p>Next, I determine the direction to sort the field in by testing the value in <i>COMPARE_DIRECTION</i>. If the direction to compare is <i>BACKWARD</i>, I use the <i>std</i> instruction to set the direction flag so all subsequent string instructions will process down, from high addresses to low addresses. I then test <i>TYPE_SORT</i> to determine the type of field I am sorting&#151;bytes, words, dwords, or strings. If I am sorting bytes, words, or dwords, I use the standard <i>rep cmpsb</i>, <i>rep cmpsw</i>, or <i>rep cmpsd</i> instructions to compare the fields. Once the comparison is complete, I reset the direction flag using the <i>cld</i> instruction, which places the processor back in its default mode of processing subsequent string instructions up, from low addresses to high addresses. The result of the comparison is then stored in the two temporary variables <i>Above</i> and <i>Below, </i>respectively. If the comparison was performed on unsigned fields, I use the <i>seta</i> and <i>setb</i> instructions; if on signed fields, I use the <i>setg</i> and <i>setl</i> instructions and bit 7 is set in the <i>TYPE_SORT</i> field using the <i>bts</i> instruction for the next comparison.</p>

<p>If the sorting is performed on null-terminated strings, all of the registers are first saved on the stack using the <i>pushad</i> instruction. The <i>CompareString</i> Windows API function is used with the locale set to <i>LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT</i> and <i>dwCmpFlags</i> set to <i>NORM_IGNORECASE</i>, which tells the function to ignore the case of the letters when sorting. The character count variable for each string to compare is set to -1, which tells the function to treat the strings as null terminated, and the length of each string is calculated automatically. The <i>Above</i> and <i>Below</i> variables are then set as determined by the outcome of the comparison, and all of the registers are restored from the stack using the <i>popad</i> instruction.</p>

<p>If the compared items are not equal, the procedure jumps out of the loop to determine if they should be swapped. If the compared items are equal, a check is made to see if there are any more fields to compare. This is done by adding 20 to the <i>ebx</i> register, which is the length of one set of sort parameters in the sort template structure. If the start of the next set of sort parameters contains <i>END_SORT</i>, there are no more fields to sort on; therefore, the function jumps out of the loop to determine if the items should be swapped, which they will not be because they are equal. If it does not contain <i>END_SORT</i>, we have another field to sort on. The sort function then returns to the start of the loop and sets up and compares the next field in the two records. This allows the procedure to sort a set of records on any number of fields you want.</p>

<p>For example, if you had a large data base of customers and you want to sort them by zip code, telephone area code, last name, first name, and middle initial in that order, all you have to do is set up the sort template structure for these five fields and call the sort procedure to sort them. One call is all it takes.</p>

<p>To sort a file, you make a call to the <i>SortMyFile</i> function and supply a pointer to the name of the file, a handle to the opened file, the number of bytes (if any) in the file header, a pointer to the sort template structure, and the direction you want to sort the data in, either <i>ASCENDING</i> or <i>DESCENDING</i>. An example of the call for sorting my journal index file is: </p>

<blockquote>
SortMyFile((LPTSTR)&amp;szIndexTemp,    hIndexTemp,0,&amp;DiarySort,ASCENDING);<br>

</blockquote>

<p>This function determines if you have enough memory to read and sort the file in memory (much faster), or if it will be sorted on disk. The <i>dwHeaderBytes</i> variable lets you tell the sort procedure to ignore the file header when sorting the file. If the file does not have a header, set it to 0. If the file is to be sorted on disk, the <i>SortFileOnDisk </i>function is called. If it is to be sorted in memory, the <i>SortFileInMemory</i> function is called. This function reads the complete file into memory and calls the <i>ShellSort</i> function to sort the data. Once the data is sorted, you return to the <i>SortFileInMemory</i> function and the sorted data is written back to disk.</p>

<p>The <i>ShellSort</i> function can also be called independently if your program needs to sort a table of data that resides solely in memory. (See Sort.c and Support.c; available electronically.)</p>

<p>I have commented out some of the code that contains the error-reporting functions used by my program. I have replaced them with simple MessageBox calls. This allows you to insert your own error procedures as required by the programs you write. This is the reason the <i>SortMyFile</i> function uses the name of the file being sorted. My error procedure displays the name so you will know what file an error occurred on.</p>

<p>Currently, the sort procedure is restricted to handling 4-GB files or less. With the advent of 64-bit computers, it could easily be modified to handle 2<sup>64</sup>-byte files using 64-bit registers. One way around this restriction is the use of index files. While the index files you want to sort would be limited to 4 GB or less, the actual database file it indexes could grow to be much larger.</p>
