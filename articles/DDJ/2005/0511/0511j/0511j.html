<p>The ASP.NET 2.0 <i>TreeView</i> server control is used to display hierarchical data. Consider, for instance, an XML-based threaded discussion forum that uses the XML file in <a name="re1"></a><a href="0511je1.html">Example 1</a>(a) as its underlying data store. You can set the value of the <i>DataFile</i> property of an <i>XmlDataSource</i> control to the path of the XML file (data.xml, for instance) to load the entire XML file into memory and use a <i>TreeView</i> control to display the contents of the file, as in <a name="re1"></a><a href="0511je1.html">Example 1</a>(b). Loading the entire XML file into memory would not be practical in threaded discussion forums that contain thousands of messages. It would waste server resources if the server were to load all the messages for each user request. </p>

<p>One of the important features of the <i>TreeView</i> server control is that it lets page developers load data on demand where the child nodes of a given node are not loaded and displayed until users expand the node. For this to work, you must perform these tasks:</p>



<ol>
  <li>Statically add a <i>TreeNode</i> instance to the <i>Nodes</i> property of the <i>TreeView</i> control and set its <i>Text</i>, <i>Value</i>, and <i>PopulateOnDemand</i> properties. The <i>TreeNode</i> instance is used to display the root node of the <i>TreeView</i>. In the case of a threaded discussion forum, <a name="re2"></a><a href="0511je2.html">Example 2</a> is required.</li>
  <li>Register a method, for example, <i>TreeView1_OnTreeNodePopulate</i>, which is called when users expand a node. </li>
  <li>The method must extract the required data from the underlying data store, create instances of the <i>TreeNode</i> class, and set the <i>Text</i>, <i>Value</i>, and <i>PopulateOnDemand</i> properties of the instances.</li>
</ol>



<p>In short, you must do a fair amount of coding to take advantage of the <i>TreeView</i> control's on-demand loading feature. This goes against an important feature of ASP.NET 2.0 in which you must be allowed to declaratively use the ASP.NET 2.0 server controls without writing a single line of code!</p>

<p>In this article, I implement <i>CustomTreeView</i>, a server control derived from the ASP.NET 2.0 <i>TreeView</i> server control. <i>CustomTreeView</i> lets you use the on-demand feature without writing a single line of code. It automatically takes care of all the steps without any coding on your part. The complete source code is available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 4. Note that I used Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition beta to develop the sample application.</p>
<h3>OnTreeNodePopulate Method</h3>

<p>The <i>TreeView</i> control exposes an event of type <i>TreeNodeEventHandler</i> named <i>TreeNodePopulate</i>. The event is raised when users expand a node whose <i>PopulateOnDemand</i> property is set to True. The <i>TreeNodeEventArgs</i> class is used to hold the event data. The class exposes an important property of type <i>TreeNode</i> named <i>Node</i> that points to the node that raises the <i>TreeNodePopulate</i> event.</p>

<p>The <i>TreeView</i> control also exposes a protected method named <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> that is used to raise the <i>TreeNodePopulate</i> event. The <i>CustomTreeView</i> control overrides the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method (see CustomTreeView.cs, available electronically, see "Resource Center," page 4). The <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method saves the reference to the <i>Node</i> property value in the <i>currentNode</i> field for future references. The main responsibility of the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method of <i>CustomTreeView</i> is to perform these tasks:</p>



<ol>
  <li>Extract the required data from the underlying data store.</li>
  <li>Enumerate the data and create an instance of the <i>TreeNode</i> class for each enumerated object.</li>
  <li>Use the extracted data to set the value of the <i>Text</i> property of each <i>TreeNode</i> instance. The <i>CustomTreeView</i> control exposes a property named <i>TextField</i> that you must set to the appropriate value. </li>
  <li>Use the extracted data to set the value of the <i>Value</i> property of each <i>TreeNode</i> instance. The <i>CustomTreeView</i> control exposes a property named <i>ValueField</i> that you must set to the appropriate value. </li>
  <li>Set the value of the <i>PopulateOnDemand</i> property of each <i>TreeNode</i> instance to True.</li>
</ol>



<p>The main challenge is to extract the data from the underlying data store. This is a challenge because in a data-driven web-application, data comes from a variety of sources including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, XML documents, and flat files, to name a few. This means that you cannot use the same data access code to access different types of data stores. For instance, you have to use <i>System.Xml</i> classes such as <i>XmlDocument</i> and <i>XPathDocument</i> to access XML documents. However, you cannot use the same <i>System.Xml</i> classes to access relational databases such as Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle. For that you have to use ADO.NET classes such as <i>SqlCommand</i> or <i>OracleCommand</i>. This is where the ASP.NET 2.0 data source control model comes to the rescue. The <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method uses the ASP.NET 2.0 data source control model to load the data from the underlying data store.</p>
<h3>ASP.NET 2.0 Data Source Control Model</h3>

<p>The ASP.NET 2.0 data source control model isolates the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method from the underlying data store and presents the method with the appropriate view of the data store. The model consists of new server controls collectively known as "data source controls." ASP.NET 2.0 comes with several types of data source controls: <i>SqlDataSource, AccessDataSource, ObjectDataSource, XmlDataSource</i>, and <i>SiteMapDataSource</i>. </p>

<p>Every data source control could present both tabular and hierarchical views of its underlying data store. Currently, only the <i>XmlDataS</i>ource and <i>SiteMapDataSource</i> controls present both types of view. All other data source controls (<i>SqlDataSource, AccessDataSource</i>, and <i>ObjectDataSource</i>) only present tabular views.</p>

<p>Each data source control is specifically designed to extract tabular or hierarchical data from a specific type of data store. For instance, the <i>SqlDataSource</i> is specifically designed to extract tabular data from relational databases such as Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle.</p>

<p>If the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method were to use a specific type of data source control (such as <i>SqlDataSource</i>) to access the underlying data store, the method would be tied to the data store that the data source control is specifically designed to work with and could not be used to access other types of data stores.</p>

<p>If the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method must not use a specific type of data source control such as <i>SqlDataSource</i>, what else could the method use to access the underlying data store? The answer lies in the fact that all tabular and hierarchical data source controls implement the <i>IDataSource</i> and <i>IHierarchicalDataSource</i> interfaces, respectively. </p>

<p>This lets the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method treat all types of tabular or hierarchical data source controls the same. As far as the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method is concerned all tabular and hierarchical data source controls are of type <i>IDataSource</i> and <i>IHierarchicalDataSource</i>, respectively.</p>

<p>Therefore, the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method can simply use the methods of the <i>IDataSource</i> or <i>IHierarchicalDataSource</i> interface to deal with all types of data source controls without knowing the real type of the data source being used; for example, whether it is a <i>SqlDataSource</i> or <i>XmlDataSource</i> control.</p>

<p>However, this raises a new problem. If the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method does not know the real type of the data source control, how can it then instantiate the data source control? The answer lies in the fact that all data source controls also derive from the <i>Control</i> class, where they inherit these two important features:</p>



<ul>
  <li>The <i>Control</i> class provides two mechanisms for data source controls to save and restore their property values across page post backs. The first mechanism provides data source controls with a <i>StateBag</i> collection object named <i>ViewState</i> to save and restore the values of their simple properties. The second mechanism provides data source controls with three methods named <i>TrackViewState, LoadViewState, </i>and <i>SaveViewState</i> that subclasses can override to save and restore the values of their complex properties.</li>
  <li>The <i>Control</i> class lets you declaratively add data source controls to the respective .aspx page without writing a single line of code. The ASP.NET runtime automatically parses the .aspx page, dynamically creates instances of the declared data source controls, and adds the instances to the control tree of the containing page. </li>
</ul>



<p>Because the underlying data source control is automatically added to the control tree of the containing page, the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method simply uses the <i>FindControl</i> method of the containing page to access the data source control without knowing the real type of the data source control; for example, whether it is a <i>SqlDataSource</i> or <i>XmlDataSource</i> control:</p>

<blockquote>
Control c = Page.FindControl<br>
          (treeNodePopulateDataSourceID);<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The <i>FindControl</i> method takes the value of the <i>ID</i> property of the data source control as its argument. The <i>CustomTreeView</i> control exposes a property of type string named <i>TreeNodePopulateDataSourceID</i> that you must set to the value of the <i>ID</i> property of the desired data source control.</p>

<p>Therefore, the only dependency between the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method and the underlying data source control is the value of the <i>ID</i> property of the data source control, which is nothing but a string value. </p>

<p>The <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method supports both tabular and hierarchical views. As <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a> shows, the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method typecasts the returned value of the <i>FindControl</i> method to <i>IHierarchicalDataSource</i> or <i>IDataSource</i>. This means that, as far as the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method is concerned, all data source controls are of type <i>IHierarchicalDataSource</i> and/or <i>IDataSource</i>. </p>
<h3>Tabular Data Source Controls</h3>

<p>The <i>IDataSource</i> interface exposes an important method named <i>GetView</i> that takes the name of the tabular view and returns an instance of the <i>DataSourceView</i> class that represents the view. Recall every tabular data source control such as <i>SqlDataSource</i> is specifically designed to expose one or more tabular views of a specific type of data store. The tabular views that a given data source control exposes are instances of a particular class.</p>

<p>For instance, the tabular views that the <i>SqlDataSource</i> and <i>XmlDataSource</i> controls expose are instances of the <i>SqlDataSourceView</i> and <i>XmlDataSourceView</i> classes, respectively. All view classes such as <i>SqlDataSourceView</i> and <i>XmlDataSourceView</i> derive from the <i>DataSourceView</i> abstract base class.</p>

<p>The <i>DataSourceView</i> class exposes all the methods and properties that its subclasses must implement to expose tabular views of their underlying data stores. One of these methods is the <i>Select</i> method.</p>

<p>The <i>OnTreeNodePopulate </i>method calls the <i>Select</i> method of the view object to select the data from the underlying data store. The <i>Select</i> method takes two arguments. The first argument is of type <i>DataSourceSelectArguments</i>. This argument lets the callers request extra operations such as sorting and paging on the query result. The <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method does not need any extra operations.</p>

<p>The second argument of the <i>Select</i> method is a delegate instance of type <i>DataSourceViewSelectCallback</i>. The <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method uses this instance to register the <i>SelectCB</i> method as the callback for the <i>Select</i> method. This is necessary because the <i>Select</i> method is asynchronous.</p>

<p>The <i>Select</i> method extracts the data from the data store, automatically calls the <i>SelectCB</i> method, and passes the data as its argument. The data that is passed to the <i>SelectCB</i> method is of type <i>IEnumerable</i>. The <i>IEnumerable</i> interface exposes a method named <i>GetEnumerator</i> that returns an object of type <i>IEnumerator</i>. The <i>SelectCB</i> method then uses the <i>IEnumerator</i> object to enumerate the records and creates an instance of the <i>TreeNode</i> class to display each record. However, a record is a collection of fields. Therefore, you need a way to specify which field of a given record to display.  </p>

<p>That is why the <i>CustomTreeView</i> control exposes a property named <i>TextField</i> that you can set to the name of the database field whose value they want to display. The <i>DataBinder</i> class exposes a static method named <i>Eval</i> that uses the .NET Framework reflection to evaluate the value of the specified field of the current record. This value is then assigned to the <i>Text</i> property of the <i>TreeNode</i> object:</p>

<blockquote>
node.Text = (string)DataBinder.Eval<br>
                        (iter.Current, TextField);<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Every record also exposes a primary key field. The <i>CustomTreeView</i> control exposes a property named <i>ValueField</i> that you can use to specify the name of the primary key field. The <i>SelectCB</i> method uses the <i>Eval</i> method of the <i>DataBinder</i> class to evaluate the value of the respective primary key field and stores the value in the <i>Value</i> property of the <i>TreeNode</i> object:</p>

<blockquote>
node.Value = (DataBinder.Eval(iter.Current,<br>
                        ValueField)).ToString();<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The <i>CustomTreeView</i> control also exposes two properties named <i>NavigateUrlFormatString</i> and <i>NavigateUrlField.</i> You must set the value of the <i>NavigateUrlField</i> property to the name of the database field used to calculate the value of the <i>NagivateUrl</i> property of the <i>TreeNode</i> object. You must also set the value of the <i>NavigateUrlFormatString</i> property to the appropriate format string. For instance, consider the values in <a name="re3"></a><a href="0511je3.html">Example 3</a>(a). The <i>SelectCB</i> method uses the expression in <a name="re3"></a><a href="0511je3.html">Example 3</a>(b) to evaluate the value of the <i>NavigateUrl</i> property of the respective <i>TreeNode</i> object. For example, for the record whose <i>MessageID</i> value is 1, the aforementioned expression evaluates to <a name="re3"></a><a href="0511je3.html">Example 3</a>(c). The <i>SelectCB</i> method also sets the <i>PopulateOnDemand</i> property of the <i>TreeNode</i> object to True. This lets users expand the node and display its child nodes on demand. The <i>SelectCB</i> method finally creates an instance of the <i>NodeEventArgs</i> class and calls <i>OnNodeDataBound</i> method to raise the <i>NodeDataBound</i> event.</p>
<h3>Hierarchical Data Source Controls</h3>

<p>The <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method also supports hierarchical data source controls such as <i>XmlDataSource</i>. Hierarchical data source controls expose hierarchical views of their underlying data store whether or not the data store itself is hierarchical. Again, all hierarchical data source controls implement the <i>IHierarchicalDataSource</i> interface. The <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method calls the <i>GetHierarchicalView</i> method of the <i>IHierarchicalDataSource</i> interface and passes the view path as its argument:</p>

<blockquote>
HierarchicalDataSourceView hdv = <br>
   hds.GetHierarchicalView(e.Node.Value);<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Notice the <i>Value</i> property of the <i>TreeNode</i> object exposes the hierarchical path of the <i>TreeNode</i> object. The <i>HierarchicalDataSourceView</i> class is the base class of all hierarchical view classes. For instance, the hierarchical views that the <i>XmlDataSource</i> control exposes are all instances of the <i>XmlHierarchicalDataSourceView</i> class, which is the subclass of the <i>HierarchicalDataSourceView</i> class.</p>

<p>The <i>HierarchicalDataSourceView</i> class exposes all the methods and properties that its subclasses need to implement in order to expose hierarchical views of their underlying data stores. The <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method calls the <i>Select</i> method of the <i>HierarchicalDataSourceView</i> class to extract the data from the underlying data store. The <i>Select</i> method returns an object of type <i>IHierarchicalEnumerable</i>. The <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method then calls the <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method and passes the <i>IHierarchicalEnumerable</i> object as its argument.</p>

<p>Because the <i>IHierarchicalEnumerable</i> interface implements the <i>IEnumerable</i> interface, it exposes a method named <i>GetEnumerator</i>. The <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method calls the method to access the <i>IEnumerator</i> object and uses the object to enumerate the hierarchical nodes of the extracted data. The <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method uses an instance of the <i>TreeNode</i> class to display each enumerated hierarchical node.</p>

<p>The <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method then calls the <i>GetHierarchyData</i> method of the <i>IHierarchicalEnumerable</i> interface to access the <i>IHierarchyData</i> object that encapsulates the actual enumerated object. The <i>IHierarchyData</i> interface exposes a property named <i>Item</i> that refers to the actual encapsulated enumerated object, which is normally an instance of a class that implements the <i>IXPathNavigable</i> interface. For instance, if the underlying hierarchical data source control is an <i>XmlDataSource</i> control, the value of the <i>Item</i> property will be an object of type <i>XmlElement</i>, which implements the <i>IXPathNavigable</i> interface. The great thing about the <i>IXPathNavigable</i> interface is that it exposes a method named <i>CreateNavigator,</i> which returns an object of type <i>XPathNavigator</i>. The <i>XPathNavigator</i> class is the .NET implementation of the XPath technology. </p>

<p>The XPath technology uses the hierarchical path of a given node to locate the node in an in-memory tree representation.  The hierarchical path of a node is a collection of what is known as "location steps." Every location step takes us from the node we are currently at to the next node. A location step consists of three parts&#151;axis, node test, and predicate. </p>

<p>You can think of the axis as the traversal direction. The <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method uses the child node as the axis. This means that you are traversing the tree in the direction of children. Therefore, the axis returns a node set that contains all the child nodes of the current node. The node test selects those nodes from the node set that satisfy the node test. The <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method uses "*" as the node test. This means that only the element child nodes of the current node are selected. </p>

<p>The predicate further filters the resultant node set. The <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method uses this as the predicate:</p>

<blockquote>
[position()=<br>
  '" + currentNode.ChildNodes.Count + "']<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method uses the count of the child nodes of the current node to determine the position of the underlying current hierarchical node. Therefore, the respective location step is:</p>

<blockquote>
/*[position()=<br>
   '" + currentNode.ChildNodes.Count + '"]<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method concatenates the <i>/*[position()...</i> location step to the hierarchical path of the parent node to arrive at the hierarchical path of the underlying hierarchical node:</p>

<blockquote>
node.Value = <br>
    currentNode.Value + "/*[position()='" + <br>
       currentNode.ChildNodes.Count + '"]";<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Because the enumerated object implements the <i>IXPathNavigable</i> interface, the <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method uses the <i>Eval</i> method of the <i>XPathBinder</i> class to evaluate the XPath expression contained in the <i>TextField</i> property against the object. </p>

<blockquote>
node.Text = <br>
XPathBinder.Eval(idata.Item, TextField).ToString();<br>

</blockquote>

<p>This means that you must set the value of the <i>TextField</i> property to the required XPath expression. The <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method also uses the values of the <i>NavigateUrlField</i> and <i>NavigateUrlFormatString</i> properties to evaluate the value of the <i>NavigateUrl</i> property of the <i>TreeNode</i> object:</p>

<blockquote>
if (NavigateUrlFormatString != null &amp;&amp; <br>
NavigateUrlFormatString.Trim() != "" &amp;&amp;<br>
    NavigateUrlField != <br>
        null &amp;&amp; NavigateUrlField.Trim() != "")<br>
  node.NavigateUrl = <br>
        String.Format(NavigateUrlFormatString,<br>
    XPathBinder.Eval<br>
                 (idata.Item, NavigateUrlField));<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The <i>HierarchicalSelectCB</i> method finally sets the <i>PopulateOnDemand</i> property to True and raises the <i>NodeDataBound</i> event.</p>
<h3>NodeDataBound Event</h3>

<p>The <i>CustomTreeView</i> control uses the standard .NET Framework event pattern to define the <i>NodeDataBound</i> event. The pattern involves the following steps:</p>



<ol>
  <li>Define the class that holds the event data (see code available electronically). The <i>NodeEventArgs</i> class holds two event data; for example, the <i>TreeNode</i> object that raises the event and the respective database record. The <i>DataItem</i> and <i>Node</i> properties refer to these two event data, respectively.</li>
  <li>Define the event delegate:</li>


<blockquote>
public delegate void <br>
&#160; &#160; &#160;NodeEventHandler<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (Object sender, NodeEventArgs e);<br>

</blockquote>

	You must use an instance of the <i>NodeEventHandler</i> delegate to register callbacks for the <i>NodeDataBound</i> event.<br>
<li>Define the event itself:</li>


<blockquote>
private static readonly object <br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; NodeDataBoundKey = new Object();<br>
public event NodeEventHandler <br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; NodeDataBound<br>
{<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; add<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; {<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Events.AddHandler<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (NodeDataBoundKey, value);<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; }<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; remove<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160;{<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Events.RemoveHandler<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (NodeDataBoundKey, value);<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160;}<br>
}<br>

</blockquote>


  The <i>CustomTreeView</i> control defines a new object named <i>NodeDataBoundKey</i> that is used as a key to access the event. <br>
  <li>Define the method that raises the event:</li>


<blockquote>
protected virtual void <br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; OnNodeDataBound(NodeEventArgs e)<br>
{<br>
&#160; &#160; NodeEventHandler handler = (NodeEventHandler)Events [NodeDataBoundKey];<br>
&#160; &#160;if (handler != null)<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;handler(this, e);<br>
}<br>

</blockquote>


The <i>OnNodeDataBound</i> method uses the <i>NodeDataBoundKey</i> key to access the event and raises the event if necessary.
</ol>
<h3>Root Name and Value</h3>

<p>When users visit the containing page for the first time, the <i>CustomTreeView</i> control only displays the root node. <i>CustomTreeView</i> exposes two properties&#151;<i>RootText</i> and <i>RootValue</i> (available electronically).</p>

<p>The setters of both <i>RootText</i> and <i>RootValue</i> properties create an instance of the <i>TreeNode</i> class to display the root node, if necessary. Notice both setters set the <i>PopulateOnDemand</i> property of the <i>TreeNode</i> object to True. When users expand the <i>TreeNode</i> object, it automatically calls the <i>OnTreeNodePopulate</i> method to dynamically load the child nodes of the root node.</p>
<h3>Control State</h3>

<p><i>CustomTreeView</i> must save and restore its property values across page post backs to function properly. ASP.NET 2.0 presents you with a new way to save and restore those properties of the control that are essential to its operation.</p>

<p>The main problem with ASP.NET 1.x view state is the fact that you have the option of turning it off. This causes major problems for server controls that need to save/restore their property values across page post backs to function properly. </p>

<p>You can think of the ASP.NET 2.0 control state as the private storage of the control where you would not be able to turn off the feature. The <i>Control</i> class exposes two methods named <i>SaveControlState</i> and <i>LoadControlState</i> that the <i>CustomTreeView</i> control overrides to save and restore its property values across post backs. The <i>SaveControlState</i> method uses an array of size 8 to hold the data that it needs to save to the view state.</p>

<p>The <i>CustomTreeView</i> control overrides the <i>OnInit</i> method to register its interest in control state with the containing page:</p>

<blockquote>
protected override void OnInit(EventArgs e)<br>
{<br>
  Page.RegisterRequiresControlState(this);<br>
  base.OnInit(e);<br>
}<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The web page in <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a> shows how you can use <i>CustomTreeView</i> to load data on demand from a Microsoft SQL Server database without writing a single line of code. The <i>CustomTreeView</i> control takes advantage of the ASP.NET 2.0 data source control model to allow page developers to use any of the ASP.NET 2.0 tabular or hierarchical data source controls.</p>
