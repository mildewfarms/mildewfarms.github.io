<h2>MediaGrid.org</h2>

<p>The Media Grid is a digital media network infrastructure and development platform developed by the Grid Institute in partnership with Boston College, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (a public biotech company in Cambridge, Massachusetts), Japan's University of Aizu (the world's first university dedicated entirely to computer science and computer-related fields), and LUA (a Boston-based medical company), with individual contributions from employees at Harvard University, Oracle, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, John Hancock Financial Services, and other companies and universities. Later this year, the Grid Institute and its partners will donate the current Media Grid implementation, source code, and technical specifications to the MediaGrid.org open standards group, through which development of this public computing utility will continue in cooperation with industry, academia, and governments from around the world. The Grid Institute is also working with the City of Boston to build a dedicated supercomputing facility in downtown Boston to showcase the Media Grid and large-scale projects that utilize it. </p>
