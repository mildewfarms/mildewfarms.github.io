<h4><b>Figure 2: </b><i>High-powered Media Grid nodes (indicated by the big Gs) provide storage, delivery, and processing services to other devices, including less capable devices that can only consume services (indicated by the smaller Gs) and standard web-enabled applications such as web browsers and rich clients.
