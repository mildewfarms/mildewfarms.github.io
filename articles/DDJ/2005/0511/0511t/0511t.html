<p>CharonWare has released an updated version of its Foxy SQL Pro and Foxy SQL Free database query tools. Foxy SQL Pro is a database script and query tool that lets you create, edit, and execute SQL commands and queries against any database via native, ADO, or ODBC connections, then browse and store the results (CSV, XML). The tool is based on the possibility to parse a complete SQL script into each individual command that can be executed according to the user's selection. Among other features, Version 1.1 of the tools includes the ability to save query results in HTML format, script selection of fonts, and additional support for Informix and DB2.</p>

<p>PDFTron Systems has released an update to its PDFNet SDK. The Version 2.6 release focuses on improved compression using JPEG2000 and JBIG2. The PDFNet SDK is a PDF library that lets you manipulate PDF documents. With PDFNet, you can write standalone, cross-platform commercial applications that can read, write, edit, print, and display PDF documents. PDFNet is available as a .NET component that can be used from any .NET language (C#, VB, and J#) and as a cross-platform C/C++ library. Version 2.6 features a JPEG2000 engine that decodes and processes any JP2 embedded stream in PDF. The JPEG2000 filter decodes data that has been encoded using JPEG2000 compression. The PDFNet toolkit also features JBIG2 decompression. Images of pages containing text in any language compress with typical compression ratios of 20:1 to 50:1. </p>
