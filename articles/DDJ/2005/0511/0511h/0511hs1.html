<h2>Google Desktop 2.0</h2>

<p>Looking to the future, Google recently released its Google Desktop 2.0 beta, which extends indexing through five new schemas and adds (and changes) APIs. The new schemas are: Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, Notes, and Journal. User-defined schemas still are not permitted. Google has extended the API set to include indexing, querying, and displaying. </p>

<p>Some of the indexing API calls were renamed from the Google Desktop 1.0 API. Even though the class and method names may have changed, the parameters remain the same. When registering a new component for indexing documents, the 1.0 <i>GoogleDesktopSearchRegisterClass</i> is named "<i>GoogleDesktopIndexingComponentRegisterClass</i>" in 2.0. The <i>RegisterComponent</i> and <i>UnregisterComponent</i> methods of the <i>GoogleDesktopSearchRegister</i> class have been renamed to "<i>RegisterIndexingComponent</i>" and "<i>UnregisterIndexingComponent</i>," respectively. </p>

<p>Submitting a document for indexing is done using the same sequence of steps in 1.0 and 2.0. An indexing event is first created using <i>IGoogleDesktopSearchEvent</i> in 1.0. In 2.0, the event is called "<i>IGoogleDesktopEvent</i>." Event properties are then set and the indexing event is submitted to Google Desktop. Setting properties and submitting events also remains the same in 1.0 and 2.0. Properties are set using the <i>Event.AddProperty</i> method, while indexing events are submitted using the <i>Event.Send</i> method. </p>

<p>The base schema <i>Google.Desktop.Indexable</i> has been extended with two additional properties: <i>cookie</i> and <i>cookie_raw</i>. Both properties are optional and are used for including additional information within an indexing event.</p>

<p>Finally, the COM reference library has changed names. The 1.0 library name is "<i>GoogleDesktopSearchAPILib</i>." In 2.0, the library name is "<i>GoogleDesktopAPILib</i>." Because Google Desktop 2.0 is in beta, these changes may not be finalized.</p>
