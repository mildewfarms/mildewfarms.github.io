<p>Zugg Software has released zApp 2.0, an application development tool for Windows. zApp lets you create software that can be modified by end users. Using Perl, JavaScript, VBScript, Python, and other languages compatible with the Windows Scripting Host, end users can create "plug-ins" that add features to your software. Multiple scripting languages can be used within one application for added flexibility. zApp includes a set of visual components that support Themes and Skins. Existing ActiveX and COM components can also be used within zApp. The tool features database support based on JDBC so that Microsoft ADO is not required. zApp applications support popular databases. The developer's version lets you encrypt zApp programs, while still allowing end users to customize them.</p>

<p>FairCom has released its c-tree Server for Apple's Mac OS X Server 10.4 Tiger operating system. The new database server exploits one of Tiger's major new features&#151;64-bit support. The redesigned kernel and updated system software allows 64-bit addressing for extended memory access, thereby making available huge amounts of memory for application developers. In addition, the new operating system uses the latest version of the GCC compiler, GCC 4.0, featuring support for 64-bit code generation. Developers using FairCom's c-tree Server SDK, which lets you compile your own custom server, benefit from both the 64-bit code generation and the performance of this new compiler.</p>
