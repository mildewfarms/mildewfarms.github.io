<h2>Dr. Ecco Solution </h2>
<h3>Solution to "Election Fraud in Verity," DDJ, August 2005. </h3>

<ol>
  <li>1.	There can be at most three pollsters meeting these conditions. Here's why. Each pollster must miss about 13 Wendy votes (because there are 51 in total, but only 38 seen by each pollster). No two pollsters miss the same Wendy voter, because every pair of pollsters interview all 100 voters. If we number the Wendy voters <i>W</i>1 to <i>W</i>51, then we can imagine that pollster A misses <i>W</i>1 to <i>W</i>13, pollster <i>B</i> misses <i>W</i>14 to <i>W</i>26, and pollster <i>C</i> misses <i>W</i>27 to <i>W</i>39. There are not enough more Wendy voters for a fourth pollster to miss, so there can be only three pollsters.</li>
  <li>2.	Number the Fred voters <i>F</i>1 to <i>F</i>49. Pollster A could interview <i>W</i>14 to <i>W</i>51 and <i>F</i>1 to <i>F</i>42. Then pollster B could interview <i>W</i>1 to <i>W</i>13 and <i>W</i>27 to <i>W</i>51 as well as <i>F</i>8 to <i>F</i>49. Finally, pollster C could interview <i>W</i>1 to <i>W</i>16 and <i>W</i>40 to <i>W</i>51 as well as <i>F</i>1 to <i>F</i>7 and <i>F</i>15 to <i>F</i>49.</li>
  <li>3.	As the solution to the first question showed, this result would not be possible with five honest pollsters. So Fred was right: Wendy stole the election.</li>
