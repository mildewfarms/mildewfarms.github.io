<h1>High-Performance I/O With Java NIO</h1>

<h2>How Orbitz.com improved throughput and performance  using NIO</h2>


<h3>By Brian Pontarelli</h3>

<p>The NIO library, a feature added to Java as part of JDK 1.4, offers an alternative, high-performance technique for handling input/output (I/O) operations. This library supports working directly with native channels, sockets, and direct memory buffers to increase the performance and throughput of I/O. In addition, it offers the ability to do true nonblocking I/O operations. However, if used incorrectly, NIO can yield little performance increase and can cause an increase in the load and reduce stability of an application. In this article, I discuss how Orbitz (the company I work for) used NIO to increase performance and stability by replacing an older standard I/O implementation. Orbitz communicates with various third-party backend systems to retrieve data for its customers. During the course of handling a single customer request, the Orbitz.com application performs time-sensitive I/O to fetch the customer's response. With a large number of concurrent users, the application can be performing hundreds of I/O operations at the same time. </p>

<p>The Orbitz.com application handles concurrent user requests by allowing each request to be performed in a separate thread. These threads, called "execute threads," can be configured such that each request is handled by a new thread or by a thread from a thread pool. In either case, it is vital to ensure that no thread is running for an extended period of time. When threads take too long processing a single user request and a new thread is used for each request, the Java VM has the possibility of crashing when excessive threads are created. Likewise, if a pool is being used and threads from that pool take too long while executing, other users are forced to wait until a thread has finished and can be reused. </p>
<h3>Standard I/O</h3>

<p>The Orbitz.com application was initially implemented with a standard I/O design using Java 1.3. To guarantee timeouts for I/O operations, it employed a separate thread to perform the I/O operations. The execute threads are then joined on this new thread using a timeout. With this approach, it prevented the execute thread from hanging when I/O operations encountered problems. <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a> shows the original thread that performed the I/O operations. It has been simplified from its original version.</p>

<p>By calling the <i>join</i> method on the <i>IOThread</i>, one of the execute threads waits until the <i>IOThread</i> has finished running. A timeout is specified when the join method is called to ensure that the execute threads do not wait forever for an <i>IOThread</i> to complete. <a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a> shows an example of how an execute thread used an <i>IOThread</i>.</p>

<p>The first version of the execute threads created new instances of the <i>IOThread</i> class for each I/O operation. Using the initial implementation it was observed that the servers were periodically experiencing high thread counts. It had initially been assumed that the maximum number of threads that could be created in a Java VM running this code would be 2<i>N</i>, where <i>N</i> was the number of execute threads. After some investigation, I found that an instance of the <i>IOThread</i> would remain in memory if it experienced network problems and was hung while performing an I/O operation. In addition, the execute thread correctly timed-out and the next execute thread attempted the same operation, with the same results. The net result was that the Java VM created an enormous number of threads and eventually ran out of memory.</p>

<p>To reduce the thread count, I added a thread pool that stored instances of the <i>IOThread</i> class. I also changed the execute thread code so that it checked out an <i>IOThread</i> instance from the pool, used it, and then checked it back in. This not only reduced the high thread count, but also reduced the overhead of thread creation. <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a> shows the second version of the execute thread that used the pool of <i>IOThread</i>s (the implementation of a thread pool is out of scope of this article).</p>

<p>This improvement still has an underlying problem. If the network experiences major failures, all instances of <i>IOThread </i>in the pool quickly become stalled and execute threads begin to fail during check-out because there are no more <i>IOThread</i>s in the pool. Additionally, when I began testing this new design under heavy load, I found that it still had problems that reduced overall performance. The issue was excessive context switching.</p>

<p>All the implementations thus far force the Java VM to perform increased context switching because either the execute threads or the <i>IOThread</i>s are all performing I/O operations concurrently. The largest problem with this concurrency is that the Java VM doesn't know which threads are ready to perform I/O operations and which are not. Therefore, the Java VM might put a thread onto the processor that isn't ready to perform I/O operations. Meanwhile another thread that is waiting to run is ready to perform I/O operations. Because Java does not provide the ability to "stack the deck" by moving threads that are ready to perform I/O to the top of the list, it is possible that a thread, which is ready to perform I/O, might wait long enough that it times out. </p>
<h3>NIO</h3>

<p>The NIO package added to Java 1.4 offers Java developers the ability to perform true nonblocking I/O and guarantee timeouts for I/O operations. It also works with low-level operating-system constructs to increase performance and reduce latency. In addition, it provides the ability to monitor multiple I/O operations concurrently, also known as "multiplexing."</p>

<p>Multiplexed NIO is a technique that moves all the I/O work into a single thread that watches over many I/O operations executing concurrently. A multiplexed NIO design uses the <i>java.nio.channels.Selector</i> class in conjunction with subclasses of the<i> java.nio.channels.SelectableChannel</i> class. The <i>Selector</i> class lets the application watch many I/O connections (subclasses of the <i>SelectableChannel</i> class and also known as "Channels") and organize these Channels into those that are ready to perform I/O and those that are not.</p>

<p>I decided to redesign to use NIO and a single thread to perform all the I/O operations. <a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a> shows the skeleton body of the NIO thread.</p>

<p>As with the threaded standard I/O design, the execute threads need a way to supply work to the <i>NIOWorker</i> in the form of a URL they want to contact. The <i>NIOWorker</i> then connects to the URL, sends an HTTP message to the server, and then reads the HTTP-response. After it completes that work, it passes back the result to the execute thread. One unit of work is designated using an inner class within the <i>NIOWorker</i> thread that lets a URL be passed in and the contents to be passed back. <a name="rl5"></a><a href="#l5">Listing Five</a> shows the inner class of the <i>NIOWorker</i> that represents one unit of work.</p>

<p>Supplying work to the <i>NIOWorker</i> is not a simple process and requires two methods. Because the <i>NIOWorker</i> thread is a separate thread that handles all the I/O operations, execute threads must add their work and then wait for the <i>NIOWorker </i>thread to process it. Therefore, the <i>NIOWorker</i> class has one method that forces the execute threads to wait, and a second method that actually adds the work. This design waits and notifies using the <i>Work</i> object as the monitor. <a name="rl6"></a><a href="#l6">Listing Six</a> shows the two <i>add</i> methods that force the execute threads to wait and add the work to the <i>Selector</i>.</p>

<p>This code creates a <i>SocketChannel</i>, which is a <i>Channel</i> that extends <i>SelectableChannel</i>, and registers the <i>Selector</i> with it. This <i>Channel</i> is set to nonblocking so that operations performed on <i>Channel</i> do not block until complete but rather return as quickly as possible. Registering a <i>Selector</i> with a <i>Channel</i> informs the <i>Channel</i> to begin a specific I/O operation and also tells the <i>Channel</i> to signal the <i>Selector</i> once the operation is complete. Here the code is setting the <i>Channel</i> to begin an OP_CONNECT operation, which forces the <i>Channel</i> to connect to a remote socket.</p>

<p>During the registration, this code also constructs a small class that holds some state information for the I/O operation. This is called an "attachment" and can be any object. The attachment is associated with a specific <i>Selector/Channel</i> relationship. This <i>Selector/Channel</i> relationship is called a "SelectionKey" (also known as "key"). It stores the type of operation the <i>Channel</i> is performing as well as the attachment. The <i>WorkState</i> object is what the <i>NIOWorker</i> uses as an attachment. <i>WorkState</i> lets the results that are read from the <i>Channel</i> be stored in a <i>StringBuffer</i>. It also provides a mechanism to monitor timeouts so that the <i>NIOWorker</i> thread does not continue working on something that has timed out. <a name="rl7"></a><a href="#l7">Listing Seven</a> shows the <i>WorkState</i> class.</p>

<p>To watch over the <i>Channels</i>, the <i>NIOWorker</i> thread needs to perform "selects" by calling the <i>selectNow</i> method on the <i>Selector</i>. Performing "selects" tells the <i>Selector</i> to update all of its keys to reflect which <i>Channels</i> are ready and which are not, allowing the <i>NIOWorker</i> thread to stack the deck by only working on the <i>Channels</i> that are ready. The number of ready keys is returned from this method. <a name="rl8"></a><a href="#l8">Listing Eight</a> shows the main <i>run</i> method for the <i>NIOWorker</i> thread that performs the select.</p>

<p>The <i>processKeys</i> method handles all of the <i>Channels</i> that signal the <i>Selector</i> that they are ready to perform I/O. Because the <i>Selector</i> handles multiple <i>Channel</i>s, the <i>processKeys</i> method performs the I/O for all <i>Channel</i>s that are ready. <a name="rl9"></a><a href="#l9">Listing Nine</a> shows the <i>processKeys</i> method that is responsible for iterating over all the <i>SelectionKeys</i> and handling each one.</p>

<p>The <i>Selector</i> object provides the ability to retrieve all the keys that are ready to perform I/O using the <i>selectedKeys() </i>method. This method returns a <i>Set</i> containing all the keys that are ready to perform I/O. This <i>Set</i> is populated with the ready keys whenever a select operation is performed on the <i>Selector</i>.</p>

<p>One important detail about the <i>processKeys</i> method is that during the loop iteration, the <i>WorkState</i> attachment is retrieved from the <i>SelectionKey</i> and used to verify that the work has not timed out. If it has timed out, the finished method is called to signal that the work is complete, which in this case is due to a timeout rather than success.</p>

<p>The <i>doWrite</i>, <i>doRead</i>, and <i>finished</i> methods are the last methods that complete the <i>NIOWorker</i>. The <i>doWrite</i> method writes the HTTP-request <i>String</i> to the channel. <a name="rl10"></a><a href="#l10">Listing Ten</a> shows the <i>doWrite</i> method.</p>

<p>The <i>doRead</i> method is responsible for performing a read from a <i>Channel</i> and signaling if everything has been read from the <i>Channel</i> or not. <a name="rl11"></a><a href="#l11">Listing Eleven</a> is the <i>doRead</i> method.</p>

<p>The <i>doRead</i> method is a standard NIO implementation of reading from a <i>Channel</i>. It reads zero or more bytes from the <i>Channel</i> and also determines if the <i>Channel</i> has any more to read. Once this code is certain that there is nothing more to read, it returns True to signal to the <i>processKeys</i> method that it should call the finished method. This code goes one step further and sets the success flag on the <i>WorkState</i> object. This is used in the <i>finished</i> method to determine whether the HTTP-response should be parsed.</p>

<p>The final <i>finished</i> method notifies the execute thread that its work was complete, whether successfully or not. The success flag set in the <i>doRead</i> method is used to determine if the HTTP-response is parsed out. <a name="rl12"></a><a href="#l12">Listing Twelve</a> is the <i>finished</i> method.</p>

<p>NIO does not handle the HTTP-request generation and HTTP-response parsing automatically. That work is left up to the NIO implementation or the client. This design handles the generation of the HTTP-request and parsing of the HTTP-response messages. The <i>buildHTTPRequest</i> and <i>parseHTTPResponse</i> methods were added here for illustration. The work of generating and parsing the HTTP messages is slightly more complex but is available in the full version of the code, within the <i>HTTPParser</i> class and the classes that implement the <i>HTTPMethod</i> interface.</p>

<p><a name="rl13"></a><a href="#l13">Listing Thirteen</a> is an example of an execute thread calling the <i>NIOWorker</i> to perform some work.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>To fully appreciate the benefits gained between standard I/O and NIO, I collected statistics using each design employed. These statistics were collected by running each of the actual implementations through a series of load tests in a fixed environment. <a name="rt1"></a><a href="0509ct1.html">Table 1</a> presents the results from those tests. All values are the number of transactions completed by an implementation per minute.</p>

<p>In addition to a load test, the standard I/O and the NIO solutions were both used in the Orbitz production environment for some period of time. I was able to monitor each one and collect statistics for load and latency. <a name="rt2"></a><a href="0509ct2.html">Table 2</a> shows the statistics from the Orbitz.com production environment.</p>
<h3>Additional Thoughts</h3>

<p>The code I present here is only part of the complete solution used in the Orbitz.com application. I simplified some of the code, but have retained the major work required to implement a multiplexed NIO solution.</p>

<p>NIO is not a simple API to use and I encountered many issues during testing that required fine tuning. A few things I found that should be kept in mind are:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Prevent adding too much work to the <i>Selector</i>. This can cause memory leaks that result in a Java VM crash. The <i>Selector</i> can be queried to determine how many keys it currently has and that number can be compared to a configurable threshold.</li>
  <li>Determine if your <i>run</i> method runs in a tight loop. The earlier code runs in a tight loop and this may be undesirable for low- to medium-volume applications. To cause a looser loop, one of the <i>Selector</i> methods with a timeout can be used. This will cause the call to that method to block until a <i>Channel</i> is ready.</li>
  <li>You may want to use a tight loop but wait when the <i>Selector</i> is empty inside the <i>run</i> method. Inside the add methods, the <i>NIOWorker</i> thread can then be notified when work is successfully added.</li>
  <li>Increase performance by moving the <i>ByteBuffer</i> and <i>CharsetDecoder</i> from the <i>doRead</i> method to instance variables on the <i>NIOWorker</i> object.</li>
  <li>Check the <i>Selector</i> for each loop iteration in the main <i>run</i> method to determine if any work has timed out. This check will prevent the <i>Selector</i> from becoming full of invalid connections due to network failures.</li>
  <li>The full version of the code, available electronically (see "Resource Center," page 3) includes all of these implementation details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pitfalls</h3>

<p>One major NIO pitfall to be aware of is that you should always use multiplexed NIO. Putting NIO code into multiple threads reduces overall performance and can cause excessive load. I experimented with using NIO in multiple threads and observed that due to enormous amounts of context switching the load nearly tripled, while latency and throughput remained unchanged. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>A multiplexed NIO solution is an ideal solution for the Orbitz application requirements because of the efficiencies of multiplexed I/O operations. Multiplexed I/O means that there is a single thread doing many I/O operations by leveraging a <i>Selector</i> to perform the multiplexing. Using a <i>Selector</i>, multiple <i>Channel</i>s executing I/O operations are managed and watched over concurrently. This means that at no point is the Java VM ever waiting on <i>Channel</i>s that are not ready to perform I/O; because the <i>Selector</i> knows precisely the <i>Channel</i>s that are ready to perform I/O and those that are not. Because there is only a single thread performing I/O, the problem of context switching between multiple threads performing I/O operations has been eliminated. All of these conditions greatly reduce overhead and latency while increasing total throughput over a standard I/O implementation.</p>
