<p>From the 1970s to 2004, microprocessor execution speed increased at an amazing rate&#151;from kilohertz to megahertz to gigahertz. But starting in 2004, CPU speeds have been increasing at a much slower pace. The main speed bumps are power and heat. Faster clock rates require more power, extra power creates more heat, and keeping the CPU from melting requires increasingly elaborate and expensive cooling mechanisms. CPU manufacturers are shifting their focus from increasing clock rates to improving the performance of multithreaded code. For instance, Intel's HyperThreading technology lets an individual Pentium 4 CPU appear as two CPUs to Windows XP and other operating systems. Although a HyperThreaded CPU is still a single processor, HyperThreading can speed up multithreaded code up to 25 percent. Intel, AMD, and other manufacturers are also shipping multicore CPUs, which are simply multiple CPUs on the same chip. Multithreading is often the only way to achieve maximum performance from parallel CPU architectures. In this article, I show how to reliably multithread .NET applications. I include File Search (available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 3), which I wrote to examine .NET multithreading. File Search was developed and tested with Visual Studio 2003/.NET 1.1 and Visual C# Express 2005/.NET 2.0 beta 2.</p>

<p>.NET provides two main threading mechanisms&#151;the <i>Thread</i> class and asynchronous methods. <a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a> shows how to explicitly manage threads. In the <i>Main</i> method, two <i>Thread</i> objects are instantiated with <i>ThreadStart</i> delegates as constructor parameters. When their <i>Start</i> methods are called, the methods pointed to by the <i>ThreadStart</i> delegates start running. These methods, <i>HelloWorld1</i> and <i>HelloWorld2</i>, must be void and take no parameters. Calling the <i>Join</i> methods causes the program to block until the methods finish. The program exits after both <i>HelloWorld1</i> and <i>HelloWorld2</i> have finished. If the <i>Join</i> statements were removed, the program would still wait for the threads to complete because <i>thread1</i> and <i>thread2</i> are foreground threads. If the threads were changed to be background threads (by setting the <i>IsBackground</i> property to True), and if the <i>Join</i> statements were removed, the program would exit before the threads finished running. <i>Thread</i> objects are easy to configure. For example, you can change a thread's priority by assigning a new value to its <i>Priority</i> property.</p>

<p>Unlike <i>Thread</i>s, asynchronous method calls (<a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a>) can have parameters. In the <i>Main</i> method <i>workDelegate</i> refers to a method (<i>Work</i>) that takes a string parameter. Each <i>workDelegate.BeginInvoke</i> call returns immediately. After each <i>BeginInvoke</i> call, the <i>Work</i> method is run on its own background thread. <i>BeginInvoke</i> returns an <i>IAsyncResult</i> object. The <i>IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle</i> object can be used to block until the method returns. The <i>WaitHandle.WaitAll</i> method waits until both asynchronous method calls have finished. Asynchronous methods run on threads managed by the <i>ThreadPool</i> class. The <i>ThreadPool</i> class maintains a set of worker threads (25 per CPU, 50 per Hyperthreaded CPU), and creates and destroys threads as necessary. Asynchronous methods don't let you directly manipulate the threads running the methods, but an asynchronous method can manipulate its thread once it's running, by accessing <i>Thread.CurrentThread</i>.</p>

<p>I decided to use asynchronous methods in File Search rather than explicit <i>Thread</i> objects because asynchronous methods can be parameterized. File Search (<a name="rf1"></a><a href="0509gf1.html">Figure 1</a>) uses asynchronous methods to simultaneously search multiple drives. For example, if the user searches the C: and F: drives in parallel, one asynchronous method searches the C:\ drive, another searches F:\.</p>

<p>To install File Search, navigate to the Setup folder and double-click filesearch.zip. If you use WinZip, you can automatically install by clicking the Install toolbar button. Otherwise, you may need to extract the .zip file to a hard disk folder and run setup.exe. To build File Search, extract the source code to a hard disk folder and load the .sln file into Visual Studio. After you've installed or built File Search, run it. Select the Settings! menu item. The number of CPUs on your system is displayed. HyperThreaded CPUs count as 2. Make sure that the Multithreaded search checkbox is checked, then press OK. Enter the file types to search, and optional search text. Select the Text or Regular Expression radio button. Then specify the drives to search by checking the drive letter checkboxes. Click the Browse button to specify individual folders and network drives. Then click the Search Now button. When the search begins, the Results tab automatically displays (<a name="rf2"></a><a href="0509gf2.html">Figure 2</a>). Click a file in the ListView to display its contents and search for specific text. Notice the 4 and 5 on the right of the status bar. The number to the left, 4, is the number of completed asynchronous method calls. The number to the right, 5, is the total number of asynchronous method calls.</p>
<h3>Asynchronous Method Call Lifecycle</h3>

<p>When you click the Search Now button the <i>Search.SearchAllFolders</i> method is called (<a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>). The actual searches are performed by the <i>SearchFolders</i> method. The <i>SearchFoldersDelegate</i> variable is used to call <i>SearchFolders</i> asynchronously. The <i>AsyncCallback</i> delegate points to the <i>SearchCallback</i> method. <i>SearchCallback</i> is automatically called each time an asynchronous method finishes running. The <i>SearchFoldersDelegate.BeginInvoke</i> calls return immediately. After the <i>BeginInvoke</i> calls have been made, the <i>SearchFolder</i>s method is called from a pooled thread. If a pooled thread is available, it is used; otherwise, a new thread is created and added to the pool.</p>

<p>The call to <i>CreateDriveHashtable</i> creates a <i>Hashtable</i> with a key for each drive being searched. The value corresponding to each key is an <i>ArrayList</i> of the folders in the drive to search. Once the <i>Hashtable</i> has been created, it's used to call the asynchronous methods. For each key (drive) in the <i>Hashtable</i>, the <i>SearchFolders</i> method is called asynchronously with an array of folders to search. Because each drive is searched by only one asynchronous method, searching the drive will not slow down due to thrashing. The last parameter (drive) in the BeginInvoke call is automatically sent to the <i>SearchCallback</i> method after the method finishes. It is available via the <i>IAsyncResult.AsyncState</i> property.</p>

<p><i>SearchFolders</i> calls <i>FileUtils.GetFiles</i> to navigate through folders and search for files. As <i>GetFiles</i> runs, it periodically checks the <i>SearchInfo.Cancelled</i> property. If users press the Stop Search button, the <i>Cancelled</i> property is set to True and <i>GetFiles</i> returns. The thread running <i>GetFiles</i> could be terminated by calling <i>Thread.Abort</i>, but I don't recommend it. <i>Thread.Abort</i> attempts to terminate a thread by throwing a <i>ThreadAbortException</i>. This is a dangerous thing to do without knowing exactly where the thread is in its processing. Additionally, calling <i>Abort</i> on a suspended thread deadlocks the thread and the application.</p>

<p>When <i>SearchFolders</i> returns, the <i>SearchCallback</i> method is automatically called (<a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a>). The <i>SearchInfo.remainingSearches</i> counter is decremented because one of the parallel searches has just finished. <i>SearchCallback</i> needs to update the status bar and the progress bar, but it must not directly call <i>MainForm.UpdateStatusBar</i> and <i>MainForm.UpdateProgressBar</i>. Manipulating GUI components derived from the <i>Control</i> class (forms, labels, status bars, progress bars, and the like) must only be done on the GUI thread that created the component. Because <i>SearchCallback</i> is called from a different worker thread, the <i>MainForm</i> methods are called indirectly by the <i>Control.Invoke</i> method (the <i>Form</i> class is derived from <i>Control</i>). <i>Control.Invoke</i> takes two parameters, a delegate to the method being called, and an object array containing the method's parameters. <i>Control.Invoke</i> calls the method on the thread that created the <i>Control</i>. Visual Studio 2003's debugger does not notify you when your code manipulates <i>Control</i>s in a worker thread unless you put <i>Debug.Assert(!InvokeRequired);</i> statements in GUI code that is callable by worker threads. However, Visual Studio 2005's debugger automatically reports these threading bugs.</p>
<h3>Race Conditions and Synchronization</h3>

<p>In multithreaded applications, variables can be accessed and updated simultaneously by multiple threads. This can cause race conditions (timing-dependent bugs) and data corruption issues that are notoriously difficult to debug. For example, consider the <i>UnsafeCounter</i> property:</p>

<blockquote>
private int unsafeCounter;<br>
public int UnsafeCounter<br>
{<br>
  [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.<br>
		Synchronized)]<br>
  get { return unsafeCounter; }<br>
  [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions<br>
		.Synchronized)]<br>
  set { unsafeCounter = value; }<br>
}<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The <i>Synchronized</i> attribute ensures that the <i>get</i> and <i>set</i> methods are only called by one thread at a time. This prevents one thread from assigning a value at the same time that another thread is reading it. But this is not sufficient to avoid a race condition. When a thread executes the <i>UnsafeCounter++</i> statement, these native CPU instructions are executed:</p>

<blockquote>
// UnsafeCounter++;<br>
mov  esi,ebx <br>
mov  ecx,ebx <br>
<br>
// Call the get method<br>
call dword ptr ds:[0BFF63D8h] <br>
mov  edi,eax <br>
<br>
// Increment value<br>
inc  edi  <br>
mov  edx,edi <br>
mov  ecx,esi <br>
<br>
// Call the set method to store the result<br>
call FFB91C23 <br>

</blockquote>

<p>Consider what happens if the <i>UnsafeCounter</i> has a value of 0 and two threads are about to increment the counter with the <i>++</i> operator. Here's one possible outcome:</p>



<ol>
  <li>Thread 1 calls the <i>get</i> method, retrieves value (0).</li>
  <li>Thread 1 increments the value to 1.</li>
</ol>



<p>The operating system switches to Thread 2.</p>



<ul>
  <li>Thread 2 calls the <i>get</i> method, retrieves value (0).</li>
  <li>Thread 2 increments the value to 1.</li>
  <li>Thread 2 calls the <i>set</i> method to store result (1).</li>
</ul>



<p>The operating system switches back to Thread 2.</p>



<ol>
  <li>Thread 1 calls the <i>set</i> method to store result (1).</li>
</ol>



<p>In this case, the counter started with a value of 0, was incremented twice, and ended up with an incorrect value of 1. And this is only one of many erroneous outcomes that could be caused by the race condition.</p>

<p>I wrote a <i>ThreadSafeCounter</i> class to prevent this race condition (<a name="rl5"></a><a href="#l5">Listing Five</a>). The <i>ThreadSafeCounter</i> class uses the <i>Interlocked</i> class to increment and decrement counters atomically. It also uses the <i>Synchronized</i> attribute to ensure that the <i>get</i> and <i>set</i> methods are not called by multiple threads simultaneously. The <i>ThreadSafeCounter</i> is limited to 32-bit integer values. .NET 2.0 lets the <i>Interlocked</i> class manipulate 64-bit integers, but this can cause race conditions on 32-bit CPUs. The <i>Interlocked</i> class is ideal for synchronizing access to integers. The lock statement is a more general-purpose synchronization mechanism:</p>

<blockquote>
lock ( {expression} )<br>
{<br>
  {statements}<br>
}<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The <i>lock</i> statement waits until no other thread is holding a lock on the expression. Then the expression is locked and the statements are executed. After the statements are finished, the lock is released and another thread can acquire a lock on the expression. The expression must be a reference type. Typically code locks on <i>this</i> to lock an entire object. To acquire locks in a static method, use the <i>typeof</i> operator to lock on the method's class. See the <i>lock</i> statement in <i>updateStaticMembers </i>below<i>:</i></p>

<blockquote>
public class LockDemo<br>
{<br>
  int w, x;<br>
  static int y, z;<br>
  public void updateMembers()<br>
  {<br>
    lock(this)<br>
    { <br>
      w = w * 2; x = w * 4; <br>
    }<br>
  }<br>
  public static void updateStaticMembers()<br>
  {<br>
    lock (typeof(LockDemo))<br>
    { <br>
      y = 33; z = z * 2 + y; <br>
    }<br>
  }<br>
}<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Applications must synchronize access to any variable that can potentially be accessed by multiple threads. The <i>Interlocked</i> class is a high-performance option for integer variables. The lock mechanism and Monitor class are slower than the <i>Interlocked</i> class, but they can synchronize access to any type, not just integers.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>One of the main reasons for developing a multithreaded application is to improve performance. But even multithreaded apps can have performance problems. For example, creating too many threads can slow down an application. Every thread uses memory to store its stack and other state information. And it takes time for the operating system to context switch from one thread to a different thread. More threads mean more memory consumption and more context switches. For some applications you may want to make the number of threads proportional to the number of available CPUs. The <i>NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS</i> environment variable specifies the number of CPUs (HyperThreaded processors count as 2). You can access this variable programmatically, see SettingsForm.cs (available electronically) for the details.</p>

<p>The <i>Synchronized</i> attribute is a convenient way to make an entire method mutually exclusive, but if only a subset of the method's code requires mutual exclusion, it's better to put only that subset in one or more lock statements. Make sure each lock is held only as long as necessary. You can use <i>Monitor.TryEnter</i> method to acquire a lock only if it's available:</p>

<blockquote>
if (Monitor.TryEnter(this))<br>
{<br>
  lock(this)<br>
  {<br>
  }<br>
}<br>

</blockquote>

<p>This works because the lock uses the <i>Monitor</i> class internally. The lock statement calls <i>Monitor.Enter</i> before executing the statements in its body, and calls <i>Monitor.Exit</i> after the statements have been executed. Another way to reduce lock contention is to use the <i>[ThreadStatic]</i> attribute. When the <i>[ThreadStatic]</i> attribute is placed above a member variable, a separate instance of that variable is available to each thread. If synchronizing a member variable is slowing your application down, you may be able to mark it as <i>[ThreadStatic]</i> and remove the synchronization. For example, File Search's asynchronous method uses a <i>Regex</i> member variable for regular expression searching. The member variable, <i>FileUtils.regularExpression</i>, is marked as <i>[ThreadStatic]</i> so there's no need to synchronize it.</p>

<p>Run perfmon to determine if your app is slowing down due to lock contention. Press the + toolbar button and select the .NET CLR LocksAndThreads performance object. Select the All Counters and Select Instances From List radio buttons. Highlight your program in the listbox and press Add and Close. Click on the View Report toolbar button and monitor the Contention Rate/sec and Total # of Contentions counters.</p>

<p>Searching files for text is I/O-bound rather than CPU-bound. Consequently, searching multiple drives with simultaneously executing asynchronous methods is a major performance enhancement. For example, when I searched two local drives and four network shares, the multithreaded search was about 3.7 times faster than the single-threaded search. This dramatic speedup is not surprising. While one thread is blocked waiting for file I/O, another thread can search for text. Multithreading a CPU-bound program typically results in a more modest speedup.</p>
<h3>Debugging and  Testing Multithreaded Apps</h3>

<p>Debugging a multithreaded application full of race conditions is a nightmare. Here are some testing tips to make testing more effective and reduce the likelihood of race conditions. If you're developing a Windows Forms application, test it with the Visual Studio 2005 debugger. Unlike previous versions, the 2005 debugger automatically detects when a control is manipulated by a worker thread. Unit testing software like NUnit is extremely useful for multithreaded code. NUnit (<a name="rf3"></a><a href="0509gf3.html">Figure 3</a>) is able to detect the multithreaded increment bug mentioned earlier. To see NUnit in action, download it from http://www.nunit.org/. Run the NUnit-Gui program. Select File/Open and open the FileSearchNUnitTests.nunit project file from the FileSearchNUnitTests project. Press Run and NUnit detects the race condition if it happens during the test run. NUnit test cases are synchronous. If you call asynchronous methods in NUnit, use <i>WaitHandle.WaitAll</i> to force the test case to wait for the asynchronous methods to complete. If your code uses <i>Thread</i> objects, force the test code to wait by calling <i>Thread.Join</i>. See NUnitTests.cs (available electronically) for sample multithreaded NUnit test cases.</p>

<p>It's worthwhile to test on a variety of machines with different performance characteristics. Some race conditions only show up on true multiprocessor machines. If your customers will be running your software on multicore or SMP machines, your test matrix needs to include multiprocessor machines.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Moore's Law hasn't been repealed. CPU manufacturers are still able to double the transistor count on a given area of silicon every 18 months or so. What has changed is the rate at which the performance of  single-threaded applications can be improved. For at least the next few years, single-threaded applications will not speed up dramatically as customers upgrade their machines. But multithreaded applications will speed up if they take advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of newer HyperThreaded and multicore CPUs. Perhaps in the future, compilers will automatically parallelize .NET code and distribute processing across multiple CPUs. But for now, multithreading is the way to harness the parallelism of today's computers. Asynchronous method calls are a convenient way to call parameterized methods on multiple threads. Just be sure to synchronize access to variables. Debug your Windows Forms code with Visual Studio 2005 and you'll automatically find Windows Forms threading bugs. Finally, put NUnit to work testing your multithreaded code. Detecting any bugs, especially threading issues, during unit testing is much less expensive than finding them later in the development process or at a customer's site.</p>
