<p>TechExcel has unveiled its DevTest test management solution, which automates test coverage creation, test planning, and scheduling, and tracking of test execution. Using DevTest, QA managers and engineers can create, manage, and document test plans in a centralized repository. Users can then schedule and assign these tests to their team using a wizard driven interface. Once assigned, testers execute these tasks, and defects can be automatically submitted to development projects based on test case status, establishing links between the test task and the submitted defects. DevTest tracks tests in built-in presentation quality reports and in a planning dashboard.</p>
