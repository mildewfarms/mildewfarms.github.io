    <td>This is the highest possible confidence level to be used for applications demanding the highest possible precision at all times.</td>

    <td>Good</td>
    <td>Represents a level that marks the minimum appropriate for making business decisions. Positional measurements could be used to make reliable in-route navigation suggestions to the user.</td>

    <td>Moderate</td>
    <td>Positional measurements could be used for calculations, but the fix quality could still be improved. A more open view of the sky is recommended.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9-20</td>
    <td>Fair</td>
    <td>Represents a low confidence level. Positional measurements should be discarded or used only to indicate a very rough estimate of the current location.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>21-50</td>
    <td>Poor</td>
    <td>At this level, measurements are inaccurate by as much as half a football field and should be discarded.</td>
