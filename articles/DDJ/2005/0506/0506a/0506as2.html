<h2>The ODB At Work</h2>
<blockquote>
<i>When I push zoom a second time, it displays the wrong data. Sometimes.</i><br>

</blockquote>


<p>I had spent several hours looking for the bug with Eclipse. He was fairly sure that a certain <i>ArrayList</i> containing time-event pairs was being corrupted, but nothing more. He thought it would be interesting to try the ODB.</p>

<p>The EVolve visualization system comprises some 80K lines of Java and is designed to read-in and display performance data on Symbian applications for mobile phones. It had been written over several years by several programmers, none of whom were available. I had never used the tool, nor had I ever seen a single line of the source code. It was exactly what I was looking for!</p>

<p>The first indication of the problem was a dialog box that displayed a zero time. So I did an incremental search through the traces in the AWT thread for the string "Start time." Of the eight events, which contained that string, the second-to-last showed a zero time range.</p>

<p>I could see from the code that the string was constructed using the start and end instance variables from a Selection object. This particular object had the same value for both. Selecting that object and stepping back to its creation, I could see that <i>RefDim.makeSelection() </i>was calling <i>new</i> with those values. That method was called from <i>Paladin.select()</i>, which obtained those values by taking the difference between the start values of elements two and four of the aforementioned <i>ArrayList</i>. I noticed that the first five elements of the list were the same object.</p>

<p>Stepping backwards to find out who put those values in, I discovered this odd little loop, which ran in thread <i>T1</i>. (At this point, there is no clear connection between the creation of the list and its use.)</p>

<blockquote>
while ((x/Math.abs(interval) - xOffset) &gt;=   timeMap.add(time2event);<br>
}<br>

</blockquote>

<p>It was clear that multiple identical entries in the list were allowed, but that these particular ones were wrong. After staring blindly at the loop for a while, I stepped back to the caller:</p>

<blockquote>
countEvents(x + xOffset*interval);  <br>

</blockquote>

<p>The programmer was adding the offset to the <i>X</i> value, only to remove it in the loop. Weird. I had noticed that the second selection only failed if it were in a low range (presumably <i>0 - xOffset*interval</i>, which was also the range where the <i>ArrayList</i> values were identical). </p>

<p>Removing the offset eliminated the bug. The entire session lasted about an hour, during which I looked at 20 objects in a dozen files. Most of my time was spent trying to understand the intent of the code. </p>
