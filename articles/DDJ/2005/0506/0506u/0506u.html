<p>Pantero Software is designed to create rules and services that deliver valid data in integration projects. You use graphical tools to import data schemas or models, map data from one representation to another, define rules to ensure validity and consistency, and define error-handling behavior&#151;with all of it captured as metadata. The Pantero runtime software implements these rules as web services or Java controls. Pantero Release 1.3 supports Eclipse and the JBoss application servers as well as software from BEA and IBM.</p>
