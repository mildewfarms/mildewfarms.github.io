<p>The aim of the gjournal project is to create a data journaling layer for FreeBSD's GEOM storage device layer. The idea of gjournal was born from the observation that FreeBSD doesn't currently have a journaling filesystem, but in an early phase the specification was extended to include copy-on-write (COW) functionality. </p>

<p>The GEOM subsystem is a modern kernel-based framework that manages pretty much all aspects of usage and control of storage devices. It's based on the concept of classes. A GEOM class can be a source of data or it can implement data transformations in a completely transparent way. All classes can be arbitrary combined in a hierarchy in the form of a directed acyclic graph. Examples of existing GEOM classes are <i>gmirror</i>, which consumes two or more underlying class instances (called "geoms") and provides one that duplicates and distributes I/O requests to them (a RAID 1 layer); and <i>geom_dev</i>, which consumes all disk device geoms and creates entries in the /dev filesystem hierarchy for them.</p>

<p>The gjournal is implemented as a GEOM class that consumes two geoms and produces one. The first of the two consumed geoms is designated as a "data device" and the second as a "journal device." The basic idea is to transform write requests to the produced geom into sequential writes to the journal device. The class implements two kernel threads: A main worker thread to which I/O requests are delegated, and a helper thread used to asynchronously commit data from the journal to the data device. </p>

<p>In regular mode, the journal device is divided into two areas, one of which is used to record data until it's filled&#151;at which point, it's scheduled for asynchronous commit. A timed callout is scheduled that periodically triggers the swap/commit process. Two journal formats are implemented&#151;one optimized for speed that emphasizes sequentiality of writes to the journal device, and another that conserves space by keeping metadata for the journal in one place.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the most used FreeBSD filesystem&#151;the UFS&#151;cannot be used with gjournal because this layer doesn't distinguish metadata (for example, information about deleted but still referenced files) and requires a <i>fsck</i> run to correct references. The COW facility is functional and can be used for experimentation with filesystems.</p>
