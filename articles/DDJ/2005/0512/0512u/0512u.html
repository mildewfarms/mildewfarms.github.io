<p>Excel Software is starting MacTranslator OSX 1.0, a reengineering tool for generating graphic models of programming source code on Mac OS X computers.  MacTranslator scans source code to extract design information that it outputs to a text file. That text is imported into the MacA&amp;D modeling tool to automatically generate UML class models, structure charts, and rich data models. MacTranslator lets you generate accurate models of unfamiliar code in minutes. Through a mix of options and translation commands, MacTranslator can process over a hundred programming-language dialects of C, Pascal, Basic, Fortran, C++, Java, Object Pascal, Delphi, Objective-C, and SQL. </p>

<p>Xamlon's Web lets you use C# or Visual Basic.NET in Visual Studio to build WinForms applications and deploy them directly to the Web without requiring the .NET runtime system. The product includes complete integration with Visual Studio.NET, and lets you use existing APIs you are already familiar with, including WinForms, GDI+, and XML web services. Programs are written in Visual Studio, then, from Microsoft's Intermediate Language bytecode, Xamlon creates compact Macromedia Flash (SWF) files. The resulting applications can be deployed anywhere Flash is installed, including Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and PDAs and cell phones. The .NET runtime is not required for deployment and the resulting application may be deployed to platforms where .NET is not even supported. </p>

<p>Dekart has released Dekart Private Disk SDK, an SDK that lets you integrate on-the-fly encryption, disk-exclusive access, and other Private Disk capabilities into any application. Dekart Private Disk SDK includes everything you need to build security into new or existing publishing, health care, legal, financial, and other applications. With the Dekart "disk firewall" feature, you can ensure that applications have an exclusive access to the protected disk, thus providing the highest possible level of security. The integration of "disk firewall" allows developers to rest assured that all the intellectual property created with their applications will never be disclosed to any unauthorized third party. The API included in Dekart Private Disk SDK can be transparently integrated into existing programs, avoiding the need to rewrite the interface or the existing documentation. </p>

<p>Franson Technology has released Franson CoordTrans 2.0, a tool for converting geographic coordinates. A coordinate from a GPS typically uses the WGS84 datum, but maps and many GIS applications use other coordinate systems like NAD83 and UTM. CoordTrans can be used to convert between virtually all coordinate systems on Earth. Franson CoordTrans converts single coordinates, large files of coordinates, and live coordinates from a GPS. A large database is included, which contains thousands of coordinate systems&#151;data and grids&#151;from all over the world. The coordinate systems are categorized by country and can also be found by free text search. Custom datums and grids can be defined.</p>

<p>Parasoft has released C++Test 6.5, an automated unit testing and coding standard analysis toolsuite that prevents the occurrence of software errors as they develop. C++Test 6.5 finds and resolves software errors in C/C++ code with enhancements to both code analysis and unit testing as well as increased platform and team support. With Parasoft C++Test 6.5, source code can now be validated against over 600 C/C++ coding standards and guidelines that reflect industry standard best practices in code design and construction-affecting reliability, performance, maintainability, security, and compliance. A new RuleWizard Autocreator lets you easily create your own custom rules or guidelines by simply providing RuleWizard a sample of "bad code" as the guideline for automatic rule creation.</p>
