<h1>The StatiC  Compiler &amp; Language</h1>

<h2>A dual-mode system for sequential and FSM development</h2>

<hr>





<p>Take one traditional sequential programming language&#151;C, for instance&#151;and remove the parts you don't like. Design and code a compiler based on this language, and target a popular microcontroller (making sure that the design is flexible enough to support multiple targets). Now, add Finite State Machine programming constructs as an integral part of the language. What you end up with is "StatiC," a dual-mode compiler that provides an easy migration path from the traditional sequential programming model to the inherently multitasking Finite State Machine model. Effectively, you get two languages for the price of one, along with a friendly syntax and small learning curve. Additionally, the use of command-line switches facilitates retargeting through external parsing software.</p>

<p>The StatiC compiler supports both traditional sequential and Finite State Machine (FSM) language methodologies, the feature being controlled via a command-line switch. Dual-methodology support lets you code using an identical syntax (but different language constructs) in either the "generic" sequential mode or the inherently multitasking FSM mode. The sequential language is based on the familiar language constructs of C, Basic, and Pascal, but with a unified and simplified syntax. The FSM language is the same as the sequential language, except that it has additional FSM extensions. In this article, I don't specifically address Finite State Machines, as this topic has been covered in <i>DDJ</i> in the past. Rather, I deal with the implementation of the concept as it applies to the StatiC language.</p>

<p>The compiler has been designed from scratch, specifically for the embedded domain, and includes the features required to support both the sequential and FSM modes of operation. In addition, the languages themselves have been enhanced to remove "clutter" (such as ambiguous operators and symbols) found in other languages, as well as incorporating some features more suited for embedded software development.</p>

<p>The StatiC compiler can be hosted under Windows or Linux, and currently targets the Motorola DSP56F80x microcontrollers. These controllers, with their dual Hardvard architecture, JTAG flash capabilities, and a wide variety of interface modules, are particularly well suited for the embedded/robotics domain. A demo version of the compiler is available at http://petegray.newmicros.com/static/ and from <i>DDJ</i> (see "Resource Center," page 5).</p>

<p>StatiC compiler operation is controlled via parameters and switches, which are invoked like this: </p>

<blockquote>
static  sourcename [switches]<br>

</blockquote>

<p>By convention, StatiC FSM-mode programs have a filetype of .fsm and non-FSM programs have a filetype of .nsm.</p>

<p><a name="rt1"></a><a href="0503jt1.html">Table 1</a>(a) lists the switches that control compiler operation. For example, to produce CodeWarrior-style assembly language for myprog.nsm, enter: </p>

<blockquote>
static  myprog.nsm   -a568cw<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Output is placed in the file clist.asm. <a name="rt1"></a><a href="0503jt1.html">Table 1</a>(b) lists additional switches for compiler development and debugging.</p>

<p>If the assembler output is unspecified (that is, you don't use the <i>-a</i> switch), the compiler generates descriptive, nonoptimized assembler, making it possible for an external program to parse the output and produce assembler for a completely different target. The default compiler mode is sequential. In addition, if the compiler is invoked without specifying a source, it begins an interactive session.</p>
<h3>FSM-Specific Language Topics</h3>

<p>FSM mode allows the use of Finite State Machine constructs, which are inherently multitasking. An application typically consists of multiple machines that&#151;at any point in time&#151;exist in a particular state. A good analogy would be that a machine is like a thread running in a process, or a machine is like a program running in a multitasking operating system.</p>

<p>The implementation of the FSM methodology requires that you list the allowable states of the machines in an application, defines the conditions whereby a machine state transition occurs, and declares the name and initial state of each machine. Each state and each machine has a unique name (they are, after all, identifiers).</p>

<p>State transitions are used to determine and execute a machine transition from one state to another, and achieve this through the assignment of the reserved word <i>nextstate</i>, optionally executing additional code during the transition.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of state machines, a transition may not include loops or calls (that is, anything that may cause a transition to "hang"). This apparent limitation really isn't limiting, rather, it proactively encourages you to produce code that is more appropriate to the state machine programming paradigm. The compiler automatically generates a high-speed, minimal overhead, context-switching mechanism based on an application's machine chain. This context switch examines the state transition conditions of each machine in a round-robin fashion, performing a machine state transition only when the transition conditions have been satisfied.</p>

<p>The demo version of the StatiC compiler has limited FSM capabilities&#151;two machines and 12 states&#151;which is enough to compile the FSM mode example program.</p>
<h3>Program Structure: Sequential Mode</h3>

<p>The structure of a typical sequential program looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
Comments<br>
  Directives<br>
   Global Variable and Constant Declarations<br>
    Procedure Block(s)<br>
 Program Block<br>

</blockquote>

<p>All items, except the Program Block, are optional. Comments can appear anywhere. Most Directives can appear anywhere. Global Variables and Constants must appear prior to being referenced (that is, referenced from a Procedure or the Program). Procedure Blocks must appear before the Program Block. </p>

<p>The Procedure and Program Block Structures follow. Optional elements are shown between square braces ([ and ]). Procedure Block Structure, see <a name="re1"></a><a href="0503je1.html">Example 1</a>(a), define the name, parameters, and code of a callable routine. The Program Block Structure defines the code of the main program; see <a name="re1"></a><a href="0503je1.html">Example 1</a>(b).</p>

<p><a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a>, a complete sequential mode StatiC program, performs simple terminal I/O and lets users turn LEDs on/off. The target system is New Micros's PlugaPod (http://www.newmicros.com/), which is based on Motorola's DSP56F803 digital-signal processor. This program displays instructions, then turns the LEDs on/off, depending upon what users type at the keyboard. </p>

<p>From within the program block, you see the statement: </p>

<blockquote>
word ichar 1<br>

</blockquote>

<p>which declares a one-word variable, <i>ichar</i>, which is local to the program block. Next, the statement </p>

<blockquote>
^SCI0BR = 260    // baud 9600<br>

</blockquote>

<p>loads the Serial Communications Interface (SCI) baud rate register with the value <i>260</i>, which sets the baud rate of the chip's SCI module to 9600. The statement works this way because I defined <i>SCI0BR</i>, near the top of the program, to be <i>$0F00</i>, the address (in Hex) of the baud-rate register for the PlugaPod, and I use the "^" operator. This could be thought of as meaning "load the contents of <i>$0F00</i> with 260." In StatiC, the same statement could have been written like this:</p>

<blockquote>
^$0F00 = 260<br>

</blockquote>

<p>which would have achieved the same thing. However, it's good practice to substitute definitions for register addresses because the registers do not always have the same address within the same family of chips. Using definitions means that if you port your code to another chip, which doesn't have the same register address as the original, you'll only need to change the program in one place&#151;in the <i>#define</i> directive. Besides, <i>SCI0BR</i> is a little more meaningful than <i>$0F00</i> to someone reading or maintaining the code.</p>

<p>The program then sets the various  general-purpose input/output (GPIO) line-control registers, which are tied to the LEDs on the PlugaPod. Next, the statement:</p>

<blockquote>
call sci0output (@msg1) // display message<br>

</blockquote>

<p>calls the SCI output routine, passing the address of <i>msg1</i> as the parameter. The constant <i>msg1</i> is a null-terminated string, and <i>sci0output</i> is coded to process the string passed to it, displaying the characters (via the SCI) to the terminal.</p>

<p>The program then enters a never-ending loop, reading the keystrokes and adjusting the LEDs accordingly. The statement: </p>

<blockquote>
call sci0input (@ichar)<br>

</blockquote>

<p>calls the SCI input routine, passing the address of the local variable <i>ichar</i> as the parameter. The <i>sci0input</i> routine is coded to wait for keyboard input and return what was typed in the parameter passed to it.</p>

<p>Next, the character returned from the input routine is tested, and the LEDs are adjusted. The statement: </p>

<blockquote>
if ( ichar = '1' ) ^PADR = ^PADR | $0004 endif<br>

</blockquote>

<p>performs a logical OR operation on the contents of the GPIO data register (<i>PADR</i> = Port A Data Register), if users type a "1" at the keyboard. ORing the data register with <i>$0004</i> sets bit 2 high, which turns the green LED on.</p>

<p>Finally, <i>sci0input</i> waits until the SCI status register (<i>SCI0SR</i>) indicates that a character has been entered, then puts the character into wherever <i>rchar</i> is pointing at: </p>

<blockquote>
ostat = ^SCI0SR<br>
while ( ostat &amp; $3000 ) &lt;&gt; $3000<br>
   ostat = ^SCI0SR<br>
endwhile<br>
^rchar = ^SCI0DR<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Recall that I passed <i>@ichar</i> to the routine, and the formal declaration of the routine was: </p>

<blockquote>
procedure sci0input (rchar)<br>

</blockquote>

<p>so the statement:</p>

<blockquote>
^rchar = ^SCI0DR<br>

</blockquote>

<p>actually stores the contents of the SCI data register (<i>SCI0DR</i>) into <i>ichar</i>.</p>
<h3>Program Structure: FSM Mode</h3>

<p>The structure of a typical FSM program looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
Comments<br>
  Directives<br>
    Global Variable and Constant Declarations<br>
 Procedure Block(s)<br>
   State List<br>
Transition Blocks(s)<br>
  Machine Definitions<br>
    Program Block<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Many of the components of an FSM program structure are present in the sequential program structure. The extensions required for FSM mode are the State List, Transitions, and Machine Definitions, which must appear in order.</p>

<p>The State List simply lists the allowable application machine states:</p>

<blockquote>
statelist statename1 statename2 ...<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The Transition Block Structure defines the conditions required for a state change  and the actions to perform when those conditions are met.</p>

<blockquote>
transition statename<br>
begin<br>
  condition expression<br>
  causes<br>
    statements<br>
  endcondition<br>
end<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Finally, Machine Definitions lists the machines in the application, and defines their stack space and initial state. Each machine has its own stack space, and the compiler automatically initializes&#151;and keeps track of&#151;the stack pointer for each machine.</p>

<blockquote>
machine  machinename  stacksize  initial state<br>

</blockquote>

<p><a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a>, a complete FSM mode StatiC program, performs simple terminal I/O. Characters entered on the keyboard are received by the microcontroller and echoed on a PC running a terminal emulator. Again, the target system is NewMicros's PlugaPod, although this example also runs on the 805 chip (NewMicro's IsoPod), and&#151;with modification to the SCI register addresses&#151;the 807 (ServoPod).</p>

<p>First, notice that this application consists of two machines&#151;<i>inputmachine</i> and <i>outputmachine</i>. The <i>main</i> part of the program, the Program Block:</p>

<blockquote>
^SCI0BR = 260 // baud rate 9600<br>
^SCI0CR = 12  // 8N1<br>
call sci0output (@msg1) // display <br>
		       // welcome message<br>
appstate = APPSTATEINPUT// the initial <br>
		            //app state<br>

</blockquote>

<p>sets up the Serial Communications Interface (SCI), displays a message, and sets the global variable <i>appstate</i> to be <i>APPSTATEINPUT</i>. This application is designed in such a way that the two machines are cooperative, and the setting of <i>appstate</i> determines their transition to/from one state to another. Machines don't have to behave this way, but it's useful, for demonstration purposes.</p>

<p>Once the program block has been executed, all machines are activated. That is to say, they're put into their "initial state" as determined by the machine definition statements:</p>

<blockquote>
machine inputmachine 10 waitappinput<br>
machine outputmachine 10 waitappoutput<br>

</blockquote>

<p><i>inputmachine</i> is put into <i>waitappinput </i>state, and <i>outputmachine</i> is put into <i>waitappoutput</i> state. Once in these states, they remain in these states until the state transition conditions have been satisfied. So, <i>inputmachine</i> is initially in <i>waitappinput </i>state, which is described in the transition block, thus:</p>

<blockquote>
transition waitappinput<br>
begin<br>
  condition appstate = APPSTATEINPUT<br>
  causes<br>
    nextstate = waitinput<br>
  endcondition<br>
end<br>

</blockquote>

<p>However, <i>appstate</i> was defined as <i>APPSTATEINPUT</i> in the main program block, so the <i>inputmachine</i>'s transition condition is satisfied. This causes <i>inputmachine</i> to change states to <i>waitinput</i>.</p>

<p>Also, you'll notice that <i>outputmachine</i>'s initial state is <i>waitappoutput</i>, which is described in the transition block, thus: </p>

<blockquote>
transition waitappoutput<br>
begin<br>
  condition appstate = APPSTATEOUTPUT<br>
  causes<br>
    nextstate = doappoutput<br>
  endcondition<br>
end<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Unlike <i>inputmachine</i>, <i>outputmachine</i>'s transition condition has not been satisfied, so no state change takes place, and <i>outputmachine</i> remains in the <i>waitappoutput</i> state.</p>

<p>At this point in time, <i>outputmachine</i> is waiting for its transition condition to be satisfied, and <i>inputmachine</i> has changed state to <i>waitinput</i>. So, looking at the <i>waitinput</i> transition block: </p>

<blockquote>
transition waitinput<br>
begin<br>
  condition ( ^SCI0SR &amp; $3000 ) = $3000<br>
  causes<br>
    appchar = ^SCI0DR<br>
    appstate = APPSTATEOUTPUT<br>
    nextstate = waitappinput<br>
  endcondition<br>
end<br>

</blockquote>

<p><i>inputmachine</i> remains in this <i>waitinput</i> state until a keyboard key is pressed at the keyboard. The <i>outputmachine</i> is still waiting for its transition conditions to be satisfied.</p>

<p>When a key is pressed, <i>inputmachine</i>'s transition conditions are satisfied, a character is read from the SCI data buffer into the global variable <i>appchar</i>, the <i>appstate</i> is set to <i>APPSTATEOUTPUT</i>, and <i>inputmachine</i> performs a state change back to <i>waitappinput</i>.</p>

<p>At this point, <i>outputmachine</i>'s state transition conditions have been satisfied (because appstate was set to <i>APPSTATEOUTPUT</i> by <i>inputmachine</i>), so <i>outputmachine</i> experiences a state change from <i>waitappoutput</i> to <i>doappoutput</i>. Looking at the <i>doappoutput</i> transition block:</p>

<blockquote>
transition doappoutput<br>
begin<br>
  condition ( ^SCI0SR &amp; $C000 ) = $C000<br>
  causes<br>
    ^SCI0DR = appchar<br>
    appstate = APPSTATEINPUT<br>
    nextstate = waitappoutput<br>
  endcondition<br>
end<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The <i>outputmachine</i> waits until the SCI is ready to send, then it loads the SCI data register with the global variables; <i>appchar</i>, sets the <i>appstate</i> to <i>APPSTATEINPUT</i>, and performs a state change back to <i>waitappoutput</i>. While this is all happening, <i>inputmachine</i> does nothing, because its state transition conditions have not been satisfied.</p>

<p>At this point in time, both machines are back in their initial states, and the whole cycle starts again.</p>
<h3>Why FSM?</h3>

<p>At this point, you may be wondering why anyone would want to code like this. The answer is because it's inherently multitasking. For example, say that you've coded the previous example and want to have the application monitor the PH level of the water in a fishtank (via the ADC), then set a GPIO line high (triggering an alarm) if the reading goes above a certain point. All you have to do is add another machine. Want to send PWM signals to activate a servo that opens a feeding tray? Add another machine.</p>

<p>There's no difficult "where do I put this new code so that the existing code still works?"&#151;the machines run independently from each other (unless, of course, you deliberately design them to be cooperative). You could even run multiple machines on the same chip, which perform  functions for more than one application; for instance, monitor a fishtank <i>and </i>monitor a home-security system.</p>

<p>You simply create machines, as required, to perform the tasks you desire. Each machine runs and changes state when its transition conditions are satisfied. All of the machines you define are running at the same time&#151;the same as a multitasking operating system&#151;and performing whatever function you've designed them to do. This is the true power of FSM programming.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>My goal with StatiC is to create a dual-methodology language, which is easy to learn and use, yet advanced enough to perform multitasking in embedded environments. It had to be something that made rapid application development a reality, and not just an overused marketing phrase. But most of all, it had to be a language that I&#151;as an experienced software developer&#151;would want to use, as a matter of preference, over any other languages available in the domain. The StatiC language and compiler meet, and in some ways exceed, that goal. I'm surprised with what can be achieved using a relatively simple language&#151;which just goes to show that sometimes the best solution to complex problems is a simple solution.</p>
