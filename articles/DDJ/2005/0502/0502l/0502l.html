<p>Calling a web service from a .NET application couldn't be easier. Just select the Project/Add Web Reference menu item. Add a URL to the WSDL file that describes the web service. Press Add Reference and a proxy class is automatically created. This proxy class includes methods corresponding to each of the web service's methods. Calling any of these proxy class methods generates a SOAP (XML) request, sends it to the server, retrieves the SOAP response, and converts it into a response object. But what if you want to request compressed responses, or access or even change the requests and responses? In this article, I show how to ask for compressed responses, capture and optionally modify SOAP requests/responses, and debug web-service calls with a network packet analyzer program. I've included SoapEx, a sample application (available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 5) that demonstrates these techniques. SoapEx (see <a name="rf1"></a><a href="0502lf1.html">Figure 1</a>) is a .NET Windows Forms program written in C#. It requires the .NET 1.1 framework and Windows 2000/XP or later. Build it in Visual Studio .NET 2003 by opening SoapEx\SoapEx.sln. You can also install the app by running setup.exe in the setup folder. </p>

<p>When you run SoapEx, it calls the Google web service. Check the Compress Response checkbox to request a compressed response. Check the Modify Soap Request and Response checkbox to change the SOAP requests and responses. You'll need a license key to use the Google web service. Press the Get License Key button to get one, or go to http://www.google.com/apis/. In either case, it will take only a minute or two to apply for a license key and receive it via e-mail.</p>

<p>Press Call Web Service to send the web-service request and retrieve the response. The SOAP request/responses are displayed in the Results text box. Pressing the IP Addresses button displays the IP address of your machine and the server hosting the web service. These IP addresses are useful for troubleshooting web-service calls with Packetyzer. </p>

<p>Many web services can return results in compressed format to conserve bandwidth. Given the verbosity of XML, compression can drastically reduce bandwidth consumption. Unfortunately, .NET web-service proxies do not ask for compressed results by default. But it's easy to correct this situation. The first step is to create a new class derived from the web-service proxy class. (For example, SoapEx has the <i>CompressedGoogleSearch</i> class, which is derived from the <i>GoogleSearchService</i> proxy class.) Then override the derived class's <i>GetWebRequest</i> method to specify an HTTP header Accept-Encoding value of gzip, deflate (<a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a>). The Accept-Encoding header specifies the compression formats that the client can cope with. The SoapEx application can decompress both gzipped and deflated responses. The second step is to override your derived class's <i>GetWebResponse</i> method to return a <i>CompressedWebResponse</i> object. The <i>CompressedWebResponse</i> object will be able to decompress web-service responses.</p>

<p>When the server returns the results, they are in gzip format, deflated format, or uncompressed. Bear in mind that the Accept-Encoding header is only a suggestion, not a demand. The <i>CompressedWebResponse.GetResponseStream</i> method decompresses the response <i>Stream</i> if it is actually compressed (<a name="rl2"></a><a href="#l2">Listing Two</a>). <i>GetResponseStream</i> determines the response format by inspecting <i>webResponse.ContentEncoding</i> (see the code inside the try block). If the response is compressed, the correct <i>inputStream</i> is selected: <i>GZipInputStream</i> for gzip, <i>InflaterInputStream</i> for deflate. A <i>BinaryReader</i> object is created to read bytes from the <i>inputStream</i>. As the <i>inputSource</i> is read, the uncompressed data is written to the result <i>Stream</i> using a <i>BinaryWriter</i>. If the response was not compressed, the result <i>Stream</i> is set to the original, uncompressed <i>Stream</i>. In any case, the result <i>Stream</i> is returned at the end of <i>GetResponseStream</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>CompressedWebResponse</i> class uses the #ziplib library (available at http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib/) to decompress responses. .NET 2.0 will include built-in libraries for gzip compression and decompression.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, you can enable compressed responses without deriving a class from the proxy class. You could override <i>GetWebRequest</i> and <i>GetWebResponse</i> in the original proxy class. But changes to the proxy class will be undone if you ever need to regenerate the proxy in the future. Compressing responses on the server and decompressing them on the client consumes additional CPU cycles on both server and client, but the savings in bandwidth is likely to justify the processing cost. At least at the moment, the Google web service does not return compressed responses, perhaps because the responses tend to be small. SoapEx requests compressed responses, and is ready to decompress them if they are returned in the future.</p>
<h3>SoapExtensions</h3>

<p>A SoapExtension enables your program to wiretap web-service calls and even change the SOAP requests and responses. SoapExtensions are not tied to a particular web service. If your application calls multiple web services, they will all be manipulated by a SoapExtension. .NET's SoapExtension mechanism lets custom code be called at various stages of the web-service call process. If you derive a class from SoapExtension, your class's <i>ProcessMessage</i> method (<a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>) will be called at the stages of the web-service call process listed in <a name="rt1"></a><a href="0502lt1.html">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>If you intend to capture and/or change SOAP requests and responses, override the <i>ChainStream</i> method in <a name="rl3"></a><a href="#l3">Listing Three</a>. The argument to <i>ChainStream</i> is a <i>Stream</i> containing the current SOAP request or response. In your overridden <i>ChainStream,</i> save the <i>Stream</i> argument and create, save, and return another <i>Stream</i> argument. For example, the sample application saves the argument as <i>oldStream</i>, and creates and returns a new <i>Stream</i> named "<i>newStream</i>."</p>

<p>After .NET has created a SOAP request by serializing the request proxy object, you can capture the SOAP request, and even modify it. Just take the original request, which is stored in <i>newStream</i>, change the XML, and store it in <i>oldStream</i> (see <i>ProcessRequest</i> in <a name="rl4"></a><a href="#l4">Listing Four</a>). When the client receives a SOAP response, the XML can be captured and changed before it's deserialized into a response proxy object. To modify a response, take the original response stored in <i>oldStream</i>, change the XML, and store it in <i>newStream</i> (see <i>ProcessResponse</i>).</p>

<p>You can see SoapEx capture and display SOAP requests and responses by pressing the Call Web Service button and looking in the Results text box. To see SoapEx modify requests and responses, check the Modify Soap Request and Response checkbox, and press the Call Web Service button. Then look at the Results text box. The request and response will be modified by "pretty-printing" them with indentation. I confess: SoapEx's modifications to SOAP requests/responses are somewhat contrived. But if you have control over both the client and server, you can use SoapExtensions to modify requests and responses to implement proprietary compression, encryption, and so on.</p>
<h3>Configuring SoapExtensions</h3>

<p>A SoapExtension can be wired into an application using a configuration file. For Windows Forms applications, put the configuration settings in a file with the same name as the executable, with an extra .config on the end. For example, the SoapEx's configuration file is named SoapEx.exe.config (<a name="rl5"></a><a href="#l5">Listing Five</a>). For ASP.NET applications, store the same configuration information in a Web.config file.</p>

<p>The &lt;<i>add</i>&gt; element is where the SoapExtension is specified. The type attribute specifies the full name of the <i>SoapEx</i> class in namespace.class format, followed by the name of the assembly containing the SoapExtension. If there are multiple SoapExtensions, the priority attribute determines the order in which they are applied. SoapExtensions with higher priorities are applied before ones with lower priorities. Priority 0 is the highest, 1 is the next highest, and so on. SoapExtensions with a group attribute of 0 have the highest relative priority.</p>
<h3>Debugging Web Services</h3>

<p>Sometimes, the Visual Studio debugger is not sufficient to debug web services. It's often important to see the exact bytes going over the wire during a web-service call. For example, when a web-service response isn't well-formed XML, the response proxy object will be null, and you'll want to inspect the actual response that the server returned. In these sorts of situations, I recommend Network Chemistry's Packetyzer program (<a name="rf2"></a><a href="0502lf2.html">Figure 2</a>), available at http://www.networkchemistry.com/products/packetyzer/. When you launch Packetyzer 3.0.1, the Capture Options dialog lets you "Capture packets in promiscuous mode," which I don't recommend. If your machine has a promiscuous network card, Packetyzer can display traffic from your machine and other machines on the network. Unless you need to monitor other machines' traffic, promiscuous mode just slows down the debugging process.</p>

<p>Launch Packetyzer and then launch SoapEx. Click on the IP Addresses button, which will launch a dialog box (<a name="rf3"></a><a href="0502lf3.html">Figure 3</a>). Select the line below the "Packetyzer Advanced Filter" and press Ctrl+C to copy it into the clipboard. Then go to Packetyzer and click the Display Filter drop-down combobox. Press Ctrl-V to paste the filter and press Apply to apply it. This filter specifies that Packetyzer will display HTTP network traffic between your machine and the web server that implements the web service. I recommend taking the time to learn Packetyzer's filtering mechanism&#151;filters can make Packetyzer much more convenient and efficient.</p>

<p>Select Session/Start Capture in Packetyzer's main menu. Then press SoapEx's Call Web Service button. Give Packetyzer a few seconds to capture the traffic. Select Session/Stop capture. Then click on the rows in the list control in the top, right corner of the screen (<a name="rf2"></a><a href="0502lf2.html">Figure 2</a>). As you click on the rows, you'll see the entire conversation that SoapEx had with the web server. To see the entire conversation in one stream, right-click any row in the list control and select Follow TCP Flow. Then select the Decode tab and you'll see the web-service request and response in a convenient textual format.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The next time you use Visual Studio's Add Web Reference feature, consider creating derived proxy classes to specify compressed responses. The bandwidth that you save may pay for the modest effort of creating a derived class that requests compressed responses. And consider using a SoapExtension to capture your application's SOAP requests and responses for debugging purposes. Finally, download Packetyzer and install it. You'll want to have it handy the next time you need to do any serious web-service debugging.</p>
