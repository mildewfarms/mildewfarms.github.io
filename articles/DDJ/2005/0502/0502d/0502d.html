<p>Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are making inroads into applications ranging from utilities and facility management, to city planning and security, among others. In this article, I present a GIS application that lets you embed a map into a Microsoft Word document simply by highlighting an address in the text. As such, this article is a convergence of several distinct technologies: GIS, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), web services, and word processing. </p>

<p>To build the sample program (actually, a Word macro), you need to have installed on your PC Microsoft Word 2002 (or higher), Internet Explorer 5.x (or higher), and the Microsoft SOAP Toolkit 3.0. However, to use the code I present here, you need to set up a web service on a protected intranet. You can easily replace my web service with your own or use a third-party subscription web service such as Microsoft's MapPoint (http://www .mappoint.com/). </p>

<p><a name="rl1"></a><a href="#l1">Listing One</a> is the code for the Word macro. The Word document that accompanies this article is available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 5. To view and open the Word document, press  ALT+F11. The execution of the sample program is a two-part operation: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Highlight a street address for Knoxville, Tennessee.</li>
  <li>Right click your mouse and choose "Validate address..." from the context menu. </li>
</ol>



<p>If an invalid address is highlighted, a message box appears informing you that the address is invalid; otherwise, you are presented with a dialog box that lets you select various map "themes" (an aerial photo, zoning restrictions, and so on) as well as specifying a map size and scale. </p>

<p>Nearly all the heavy lifting in this program is performed by a web service that lives on the Internet (or an intranet) and performs discrete operations; in this example, the web service first validates an address, then returns a map at the request of users. The beauty of web services is that you don't have to know anything about their inner workings&#151;you simply use them. Web services expose their methods, which makes it easy to know what data you have to pass in (in this example, an address as a string), and what you get back (again, a string representing the URL of a map). The other nice thing about web services is that they can be written in one language, but called from any other. My web service is written in Visual Basic; however, you could call it from a C# or C++ application. In short, web services go a long way toward delivering on the promise of seamless, heterogeneous, distributed computing.</p>
<h3>The KGIS Address Web Service</h3>

<p>The web service used by my Word macro is a product of Knoxville Geographic Information Systems (KGIS) of Knoxville, Tennessee. KGIS is responsible for maintaining all the geographical data for Knox County, and is a consortium of the city of Knoxville, Knox County, and the Knoxville Utilities Board (KUB). KGIS is thus responsible for supporting a wide user base with diverse data needs. The primary GIS tool is ArcIMS from ESRI (http://www.esri.com/). ArcIMS generates the map that gets inserted into a Word document when an address is validated. The web service I use in this article does not actually return a map image, but rather, the URL of the map image. The main point here is that a web service exists that validates an address (for Knox County, Tennessee) and returns you a reference to a map of that address.</p>

<p>The web service itself is integrated in a Microsoft Word document as a macro. This entire problem of inserting a map into Word can be broken down into three steps:</p>



<ol>
  <li>Create the macro that calls the web service.</li>
  <li>Provide a way for the user to call the web service.</li>
  <li>Do something with the result.</li>
</ol>

<p>To create a Word macro, select Tools-&gt; Macro-&gt;Macros... from the toolbar. This launches a dialog that lists all current macros, plus, displays a Create button. Enter the name of your macro and click this button. This launches the VBA editor, which defaults to editing a subroutine with the same name as your macro from the previous screen. The code for my macro (available electronically; see <i>Validate_Address()</i>) is responsible for reading the address that users select (highlight), and configuring the structures needed by the web service. This is done by using the <i>Selection</i> object; see <a name="re1"></a><a href="0502de1.html">Example 1</a>.</p>

<p>Saving the selected string is necessary for two reasons. First, you need to read the string containing the address. Second, if the address turns out to be valid and users want to see a map, I insert a blank line immediately below the highlighted address for inserting the map. I then rehighlight the address. Saving the starting/ending locations of the address string lets me do this. It also gives users visual feedback as to which address they selected.</p>

<p>One final caveat regarding macros&#151;you may need to adjust your security settings in Word before this macro executes. Select Tools-&gt;Macros-&gt;Security... on the toolbar and enable macros.</p>
<h3>Calling a Web Service</h3>

<p>The next step is to provide a way for users to call the web service from inside Word. For my sample program, I modified the context menu that appears when you right-click in Word; see <a name="rf1"></a><a href="0502df1.html">Figure 1</a>. Begin by clicking Customize under Tools on the main menubar of Word. Select the Toolbars tab and check the box next to Shortcut Menus. That opens the shortcut menu bar editor; see <a name="rf2"></a><a href="0502df2.html">Figure 2</a>.</p>

<p>Next, select Text from the Shortcut Menus toolbar, and add the text for the context menu (Validate Address...). Then, on the Customize dialog, select Commands and then Macros. Add the name of the macro here; see <a name="rf3"></a><a href="0502df3.html">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>The code exists in a macro called <i>Test()</i>. In the sample Word document (available electronically), you can access the code by pressing ALT+F11 to open the macro editor. The code declares many different variables; some of these are related to calling my map service. The generic variables are concerned with getting the text that users have highlighted, namely, <i>sSelection</i>. The contents of this variable must be checked for nonvisible ASCII characters. The only thing you want to pass to the web service is a valid street address. <a name="re2"></a><a href="0502de2.html">Example 2</a> does just that.</p>

<p>Once you have the address, you have to validate it against the KGIS database (again, your project would use your database). If valid, the dialog box in <a name="rf4"></a><a href="0502df4.html">Figure 4</a> appears, letting users select the properties of the map for the given address.</p>

<p>This dialog is called <i>UserForm1</i> in the project. The Theme combobox is populated with the values <i>Topographic</i>, <i>Aerial Photo</i>, <i>Case</i> <i>Parcel Map</i>, and <i>Zoning</i>. The web service uses this information to return the type of map. Scale and Size are self explanatory. The Owner Data combobox is an additional criterion peculiar to the KGIS web service. Its values are <i>Map ONLY</i>, <i>Owner Info.</i>, and <i>Owner Info./Parcel ID</i>. Normally just a map would be returned, but the other options allow information about the owner of the address and the parcel to be returned as well.</p>

<p>After users have made their selections on this dialog and clicked the OK button, the real fun starts. The structures used by the web service are completed and the web service is called using this line:</p>

<blockquote>
sMapURL = <br>
   myMap.wsm_GetMapByAddressMSLink<br>
      (CLng(Val (myAddrInfo.AddrMSLINK)), <br>
          myMapProps)<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The web service returns the URL of a map that lives on the server. The next programming chore is to get this image into the Word document. This is done by first creating a temporary file in the user's TEMP directory, then copying the JPEG map image to this file. Once on the local machine, it's a snap to insert it into Word; see <a name="re3"></a><a href="0502de3.html">Example 3</a>. The line in bold is a little-known API call that does all the work. According to the documentation, its function is to "Download bits from the Internet and save them to a file"&#151;exactly what you want. Finally, a <i>Selection</i> object is created for an <i>InLineShape</i>, and the map/JPEG is assigned to the <i>AddPicture</i> method. You now have a map in your Word document.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are a number of Internet sites that provides maps identifying stores, points of interests, and the like. With the merging of GIS with the Office tools, you can greatly extend and enhance the utility of your GIS-related applications.</p>
