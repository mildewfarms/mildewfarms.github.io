<p>Recursion Software has updated its JGL Toolkit, which provides generic programming facilities for Java similar to the Standard Template Library for C++. Release 5.0 of the JGL Toolkit builds upon and extends the functionality of Sun Microsystems JDK 5.0, offering runtime error reduction through typesafe collections processing with generics. Also, generic arithmetic for the number classes eliminates the need to convert between the number classes and primitive types.</p>

<p>The Topologi Difference Detective is a lightweight utility for displaying changes between different versions of files, including XML data. For small, dense files, such as XSLT scripts or XML Schemas, there is a detailed word-by-word comparison showing all additions and deletions. For larger text files up to 100K, a line-by-line comparison is available and for large and binary files, a byte-by-byte comparison detects where two files are not the same.</p>
