<h2>Elliptic</h2>

<p>Elliptic has upgraded its Ellipsys security software to Version 2.0. This release upgrades the algorithms implemented to include a complete set of asymmetric functions such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and RSA functions. ECC is often used in mobile handsets because of its smaller key sizes compared to equivalent RSA algorithms. The ESS-02 Asymmetric Cryptography library includes ECC, EC Diffie-Hellman, RSA PKC, and other functions. The ESS-01 symmetric library offers a complete set of ciphers, modes, and authentication algorithms. <a href="http://www.ellipticsemi.com">www.ellipticsemi.com</a></p>
