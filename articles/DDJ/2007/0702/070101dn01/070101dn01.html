<h2>Ajaxium</h2>

<p>Ajaxium 2.0 from Ajaxium is a component that acts as a universal AJAX container for default and custom ASP.NET controls and pages. Ajaxium-powered pages become AJAX-enabled, but preserve their normal lifecycle. In addition to empowering all controls on separate ASP.NET pages, Ajaxium handles all types of hyperlinks, enabling smooth navigation from one AJAX-enabled page to another and letting you AJAX-ify entire web sites. All pages remain compatible with all browsers and search engines. <a href="http://www.ajaxium.com">www.ajaxium.com</a></p>
