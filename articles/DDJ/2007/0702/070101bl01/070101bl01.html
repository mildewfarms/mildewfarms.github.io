<p>Coupling is a rough measure of how much one software module relies on another. In particular, "loose coupling" refers to a module that uses only a published interface to another module. Tight coupling, on the other hand, depends on internal details.</p>

<p>Tight coupling is a bad thing because it means that every time someone decides to change the implementation of his or her module, every tightly coupled module might have to be changed, too. For instance, in Example 1(a) a loosely coupled module will only use <i>getAge()</i>. Should a module "cheat" and access the <i>age</i> instance variable directly, then when Example 1(b) is distributed, the cheating module will no longer even compile. </p>


<div>

<pre class="code">
<b>(a)</b>

class Person { 
   int age;
   public int getAge() {return age;}
}

<b>(b) </b>

class Person { 
   int birthYear;
   public int getAge() {return thisYear - birthYear;}
}
</pre>

<h3>Loose Is Better, Always</h3>

<p>What you often hear about is the necessity to couple more tightly "for performance reasons." Indeed, it is not difficult to come up with examples of where tight coupling lets na&iuml;ve compilers produce significantly better code&#151;but you shouldn't use na&iuml;ve compilers for production code. </p>

<p>The one good thing about this kind of tight coupling is that the compiler prevents you from distributing nonworking code by accident. Which brings us to insidious tight coupling (ITC).</p>

<p>ITC is the situation where one module depends on another module having some special state, or set of string literals, but where the compiler doesn't know. In this case, it is easy to make changes to one module and miss another module that was making assumptions about the first.</p>

<p>An example would be where you know that students are to be entered into a list in grade-point order. If another module relied upon this, then it would fail should the students be entered in a different order. The appropriate way to deal with this situation is to make your code reflect the requirements you put upon it. In this case, you would subclass <i>List</i> with a class <i>SortedList</i>, which would throw an exception if someone tried to insert a student out of order. </p>

<p>The most common example of ITC is when two modules need to use the same string literal. Within a single language project, this issue is resolved through the use of canonical objects and constants. But the trouble starts when those modules are in different languages. There's no compiler to tell you when you misspell a variable name, or that you only changed six of the seven places a literal was used. Moreover, because the typical use of these strings is for table lookups <i>(request.getParameter("firstName")</i>, for example), a <i>null</i> value might be a legal value, making it much more difficult to find the problem. (Often times, the bug is never noticed and the program simply spits out incorrect data.) </p>

<p>This is ITC at its worst. And where do you typically see many languages coming together? Web apps!</p>

<p>For instance, consider:</p>



<ul>
  <li>You decide to write the logic in Java.</li>
  <li>2, 3.	You're targeting browsers, so you need HTML and JavaScript.</li>
  <li>You'll certainly use CSS. </li>
  <li>Ajax is popular, which means XML or JASON (or both!)</li>
  <li>You're running Apache, so you'll need an XML DTD for configuration files.</li>
  <li>7, 8.	What good is a web site if you can't make objects persistent? So you'll need SQL/HQL. Maybe you want Hibernate? Those config files count.</li>
  <li>9, 10.	Finally, you'll want to write out a pretty page and you'll need JSP+JSF or something similar.</li>
  <li>HTTP! I forgot HTTP.</li>
  </ul>

<p>That's 11 languages for an elementary application. This is insane. What the heck are we doing? Well, we're letting tools control our lives. We are designing our applications so that they'll fit neatly into Ruby or Tapestry or J2EE. We have all these fancy tools that work for one aspect of creating a web application, then leave us to muddle through the rest. Tools are supposed to serve us. We are supposed to decide what we want, then find the tools that let us do it. We can write software to do anything. Why don't we write software to build entire web applications? </p>









<h3>What Do We Want?</h3>

<p>All too often, we start by asking what a tool can do for us, when we should be asking what we want our app to do. We want our apps to display information to users, accept input, execute transactions, and display more information. Figure 1 is a transition graph in classic MVC format illustrating this point. The application starts by displaying the <i>LoginPage</i>, which transitions to either the <i>VerifyLoginController</i> (passing an ID and password) or to a <i>NewVoterController</i> (passing nothing). If the login is valid, the <i>StatusPage</i> is displayed, showing details about the <i>Voter</i> and elections voted in. If not, it's back to the <i>LoginPage</i> with an error message.</p>

<p>It appears that most infrastructures and most web designers think in terms of page-to-page transitions. ("The <i>LoginPage</i> can transition to either the <i>VerifyLoginPage</i> or the <i>NewVoterPage</i>.") This is unfortunate because page-to-page transition graphs leave out essential information and result in horrendous hacks ("forwarded" pages, anyone?) to get around perceived problems. </p>
<h3>Languages at  Different Levels</h3>

<p>Java is a lousy language for describing page layout, and HTML is no good at logic. So we do want to use several different languages to define our applications. Can we do it and still avoid ITC? There are four basic levels I see for web apps, each of which is best done with its own language:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Data Definition</b> can be done by choosing a name for the object you want and listing its components. This <i>Person[String name, int age, String address]</i> is minimally sufficient. You can generate stubs in Java, a presentation description in HTML, and build a persistence definition from it. And that's what we want. (Dealing with a back-end database can be done entirely automatically. You only write calls like <i>dataObject.persist()</i>. No SQL. No ITC.)</li>
  <li>A <b>Transition Graph</b> lets you say which controller calls which set of pages, and what data those pages display. It also says what information those pages will have to solicit from users when transitioning to the next controller. You can build stubs for both the page layout and controllers from it.</li>
  <li><b>Page Layout</b> is best done with a WYSIWYG editor. You can hand the editor the page stub you just created (which will have basic HTML to display the data) and do all the positioning and pretty details there.</li>
  <li><b>Logic</b> is built up from the controller stubs, using whatever programming language you find suitable. (I like Java.) Because you're generating all the stubs from the transition graph, you can generate specific <i>Request</i> objects for the controllers that do all of the data verification and data object creation for you, letting you write things like <i>request.getUID()</i> instead of <i>request.getParameter("UID")</i>. No ITC!</li>
</ul>

<p>In this fashion, there is a single source for all the name strings and the generator, plus the compiler guarantees that no naming mistakes are made. The tricky part of dealing with multilevel designs like this is ensuring that changes in one language (say, the transition graph) are appropriately reflected in the generated code; and you must prevent programmers from changing the generated portions of the code to conflict with the graph. But this is an issue for tool designers, not application programmers. </p>

<p>What about those 11 languages? Don't they serve a necessary purpose? Yes. You just don't want application programmers to have to deal with them directly. You want them to be treated the same way we treat assembly code&#151;as something that's generated for us. It's great to have web pages do local field validation. It's just that the validation code should be generated from the data description for us. The same goes for just about everything else in that list. </p>







<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It's all about writing readable code. A quick glance at the transition graph is sufficient for us to understand the flow and information requirements of the application. With all the stub code being generated for us, the only Java code we have to write is the code that does the actual logic. Contrast this to poring through the hundreds of lines of XML, JSP, HTML, Java, and JavaScript code required by J2EE, Spring, and the like, to do the same thing. By eliminating insidious tight coupling, you are able to better understand what your actual objectives are, and extensively simplify the process of creating applications, web-based or otherwise.</p>
