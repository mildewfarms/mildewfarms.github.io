<h2>CA Plex</h2>

<p>CA has announced CA Plex r6, a rapid application development environment that enables model-driven development of web services for .NET, J2EE, and IBM System i. With CA Plex r6, web services can be managed as "first-class" objects. You can view, diagram, document, and manage these objects just as you do others. A .NET 2.0 based C# code generator utilizes OLE-DB to support access to databases. It provides rich interoperability between .NET, Java, and System i applications as well as .NET applications developed with Visual Studio. It also lets you model and deploy applications as Java JAR files and .NET assemblies through a build environment that exploits Apache ANT and MSBuild. <a href="http://www.ca.com">www.ca.com</a></p>

<h2>IMSL Fortran Numerical Library</h2>

<p>Absoft has announced its IMSL Fortran Numerical Library for Mac OS/Intel. The IMSL Library is the standard in mathematical and statistical algorithms for high-performance computing. IMSL is a collection of more than 1000 algorithms covering areas such as numerical optimization, differential equations, time series, and forecasting, regression, and special functions just to name a few. Developed as a companion for Absoft's Pro Fortran v10 compiler suite, they are compatible with both the Tiger and Leopard OS. <a href="http://www.absoft.com">www.absoft.com</a></p>

<h2>Testing Relief</h2>

<p>Iron Ant has unveiled <b>Testing Relief 1.0.0,</b> a testing tool for applications created on .NET. Designed for developers following RUP discipline, Testing Relief analyzes changes made to applications, evaluates how the changes influence all parts of the software, and singles out those parts of the code that depend on the changes but haven't been modified themselves. This helps you focus on the "suspicious" parts of the code and find the bug much quicker because, instead of full test of the code, you can test the code selectively. <b><a href="http://www.testingrelief.com">www.testingrelief.com</a></b>.</p>
