<h2>Polar Rose</h2>

<p>Polar Rose has released tools for combining automatic face recognition with 3D modeling for visual search applications. Available as a free web browser plug-in and through royalty-free APIs, you can create applications that let you automatically search for and recognize faces on a consistent basis similar to the way people do&#151;by using the visual cues of the photo as opposed to nearby text analysis. The technology creates a 3D model from a single 2D image of a face. <a href="http://www.polarrose.com">www.polarrose.com</a></p>

<h2>CrypKey</h2>

<p>CrypKey has released CrypKey SDK 7. The CrypKey SDK supports true client/server network licensing, so that a software license can be shared with any computer on a network without needing a shared drive. Other features of Release 7 include: applications that can act as either license servers or license clients; automatic restart of servers upon reboot; support for an unlimited number of redundant servers; and the ability to specify domains, computers, and users that can or cannot use a particular license. <a href="http://www.crypkey.com">www.crypkey.com</a></p>

<h2>Recursion Software</h2>

<p>Recursion Software released Cinergi 2.1, a multilanguage application integration platform (ESB) that supports service-oriented architectures (SOA). Cinergi 2.1's runtime environment for C++ provides 64-bit support for AIX 5.3 and Linux (Red Hat). Developers using Cinergi's native Windows-like Architect Console can fully leverage 64-bit CPUs for increased performance. Cinergi 2.1 also has a failsafe feature that protects against server failure once the runtime application starts. Cinergi clients and servers communicate regardless of the ability to communicate with the license server. <a href="http://www.recursionsw.com">www.recursionsw.com</a></p>
