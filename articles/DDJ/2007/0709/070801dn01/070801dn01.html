<h2>WiFi-Manager 2.4</h2>

<p>WiFi-Manager 2.4 from Nicomsoft is a library that lets you manage WiFi connections in Windows XP SP2 and Vista. The current 2.4 release includes an option for getting MAC addresses of the current and available networks, a function for getting the RSSI value of available networks, and an improved ActiveX wrapper. Because Windows XP SP2 and Vista have totally different APIs to manage WiFi adapters and networks, the WiFi-Manager library provides a "one-stop" set of API functions to manage WiFi connections and settings in both XP and Vista.  <a href="http://www.nicomsoft.com/wifiman/">www.nicomsoft.com/wifiman/</a></p>
