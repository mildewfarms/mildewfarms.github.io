<h2>Maple-NAG Connector</h2>

<p>The Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) and Maplesoft have announced the Maple-NAG Connector, a toolbox that lets you access NAG C Library numeric routines from inside the Maple environment for fast prototyping and modeling. Development and testing in this interactive environment also eliminate the need for compiling or linking. NAG C Library documentation is integrated into the Maple Help System, and includes hundreds of examples coded in Maple. <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com">www.maplesoft.com</a> and <a href="http://www.nag.com">www.nag.com</a></p>

<h2>GemFire Enterprise 5.0.1</h2>

<p>GemStone Systems has launched GemFire Enterprise 5.0.1 with support for native C++ and .NET clients, which eliminates the need to deploy Java Virtual Machines on application clients or employ wrappers when sharing data between C++ and Java. GemFire Enterprise provides a high-performance, distributed operational data store that drives real-time operations across distributed locations. <a href="http://www.gemstone.com">www.gemstone.com</a></p>

<h2>Real-Time Systems</h2>

<p>Real-Time Systems GmbH (RTS) has announced its Real-Time Hypervisor software that lets real-time operating systems (such as Wind River VxWorks) run simultaneously with a general-purpose operating system (such as Linux) on a single hardware platform while ensuring real-time behavior of the RTOS. Deployment of multiple operating systems on multicore processor platforms is a logical step in embedded systems design, reducing total hardware costs while increasing reliability and system performance.  <a href="http://www.real-time-systems.com">www.real-time-systems.com</a></p>

<h2>Lighthouse Pro</h2>

<p>Artifact Software has introduced Lighthouse Pro, a tool that brings all software development data into a single system so teams can uncover obscure issues and bugs that can doom software projects. Lighthouse Pro has capabilities for managing, monitoring, and measuring software projects. These include task management, requirements management, resource management, project planning, time sheets, test management, defect tracking, issue tracking, change requests, document management, workflow, alerts, role-based security, reports and dashboards, and more. <a href="http://www.artifactsoftware.com">www.artifactsoftware.com</a></p>

<h2>eXtremeDB Fusion</h2>

<p>McObject has released eXtremeDB Fusion, which combines on-disk and all-in-memory data management in a single embedded database system. eXtremeDB Fusion lets you specify one set of data as transient (managed in memory), while choosing on-disk storage for other record types, requiring only a simple database schema declaration. The resulting application retains in-memory strengths, while potentially leveraging the cost savings and built-in durability of on-disk databases.  <a href="http://www.mcobject.com">www.mcobject.com</a></p>

<h2>ULC Mobile 1.0</h2>

<p>Canoo has released ULC Mobile 1.0, a mobile version of its Java RIA library, UltraLightClient (ULC) for mobile devices. ULC Mobile is specially geared for Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) running on top of Java ME. Using ULC Mobile, you can develop Enterprise Web 2.0 applications with a desktop user experience that run on both Java SE and Java ME clients. <a href="http://www.canoo.com">www.canoo.com</a></p>
