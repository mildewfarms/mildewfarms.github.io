<p>Throughout the 20-odd years of its existence, Microsoft Windows has always exhibited a fairly high degree of backward compatibility. With relatively few examples, programs written for one version of Windows continue to run on the next. </p>

<p>Windows Vista continues this trend: It runs programs written for the Win32 API, for the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), for Visual Basic, and for the Windows Forms library of .NET 1.0 and 2.0. </p>

<p>Vista also implements a new application programming interface called the "Windows Presentation Foundation" (WPF), previously known under the codename "Avalon." The WPF is also available under Windows XP with the .NET Framework 3.0 installed. (Alternatively, you can think of WPF as part of .NET 3.0, which can be installed under XP but which is built into Vista.)</p>

<p>Compared with the previous mainstream APIs for Windows, the WPF breaks new ground by implementing two complementary programming interfaces. You can write entire WPF applications in your favorite .NET-compliant programming language such as C# or Visual Basic .NET, but you can also write at least parts of the application using the XML-based Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML, pronounced "zammel"). </p>

<p>Although XAML has been classified as a declarative programming language, it is mostly restricted to instantiation and initialization of visual objects. In simple scenarios, you use XAML to define the layout of controls on your windows, and you use code to implement event handlers for these controls. You compile the XAML and code together into an executable. </p>

<p>However, several features of the WPF&#151;such as data binding and animation&#151;let you write interesting XAML files that stand by themselves. These standalone XAML files can be launched under Vista or .NET 3.0 just like other executables, and they run in the web browser.</p>









<h3>Instantiation and Initialization</h3>

<p>Let's look at some C# code first. Here is some code to create and initialize a <i>ScrollBar</i> control, perhaps in the constructor of a <i>Window</i> class where the <i>ScrollBar</i> appears:</p>



<pre class="code">

ScrollBar scr = new ScrollBar();
scr.Orientation =      Orientation.Vertical;
scr.Minimum = 10;
scr.Maximum = 100;

</pre>


<p><i>Orientation, Minimum,</i> and <i>Maximum</i> look like fields of the <i>ScrollBar</i> class, but they are actually properties. The <i>Orientation</i> property is set to a member of the <i>Orientation</i> enumeration; the other properties are of type <i>double</i>. Properties were introduced in .NET 1.0 as a nice clean syntax to replace pairs of <i>Get</i> and <i>Set</i> methods; for example, <i>GetMinimum</i> and <i>SetMinimum</i>. </p>

<p>Very often, a .NET property provides a public interface to a private field. A property such as <i>Minimum</i> would be associated with a <i>private</i> field initialized to a default value:</p>

<p>     </p>

<pre class="code">

private double min = 0;

</pre>


<p>The definition of the <i>Minimum</i> property starts out looking like a method, but without any parentheses or argument list. Within the property definition are two accessors, labeled <i>get</i> and <i>set</i> with code that might otherwise be found in the corresponding <i>GetMinimum</i> and <i>SetMinimum</i> methods:</p>

<ul>
  </ul>

<pre class="code">

public double Minimum
{
    get
    {
        return min; 
    }
    set
    {
        min = value;
        ...
    }
}

</pre>
<p>The <i>get</i> accessor must terminate with a <i>return</i> instruction with a value of the proper type. Within the <i>set</i> accessor, the word <i>value</i> indicates the value the property is being set to. Notice that ominous ellipsis. Traditionally, what happens next depends on how the <i>ScrollBar</i> class is structured. The object might need to redraw itself based on the new value of <i>Minimum</i>. Perhaps the <i>Value</i> property of <i>ScrollBar</i> is no longer within the range between <i>Minimum</i> and <i>Maximum</i>. <i>Value</i> might then need to be reset, which might trigger an event.</p>

<p> Properties are sometimes called "smart fields" because code is evoked when a property is set or retrieved. The object has the opportunity to react in some way, and that's just not the case with fields. An object doesn't know a field has been set until it checks the value. </p>

<p>My illustration of the <i>Minimum</i> property is actually not how properties like these are defined in the Windows Presentation Foundation. Some properties are, but many are not. Many WPF properties are actually a somewhat different kind of animal called "dependency properties," and the reasons for the extra overhead in the WPF is one of the themes of this article.</p>

<p>Originally, .NET properties seemed to do little more than provide an elegant syntax to replace <i>Set</i> and <i>Get</i> methods. A bonus was revealed when it was time to represent classes in XML-based files, including XAML. The property names simply became XML attributes. Here's the equivalent XAML of the <i>ScrollBar</i> creation and initialization logic:</p>

<pre class="code">
     
&lt;ScrollBar
  Orientation="Horizontal"
  Minimum="0"
  Maximum="150"
/&gt;

</pre>
<p>The problem with this particular <i>ScrollBar</i> is that it doesn't have any effect on anything else in the program. In the general case, you'll want an event handler that's triggered whenever the <i>Value</i> property of the <i>ScrollBar</i> changes. You indicate the method you want to use as the handler for the <i>ValueChanged</i> event in C# code like this:</p>

<pre class="code">

scr.ValueChanged += 
  ScrollBarValueChanged;

</pre>
<p>In XAML, you can indicate the event handler like so:</p>

<pre class="code">

&lt;ScrollBar 
  Orientation="Horizontal"    
  Minimum="0" Maximum="150"
  ValueChanged="ScrollBarValueChanged"
/&gt;

</pre>
<p> However, the handler itself needs to be written in code.</p>

<p>There's another way the <i>ScrollBar</i> could be used, and this alternative approach doesn't require an event handler. It's a data binding. Basically, you establish a link between the <i>Value</i> property of the <i>ScrollBar</i> and a property of some other object. You can establish this binding in code, but it's actually easier to do it in XAML.</p>










<h3>A Stack of Text</h3>

<p>In a WPF program, properties can be set in a variety of ways. They can be set explicitly through code or markup, they can be set through data bindings, they can be set through animations or styles, and they can be set in other ways beyond the scope of this article. Listing One is a XAML file named "PropertySettingsDemo.xaml" that provides a glimpse into this flexibility. If you're running Windows Vista or the .NET Framework 3.0 under Windows XP, you can simply launch this file as if it were a program, and it runs in your web browser. It contains two animations, so what you'll see might look something like Figure 1.</p>

Figure 1: Animations generated by PropertySettingsDemo.xaml. 
</div>
</div>



<p>In the center of the PropertySettingsDemo.xaml file are six <i>TextBlock</i> elements, five of which have their <i>FontSize</i> properties set in five different ways. (The rotating <i>TextBlock</i> is just a gratuitous bonus, but I use it to make a point.) <i>TextBlock</i> is a relatively simple element used to display chunks of text. The six <i>TextBlock</i> elements are grouped as children in a <i>StackPanel</i> element, which stacks its children vertically. The <i>StackPanel</i> is itself a child (along with a <i>ScrollBar</i>) of a <i>DockPanel</i>, which is a child of the top-level element, a <i>Page</i>.</p>

<p>Notice first that the whole program contains no explicit coordinate positions or sizes except for the <i>FontSize</i> property itself. Each <i>TextBlock</i> is entirely capable of determining what size it needs to be, and the <i>StackPanel</i> can arrange these six elements based on those sizes. Also notice that <i>StackPanel</i>'s arrangement of the elements dynamically accommodates the animations.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The first <i>TextBlock</i> element is assigned an explicit <i>FontSize</i> value of 16. In the WPF, values such as this are in units of 1/96 inch, which isn't exactly an industry standard of any sort except that video displays under Windows commonly use a resolution of 96 DPI. The value of 16 translates to 1/6 inch or 12 points.</li>
  <li>The second <i>TextBlock</i> element is assigned a <i>FontSize</i> of 12, but it's used only as a base value for the first of the two animations. The animation takes the <i>FontSize</i> up to a value of 48 over two seconds, then back down over the next two seconds, and repeats the process "forever."</li>
  <li>The third <i>TextBlock</i> doesn't have a <i>FontSize</i> property set, which would normally cause the value to be set to its default, which might be 11 (under Windows XP) or 12 (under Vista). But notice that the top-level <i>Page</i> element has its own <i>FontSize</i> property set to 36 points. That value is inherited by any descendent <i>TextBlock</i> that doesn't have its local <i>FontSize</i> property set.<br>
  You might imagine property inheritance happening in one of two ways. Perhaps the parent element pushes property values on the child. Whenever the parent detects that it's getting another child assigned to it, it sets the <i>FontSize</i> property of the child to its own <i>FontSize</i> property. Or maybe it's a pull mechanism, where the child detects when it's being assigned a parent, and then queries the parent's <i>FontSize</i> property.<br>
  The problem with these two theories, however, is that neither <i>DockPanel</i> nor <i>StackPanel</i> implement the <i>FontSize</i> property, and they know nothing about the <i>FontSize</i> property. The inheritance of the <i>FontSize</i> property is effectively skipping two generations, so the mechanism is obviously more complex than simple push or pull logic might suggest.</li>
  <li>For the fourth <i>TextBlock</i>, I considered having the animation change a <i>ScaleTransform</i> so the <i>TextBlock</i> would grow and shrink in size like the second one, but I decided to add a little variety and apply the animation to a <i>RotateTransform</i>. </li>
  <li>The fifth <i>TextBlock</i> binds its <i>FontSize</i> property to the <i>Value</i> property of the <i>ScrollBar</i> docked at the left of the page. You can use the <i>ScrollBar</i> to change the <i>FontSize</i> to values between 10 and 100 units.</li>
  <li>The sixth <i>TextBlock</i> sets its <i>Style</i> property to a <i>Style</i> object defined as a resource towards the top of the file. The style sets the <i>FontSize</i> property, as well as the horizontal alignment of the element and its color.</li>
</ul>









<h3>Measure and Arrange</h3>

<p>The WPF was conceived early on as supporting automatic sizing and dynamic layout, so it's not surprising to see this mechanism implemented as a fundamental part of WPF architecture. </p>

<p>Layout occurs in two passes, and begins with the highest level element, in this example, the <i>Page</i>. Every element can have zero or more children. Elements that have multiple children go by the generic name of "panel" and are the primary layout mechanisms. The <i>Panel</i> class has several descendants, including <i>DockPanel</i>, <i>StackPanel</i>, <i>WrapPanel</i>, <i>Grid</i>, <i>UniformGrid</i>, and <i>Canvas</i>, which is the panel that lets you position controls and elements with explicit two-dimensional coordinates. </p>

<p>Layout begins with a call to the virtual <i>MeasureOverride</i> method in the top-level element. (This method is defined in <i>FrameworkElement</i> and it has a rather odd name because it essentially replaces a similar method in the <i>UIElement</i> class <i>MeasureCore</i>.) The parameter to this method is an available size. The <i>MeasureOverride</i> method is responsible for calling the <i>Measure</i> method on all its children (if any), which in turn causes a call to the child's own <i>MeasureOverride</i> method. This is how measuring proceeds from the top of the element tree to the bottom. </p>

<p>The <i>Measure</i> method is responsible for determining what size the element should be. When <i>Measure</i> returns, the parent examines the <i>DesiredSize</i> properties of its children and derives a composite size. For example, a <i>StackPanel</i> with a vertical orientation sums the desired heights of all its children.</p>

<p>The second layout pass begins with a call to virtual <i>ArrangeOverride</i> to the top-level element. The parameter indicates a final size for the element. The parent's job is to arrange all its children within that space with a call to each child's <i>Arrange</i> method, which then calls the child's <i>ArrangeOverride</i> method to ripple through the rest of the layout.</p>

<p>Although panels are commonly used to lay out controls and elements within a page or window, they can also be used inside buttons and other controls. For example, a <i>Button</i> might contain a <i>StackPanel</i>, which then contains text and bitmaps.</p>

<p>As the animations are going on inside PropertySettingsDemo.xaml, the <i>StackPanel</i> is continuously rearranging its children based on their changing sizes.</p>









<h3>Retained Graphics</h3>

<p>What's not going on in PropertySettingsDemo.xaml is a lot of redrawing&#151;at least, by most of the <i>TextBlock</i> elements. In earlier Windows programming environments, when a control is moved from one part of a window to another, it needs to be redrawn. The surface of the window is invalidated, which generates repainting calls.</p>

<p>In contrast, the WPF has a retained graphics system. Once an element draws itself&#151;a process that happens in the virtual <i>OnRender</i> method&#151;it doesn't need to draw itself again unless something happens to cause it to require a new appearance. This is the case with the <i>TextBlock</i> whose <i>FontSize</i> is animated, and the one whose <i>FontSize</i> is bound to the <i>ScrollBar</i>. A new <i>FontSize</i> requires redrawing; but the others are drawn only once, including the one being rotated.</p>

<p>To make this program more efficient, it would be better to change the size of <i>TextBlock</i> elements with a <i>ScaleTransform</i> rather than altering the <i>FontSize</i>. The transform is performed on the retained graphics object rather than requiring the element to redraw itself.</p>


<h3>Properties and Dependency Properties</h3>

<p>The developers of the WPF realized they were designing a system where properties could be set in a variety of ways, some of them possibly interacting with each other. It was important to construct a system where these interactions would have strict levels of precedence and predictability. Their solution was to build a layer on top of the existing property mechanism called "dependency properties." </p>

<p>If you were privy to source code for <i>TextBlock</i>, you would probably find it has something like this code:</p>

<pre class="code">

public static DependencyProperty 
  FontSizeProperty =
   DependencyProperty.Register
     ("FontSize", typeof(double), 
      typeof(TextBlock), 
       new FrameworkPropertyMetadata
        (default, flags,
         FontSizeChanged), 
          ValidateFontSize);

</pre>
<p>This is the definition of a static field named <i>FontSizeProperty&#151;that</i> is, the <i>FontSize</i> property name followed by the word <i>Property&#151;</i>of type <i>DependencyProperty</i>. The initialization code that follows could alternatively be in the class's static constructor. This code defines the name of the property, its type (<i>double</i>), its owner, and a <i>default</i> value, indicated by <i>default</i>. Let me come back to the <i>flags</i> parameter.</p>

<p>The code also references two static methods. One provides a systematic approach to validation. The <i>ValidateFontSize</i> method returns <i>True</i> if the <i>FontSize</i> property is being set to a value of at least 1/300 inch.</p>

<pre class="code">

static bool ValidateFontSize
    (object obj)
{
  double fntsize = (double) obj;
  return fntsize &gt; 1.0 / 300;
}

</pre>
<p>I don't have access to WPF source code, so I can't tell you precisely what happens in the method I've called <i>FontSizeChanged</i>. The method is called whenever the <i>FontSize</i> value changes, but it might not exist at all, and if it does, it probably only performs some preparation work, such as creating an object of type <i>FormattedText</i>. Anything more is unnecessary, as you'll see soon.</p>

<p>The <i>TextBlock</i> class also includes a regular <i>FontSize</i> property, but it only refers to the <i>FontSizeProperty</i> dependency property:</p>

<pre class="code">

public double FontSize
{
  get { return (double)
     GetValue (FontSizeProperty);      }
  set { SetValue(FontSizeProperty,
     value); }
}

</pre>
<p>The <i>GetValue</i> and <i>SetValue</i> methods are defined by the <i>DependencyObject</i> class. Any class that implements dependency properties must derive from <i>DependencyObject</i>.</p>

<p>I haven't yet discussed the <i>flags</i> parameter in the dependency property initialization code, and for the <i>FontSize</i> property, these flags are crucial. The <i>flags</i> parameter consists of zero or more members of the <i>FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions</i> enumeration, combined with the bitwise <i>OR</i> operator. For <i>FontSize</i>, there are three flags set:</p>



<ul>
  <li>The <i>AffectsMeasure</i> flag indicates that whenever the <i>FontSize</i> property changes, the current measure information for the element should be invalidated. This causes a call to the <i>MeasureOverride</i> method, which then triggers a call to <i>ArrangeOverride</i> so the element can be repositioned based on its new size. </li>
  <li>The <i>AffectsRender</i> flag indicates that whenever the <i>FontSize</i> property changes, the current visual appearance of the element is invalidated, generating a call to <i>OnRender</i>. Notice that the <i>AffectsMeasure</i> and <i>AffectsRender</i> flags are independent. For example, the <i>Foreground</i> property, which indicates the color of the text displayed by the <i>TextBlock</i>, has its <i>AffectsRender</i> flag set but not <i>AffectMeasure</i> because the color doesn't affect the size of the element.</li>
  <li>Finally, the <i>Inherits</i> flag is set, indicating that the <i>FontSize</i> property can be set from the element's closest ancestor. </li>
</ul>



<p>Yes, the <i>TextBlock</i> element is still responsible for determining how large it needs to be and what it should look like, but all the notification mechanisms for property changes have been encapsulated in the <i>DependencyProperty</i> object. <i>TextBlock</i> doesn't have to invalidate its size or rendering information, nor does <i>TextBlock</i> have to worry about how property inheritance works. The retained graphics system provides that any change to these properties won't cause flickering on the screen.</p>

<p>Dependency properties are so important that data binding and animation don't work with anything that's not a dependency property. The data-binding and animation markup in PropertySettingsDemo.xaml seems to refer to the <i>FontSize</i> property, but binding and animation classes actually access the <i>FontSizeProperty</i> field directly. </p>

<p>That means that if you're writing a WPF class in which you want properties to be bindable or animatable, you'll want to make them dependency properties, and in the process save yourself from implementing a lot of custom notification logic.</p>
