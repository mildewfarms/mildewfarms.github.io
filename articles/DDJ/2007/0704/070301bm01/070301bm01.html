<h1>Windows Workflow Foundation and Web Services</h1>
<h2>Activities that let your workflow become a web service</h2>

<p>Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) is the programming model and tools for building "workflow-enabled" (a set of related activities representing specific business logic) Windows applications. The ultimate goal of WF is to simplify development of business processes in .NET. One of the activities that Windows Workflow provides is an activity for working with web services, along with several activities that let your workflow become a web service. In this article, I introduce the InvokeWebService activity, which lets you work with existing web services. I also introduce three other activities&#151;WebServiceInput, WebServiceOutput, and WebServiceFault&#151;that let you create your workflow as a web service.</p>

<h3>InvokeWebService Activity</h3>

<p>Windows Workflow Foundation supports three workflows: Sequential, State Machine, and Data-Driven. You can use the <i>InvokeWebService</i> activity in both the Sequential and State Machine workflows. It's similar to using a web service in any other .NET application. First, you must reference the web service, then you can access it. To illustrate, I present a simple web service that returns a value of <i>True</i>. Although impractical in the real world, it gives a good example of how the interaction works. </p>

<p>The first step in this example is to create a simple web service. The completed web service, <i>SimpleWebService</i>, is available electronically; see "Resource Center," page 5. However, if you wish to build the web service, here are the steps to do it. (If you aren't familiar with web services, you can find an introduction to web services in Chapter 10 of my book <i>Beginning Object-Oriented ASP.NET 2.0 with VB.NET</i>; Apress, 2005.)</p>

<p>Create a new web site, choose ASP.NET Web Service, and call the service <i>SimpleWebService</i>. When the web service is created, open the Service.vb file if it isn't already open. Replace the <i>HelloWorld</i> default web method with the following:</p>



<pre class="code">
Public Function IsUser(ByVal UserName As
                     String) As Boolean
   If UserName = "Brian" Then
     Return True
   Else
     Return False
   End    If
End Function

</pre>


<p>Build the web service, then close the project. To test the web service, enter: </p>



<pre class="code">
http://
  localhost/SimpleWebService/Service.asmx 

</pre>
<p>in your web browser. The Service web service default page appears, listing the web methods (<i>IsUser</i>). Click the <i>IsUser</i> link, enter <i>Brian</i> as the <i>UserName</i> parameter, and click <i>Invoke</i>. An XML document appears in a new browser window; it says <i>True</i>. Close the XML document window, enter <i>Me</i> as the <i>UserName</i> parameter, and click <i>Invoke</i>. This time the XML document contains <i>False</i>, showing that the web service is working correctly. </p>

<p>Create a new VB Sequential Workflow Console Application called "VBWebServiceSequentialConsole." Drag an <i>InvokeWebService</i> activity onto the Workflow Designer. As soon as the activity is added to the workflow, the Add Web Reference window appears. Click the <i>Web Services on the Local Machine </i>link. A list of the web services on the local machine is listed here. Find the link with the URL listed as: </p>



<pre class="code">
http://localhost/SimpleWebService/Service.asmx. 

</pre>
<p>The Services column lists <i>Service</i>. Click the URL. The Service default page appears as it did in the browser previously. Change the Web Reference Name to <i>SimpleWebService</i> and click the Add Reference button. This is the same as adding a web reference to a VB or C# application.</p>

<p>After the Add Web Reference window closes, click the <i>InvokeWebService</i> activity and view the properties. Change the name to <i>InvokeSimpleWebService</i>. Click the <i>MethodName</i> property and choose <i>IsUser</i> from the drop-down. Each <i>InvokeWebService</i> activity lets you interact with one web method exposed by the web service. Once you choose <i>IsUser</i>, the <i>(ReturnValue)</i> and <i>UserName</i> properties appear under Parameters, as in Figure 1. These two properties let you provide values or variable names that contain the values to send to the web method when it's called.</p>

<p>View the code for the workflow to add the necessary variables. Add the following code within the workflow class declaration:</p>

<pre class="code">

Public LoginName As String = "Brian"
Public ValueReturned As Boolean = False

</pre>
<p>Return to the Workflow Designer, click the <i>InvokeSimpleWebService</i> activity, and view the properties. Click the ellipse next to the <i>UserName</i> property. This opens the Bind to Property window. Choose <i>LoginName</i> from the tree under <i>Workflow1</i>, as in Figure 2. </p>

<p>Right-click the <i>(ReturnValue)</i> property name and choose <i>Commands</i> if it's not already selected. You should now see a <i>Promote Bindable Properties </i>link at the bottom of the Properties window. Click the <i>Promote Bindable Properties </i>link. A default value is placed in the <i>Return</i> <i>Value</i> property. Click the ellipse next to the <i>Return</i> <i>Value</i> property; this brings up the <i>Bind</i> Property window again. Choose <i>ValueReturned</i> from the list under <i>Workflow1</i>; see Figure 3. The <i>Parameters</i> properties for <i>InvokeSimpleWebService</i> look like Figure 4.</p>

<p>Drag a <i>Code</i> activity onto the Workflow Designer before the <i>InvokeSimpleWebService</i> activity. Call this <i>Code</i> activity <i>BeforeInvokeCode</i>, generate Handlers for the activity, and add the following code to the sub generated:</p>



<pre class="code">
MsgBox("Before Invoke: " &amp; ValueReturned)


</pre>
<p>This displays a message box with the value of <i>blnReturn</i> prior to the web service being called. Next, drag a <i>Code</i> activity onto the Workflow Designer after the <i>InvokeSimpleWebService</i>. Call this <i>Code</i> activity <i>AfterInvokeCode</i>, generate Handlers for the activity, and add the following code to the sub generated:</p>



<pre class="code">
MsgBox("After Invoke: " &amp; ValueReturned)

</pre>
<p>Execute the workflow, and you'll see the Before box appear with <i>False</i> and the After box appear with <i>True</i>. This shows that the workflow called out to the web service providing the variable <i>LoginName</i> as a parameter, and received the parameter <i>ValueReturned</i> back. </p>

<p>There's little change between the Sequential workflow and the State Machine workflow. The only difference is that the <i>InvokeWebService</i> activity must be placed inside an <i>EventDriven</i> activity, like any other activity within a State Machine workflow. Also, the logic behind the code is the same between VB and C#.</p>











<h3>Workflow as a Web Service</h3>

<p>Using the <i>WebServiceInput</i>, <i>WebServiceOutput</i>, and <i>WebServiceFault</i> activities, you can expose your workflow as a web service. This has some advantages, especially within SOA environments and when deploying a Windows-based application instead of a web-based application. In this section, I present an example of a simple workflow that's exposed as a web service. First, create a VB Sequential Workflow Library called "<i>VBAsWebServiceSequentialLibrary</i>."</p>

<p>Make sure you select Sequential Workflow Library. Change the name of the Workflow1.vb file to "WorkflowAsService.vb." Open the workflow file (WorkflowAsService.vb) and view the code. Add <i>Public</i> <i>ValueEntered</i> <i>As</i> <i>Integer</i> to the workflow class declaration. This variable holds the inputted value and allows manipulation of it. Next, you must define the interface that will be exposed. An interface is what other applications wanting to use this web service will see. It defines any methods or properties that other applications can use to interact with the web service, and is a core OOP concept. To define the interface, add the following:</p>



<pre class="code">
Public Interface IWorkflowAsWebService
    Function AcceptValue(ByVal InputValue As 
                       Integer) As Integer
End Interface

</pre>


<p>Any application wanting to use this web service will see only the <i>AcceptValue</i> method, and will see that this method expects a parameter that is of type <i>Integer</i>. Next, view the designer and add a <i>WebServiceInput</i> activity to the workflow. Leave the default name, but click the ellipse next to Interface Type. This displays a window that lets you pick a .NET <i>Type</i>. You want to select the interface that was just defined. You can do this by clicking the Current Project folder on the left and selecting the defined interface, as in Figure 5.</p>

<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>


<p>Set <i>IsActivating</i> to <i>True</i>, because the first <i>WebServiceInput</i> activity within a workflow must have the <i>IsActivating</i> property set to <i>True</i>. From the drop-down list next to the <i>Method</i> <i>Name</i> property, choose <i>AcceptValue</i>. This links the call to the <i>WebServiceInput</i> activity to the interface. When an application using this web service makes a call to this web service and executes <i>AcceptValue</i>, the workflow engine will know to call this <i>WebServiceInput</i> activity. Finally, from the drop-down next to <i>InputValue</i> under the parameters, select <i>IntInputValue</i>. Click the <i>Promote Bindable Properties</i> link at the bottom of the Properties window. Click the ellipse next to the <i>InputValue</i> property and choose <i>ValueEntered</i> from the Bind Properties dialog box. This ties the value passed in as a parameter to <i>AcceptValue</i> to the <i>ValueEntered</i> variable defined within the workflow. The properties of the <i>WebServiceInput</i> activity look like Figure 6.</p>

<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>


<p>Add a <i>WebServiceOutput</i> activity to the workflow. Leave the name as the default. Use the drop-down next to <i>InputActivityName</i> to select <i>WebServiceInputActivity1</i>. This property ties the two activities together, so the input activity is receiving information, the output is sending the information, and it's the same information. Click the <i>Promote Bindable Properties</i> link at the bottom of the Properties window. Click the ellipse next to the <i>Return</i> <i>Value</i> property and choose <i>ValueEntered</i> from the Bind Properties dialog box. Again, this ties the value returning to the application that calls this web service to the variable declared within this class.</p>

<p>Next, click <i>GenerateHandlers</i> at the bottom of the Properties window. This generates code to be executed when the activity is executed. When the sub is created, add:</p>



<pre class="code">
IntInputValue = IntInputValue + 10

</pre>
<p>This simply adds 10 to the value provided by the calling application. Now the workflow is complete. The workflow will accept a value, add 10 to that value, and return it to the calling application. This simple example shows how you can use a workflow as a web service. </p>

<p>The final step to make a workflow into a web service is to publish the workflow as a web service. To do this, right-click the project name within the Solution Explorer and choose Publish as Web Service. A solution is created within the Solution Explorer, and all the necessary files are also created. To view the created web service, right-click the file with the .asmx extension (VBAsWebServiceSequentialLibrary.WorkflowAsService_Web-Service.asmx) and choose View In Browser. This opens the .asmx file in the browser. Click the <i>AcceptValue</i> link to test the <i>AcceptValue</i> method. Enter <i>10</i> as the <i>InputValue</i> and click the <i>Invoke</i> button. The result of <i>20</i> appears in the XML file. This shows the workflow working as a web service.</p>
