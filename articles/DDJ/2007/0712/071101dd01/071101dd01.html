<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you do there?</p>

<p><b>WH:</b> I'm a lead software systems engineer and project team manager. I work with a team that develops air-traffic management systems (concepts, requirements, and prototypes) for the FAA and other aviation organizations.</p>

<p><i>Employer:</i> Wonderware/Invensys</p>

<p><i>Job:</i> Director, Platform Development</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b> What do you like best about your job?</p>

<p><b>KK:</b> That my job allows me to be innovative with regard to software development practices in an environment that's highly pragmatic and business focused.  We're in an environment where no one has to negotiate whether we should use the best tools that money can buy, where managers are incentivized to take calculated risks and push the envelope on what can be achieved, and not settle for second-best at any level. We have a lot of programmers and testers. It's a constant challenge to ensure that we get the best ROI from our resources that they are working on the most important projects, [which] will give us the highest return from the market, and do so using the most efficient manner possible.</p>

<p><b>DDJ:</b>  What have you found that makes your job easier?</p>

<p><b>KK:</b> Here are a few things that I found that make my job easier:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Great source-control systems such as ClearCase.</li>
  <li>VMWare's LabManager. Being able to create new images, for any OS, any configuration, within minutes. Use the fresh image, and then recycle.</li>
  <li>A formal "Development Integration" phase where software is formally delivered from Development to QA. It's a three-day phase that requires a group outside of both Dev and QA to run through the software with the Use Case at hand. Only once the basic functionality is working is software formally delivered to QA for testing.</li>
  <li>NUnit.</li>
  <li>SAFS.</li>
  <li>WinDbg training from Microsoft.</li>
  <li>Remote Desktop.</li>
  <li>Sharepoint.</li>
</ul>
