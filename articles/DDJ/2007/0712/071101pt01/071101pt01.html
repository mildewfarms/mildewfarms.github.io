<p>Widespread use of XML has established it as a lingua franca. The choice of XML to represent ever-increasing amounts of data led to the need for a query language that uses the structure of XML intelligently to express queries across the diverse kinds of data XML can be used to represent. W3C has developed a formal specification of such a query language; it is called XQuery. </p>

<p>The best approach to learning XQuery is one that comes naturally to developers&#151;examine a few examples and start writing queries. The eXist open-source native XML database (http://exist.sourceforge.net) comes with a sandbox that makes such an approach easy; see Figure 1. In the upper window, the query <i>doc("musicians.xml")/musicians/musician</i> searches the document contained in the file "musicians.xml" (Listing One) for all <i>musician</i> nodes that are children of the node named <i>musicians</i>. The results of the query are displayed in the lower window.</p>

<h3>Using XQuery From Java</h3>

<p>The eXist sandbox is an excellent learning tool and can be useful for composing and executing ad hoc queries; however, as you surely discovered when you used SQL, the real power of XQuery comes when it is used in an application. QueryExample.java (available online; see <a href="http://www.ddj.com/code/">www.ddj.com/code/</a>) is a Java program from the eXist Developer's Guide that can be used to execute <i>XQueries</i>. There are many implementations of XQuery. Because we had already installed eXist to use the sandbox, we chose the <i>XML:DB</i> API that eXist uses. This API can work with any native or XML-enabled database for which a suitable driver has been written. If you examine the Java code, you see that it is roughly analogous to using JDBC. You start by using the following code to load the driver:</p>

<pre class="code">

String driver =    "org.exist.xmldb.DatabaseImpl";
Class cl = Class.forName(driver);	
  Database database =      (Database)cl.newInstance();
DatabaseManager.registerDatabase   (database);


</pre>
<p>The only difference between this code and its JDBC counterpart is the last line, which registers the <i>Database</i> object with the <i>DatabaseManager</i>. Each vendor delivers its own implementation of <i>Database</i>, which is the encapsulation of the database driver functionality that is necessary to access an XML database. The <i>DatabaseManager</i> class provides access to a <i>Collection</i>. The <i>Collection</i> interface represents a collection of <i>Resources</i> stored in an XML database. The <i>Resource</i> interface represents a container for data stored within the database.</p>

<p>Next, you get a <i>Collection</i> object using this code:</p>

<pre class="code">

Collection col =    DatabaseManager.getCollection(
"xmldb:exist://localhost:8080   /exist/xmlrpc/db"


</pre>
<p>The URI starts with <i>xmldb:</i> and the rest is vendor specific, but the overall format resembles the URIs you have used in JDBC.</p>

<p>From the collection, you obtain a <i>Service</i> instance:</p>

<pre class="code">

XPathQueryService service =
  (XPathQueryService) col.getService   ("XPathQueryService", "1.0");


</pre>
<p><i>XPathQueryService</i> is an implementation of the <i>Service</i> interface that enables the execution of XPath queries within the context of a <i>Collection</i> or against a single XML <i>Resource</i> stored in the <i>Collection</i>. The <i>Service</i> interface is equivalent to the <i>Statement</i> interface in JDBC.</p>

<p>You then execute the query using the following statement:</p>

<pre class="code">

ResourceSet result =    service.query(args[0]);


</pre>
<p>The argument to the <i>query()</i> method is a string whose contents is the XQuery. In our example, rather than hardcoding an XQuery, we generalized the program by accepting the XQuery as a command-line argument. The <i>query()</i> method returns a <i>ResourceSet</i>, which is similar to the <i>ResultSet</i> in JDBC. We complete our program by iterating over the <i>ResourceSet</i> and displaying the content of each <i>Resource</i> it contains. The code looks like this:</p>

<pre class="code">

ResourceIterator i =    result.getIterator();
while(i.hasMoreResources()) {
  Resource r = i.nextResource();
    System.out.println       ((String)r.getContent());
    }


</pre>
<p><i>QueryResults</i> (available online) shows the results obtained when you run the program using this command-line argument:</p>

<pre class="code">

doc("musicians.xml")/musicians/musician[birthDate&gt;="1960-01-01" and birthDate&lt;"1965-01-01"] 

</pre>









<h3>The Relation to XPath</h3>

<p>If you are familiar with XPath, you'll recognize the syntax of the XQuery we just executed. That's because XQuery is built on XPath. XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 share the same data model and support the same functions and operators. As a matter of fact, every XPath expression is a valid XQuery. This is good news because if you have already learned and used XPath, it won't take much additional study to master XQuery.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>FLWOR</h3>

<p>FLWOR, an acronym for "For, Let, Where, Order by, Return," describes a type of expression used in XQuery that is similar to the "SELECT FROM WHERE ORDER BY" you know from SQL. Here is a description of the FLWOR clauses:</p>

<ul>
    <li><i>for</i> iterates over the result of an expression and binds a variable to each item returned by the expression.</li>
  <li><i>let</i> binds a variable to the result of an expression.</li>
  <li><i>where</i> filters the tuples of variable bindings that are generated by the <i>for</i> and <i>let</i> clauses.</li>
  <li><i>order</i> <i>by</i> specifies the order in which values are processed by the <i>return</i> clause.</li>
  <li><i>return</i> evaluates the expression in the clause once for each tuple of bound variables that is generated by the <i>for</i>, <i>let</i>, <i>where</i>, and <i>order by</i> clauses and concatenates the results of all the evaluations into a single sequence, which becomes the result of the FLWOR expression.</li>
  <li> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>The practice of placing frequently used segments of code into functions is common to all programming languages. XQuery is no different. We have already mentioned that XQuery supports the same functions as XPath. There are over 100 built-in functions (for a summary, see www.w3schools.com/xpath/xpath_functions .asp). You can also write your own functions. XQuery functions exist within a namespace. Each function name consists of a prefix that is a shortcut to the namespace followed by a colon followed by the function name. The default prefix, which you can see in the list of built-in functions, is <i>fn:</i>. For user-written functions, you can use the prefix <i>local:</i>.</p>

<p>A function that uses a FLWOR expression to perform the equivalent of the join with which you are familiar from SQL is <i>printBandMemberInstrument</i> (available online). It joins musicians.xml, which we have already seen, and band.xml (which is also available online). Notice that the <i>return</i> clause can contain XML tags as well as data.</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>XQuery provides the same power and flexibility for XML as SQL does for relational data. XQuery also makes it possible for you to query  office documents&#151;spreadsheets, word-processing documents, and the like. For more details, see Marc Van Cappellen's article "XQuery Your Office Documents" (<a href="http://www.ddj.com/linux-open-source/202401913">www.ddj.com/linux-open-source/202401913</a>).</p>
