Rapid advancements in technology and consistent Internet growth are creating an ongoing demand for technical talent. Organizations of all sizes are focused on sustaining growth and reducing operating expenses &#151; and technology professionals are developing some of the tools that can help them get there. </p><p>Because IT impacts every aspect of a company's operations &#151; from supply chain management to customer service &#151; firms are not only recruiting qualified candidates with the technical skills required, they're also seeking those with a combination of strong interpersonal and analytical skills who can serve on interdepartmental project teams.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>So, what sort of hiring environment can you expect in the next year as an IT professional? According to the RHI Quarterly CIO Hiring Index, the forecast remains strong for the next three months, and compensation &#151; particularly for those with skills in the hottest job categories &#151; will continue to increase. Overall, average starting salaries in the United States are expected to increase 8.4 percent over last year.</p><p>Whether you're considering a new job or not, here's what you need to know about the hottest positions this year &#151; and some critical information on how to successfully manage your career over the long term.</p><h3>Networking</h3><p>Networking experts remain in strong demand as companies continue to upgrade their infrastructures to meet internal and external communication requirements. In fact, it was ranked as one of the job categories most in demand by chief information officers (CIOs) surveyed for the semiannual RHI Consulting Hot Jobs Report (the Hot Jobs Report tracks job growth in information technology through a survey of more than 1400 CIOs nationwide); see <A NAME="rt1"><A HREF="0104kt1.htm">Table 1</A>. As technology is further integrated with business objectives, businesses will continue to seek those skilled in systems design and implementation as well as network architecture. Networking specialists are needed to help firms design, administer, and expand local and wide area networks (LAN/WAN) including voice and data integration. Companies will also seek individuals who can incorporate distributed data and troubleshoot technical problems.</p><p>How much will starting salaries rise for those in the networking field? According to RHI Consulting's 2001 Salary Guide, network engineers will see the largest projected average rise in starting salaries &#151; from $62,500 to $85,250, a 10.1 percent increase over 2000. Network administrators can expect a 9.8 percent increase in starting compensation, from $48,000 to $69,250. </p><p>What are some of the skills and certifications required for this area of IT? Experience in Windows NT, UNIX, Novell, and Linux systems; and certifications such as Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE), Certified NetWare Engineer/Administrator (CNE/A), Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE), and Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) are highly valued. And in addition to technical knowledge, those in networking should possess strong interpersonal and business skills since their projects may involve colleagues from many departments within a company.</p><h3>Internet/Intranet and  E-Commerce Development</h3><p>Skilled web site developers will remain in strong demand this year. E-business initiatives continue to fuel hiring activity as more firms rely on the web to streamline internal processes, increase productivity, and market products and services. Companies seek web developers, administrators, and programmers who can assist with the development and integration of web-based business applications.</p><p>Internet developers will be paid average starting salaries of $56,250 to $76,750 per year, a 10.8 percent increase over 2000. E-commerce specialists will see a 10.1 percent increase in starting compensation, to the range of between $59,750 and $89,500 annually.</p><p>Those professionals who are most marketable in this area possess Visual Basic, Visual C++, HTML, ASP, Java, and JavaScript experience. They also should have an understanding of business strategy and company objectives because their jobs can directly affect the growth of business in areas such as consumer and business-to-business electronic commerce. </p><h3>Network Security</h3><p>Companies are becoming more proactive in securing internal and external networks &#151; particularly those that are web-based &#151; to prevent security breaches before they disrupt business operations. In a survey conducted earlier this year by RHI Consulting, 58 percent of CIOs said they had increased their investment in hardware, software, and personnel to support their company's network security initiatives. Firms are placing a premium on technical expertise in such areas as encryption and authentication, safeguarding firewalls, intrusion monitoring, and administration of virtual private networks (VPNs).</p><p>Network security leads all job categories with average starting salaries projected to rise 10.9 percent. A security manager can expect to be paid between $70,500 and $102,750 to start, a 12.7 percent increase over 2000. Network firewall specialists will see an average starting compensation rise  of 8.4 percent over 2000 to between $59,750 and $82,750 annually.</p><p>Those in this field should possess security-related hardware and software experience; LAN/WAN management and systems administration (Windows NT/2000, UNIX, or Linux), as well as a background in VPNs, TCP/IP, intrusion detection, and firewall implementation.</p><h3>Database Administration </h3><p>The increased demand for specialists in this area has been fueled largely by the need for database-driven applications that provide management with up-to-the-minute information about business expenses, sales, and customer demographics. Competitiveness in the global marketplace coupled with pressure to bring products to market even faster has prompted businesses to allocate resources to these applications. More database professionals are also required due to the growth of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems that incorporate finance, manufacturing, and HR functions into a single software package. A third major contributor to the increased demand for database expertise has been the need to mine data stored in corporate databases for e-commerce and other web applications. </p><p>Database administrators will see the largest increase in starting salary for this category &#151; between $72,500 and $105,750 annually, up 11.8 percent from the previous year. Close behind are database managers, who will earn between $82,000 and $106,000 in 2001 &#151; an increase of 10.8 percent over the prior year.</p><p>The job market is particularly favorable for database administrators who can manage, maintain and develop database systems; systems integrators proficient in working with applications from SAP, Siebel, PeopleSoft, and Oracle; and Java programmers experienced in integrating Internet applications with corporate databases.</p><h3>Understanding the Big Picture, Developing a Desk-Side Manner</h3><p>While it's important to possess the technical skills for today's hottest jobs, it's also necessary for your long-term career growth to know how each specialty fits into the business as a whole and to develop your soft skills. </p><p>Not clearly understanding your company's industry and needs limits your effectiveness in creating solutions. Learn more about your business's goals and objectives. Have you read your company's annual report? How about its mission statement? These are the absolute basics, but many workers fail to demonstrate the initiative to become experts on their employer's operations.</p><p>Similarly, soft skills are as important as technical knowledge in an IT professional's career. Just like doctors, technology specialists need to be able to diplomatically translate technical terms and issues into something that is relevant to a nontechnical audience. In a recent survey by RHI Consulting, 97 percent of CIOs indicated that they look for well-developed soft skills when hiring IT staff. Whether you're training an end user or strategizing with senior management, here are some guidelines to help you develop your interpersonal skills: </p><ul>  <li>Be a good listener. This skill probably sounds easier than it is. Good listeners are able to focus their full attention on the speaker and tune out everything else around them. They also wait their turn to speak &#151; even if they disagree with what they hear. Solid listening skills will not only ensure you understand what end users or those in management are saying, but will also help you establish rapport and build trust with those individuals.  <li>Offer some validation. Try not to be defensive when someone complains about a technical issue (the network is too slow or they can't access their e-mail). Acknowledge the concern, explain what steps you'll take to investigate the problem and promise to contact them shortly with a plan of action if you don't have an immediate solution.   <li>Increase your availability. When a network goes down or a computer crashes, users tend to lose patience &#151; especially if they have to search a long time for help. You can earn their trust by addressing their concerns as quickly as possible when a problem occurs.   <li>Keep your message simple. If you're making a formal presentation, provide an outline of the technical information &#151; don't elaborate unless you have a request to do so. Provide enough background to help your audience understand the topic without overwhelming them.  <li>Avoid technical jargon. Eliminate as many acronyms and buzzwords as possible when explaining a complex issue. Use analogies to simplify technical details. Diagrams can also help to clarify concepts.  <li>Use tact. Try not to make anyone feel incompetent. If you don't have an answer to a problem, admit it. It's better to tell someone that you'll get back to him or her later with the solution.</ul><h3>Maintaining Technical Skills</h3><p>It's important to seize every opportunity to enhance your skills because new technologies are introduced constantly. Committing to lifelong learning to improve your technical abilities will play a major role in your future marketability and success on the job. Here are some suggestions to help you refresh your skills on a regular basis:</p><p></p><ul>  <li>Attend classes on emerging technologies. Enrolling in a continuing education program in a hot area of specialization or developing your business-related skills is worth the investment. You'll become more marketable and expand your personal network. Many employers offer reimbursement for this sort of training.  <li>Visit tradeshows, read industry trade publications, and participate in user groups and industry associations. These resources will provide insight into what's new in the field and what may be in demand in the months to come.  <li>Look at classified ads and Internet job listings. Check to see if your skills match those sought by companies that are hiring. This will help you get an idea of areas in which you may require additional training or improvement.  <li>Volunteer at local schools or nonprofit organizations. Apply your abilities to the technical needs of these groups. They may have particularly challenging issues and could help you develop additional skills.  <li>Become certified in a specific technology. In an RHI Consulting survey of 470 IT consultants, 83 percent said that technical certification was a valuable tool for career advancement. If you want to continue moving forward, additional certifications can help you get to the next level. For example, if you're a network administrator, you may want to consider certifications such as Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) or Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE).</ul><p>Even though the demand for IT expertise is high, it's still critical to remain up-to-date on the latest trends in your particular area of specialization and the technology industry as a whole so you can update your skills accordingly. If you stay flexible and open to new developments that could change your job in the future, you'll be on your way to being a master in your field.</p><p><b>DDJ</b></p></body></html>
