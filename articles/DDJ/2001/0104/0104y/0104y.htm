<p><i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i> April 2001</p>

<p>Neoware Systems has introduced NeoLinux 2.0, an embedded version of the Red Hat Linux distribution designed for Internet appliances. NeoLinux includes a customizable user interface which creates connections to servers. Also included is a software distribution capability, letting new software features be added to appliances across a network, and a management utility allowing NeoLinux devices to be discovered across the net and updated in groups. Neoware is making "snap-ins" that can be distributed over the network to add capabilities such as wireless Ethernet, floppy disk drivers, Adobe Acrobat, or Macromedia Flash to the operating system. An appliance running NeoLinux can be powered down by pressing the on/off switch, and the system can run in a read-only mode to protect itself from unauthorized changes.</p>

<p>Upspring has released Version 2.0 of its Software Quality Benchmark product. The SQB is produced from a database of individual quality assessment reports, and reports a "defect found percentage" for the categories of programming standards, portability, globalization, and structure. The number of defects found by the SQB are compared to the total number of possible defects for each category. Particularly emphasized within the SQB are measures like memory leaks that can cause severe crashes and bugs like empty statement bodies that are not captured by standard tools and compilers.</p>
