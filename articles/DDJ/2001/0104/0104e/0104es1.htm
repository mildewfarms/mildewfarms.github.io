The steps and substeps, which correspond to the coding steps in <A NAME="rl1"><A HREF="0104e.htm#l1">Listing One</A>, illustrate how you can use SAL.</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Aggregate points to trajectory curves. Given input points; <A NAME="rf6"><A HREF="0104ef6.htm">Figure 6</A>(a). Compute a neighborhood graph, constructed by a minimal spanning tree (MST) algorithm on a Delaunay triangulation, to encode spatial adjacency of points from the input field; <A NAME="rf6"><A HREF="0104ef6.htm">Figure 6</A>(b). Form equivalence classes of points from the MST by deleting inconsistent edges in the MST that are significantly longer than neighboring edges; <A NAME="rf6"><A HREF="0104ef6.htm">Figure 6</A>(c). Each of the resulting connected components in the graph forms an equivalence class of consistent points.<b></p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>Step 2. </b>Aggregate trajectory curves to trajectory bundles. Redescribe the equivalence classes of consistent points as trajectory curves; <A NAME="rf6"><A HREF="0104ef6.htm">Figure 6</A>(d). Aggregate trajectory curves into a neighborhood graph such that curves are adjacent if any of their constituent points are neighbors in the underlying minimal spanning tree; <A NAME="rf6"><A HREF="0104ef6.htm">Figure 6</A>(e). Classify connected curves into the same equivalence class if their shape is relatively similar; <A NAME="rf6"><A HREF="0104ef6.htm">Figure 6</A>(f).</p><p><A NAME="rf7"><A HREF="0104ef7.htm">Figure 7</A> shows an interactive interpreter session for another application.</p><p> &#151;  F.Z., C.
