But then, I do have a copy &#151; and a very special one it is. As you might expect, we're pretty proud of this 25th anniversary issue of <i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i>. Computer magazines have come and gone over the years, but <i>DDJ</i> has been there throughout as <i>the </i>magazine of record for the programming community. Imitation being the sneakiest form of flattery, other magazines have openly borrowed <i>DDJ</i>'s look and feel, but just never got it right. That's because there's something special about this magazine &#151; its history, its writers, its readers, its mission &#151; that's hard to put your thumb on. From TinyBasic to open source, <i>DDJ</i> hasn't just reported on the practice of programming &#151; it is the practice of programming. </p><p>Okay, if you've had your fill of sappy, self-indulgent back-patting, well, you haven't seen anything yet. So please, indulge me once every 25 years. On the outside, the magazine you're holding in your hands is a far cry from the tabloid Dennis Allison and Bob Albrecht launched as <i>Dr. Dobb's Journal of Calisthenics and Orthodontia: Running Light Without Overbyte</i>. It is a little slicker and the topics covered are more wide ranging than in January 1976. But what hasn't changed is <i>DDJ</i>'s commitment to sharing technical information that is the heart and soul of computer programming &#151; and our belief that computers can indeed make the world a better place. In the early days of <i>DDJ</i>, these ideals were referred to as "realizable fantasies," and they are core concepts that are as true today as then.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>That said, I'd like to acknowledge a number of people who deserve recognition. Of course, the danger here is that I'll surely leave off more deserving names than not. Still, the following individuals in one way or another have embodied the <i>DDJ</i> spirit and contributed to its longevity. The list starts, quite naturally, with Bob and Dennis &#151; <i>DDJ's</i> founders (the "D" from "Dennis" and "ob" from "Bob" &#151; get it?), along with Jim Warren, <i>DDJ</i>'s first editor. I'm grateful that all three stay in contact and care enough to tell us what we're doing wrong. Then there's any number of the other early editors &#151; Jef Raskin, Marlin Ouverson, Tom Williams, and Nick Turner (who still owes me an article). Ray Duncan, who has been a columnist and contributing editor for nearly 20 years. Allen Holub, who taught a generation of programmers about the mysteries of C. Early contributors Bob Blum, H.T. Gordon, Mike Gabrielson, Lichen Wang, Anthony Skjellum (who also owes me an article), Dave Caulkins, and Dave Cortesi. James Hendrix, and Ron Cain, both of Small-C fame. Columnists Jeff Duntemann, Martin Tracy, Ernie Tello, the late Kent Porter, Michael Abrash, Andrew Schulman, and of course my good friend Al Stevens. Thanks to Ray Valdes, Eugene Kim, Mike Floyd, and Tim Kientzle. Longtime contributors Mark Nelson, Jack Woehr, Al Williams, Bruce Schneier, Greg Wilson, Dennis Shasha, Jon Bentley, and Tom Genereaux. Of course, the rascally Michael Swaine, who single-handedly riled most of Canada against me. The list of people who have written for <i>DDJ</i> over the years is a programmer's who's who and there just isn't enough space to acknowledge everyone. But thanks to you all, and know that if you published an article in <i>DDJ</i>, you're someone special.</p><p>Inside the walls of <i>DDJ</i> world headquarters, Monica Berg has been around longer than anyone. Likewise, longtime <i>DDJ</i> publisher Peter Hutchinson, who opted for the ether of upper management; Peter Westerman, who has stood up for <i>DDJ</i> as much as anyone over the years; Tim Trickett, <i>DDJ</i>'s current publisher (who had the good sense to return to <i>DDJ</i> after several years' absence); Bill Howard; Mike Calderon; and Regina Ridley. And there's a plaque on the wall for Charlie Shively.</p><p>Month in and month out, <i>DDJ</i>'s staff never ceases to amaze &#151; Deirdre Blake, Nick Baran, Kevin Carlson, Margaret Anderson, Amy Lincicum, Della Song, John Dorsey, Shannon Cochran, Philippe Lourier, and Sean Horton. And thanks to the Internet, circulation, advertising sales, marketing, and production staffs that round out the <i>DDJ</i> team. </p><p><i>DDJ</i> has been particularly fortunate over the years in having a dedicated staff with the goal of producing a magazine that they can be proud of and that you will profit from and enjoy. Which brings us to the most important acknowledgment. Thanks to each and everyone of you, dear readers, who have supported <i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i> over the years. We couldn't have done anything without you. Here's hoping that all of your fantasies become realized, and that we'll move into the next 25 years together.</p><p><br>Jonathan Erickson<br>editor-in-chief<br>jerickson@ddj.com<br></p></body></html>
