This browser is written in C and uses the Java Native Interface to map platform-specific services onto appropriate Java implementations. The three-layer architecture consists of the ANT Portability Environment, which manages the interface to the hardware platform; the core standards-compliant browser core; and a graphical front end. Fresco is platform independent.</p><p>ANT Limited</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>20 Cambridge Place</p><p>Cambridge, UK CB2 1NS</p><p>949-363-5662</p><p>http://www.antlimited.com/</p><p></p><p>Esmertec has released its Jbed RTOS package 1.3, an embedded real-time Java Virtual Machine. Enhancements to the 1.3 release include improved TCP/IP networking performance and PPP, DNS, and daytime protocol support. The target bytecode compiler for dynamic class loading additionally supports loading across HTTP and TFTP. New boot loaders have been added, the Jbed IDE has been enhanced, and functionality has been added for Interrupt Service Routines (allowing notification from an ISR to a waiting real-time task). Also new to the Jbed family is Jbed Micro Edition CLDC, a small-footprint Java Virtual Machine designed for memory constrained devices.</p><p>Esmertec Inc.</p><p>111 N.

The beta version of Curl Surge, a browser plug-in allowing users of Netscape or Internet Explorer to run applications written in the Curl language, is now available for free download. As part of the beta program, Curl is also offering web developers and programmers the chance to test out the Curl language and build applications using Curl Surge Lab, an integrated developer's environment. </p><p>Curl Corp. </p><p>400 Technology Square, 8th Floor</p><p>Cambridge, MA 02139-3539</p><p>617-761-1200</p><p>http://www.curl.com/</p><p>Caesius Software has introduced WebQL, software designed to query the Internet like a database. Based on web crawling, regular expressions, Perl, and HTML, the program aims to help business intelligence and competitive analysis projects by extracting specific information from the Internet through queries written in WebQL. Examples would include questions like "How fast is company X growing?" or "How many web sites display our logo?" WebQL can be used through the provided user interface or through the command line, where it can collect data for other applications.</p><p>Caesius Software</p><p>P.O.

The new compilers feature enhanced intrinsics and class libraries that support the upcoming 32-bit Pentium 4 microprocessor; they also include a prerelease version for the upcoming 64-bit Itanium processor. These compilers can be used on 32-bit systems to create 64-bit executables. Each compiler supports new features such as autovectorization and OpenMP, which is designed to allow multiprocessor computer developers to use high-level directives instead of a low-level operating system interface. Intel has also enhanced interprocedural optimization, vectorization, and profile-guided optimization in its compilers. Both compilers plug into the Microsoft Visual Studio development environment. The Intel C++ Compiler 5.0 carries forward its source and object code compatibility with Microsoft Visual C++, and the Intel Fortran Compiler 5.0 continues to be substantially source-code compatible with Compaq Visual Fortran.</p><p>Intel Corp.</p><p>2200 Mission College Boulevard</p><p>P.O.

MAXML's goal is a write-once, run-anywhere language for mobile devices. MAXML is interaction oriented, modeling the relationships between data and user interactions to minimize the importance of the presentation layer. The platform is compatible with HTML, XML, WAP, and VoiceXML. MAXML and Curious Networks' presentation server, Continuum, are currently available in beta form.</p><p>Curious Networks </p><p>833 W.

Rosette now supports Unicode 3.0, the latest version of the global text processing standard. New features include support for additional character mappings (including the Euro character); improved support for MIME recognition; Unicode 3.0-compliant sorting/collation for locale-specific sort orders; new character properties to support correct processing of Asian and Middle Eastern text; character decomposition for unambiguous text searches; and improved speed in transcoding between different character sets. Basis Technology is also offering Euclid, an engine that determines the language and data encoding of text from unknown sources. When used in conjunction with Rosette, Euclid can automatically convert text from any source into Unicode. Rosette and Euclid are portable across all major hardware and operating-system platforms and are licensed royalty free in either binary or full source code versions.</p><p>Basis Technology</p><p>One Kendall Square</p><p>Cambridge, MA 02139</p><p>617-386-2000</p><p>http://www.basistech.com/</p><p>Cyrano has released the developer version of OpenSTA, an open-source distributed software testing architecture based on CORBA. Using OpenSTA, a user can generate realistic heavy loads simulating the activity of hundreds to thousands of virtual users, whatever the development languages used. OpenSTA is licensed under the GPL and maintained on SourceForge. Cyrano is offering consulting, training, and support services for the architecture. Cyrano has also upgraded two of its proprietary testing tools, Impact and Test. Impact 2.2.4 is a SQL transaction capture/playback tool that finds performance bottlenecks through multiclient simulations. Test 5.4.2 is a character-based regression and load testing tool that uses scripts and distributed processing to test applications across an enterprise-wide IT network.</p><p>Cyrano</p><p>26 Parker Street </p><p>Newburyport, MA 01950 </p><p>978-462-0737</p><p>http://www.cyrano.com/</p><p>The most recent versions of ILOG's optimization solving engines, CPLEX 7.0 and Solver 5.0, feature Concert, a new C++ optimization modeling library and interface. Concert is designed to unify constraint programming and math programming. Concert also allows optimization models implemented in C++ to be expressed in a format familiar to operations research professionals. With Concert, CPLEX (which is C-based) can be used with C++, and optimization models can be specified using object-oriented programming. Concert is also a part of new releases in the ILOG Optimization Suite. All products are available for Windows, Solaris, Linux, and UNIX platforms.</p><p>ILOG Inc.</p><p>1080 Linda Vista Avenue</p><p>Mountain View, CA 94043</p><p>650-567-8000</p><p>http://www.ilog.com/</p><p>The K &amp; G Software Group is offering HiClock Pro, a program designed to provide the exact time to all computers in a network based on the time standard of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The program queries NIST timeservers using the Internet and adjusts the computer's time to reflect NIST time. The host computer can serve as a timeserver to any size network, and times can be checked as often or as seldom as desired. HiClock Pro includes two alarm clocks and customizable skins. A freeware version (which displays ads and cannot be used as a timeserver) is also available. </p><p>K &amp; G Software Group</p><p>B.

Visual VCL Help employs a single project to simultaneously generate both C++Builder and Delphi VCL help files. Additionally, it parses the relevant source files to automatically generate Help topic pages as well as browse groups, pop up windows, and hyperlinks. Visual VCL Help's internal dictionary, built through parsing of source files and manually added elements, holds classes, class methods, class properties and events, type descriptors, standalone procedures and functions, examples, and general help topics.</p><p>Cytron Research Ltd.</p><p>414A St. Vincent's Street,</p><p>Glasgow, Scotland G3 84N</p><p>440-141-248-5186</p><p>http://www.cytronresearch.co.uk/</p><p>DDC-I's Very Smooth Migration (VSM) package offers a migration path for embedded system Ada developers switching from VAX to Solaris.
