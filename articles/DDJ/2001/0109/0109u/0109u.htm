<p>Fonix FAAST Framework is a development environment for designing, building, and implementing applications that integrate advanced speech technologies. The framework is comprised of a variety of class libraries in C++, Java, and ActiveX Controls. It supports selection of any of its installed soundbanks by the desired characteristics of speech as well as language, gender, name, technology, sample rate, bits per sample, and encoding format. The framework supports Fonix speaker-independent speech-recognition engines as well as nonFonix speech engines. It is available on the x86 platform running Windows, Linux, and Solaris, as well as Solaris running on a Sparc workstation. It also supports the most common XML-based markup languages including the Java Standard Markup Language (JSML), the SAPI Markup Language (XSML), and the proprietary Fonix Markup Language (FXML).</p>

<p>Cyber-Ark Software has announced an API option for its PrivateArk Network Vault platform. You can now use the PrivateArk API to secure existing applications. The PrivateArk platform blends 10 security layers, including VPN, firewall, access control, encryption, authentication, and proprietary Cyber-Ark technology in a dedicated environment. It functions as the container for the data objects and the security features become a seamless part of the user's interaction with the application. Rather than securing the entire network, PrivateArk runs on a dedicated server that is engineered to protect sensitive data objects.</p>

<p>SoftSynth.com's JSyn Version 14.2 is an audio toolbox for Java that can synthesize high fidelity music and sound effects directly on the user's computer without having to download large sound files. It provides oscillators, filters, envelopes, sample players, wave shapers, and other synthesis modules that can be connected together to create complex sounds. You can use JSyn to develop interactive audio applications that can be run as standalone applications or as applets in a web page. This version comes with several new sound modules and new GUI tools. JSyn includes freely downloadable browser plug-ins, an SDK for programmers, and an OEM package. JSyn is Java based so the applications are cross platform; a C-based software synthesizer called "CSyn" can also be licensed separately from JSyn.</p>

<p>Sospita's software license protection system decrypts and executes encrypted code in an external tamper-proof environment, such as smartcard or USB token, without users being able to view the code. Sospita License Protection is enabled by an AT90SC6464C-USB secure microcontroller from Atmel. The Sospita Development Kit lets you write and debug software applications using ordinary compilers and debugging tools. Sections of code are marked for encryption and can only be executed by end users on a secure smart card or USB token attached to the computer.</p>
