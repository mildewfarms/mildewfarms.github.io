<h2>FEATURES</h2>


<h3><a href="0109a/0109a.htm">DEVELOPING SCALABLE DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS</a></h3>

<h4>by Mario A. Torres</h4>

<p>Mario presents a generic model designed to serve as a blueprint for development of scalable distributed computing applications. </p>

<h3><a href="0109b/0109b.htm">A PORTABLE DISTRIBUTED EVENT-LOGGING FACILITY</a></h3>

<h4>by Ivan Kiselev</h4>

<p>Every application needs event-logging facilities to monitor the state of applications. Ivan presents a distributed portable event-logging facility that is simple, flexible, and relatively platform independent.</p>

<h3><a href="0109c/0109c.htm">DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING COMPONENT LIFECYCLES</a></h3>

<h4>by Cliff Berg</h4>

<p>A fundamental problem in all distributed systems is that different components are maintained on different schedules &#151; and things inevitably break. Cliff presents a framework designed to synchronize components in distributed systems. </p>

<h3><a href="0109d/0109d.htm">THE DELPHI XML SAX2 COMPONENT &amp; MSXML 3.0</a></h3>

<h4>by Danny Heijl</h4>

<p>Danny shows how to use the C++ COM interfaces of Microsoft's MSXML 3.0 SAX2 parser  with Borland Delphi. He then presents <i>TSAXParser</i>, a Delphi component that uses these interfaces, but shields you from their complexities.</p>

<h3><a href="0109e/0109e.htm">SHIFT-LEFT TESTING</a></h3>

<h4>by Larry Smith</h4>

<p>By combining development and quality assurance earlier and more deeply in your project plan, you can expand your testing program and reduce manpower and equipment needs.</p>

<h3><a href="0109f/0109f.htm">THE CURL PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT</a></h3>

<h4>by Friedger M&uuml;ffke</h4>

<p>Curl is a programming environment designed for developing interactive Internet applications. As such, it combines the ease of markup languages with the functionality of object-oriented ones. </p>

<h3><a href="0109g/0109g.htm">PROGRAMMING MOBILE PHONES</a></h3>

<h4>by Panos Kougiouris</h4>

<p>Panos presents one approach to updating contact information for mobile phones by downloading contacts from PCs running Outlook 2000 to Nokia mobile phones. </p>

<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2>


<h3><a href="0109h/0109h.htm">TRAMPOLINES FOR EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</a></h3>

<h4>by Joseph M. Link</h4>

<p>Trampolines are short snippets of code that start up other snippets of code to, among other things, minimize the latency of interrupt handlers.</p>

<h2>INTERNET PROGRAMMING</h2>


<h3><a href="0109i/0109i.htm">SOAP: SIMPLIFYING DISTRIBUTED DEVELOPMENT</a></h3>

<h4>by Neil Gunton</h4>

<p>The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) was developed as an open RPC protocol using XML, targeting much the same problem set as CORBA, DCOM, and Java RMI. Neil uses it to add new facilities to his web site.</p>

<h2>PROGRAMMER'S TOOLCHEST</h2>
