MontaVista's High Availability Framework is based completely on the latest Linux kernel 2.4 and supports PICMG 2.12 hot swap capabilities (hot replace and hot insert), redundant Ethernet and backplane messaging, as well as resource and event management. The MontaVista HA Framework initially supports multiple leading CompactPCI chassis, System Slot CPUs and Intelligent I/O boards, including Intel x86/IA-32 processor boards from Motorola and RadiSys, and PowerPC processor boards from Motorola and other vendors.</p><p>High Availability is a term for technology that enhances the "up-time" of computer systems by distributing functionality across multiple CPUs. CompactPCI systems are designed for HA systems by reducing single points of failure in a single chassis. In response to hardware and software failures, CompactPCI HA systems facilitate the rapid transfer of control (fail-over) from a faulty CPU, peripheral, or software component to a functional one, while preserving operations or transactions in-progress at the time of failure. Many embedded designers choose the standard CompactPCI board and system form factor for HA designs since it supports replacement and insertion of system and peripheral cards without the need for cycling power, reducing technician-assisted time-to-repair.</p><p>MontaVista Software Inc.<br>1237 East Arques Avenue<br>Sunnyvale, CA 94085<br>408-328-9200<br><a href="http://www.mvista.com/">http://www.mvista.com/</a></p><p>Cyrano has released its DB Monitor module for OpenSTA.

Users simply present the smartcard and place a finger on the reader. The V-Smart then compares the presented fingerprint with the fingerprint template stored on the smartcard to verify the user's identity. V-Smart is designed to offer a convenient biometric solution for large-scale installations by taking advantage of the features of a contactless smartcard technology. The fingerprint template is securely stored on the smartcard instead of the reader or server creating a "portable database," supporting an unlimited number of users. As V-Smart stores the template on the smartcard, it eliminates the redundant wire requirements necessary to distribute the templates across the network of readers. For companies with multiple locations, this allows employees to access multiple facilities without having to be enrolled at each and every site.</p><p>Bioscrypt Inc.<br>5450 Explorer Drive, Suite 500 <br>Mississauga, ON <br>Canada  L4W 5M1 <br>905-624-7700<br><a href="http://www.bioscrypt.com/">http://www.bioscrypt.com/</a></p><p>NQL has announced Version 2.0 of its Network Query Language.
