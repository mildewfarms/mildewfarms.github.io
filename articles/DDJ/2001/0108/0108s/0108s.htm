The CrossOver Plugin works with Netscape, Mozilla, or Konqueror, and does not require any Microsoft licensing fees. The program relies upon Wine technology (a Windows API that runs on Linux) to enable Windows plugins to run correctly. Other products available or forthcoming from CodeWeavers include a remote start menu to run PC applications from a web pad, and a server to host Windows applications for display on multiple devices.</p><p>CodeWeavers Inc. </p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>2550 University Avenue West, Suite 313N</p><p>St. Paul, MN 55114</p><p>800-596-0409</p><p>http://www.codeweavers.com/</p><p>COM Explorer 2.0 from 4Developers lets you explore, manage, and repair ActiveX/COM files. The software provides a centralized view of COM objects as well as detailed information such as GUID, TypeLib, version and file information. Misbehaved objects (such as objects with missing files left as junk in the Registry) are clearly marked. A Registry editor is fully integrated, allowing developers to view and edit COM settings. Also included is a dependency viewer that allows viewing of all DLL dependencies for a COM object and clearly marks missing DLL files. COM Explorer is tightly integrated with Windows Explorer, allowing users to quickly register, unregister, or access COM controls. It runs on all Windows systems.</p><p>4Developers LLC</p><p>1030 East El Camino Real, #440</p><p>Sunnyvale, CA 94087</p><p>http://www.4dev.com/</p><p>Kabira has announced the release of Kabira Adapter Factory, which automatically generates adapters connecting the Kabira ObjectSwitch Server with applications or network equipment via XML, Java, and CORBA interfaces.
