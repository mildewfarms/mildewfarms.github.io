The masked edit control also offers date and time input fields, numeric integer input, currency input, and user-definable input masks. For numeric input, it offers spin buttons, a minimum/maximum range, and a popup calculator. Dates support a drop-down calendar. SftMask/ATL also offers input field underlining rather than a prompt character, and the control's built-in caption can automatically be aligned with the edit control to simplify development and reduce the number of controls on the form. Fully automatic OLE drag-and-drop support is offered, but can also be configured. The control weighs in at just over 300 KB and requires no additional DLLs. All major languages, as well as the Internet Explorer browser, are supported.</p><p>Softel vdm Inc.</p><p>1436 Kinglet Drive</p><p>Punta Gorda, FL 33950</p><p>941-505-8600</p><p>http://www.softelvdm.com/</p><p>Voxeo's phone-to-web infrastructure is designed to hide the details of voice cards, APIs, circuit provisioning, and hardware configuration behind high-level mark-up languages.

Sistina GFS transforms a cluster of Linux servers into a storage cluster, giving administrators the ability to simultaneously mount shared storage devices on multiple nodes in a storage area network. This enables simultaneous access to files within the file system, preventing performance bottlenecks and single points of failure, and spreading a workload across a cluster of computers. GFS can also be used as a shared root file system to simplify cluster administration. GFS storage clusters can be deployed to extend the available bandwidth and transactions per second of Web, SMTP, IMAP, NFS, specific application servers, and parallel, scientific computing/data processing.</p><p>Sistina Software Inc.</p><p>1313 5th Street S.E., Suite 111</p><p>Minneapolis, MN 55414</p><p>612-379-3951</p><p>http://www.sistina.com/</p><p>REAL Software is shipping REALbasic 3, a development tool that runs on Mac OS X and earlier versions of the Macintosh operating system.
