<h2>The Secure Digital Music Interface </h2>
<p>The music industry is particularly passionate about SD cards since they are compliant with the Secure Digital Music Interface (SDMI). SDMI-compliant portable devices must communicate with an authorized PC-based multimedia librarian to transfer legitimate media streams. It cannot play content from unknown sources and won't produce high-fidelity copies of digital media streams.</p>
<p>While SDMI is popular among studios, it has inspired intense opposition from users. A significant reason for consumer mistrust of SDMI is that the consortium initially attempted to outlaw playback of MP3 files on portable devices. The consortium eventually eliminated this feature due to the vociferousness of consumer complaints.</p>

<p>Many users also fear SDMI because it arbitrarily cripples the functionality in their portable devices. Furthermore, some feel that the SDMI consortium is a closed organization that doesn't represent consumers needs. Because of the controversy, it is uncertain whether SDMI will ever gain widespread acceptance. Fortunately, Pyro hides SDMI implementation details from the user. If SDMI takes off, users will be able to seamlessly play protected content on the Pyro.   </p>
