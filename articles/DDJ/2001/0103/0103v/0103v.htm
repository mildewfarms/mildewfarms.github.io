<p>VMware has announced two new servers: the GSX Server for Linux platforms and the ESX Server, which does not require an operating system. The GSX Server is intended to provide improved control on Intel servers through the use of virtual machines, all of which can be remotely managed. New features include the ability to run multiple applications on a single host; detect server crashes and automatically switch to a backup; create a small server farm dedicated to testing and integration; and use only one server to run in isolation sets of applications that were designed for separate machines. The ESX Server also runs multiple virtual machines on the Intel architecture and shares many capabilities of the GSX Server. It includes monitor architecture to provide scheduling, resource governing, memory management, high-performance I/O, data collectors, and an SNMP agent.</p>

<p>WebGain's TopLink for Java Version 3.0 is intended to bridge the gap between JavaBean objects and relational databases. TopLink abstracts the interface to the database and maps the data directly into application objects, so you can build object-based applications even when the database you work with is relational. TopLink is compatible with a number of application servers, including IBM WebSphere and BEA     WebLogic. TopLink will also be included in the professional edition of WebGain Studio.</p>
