<h2>FEATURES</h2>


<h3><a href="0110a/0110a.htm">REGULAR EXPRESSIONS IN C++</a></h3>

<h4>by John Maddock</h4>

<p>Regex++ is a regular expression engine that makes C++ as versatile for text processing as  script-based languages like Awk and Perl.</p>

<h3><a href="0110b/0110b.htm">EXTRACTION AND EXAMINATION OF RELATIONS IN C++</a></h3>

<h4>by Keith Paton</h4>

<p>Design flaws can be automatically detected, as long as you can extract and manipulate sets  of key relationships among the entities in C++ systems. </p>

<h3><a href="0110c/0110c.htm">PRECOMPILED HEADERS &amp; NORMAL C++ SEMANTICS</a></h3>

<h4>by Jeffrey Taylor</h4>

<p>If arranged correctly, precompiled headers, like those in Visual C++, can double the build speed. However, it is possible also to arrange precompiled header files in a manner that is inconsistent  with normal C++ semantics. </p>

<h3><a href="0110d/0110d.htm">C++ SET-THEORETIC OPERATIONS ON VIRTUAL CONTAINERS</a></h3>

<h4>by Gregory Begelman, Lev Finkelstein, and Evgeniy Gabrilovich</h4>

<p>The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides the set-theoretic operations <i>union, intersection, difference, </i>and <i>symmetric difference,</i> accessible through the header file &lt;algorithm&gt;. </p>

<h3><a href="0110e/0110e.htm">C# &amp; PERL</a></h3>

<h4>by Talbott Crowell</h4>

<p>Although C# is an evolution of C/C++ much like Java, it also borrows from other languages &#151;  and has facilities familiar to Perl. Talbott presents common Perl scripts that you can implement in C#. </p>

<h3><a href="0110f/0110f.htm">SCRIPTING WITH JAVA &amp; PYTHON</a></h3>

<h4>by Boudewijn Rempt</h4>

<p>Boudewijn shows how you can embed a standard language such as Python into a Java application. </p>

<h3><a href="0110g/0110g.htm">SHORT MESSAGE SERVICES</a></h3>

<h4>by Ron Hume</h4>

<p>Short Message Services (SMS) let you send short text-based messages between wireless devices,  such as cell phones and pagers. </p>

<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2>


<h3><a href="0110h/0110h.htm">AN EMBEDDABLE HTTP SERVER</a></h3>

<h4>by M. Tim Jones</h4>

<p>Most HTTP servers for embedded devices place requirements on the design of  embedded systems that adversely effect cost. The embeddable HTTP server Tim presents  here is small, but still powerful enough to get the job done.</p>

<h2>INTERNET PROGRAMMING</h2>


<h3><a href="0110i/0110i.htm">HIGH-PERFORMANCE WEB SITES: ADO VERSUS MSXML</a></h3>

<h4>by Tim Chester</h4>

<p>ADO and MSXML are tools that can be used to create high-performance web sites.  MSXML provides flexibility, but ADO offers performance. </p>

<p></p>

<h2>PROGRAMMER'S TOOLCHEST</h2>


<h3><a href="0110j/0110j.htm">VOICEXML AND THE VOICE/WEB ENVIRONMENT</a></h3>

<h4>by Lee Anne Phillips</h4>

<p>While the Internet is making inroads into the public switched-telephone  network, XML protocols such as VoiceXML are providing access to a set of  tools that address the entire range of web applications. </p>

<p></p>
