PowerXML accepts input from XML and HTML files, SQL databases, or text. This input can be run through multiple steps, including data insertion, filtering, transformation, output formatting, compressed output, or encryption. It can then be output to formats such as XML, HTML, WML, PQA, and text, and also to multiple destinations such as File and URL.</p><p>Wizen Software</p><p>601 Minnesota Street, Suite 218</p><p>San Francisco, CA 94107</p><p>415-826-3113</p><p><a href="http://www.wizen.com/">http://www.wizen.com/</a></p><p>The Java Music Specification Language (JMSL) is a Java-based development tool for experiments in algorithmic music composition, live performance, and intelligent instrument design. JMSL is the evolutionary successor to the Hierarchical Music Specification Language (HMSL). JMSL's strengths include its Java core, hierarchical real-time polymorphic scheduling, device abstraction, a stylistically neutral core, and Jscore, a common music notation editor that you can extend with your own compositional algorithm. The composer can also create standalone JMSL applications or deploy JMSL applets on the Web.</p><p>Java Music Specification Language</p><p><a href="http://www.algomusic.com/">http://www.algomusic.com/</a>  </p><p>InCert Software has released TraceBack 1.0 for Java. When a crash/hang/misbehavior occurs, TraceBack ejects a trace file with detailed information including variable, stack, and environment data as well as a line-by-line history of the program's execution correlated with its source code. A single command-line instruction lets you instrument all classes and/or JAR files in a project within minutes. TraceBack works on existing compiled code, with no changes to the source or build process. Unlike debuggers, it works with the same VM used in production. It can also replay the interleaving of multiple threads in execution. TraceBack 1.0 is currently available for Windows C/C++ and OS/390.</p><p>InCert Software Corp.</p><p>One Kendall Square, Building 1400W</p><p>Cambridge, MA 02139</p><p>877-346-2378</p><p><a href="http://www.incert.com/">http://www.incert.com/</a></p><p>The Xceed Encryption Library can encrypt and decrypt strings, memory buffers, streaming data, or single files using the  Advanced Encryption Standard (Rijndael). The library also offers RSA public-key encryption and supports digitally signing and authenticating data and other encryption-related functionality. Together with Xceed's Xceed Streaming Compression Library and Xceed Binary Encoding Library, you can compress, encrypt, and encode data into text with only a single function call.</p><p>Xceed Software Inc.</p><p>1555 Boulevard Jean-Paul-Vincent</p><p>Suite 180</p><p>Longueuil, PQ</p><p>Canada, J4N 1L6</p><p>450-442-2626</p><p><a href="http://www.xceedsoft.com/">http://www.xceedsoft.com/</a></p><p>DevelopMentor has announced the beta release of Gen&lt;X&gt; 1.5, a code reuse and generalization developer tool. Gen&lt;X&gt; 1.5 captures code as templates, enabling easy reuse from one project to the next. Unlike CASE tools, which are code generators that lock programmers into strict design frameworks or inflexible process methodologies, Gen&lt;X&gt; doesn't require learning a proprietary syntax. New features include enhanced wizards to speed the development process and command line access for wizards, allowing for the automatic creation of code during the build process. DevelopMentor is also shipping a new COM+ Wizard Pack, a set of wizards that generate COM+ code using Gen&lt;X&gt;. This simplifies the development of ATL-based components that take full advantage of the COM+ run-time services.</p><p>DevelopMentor Inc.</p><p>21535 Hawthorne Boulevard, 4th Floor</p><p>Torrance, CA 90503</p><p>310-543-1716</p><p><a href="http://www.develop.com/">http://www.develop.com/</a></p><p>Aladdin Systems has released the StuffIt Engine Software Developer Kit (SDK) for Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris. The SDK supports the number compression and encoding formats, including: StuffIt, Zip, Gzip, Tar, Rar, Bzip2, uencode, UNIX Compress, Binhex, MacBinary, and more. All formats are accessible via a single API. It is appropriate for both compiled programs and popular web-scripting languages, while the StuffIt format is Unicode compliant for compatibility with 2-byte languages such as Chinese.</p><p>Aladdin Systems Inc.</p><p>245 Westridge Drive</p><p>Watsonville, CA 95076</p><p>831-761-6206</p><p><a href="http://www.aladdinsys.com/">http://www.aladdinsys.com/</a></p><p>Princeton Softech's Relational Tools 5.0 is an application testing toolset that processes related sets of data in both DB2 and legacy files. It provides a method for streamlining time-intensive application testing tasks including extracting, migrating, editing, and comparing related sets of data. The new release features Move for Legacy, a new product that integrates data from VSAM and sequential files with DB2 sources into a single, consistent test environment. Virtual legacy tables define the layout of the legacy record and associate it with a physical data source. Legacy tables can be associated to other legacy or DB2 tables to create a set of related data. By processing the data transparently, regardless of its source, the Relational Tools can create federated test data or migrate legacy data to DB2. </p><p>Princeton Softech</p><p>111 Campus Drive</p><p>Princeton, NJ 08540</p><p>800-457-7060</p><p><a href="http://www.princetonsoftech.com/">http://www.princetonsoftech.com/</a></p><p>Gimpel Software has released PC-lint Version 8.0 for C/C++. PC-lint is a static analyzer that analyzes a mixed suite of C and C++ programs and report on bugs, glitches, and inconsistencies. The interstatement value tracking introduced in earlier versions of PC-lint has been extended across function boundaries. It also includes better exception analysis, better location of <i>const</i> opportunities, and enhanced checking for adherence to the MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association) Guidelines. There are 88 new error/warning messages and 20 new options. PC-lint 8.0 is upward compatible with and includes the same checking as earlier versions of the product.
