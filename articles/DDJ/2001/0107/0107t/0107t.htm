CocoBase generates code for CMP/BMP entity beans and session beans, and provides a simplified layer for persisting Java classes with EJB, without requiring embedded JDBC and SQL calls in objects. CocoBase 3.19 offers EJB 2.0 support, including dependent objects; better JSP code generation; and updates to some of the UNIX scripts to enhance compatibility.</p><p>Thought Inc.</p><p>657 Mission Street</p><p>San Francisco, CA 94105</p><p>415-836-9199</p><p><a href="http://www.thoughtinc.com/">http://www.thoughtinc.com/</a></p><p>REBOL/View from REBOL Technologies is a system-independent distributed computing platform that lets portions of an application execute on different parts of the network without modification. Applications intercommunicate using REBOL dialecting, a unified method for the secure exchange of semantic information between all types of computer systems. Dialects are intended to offer greater control over the information and functions being exchanged. The REBOL/View package is 360 KB, free for noncommercial purposes, and includes 14 Internet protocols, graphics, a world-wide distributed desktop, compression, and the REBOL messaging language. A commercial version adds encryption, external library access, and shell application access.</p><p>REBOL Technologies</p><p>301 South State Street</p><p>Ukiah, CA 95482</p><p>707-467-8000</p><p><a href="http://www.rebol.com/">http://www.rebol.com/</a></p><p>Fookes Software has released NoteTab Pro 4.85, a Windows text editor that can simultaneously open and edit as many documents as the system can support. A configurable toolbar features more than 90 commands, and a ClipBar feature lets you create toolbar buttons to execute custom scripts and wizards. NoteTab Pro incorporates a scripting language to process text, create text/code completion wizards, control the Clipboard, manipulate NoteTab's interface, and exchange data with other applications, and there are commands that provide support for Perl and Gawk interpreters. It also includes one-click conversion from text to HTML, has the ability to strip HTML tags quickly and easily, and supports the new XHTML Standard.</p><p>Fookes Software</p><p>Av.
