<h3><a href="0107a/0107a.htm">OPTIMIZING IA-64 PERFORMANCE</a></h3>

<h4>by Sverre Jarp	</h4>

<p>The IA-64, also known as Itanium, is a 64-bit processor designed by Hewlett-Packard and Intel  that supports performance-enhancing techniques such as predication, speculation, rotating registers, and the like. It also sports a new kind of instruction set based on the Explicit Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) specification. </p>

<h3><a href="0107b/0107b.htm">AUTOMATICALLY EXPLOITING IMPLICIT PARALLELISM</a></h3>

<h4>by Aart J.C. Bik, Milind Girkar, Paul M. Grey, and Xinmin Tian</h4>

<p>Recent trends in processor design have introduced new ways for programmers to exploit parallelism &#151; and "smarter" compilers do much of the work for you.</p>

<h3><a href="0107c/0107c.htm">MULTITHREADING, FTHREADS, &amp; VISUAL FORTRAN</a></h3>

<h4>by Dan Nagle</h4>

<p>Dan presents a Fortran module that helps you write multithreaded programs for  Windows-based applications.</p>

<h3><a href="0107d/0107d.htm">IMPROVING SCALABILITY OF MULTITHREADED  DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION</a></h3>

<h4>by Greg Nakhimovsky </h4>

<p>Multiprocessor/multithreaded environments add a new dimension to the familiar malloc  facility. The "MT-hot" implementation Greg presents here lets multiple threads execute in  parallel without major delays.</p>

<h3><a href="0107e/0107e.htm">A TRIUMPH OF SIMPLICITY:  JAMES CLARK ON MARKUP LANGUAGES AND XML</a></h3>

<h4>by Eugene Eric Kim</h4>

<p>Whether you know it or not, James Clark has made your life easier by creating a number of  open-source tools such as expat (an XML parser), groff (a GNU version of troff), TREX (an XML schema language), and more. </p>

<h3><a href="0107f/0107f.htm">PALM OS MEMORY LEAK DETECTION</a></h3>

<h4>by Jeff Ishaq </h4>

<p>Nothing can stop Palm development faster than unexpectedly running out of memory, so every byte of dynamic heap is precious. Jeff presents techniques for hunting down memory leaks, then provides a robust memory leak detection system.</p>

<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2>


<h3><a href="0107g/0107g.htm">ACTIVEX CONTROLS FOR EMBEDDED VISUAL BASIC</a></h3>

<h4>by Steve Lardieri</h4>

<p>Using the ActiveX control Steve presents here, there's no need to resort to C++ when your Embedded Visual Basic applications need speed and power.</p>

<h2>INTERNET PROGRAMMING</h2>


<h3><a href="0107h/0107h.htm">WEB-BASED VIDEO MONITORING</a></h3>

<h4>by Michael Larson</h4>
