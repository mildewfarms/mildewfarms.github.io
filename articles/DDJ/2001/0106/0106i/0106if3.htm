Open a command-line window.2. Go to a TAO example directory and type: Start Naming_Service -o drive:\path\iorfile, where iorfile is the name of the file that will hold the Naming Service's IOR string and drive:\path\ is the location of your Visibroker server/client executable.3. Switch to the directory drive:\path.4. Edit iorfile to contain "vbj Server" prior to the IOR string and save this file as ser.bat.5. Edit iorfile to contain "vbj Client" prior to the IOR string and save this file as cli.bat. 6. Start the server and the client type: Start Ser.bat, cli.bat.TAO Server to Visibroker Client with TAO Naming Service1. Open a command-line window.2. Go to a TAO example directory and type Start Naming_Service -o iorfile, where iorfile is the name of the file that will hold the Naming Service's IOR string.3. Edit iorfile to contain "Server" prior to the IOR string and save this file as ser.bat.4. Switch to the Visibroker directory.5. Copy iorfile from the TAO directory into the Visibroker directory.6. Edit the new iorfile to contain "vbj Client" prior to the IOR string and save this file as cli.bat.7. Start the server switch to the TAO directory and type: Start Ser.bat.8. Start the client switch to the Visibroker directory and type: cli.bat.TAO Server to MICO client with TAO Naming Service 1. Open a command-line window.2. Go to a TAO example directory and type: Start Naming_Service -o iorfile, where iorfile is the name of the file that will hold the Naming Service's IOR string.3. Edit iorfile to contain "Server" prior to the IOR string and save this file as ser.bat.4. Switch to the MICO directory.5. Copy the above iorfile from the TAO directory into the MICO directory.6. Edit the new iorfile to contain "Client -ORBNamingAddr" prior to the IOR string and save this file as cli.bat.7. Start the server switch to the TAO directory and type: Start Ser.bat.8. Start the client switch to the Visibroker directory and type: cli.bat.MICO Server to MICO Client with Mico Naming Service 1. Open a command-line window.2. Switch to the MICO directory and type:   start nsd -ORBIIOPAddr inet:localhost:1234 &amp;    start server -ORBNamingAddr inet:localhost:1234 &amp;   client -ORBNamingAddr inet:localhost:1234</pre><h4>Figure 3: Instructions for running the various examples.</h4><a href="0106i.htm#rf3">Back to Article</a></body></html>
