Actually, I've never seen any of them work, but that's simply because the only place I ever run into them is at Foo Bar, the late-night place where I moonlight as a relief bartender and where technology reporters come to be indiscreet in dim lighting. Tonight, the first of the three to arrive was Joe, and did he ever look down. </p><blockquote><p></p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>"The usual?" I asked perfunctorily, as I popped the top off a cream soda. But I had popped too soon.</p><p>"No, give me a beer," he said. "I've had a bad week."</p><p>Larry walked in just then, said the rather more elaborate hellos that his upbringing brings out, and graciously accepted a glass of white wine. Larry is British and it slips out at conventional moments, although usually he's as rude as any American tech reporter.</p><p>"So how is California's energy crisis affecting Foo Bar?" he asked. </p><p>I shrugged. "Management was never big on lighting anyway." </p><p>"I had a really bad week," Joe said.</p><p>"I suppose as long as you can keep the fridges cool &#151; that's too bad, Joe &#151; I suppose there's not all that much electricity involved in running a bar."</p><p>"More than you'd think," I said, taking a slug of the cream soda I'd opened. I don't drink alcohol on the job, but if I had to drink much of that stuff I might be driven to it. I'm a Jolt man. "We've had to eliminate all blender drinks," I added.</p><p>Mo claimed her stool just then, filling out the quorum. "If that means no blender-drink drinkers, it would be a plus. Scotch, rocks."</p><p>"I had a really awful week," Joe said.</p><p>"If it has something to do with that hideous airline magazine you write for, I don't want to hear about it," Mo told him.</p><p>"I got sued," Joe said, sniffing his beer between tentative sips.</p><p>"Really?" Larry said. "Sued over what?"</p><p>"It was my web site. I don't know if you know that I have a large collection of ceramic cats &#151; "</p><p>Mo held up a hand. "I didn't realize that it was necessary to mention it, but I really don't want to hear about ceramic cats."</p><p>"Give him a chance, Mo," Larry said. "If what he says is really asinine, then it's just that much more ammunition to use against him." He smiled sweetly. "Go ahead, Joseph."</p><p>Joe looked at him warily, but went on. "I wanted to put up a web site to sell some of my cats. Some of the ones I'm willing to part with if the price is right, you know. But I'm no programmer, so I hired this kid to do the HTML &#151; "</p><p>"HTML coding is not programming," Mo cut in.</p><p>"Let him tell the story, Mo," Larry said.</p><p>"Well, I got the site up and immediately got a letter from attorneys for CatFanatics2001, saying that I had appropriated their intellectual property." </p><p>Mo squinted at him. "You ripped off their content?"</p><p>Larry shook his head. "Not a good policy, Joe. I'd settle, if I were you."</p><p>"No, no, I didn't steal their content &#151; "</p><p>"Look and feel, eh? That's a subtle one, but you just can't take whatever you &#151; "</p><p>"No, it wasn't a look-and-feel suit, either."</p><p>"Ah, the code. Joe, HTML may not be programming, but it still represents someone's creative efforts &#151; "</p><p>"I didn't steal their HTML, for pete's sake."</p><p>Mo slid her glass toward me for a refill and turned toward Joe. "You fool. You mad fool. You posted secret Scientology documents to your site, didn't you? You're done for now."</p><p>"Mo, he said it was some cat site that was suing him, not the Scientologists."</p><p>"Probably a front." She looked around the bar, suddenly puzzled by something.</p><p>"No, no, no. I didn't post any Scientology documents. It was a business-methods patent suit."</p><p>Larry perked up his ears and asked for details.</p><p>"Well, apparently CatFanatics2001 has a patent on what I'm doing. They quoted the legal language in the letter. Said they had a patent on quote 'selling ceramic collectibles via a network using a pointing device such as a mouse or trackpad,' unquote."</p><p>Larry whistled softly. "That's just a little bit scary," he said.</p><p>Mo poked my arm. "Hey, is it darker than usual, or is it just me?"</p><p>"It's not just you," I said.</p></blockquote><p><i>Note:</i> This story is fiction. A patent such as described here is not one of the 2500 business-method patents issued annually in the software field alone. At least I don't think it is. I haven't done a search.</p><p><br>Michael Swaine<br>editor-at-large<br>mike@swaine.com<br></p></body></html>
