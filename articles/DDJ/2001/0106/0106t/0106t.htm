Insure++ for Windows now includes the Chaperon mode to check noninstrumented executables. Without requiring any recompiling or relinking, Chaperon provides a quick check of all data-memory references made by a process and detects and reports reads of uninitialized memory, reads/writes that are not within the bounds of allocated blocks, and allocation errors such as memory leaks. A Source Code Instrumentation mode is also included for a more detailed check. Add-on modules are available to graphically monitor a program's memory allocation and aid with memory optimization, and to show which files, functions, and statements have been executed, and which have not. The 6.0 edition of Insure++ is available for Windows 2000/NT; UNIX versions are supposedly forthcoming.</p><p>ParaSoft Corp.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>2031 S.

The TowerJ virtual machine uses ahead-of-time compilation to convert standard Java bytecode into optimized, self-contained executables, and mixed-mode deployment allows dynamic update. Also available is an SDK for Itanium servers. The deployment platform is now available on Red Hat Linux, TurboLinux, and Suse Linux, and a version is planned for Windows 2000.</p><p>Tower Technology </p><p>Centennial Towers</p><p>505 East Huntland Drive, Suite 530</p><p>Austin, TX 78752</p><p>512-452-9455</p><p>http://www.towerj.com/</p><p>Covalent Technologies has introduced several new server products for Apache that can be purchased as integrated bundles or on a modular basis. The Covalent Secure Server offers 128-bit SSL encryption, intrusion detection, virus scanning, and graphical interface. The Covalent Commerce Server provides a generic API for most credit-card clearinghouses and commercial-grade SSL support. The Covalent Managed Server offers a uniform environment to install and support PHP, Perl, Java, DAV, or SSL, and also features SNMP instrumentation for monitoring and configuration through precertified management frameworks.</p><p>Covalent Technologies</p><p>706 Mission Street, 2nd Floor</p><p>San Francisco, CA 94103</p><p>415-536-5200</p><p>http://www.covalent.com/</p><p>NuSphere has contributed a transactional storage engine to MySQL, allowing the open-source database to support row-level locking. Other new features of MySQL resulting from this contribution include ACID transactions suitable for financial applications; automatic crash recovery; and support for features that build on row-level locking such as a select for update function that selects records and locks them so they can be updated at a later date. A formal release of the alpha version of MySQL 4.0, including the new features from NuSphere, is forthcoming.</p><p>NuSphere Corp.</p><p>14 Oak Park</p><p>Bedford, MA 01730</p><p>781-280-4600</p><p>http://www.nusphere.com/</p><p>Object Design has announced its ObjectStore data management software for Linux systems.

CMF is also open source. It uses templates to simplify a web-managed content creation process. Role-based permissions ensure implementation of content publication; workflow and other business rules are customizable, and groups can have different rules; version tracking and rollback capabilities help manage changes. Multiple presentations are supported. Information is added to the site and indexed on a real-time basis. CMF integrates with standard components and protocols including XML, WebDAV, RPC, SOAP, and LDAP, and runs on most versions of Windows and UNIX.</p><p>Digital Creations 2 Inc.</p><p>607 William Street, Suite 201</p><p>Fredericksburg, VA 22401 </p><p>540-371-6909</p><p>http://www.digicool.com/</p><p>General Software's Firmbase operating environment runs firmware applications in System Management Mode (SMM), which insulates code from the foreground operating system with dedicated hardware. Firmware applications run even when the foreground operating system crashes. Firmbase simplifies SMM programming by providing a multithreaded API callable from standard Windows programs, so Firmbase applications can be written in high-level languages. Firmbase itself is loaded by Embedded BIOS 2000, which also includes a quick-boot feature.</p><p>General Software Inc.</p><p>11000 NE 33rd Place, Suite 102</p><p>Bellevue, WA 98004</p><p>425-576-8300</p><p>http://www.gensw.com/</p><p>LinkScan 8.0 from Electronic Software Publishing (Elsop) delivers test automation and web-site management capabilities.

The tool lets you replace the dialogs of an application with web pages acting as ordinary dialogs, since DHTML often allows more freedom in dialogs than the Win32 resource script language: DHTML dialogs are resizable and can use scripts within the dialog itself. A syntax-coloring JavaScript editor is included, as are custom dialogs to assist in designing scripts. The tool requires a Windows platform and Internet Explorer 5.5.</p><p>Buckland, Buchman &amp; Backlund</p><p>Helgevagen 7, SE-182 54</p><p>Djursholm, Sweden</p><p>46-8-753-01-08</p><p>http://www.htmldialogs.com/</p><p>CRiSP 7.1 from Vital is a visual text editor designed to streamline program editing.

DART, short for "Downloadable Assessment Reporting Tool," is intended to give you an estimate of the issues they might encounter during their migration projects. The DART analyzes the number of lines of code per file involved in the migration; the number of files involved; and an estimated total of the issues found. This is MigraTEC's second DART: Future utilities will perform 64-bit and cross-platform migration assessment, and reporting on applications running on the AIX 5L platform.</p><p>MigraTEC Inc.</p><p>11494 Luna Road, Suite 100</p><p>Dallas, TX 75234</p><p>972-969-0385</p><p>http://www.migratec.com/</p><p>Innomation Systems has introduced OmniBasic Version 2.1, a Basic compiler written in Basic.

Any Windows-based scripting language can be integrated.</p><p>Time-to-Market Software</p><p>1031 Sterling Road, Suite 201</p><p>Herndon, VA 20170</p><p>703-733-0345</p><p>http://www.timetomarketsoftware.com/</p><p>Catalyst Systems has announced Openmake 5.12, a build process automation tool for Java developers. Openmake automates identical build processes across all platforms regardless of compiler, IDE, or operating system. Openmake's dynamic compile-time dependency checking lets you avoid complete system builds every time a single component changes. The dependency checking facility detects class constructs such as import, extend, throw, and new. Using Openmake, you can deploy a single Jar file including your source code plus EJB and other third-party classes, and multiple manifest files can be consolidated into one in the Jar.</p><p>Catalyst Systems Corp.</p><p>P.O.
