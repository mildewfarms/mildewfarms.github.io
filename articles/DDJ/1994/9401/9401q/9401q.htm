A native, ANSI-standard Fortran 90 compiler for UNIX platforms has been introduced by Edinburgh Portable Compilers (EPC). EPC's Fortran 90 provides facilities to organize and manage compilation of program units, detects incorrect compilation order, and automatically binds a program from its constituent parts. Optimizing techniques provide array scalarization, dependence analysis, scalar optimizations, and symbolic register allocation. Other key features such as modules, array operations, derived types, recursion, generic and internal procedures, pointers and dynamic allocation, and new control structures are improvements over existing Fortran 77 implementations. This compiler is initially available for SunOS and SPARC-based systems. Reader service no. 22.<P>

Software Technology (And Tools) is offering training courses for object-oriented analysis and design. The thrust of the curriculum is that excellence in engineering begins with a proper analysis of the problem. Good analysis allows the problem to be solved on paper, independent of implementation strategies and techniques.<P>
The agenda includes the following topics: basis for analysis, object-oriented analysis, objects, attributes, relationships, state models, model organization, design of implementation, state- controlled implementation, and CASE for OOA. Classes are held monthly, and on-site training is available. Reader service no. 24.<P>

Analog Devices is set to release a new class of single-chip digital-signal processors (DSP). The ADSP-21060 will provide 32-bit single precision (or 40-bit extended precision) and an IEEE floating-point DSP core with three independent, parallel computational units: ALU, multiplier, and shifter. Performance is equivalent to 40 MIPS, with 120 MFLOPS peak (80 MFLOPS sustained). On-chip, configurable memory banks, such as dual-ported, 4-megabit internal SRAM provide fast, independent local memory access for the DSP core, DMA controller, and I/O processor. Other features include an I/O processor with DMA controller, a memory mapper, and communications. Ten DMA channels, used with the dual-ported SRAM, handle background transfers between internal and external memory, peripherals, host, and serial/link ports--without impact on the performance of the DSP core.<P>
Interface to off-chip memory supports programmable DRAM. The system-bus crossbar provides flexible interconnections between a 16/32-bit host CPU, a DMA device controller, external memory, peripherals, and optional boot EPROM. Target pricing per 1000-piece quantities is $296.00. Reader service no. 27.<P>

Adlersparre recently introduced its Stash 3.0 data-compression software. Stash works on MVS, VM, AS/400, DOS, OS/2, Mac, and most UNIX machines. It translates files from ASCII to EBCDIC, or vice versa to maintain consistency between systems, and multiple files can be compressed and decompressed in one run. Transactions created on PCs or minis that are batched can be uploaded to a mainframe for processing, thus reducing upload time. Prices range from $8500.00 for a mainframe license, to $40.00 for a PC version. Reader service no. 28.<P>

ACCENT STP 2.0 from National Information, is a translation tool for Sun Open Look applications. According to a spokesperson, the Sun user community will now be able to migrate to CDE and COSE without rewriting the graphical user interface portion of their application. ACCENT STP will translate 80 to 100 percent of the C or C++ application source code produced by XView, OLIT, or Devguide GIL files--including header files--for which equivalent paradigms are offered in Motif. The translated output will be recognizable Motif C or C++ source code. Version 2.0 features a number of new enhancements, including support for &quot;drag and drop,&quot; the TTY Widget, and internationalization.<P>
ACCENT STP consists of three separate modules: the Devguide Conversion, XView Conversion, and OLIT Conversion; each costs $4995.00. A WindowMaker GUI editor is $1495.00. Reader service no. 35.<P>
