<h2><a name="0071_0001"><a name="0071_0000">Defense Talks at Foo Bar</h2><P>
Saturdays I man the pumps at an establishment called &quot;Foo Bar&quot; out on Poison Oak Road. Tonight's pretty quiet except for the guy at the end of the bar in the Apple T-shirt sobbing into his third Pepsi. I'm going to have to cut him off soon.<P>
Even Memphis Joe and Corbett are quiet until the car alarm goes off.<P>
All eyes turn to the parking lot, where through the open front door we see a very surprised cat jump off the hood of a BMW. The Pepsi drinker sniffs, &quot;Casper: off,&quot; and the alarm offs.<P>
&quot;Nice system,&quot; Corbett says. &quot;Keyed to the owner's voice, I presume. Pretty foolproof, really.&quot;<P>
Memphis Joe turns back to his mint julep. &quot;It sucks,&quot; he grumbles. I check under the bar for my persuader.<P>
&quot;You're wrong,&quot; Corbett argues. &quot;Any security system is just locks and keys. Here's a key that can only be used by the owner, can't be lost or stolen, and works at a distance.&quot;<P>
&quot;So you think your throat is a safe hiding place,&quot; Memphis Joe says. &quot;Fine. Personally, if somebody holds a knife to my throat, I'll sing like a bird.&quot;<P>
&quot;There's a deterrent,&quot; I say, trying to lighten things up, but Corbett is off on one of his tangents.<P>
&quot;Rather than putting the key in your throat or head,&quot; he says, his eyes dreamy, &quot;what you really want to do is put the lock in the crook's head.&quot;<P>
Memphis Joe raises his glass. &quot;Corbett, that is, without a doubt, the ripest load of garbage you've yet delivered.&quot;<P>
I cut in. &quot;Criminals sure are more violent these days. Drugs, do you figure?&quot;<P>
Memphis Joe doesn't figure that. &quot;Nah, it's plastic money.&quot;<P>
Corbett stares at him. &quot;You're nuts. Before credit cards and ATMs, people walked around with cash all the time. They were far more vulnerable to crime.&quot;<P>
&quot;More vulnerable to pickpockets. Today, the only time a thief can be halfway sure somebody's carrying cash is when they've just left an ATM machine. And that's when the victim is on guard, so no pickpocket stands a chance.&quot;<P>
&quot;Leading to less crime.&quot;<P>
&quot;Leading to the nonviolent dip getting edged out by the violent mugger.&quot;<P>
Corbett shrugs. &quot;Anyway, the real cause of the increase in violent crime in America is the easy availability of military-grade weapons.&quot;<P>
&quot;Huh. I might have known you were one of them.&quot;<P>
&quot;Face facts, Joe. There's solid scientific evidence that the mere possession of a gun increases your risk of getting shot.&quot;<P>
&quot;Correlational data,&quot; Memphis Joe snarls. &quot;The only way to demonstrate a causal link is by experimental manipulation. You have to give people guns and observe the effects, contrasted with a control group not given guns.&quot;<P>
&quot;Oh, there's a brilliant plan,&quot; Corbett sneers.<P>
&quot;Otherwise you can't control the psychological factors.&quot;<P>
&quot;Somebody should control your psychological factors.&quot;<P>
Memphis Joe growls. Corbett's lip curls. The cat, which has sneaked in to steal bread, exits hastily, staying clear of the BMW.<P>
Before things can go any farther, I cough and nod meaningfully at the sign behind the bar, the one that says, &quot;These premises protected by Smith and Wesson.&quot; They shut up just as though a lock has snapped shut in each of their heads.<P>
I like it quiet.<P>
