On the heels of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Market Regulation rule change concerning records preservation, Kidder Peabody recently became one of the first major Wall Street firms to adopt the use of optical-disc technology for record retention. The SEC's amendment allows broker/dealers to use optical-disc technology for storing business and legal records. Microfilm and microfiche have been the preferred mode since 1970; until then, the only acceptable medium was paper. Magnetic media has never been used because alterations cannot be detected.<P>

The SEC outlined ten requirements to ensure that brokers/dealers maintain the integrity of stored data when converting to optical technology, while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with existing record-preservation standards. In general, these requirements cover broker/dealer internal responsibilities (facilities, audit systems, optical-disc storage, duplicate copies, and the like). Central to the SEC's requirements, however, is the notion of &quot;technology escrow&quot; whereby broker/dealers must place in escrow a copy of the physical and logical file formats of the optical discs and indexes, the field format of all different information types, the source code, and all appropriate documentation.<P>

Although specifically targeted to the financial industry, the concept of source-code escrow has important ramifications for both software developers and licensees. Independent software developers quite naturally need to protect their intellectual property, hence they typically license only the object code, not the source code. Software licensees, however, need protection in case the developer disappears or otherwise defaults on agreed upon support requirements. By placing copies of the source code and relevant documentation in the hands of a neutral third-party, the licensee is guaranteed access to information needed to run the business, while software developers are protected from unnecessary technology transfers.<P>

There are no standard circumstances that govern source-code escrow agreements. Relationships range from developers to end users, to more sophisticated alliances involving VARs, OEMs, venture capitalists, software publishers, software partners, and (in this instance) brokers/<P>dealers. The SEC optical-storage requirements are typical of software-escrow situations. Information is stored on optical discs, each comparable to a 12-inch LP record, which hold about 7 billion bytes, or 3.5 million pages of compressed data. The discs are housed in an automated disc library (&quot;jukebox&quot;) for immediate inspection or reference.<P>

Aside from the obvious marketing advantages of anticipating and preparing for the client's requirement for source-code escrow, technology-asset protection directly benefits the developer in other ways too. Specifically, escrow firms offer intellectual-property protection in four areas:<P>

<P>

<UL><LI>Trade-secret protection is the form of intellectual property protection that is most intricate and enigmatic to achieve. Its primary tenet is that the developer make the greatest possible effort to keep information secret. In an infringement suit, the court passes judgment based on the extent of measures the developer has taken. To benefit from perpetual protection under the trade-secret umbrella, it must be treated as such from the beginning, using employee-confidentiality agreements, other precautions, and source-code escrow.</LI><P>

<LI>An alternative to filing for copyright protection is to deposit the entire source code with an escrow firm to minimize the exposure of the information and serve as time- and date-stamped documentation in the event of a copyright-infringement case.</LI><P>

<LI>Employees with access to trade secrets constitute the most obvious and difficult problem. Addressing this dilemma with a source-trail agreement communicates to employees and contractors the company's serious commitment to information protection.</LI><P>

</UL>Escrow provides effective proof of ownership in case an employee should steal information and leave the company to develop the product under another name. This is especially germane in the software industry, where many companies are founded with the expectation of being sold. The value of the company's asset will be based on the ability to document clear ownership.<P>

<UL><LI>Source-code escrow is an effective means of disaster protection. Specialized vaults protect the deposit against natural disasters and minimize the risk of losing all of your source-code copies.</LI><P>
