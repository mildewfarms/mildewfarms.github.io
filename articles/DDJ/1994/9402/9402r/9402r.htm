Microsoft has released Visual C++ 1.5, which includes support for OLE 2.0 and ODBC. If nothing else, this release should be a shot in the arm for OLE 2.0 as much as Visual C++. OLE 2.0 has been haltingly adopted by developers in large part because of its complexity. VC++ 1.5 addresses this complexity, making OLE 2.0 much more approachable by providing a set of classes for OLE-based development. The AppWizard for VC++ 1.5 supports containers, miniservers, full-server, and similar applications, as well as visual editing and drag-and-drop.<P>
Database support is through a group of data-access classes that implement an ODBC API. For example, a new base class called <I>RecordView</I> displays data in a form. VC++ 1.5 also includes royalty-free ODBC drivers for a variety of off-the-shelf database packages.<P>
Version 1.5 now runs under Windows NT; some of the requirements are: MS-DOS 5.0, Windows 3.1, a 386 or higher, and 8 Mbytes of RAM. Reader service no. 22.<P>

Inform Software, a fuzzy-logic development-tool vendor, has teamed up with Texas Instruments and Intel to support processors from both companies. In particular, the Windows-hosted fuzzyTech 3.1 development environment will generate C code for TI's TMS320C2/5 digital-signal processors and Intel's MCS 96, MCS 51, and 80C186 microcontrollers. (TI's implementation of fuzzyTech is called fuzzyTech 3.1 MCU-320, while Intel's is fuzzyTech 3.0 NeuroFuzzy.)<P>
fuzzyTech is a graphical CASE tool that supports design steps for fuzzy-system engineering. It provides simulation and optimization and displays system performance in multiple ways to give you efficient optimization options. Finally, it generates C/assembler code optimized for the target processor.<P>
TI's fuzzyTech MCU-320 Explorer version sells for $199.00, and the fuzzyTech MCU-320 Edition version for $1890.00. Intel's fuzzyTech 3.0 NeuroFuzzy module (an extension for all fuzzyTech 3.0 Editions) sells for $900.00. Reader service no. 28.<P>

The MainWin SDK from MainSoft is a cross-platform development tool for porting Windows applications to UNIX workstations. MainSoft claims that the underlying code of the original application does not have to change and that developers can upgrade all versions--Windows and UNIX--simultaneously. MainSoft further claims that in benchmarks of common Windows programs, MainWin-based applications run 10 to 20 times faster than comparable WABI-based apps. MainWin requires minimal rewriting of C/C++ code, focusing on 16-bit to 32-bit dependency conversion. MainWin initially supports AIX, HP-UX, Solaris 2.2, SunOS 4.1, and IRIX 5.1.<P>
The MainWin SDK sells for $5000.00 for the first copy, $2000.00 for subsequent copies. MainWin for Workstations, the end-user environment, sells for $195.00. Reader service no. 30.<P>
