<a name="00bc_0040"><a name="00bc_0000">ObjectSoftware has released ObjectTrace 1.0, a profiler and tracer for C++ applications. This tool allows you to trace C++ programs using instrumentation techniques, C++ objects, C++ object-member functions, and any memory leaks by C++ objects. The tool then produces a call-graph on the C++ application that has been traced, along with a detailed report on object instances and memory leaks. ObjectTrace is currently available for SunOS 4.1.x and Solaris 2.3. A single-user license sells for $395.00. Reader service no. 20.<P>

Pacific Communication Sciences Inc. (PCSI) has announced its Ubiquity CDPD SDK--a software-only approach for simulating an<B> </B>end-to-end CDPD network on a PC without resorting to cellular airlinks. The Ubiquity SDK enables software developers to create DOS- and Windows-based wireless applications for the CDPD cellular data network. The SDK includes a CDPD network simulator that permits applications to be built, tested, and demonstrated in a controlled environment reflecting the wide range of conditions that occur in normal field environments.<P>
The Windows PC-based network simulator supports configurable serial communications interfaces for two mobile computers and one fixed-end computer. Its programmable event logs and traffic statistics provide developers a superior application debug and analysis capability. By eliminating the need for the CDPD cellular airlink, the simulator reduces both development time and the need for cellular service.<P>
The Ubiquity SDK provides a library of communication interfaces such as the Windows Sockets API and the SLIP protocol. The SDK provides an AT emulation mode, allowing existing modem applications to operate over the CDPD-packet data service. The library includes an optimized DOS API utilizing the TCP/IP protocol stack built into all PCSI Ubiquity subscriber products. The Ubiquity CDPD SDK sells for $995.00. Reader service no. 23.<P>

EsiObjects 1.1, an object-oriented application-programming environment based on the M language (a MUMPS derivative) has been released by ESI. The Windows-hosted system combines over 140 classes containing almost 2000 methods. These classes are stored in a network-based multidimensional database so that a multitude of programmers can share tools across the network. Additionally, the database can be built into client/server applications. EsiObjects runs on most M implementations that support workstation hardware and a windows interface. Run-time environments are supported on all M implementations. Single-user licenses cost $1295.00. Reader service no. 25.<P>

Visigenic Software has licensed the source code to Microsoft's ODBC SDK 2.0 in order to port the ODBC technology to UNIX. ODBC is Microsoft's interface for accessing data in a heterogeneous environment of relational and nonrelational database- management systems. The license covers the Driver Manager, ODBC utilities, and documentation. <P>
In porting the ODBC Driver Manager 2.0 to UNIX, Visigenic provides a complete ODBC SDK for UNIX database programmers. Developers will be able to use the Visigenic ODBC SDK to create C or C++ programs that use the ODBC API, or conversely, create their own driver for a new data source. The SDK is also required by any other type of language or application, such as a spreadsheet or word processor, which needs to access DBMS data on UNIX, through a standard programmer interface, regardless of the brand of SQL engine. Initially, Visigenic is developing drivers for the following UNIX data sources: Informix, Oracle, and Sybase. These drivers, as well as drivers written by other data sources, are available separately from the SDK.<P>
The Visigenic SDK will include the Driver Manager, header files, sample programs, and utilities to speed the development of applications or new drivers. Since these components are common with the Microsoft SDK for Windows, DBMS developers can write to a single database API for applications that can be executed in both Windows and UNIX environments. The Visigenic ODBC SDK will be priced at $995.00. Reader service no. 26.<P>

Three C programming tools have been released by Interactive Instruments. The first, Data-Organ, is a data-management tool which serves as a base for multi-instance B*-trees and a record-set manager for keyed or direct access. Keyed access is performed by extendable hash in the foreground or by B*-tree indexing.<P>
The second tool is KeyPoint, which contains AVL-balanced binary trees, a keyword-table manager that allows access by abbreviations or synonyms, and a constructor and interpreter for languages of the operator/operand type.<P>
The third tool, TextMatch, consists of a finite-state pattern translator and context-free macro-substitution processor. Both work as character pipelines with user-supplied input/output handling.<P>
DataOrgan sells for $450.00, KeyPoint  for $130.00, and TextMatch for $180.00. As a set, the three packages, which are supplied in source-code form with no run-time royalties, are available for $680.00. Reader service no. 28.<P>

Novell has announced support for the VIM (Vendor Independent Messaging API from the VIM consortium), CMC (Common Mail Calls from the XAPI Association), and Simple MAPI (from Microsoft) messaging APIs. Applications based on these APIs can be used to interoperate with native NetWare MHS programs that run on SMF, Novell's messaging API.<P>
The VIM API is a procedural, cross-platform messaging, transport-independent API developed by a consortium of industry vendors, including Novell, IBM, Apple, Borland, Lotus, MCI, Oracle, and WordPerfect. Applications developed with VIM include Borland's Quartro Pro for Windows, Central Point Tools for Windows, Microsoft Office, and WordPerfect InForms.<P>
CMC was designed to offer basic mail-enabling capabilities in a procedural, cross-platform messaging, transport-independent environment. Applications developed with CMC include Collabra Share, MS Word, and Excel. <P>
Simple MAPI was originally provided as a subset of the MAPI 1.0 API. Microsoft has since replaced it with CMC as its recommended basic mail-enabling API. Simple MAPI is a basic mail-enabling API for Windows upon which a variety of older mail-enabled solutions are based.<P>
SMF provides full access to all features of the NetWare MHS product line, including NetWare Global MHS, NetWare Basic MHS, and NetWare Remote MHS. <P>
All these API libraries are available free of charge as a set of DLLs for Windows. The libraries will be distributed on NetWire, included as part of the next NetWare SDK release, and integrated with all NetWare MHS product revisions. Reader service no. 31.<P>
