<H3>Encryption</H3>

<P>The National Institute of Standards and Technology has officially
designated Digital Signature Standard (DSS) public-key cryptography
as a Federal Information Processing Standard (#186), effective
12/1/94. Federal agencies, businesses, and private individuals can now
authenticate digital signatures for bids and other electronically
submitted data. In other news, the House Foreign Affairs Committee has
voted to allow the export of software with any kind of encryption,
dealing a blow to NSA-backed Clipper chip proposals. The provision
bars the government from requiring export encryption licenses for
&quot;generally available software.&quot;</P>

<H3>Internet</H3>

<P>The National Science Foundation has awarded contracts to telephone
companies to operate Internet &quot;Network Access Points&quot; (NAPs)
and an NSF-funded very high-speed backbone. According to the
Washington-based Taxpayer Assets Project, there are indications that
the telephone companies operating the NAPs will push to price Internet
services based on Internet usage, instead of the now common
flat-fee.</P>
