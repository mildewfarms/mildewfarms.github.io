<H1>Eurocrypt '94</H1>

<H3>Bruce Schneier</H3>

<P>In the cryptographic world--at least, the cryptographic world
outside the military--there are two major annual conferences: Crypto
and Eurocrypt. Eurocrypt '94, held in Perugia, Italy, in mid-May, had
an attendance of approximately 300, representing the best in academic
cryptography from five continents. A total of 37 papers were presented
at the main session, with another 20 or so at an informal &quot;rump
session&quot; one evening.</P>

<P>Much of what was presented was very theoretical and only of
marginal use to front-line programmers actually implementing such
things. Still, I found the following both useful and important:</P>

<P>

<UL> <LI>Feedback with Carry-Shift Registers (FCSRs). Linear-Feedback
Shift Registers (LFSRs) have been the workhorse of military
cryptography for years. Goresky and Klapper have discovered a new
class of shift registers which should prove to be just as
useful. There are analogues for most of the LFSR theory that apply to
FCSRs. Algorithms implemented with LFSRs can be implemented with
FCSRs, possibly with different degrees of security. Even more
interesting should be cryptographic algorithms, which use a mixture of
LFSRs and FCSRs. I expect this to dramatically change the development
of stream ciphers.</LI>

<LI>Synthesis of Public-Key Algorithms. Numerous public-key,
digital-signature algorithms are based on the problem of taking
discrete logarithms in a finite field: El Gamal, Schnorr, and the
Digital-Signature Standard (DSS) are three such examples. Nyberg and
Rueppel presented a paper which unified all of these algorithms (108
total) into one family. They also showed how to encrypt with all of
them. This allows for further research on the entire family of
algorithms, not just on one in particular. It also lays to rest
Schnorr's claim that the DSS infringed on his patent; it is now clear
that both Schnorr and DSS are specific cases in this general
algorithm.</LI>

<LI>The Digital-Signature Standard. Naccache, M'Raihi, Raphaeli, and
Vaudenay presented enhancements to the DSS--one that increases speed
and another that reduces storage requirements (important for
smart-card implementations). Their most interesting enhancement is the
ability to verify multiple signatures in a single operation. A
complaint against DSS is that signature verification is slow. The
batch-verification method in this paper should silence that complaint
once and for all.</LI>

<LI>Visual Cryptography. Shamir developed a one-time-pad cryptosystem
suitable for encrypting visual images. The key is a pattern of black
and white pixels on a transparency; the ciphertext is another pattern
of black and white pixels. Overlay the key on the ciphertext, and the
message appears. This is unconditionally secure; even alien
civilizations with undreamed-of computing power cannot break this
cryptosystem. One application is sending an encrypted message via fax:
The receiver can carry the key transparency with him and receive the
encrypted fax from an insecure machine. Cool stuff.</LI>

<LI>Designated Confirmer Signatures. Undeniable signatures are
signatures which need permission from the signer to verify. One
application is computer publication of data. The recipient of the data
wants to be able to verify the publisher's signature, so he knows that
the data is authentic. The publisher wants his signature to be
verifiable only by people who have paid for the data and not by people
who have pirated it. Undeniable signatures do that. Chaum's extension
allows the publisher to designate an agent who can help receivers
verify the signatures.</LI>

<LI>Differential and Linear Cryptanalysis. Both of these techniques
were further refined by several people. Two papers, one by Biham and
another by Chabaud and Vaudenay, looked at similarities between the
two. Matsui found an alternate order for the S-boxes that is resistant
to linear cryptanalysis; unfortunately, it is weak against
differential cryptanalysis.</LI>

<LI>Self-Shrinking Generator. The shrinking generator was a big hit at
Crypto '93. Basically, a LFSR is decimated by another LFSR. This
stream algorithm is simple to implement and looks very strong. Meyer
and Staffelbach developed a variant of this generator, which uses a
single LFSR. The even bits of the generator are used to decimate the
odd bits. This is even simpler to implement and just as strong.</LI>

<LI>Formal Protocol Design. One of the problems with authentication
protocols, such as Kerberos is proving that they are correct. There's
nothing more embarrassing than fielding a protocol and finding a
security problem two years later. Syverson and Meadows have developed
an expert system that helps detect security problems in
protocols.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Among the interesting papers presented at the rump session were
Biham's, showing that triple-DES in cipher-feedback mode, with
triple-DES as the block cipher, is more secure than a large number of
variant possibilities. Knudsen found a class of &quot;weak&quot; keys
for DES and LOKI when those algorithms are used as one-way hash
functions. However, there is really nothing to worry about; the odds
of picking such a key at random is very small. Charnes and O'Connor
presented some initial comments on the GOST algorithm, an encryption
algorithm from the Soviet Union.</P>

<P>The side discussions were also interesting. At least two
cryptographers are working on something called &quot;higher-order
differential cryptanalysis.&quot; Although this technique has had
great success against DES with only 5 rounds, no one knows how to
extend it to a full 16-round DES. One cryptographer has developed an
alternate set of DES S-boxes that is resistant to both differential
and linear cryptanalysis, while another has developed a method for
generating key-dependent S-boxes that increase the effective key size
of DES beyond 56 bits. If there are going to be any more attacks
against DES, this--and Hellman's attempts to combine differential and
linear cryptanalysis--is where you'll want to be watching.</P>

<P>RSA-129 was recently factored. This is the 129-digit number, the
product of two large primes, that was featured in Martin Gardner's
seminal <I>Scientific American</I> column (August 1977) about the RSA
algorithm. Although this doesn't affect the security of the 1024-bit
numbers used in programs such as PGP, it does show how far we've come
in 15 years. Gardner was sure this number would not be factored for
millions of years.</P>

<P>The other big news is a security problem with the Secure Hash
Algorithm (SHA); see &quot;The Secure Hash Algorithm&quot; by William
Stallings, <I>DDJ</I>, April 1994. NSA cryptographers acknowledge
they've found a problem with the algorithm, but they won't tell anyone
what, or even how serious, it is. Still, they promise a fix really
soon now. Expect that fix to be secret, too. We're all waiting with
bated breath.</P>
