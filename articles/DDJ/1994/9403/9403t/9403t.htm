<a name="00fa_0001"><a name="00fa_0000">The Tool Interface Standards (TIS) Committee, a group of software companies working to advance the interoperability and portability of development tools for 32-bit Intel architecture operating environments, has announced version 1.1 of the TIS Portable Formats Specification.<P>
The TIS spec standardizes the first linkable, loadable, and debug formats. The formats include the relocatable object module format (OMF), executable linkable format (ELF), and debug information format (DWARF). The committee has also agreed upon Microsoft's PE and symbol and type information (STI) for the Windows environment. Version 1.1 updates OMF and DWARF by clarifying inconsistencies in the OMF standard and adding functionality to the DWARF standard through support for C++, Fortran-90, Modula-2, and Pascal.<P>
TIS includes the aforementioned Portable Formats Specification for defining file formats portable across Windows, UNIX, OS/2, and other operating systems, and the Formats Specification for Windows, which describes formats for 32-bit implementations of Windows. TIS-compliance enables you to mix- and-match tools that previously conformed to proprietary interface specs. Companies backing TIS include Borland, IBM, Microsoft, Intel, SCO, Novell, Microtec, Watcom, Lotus, Metaware, Lahey, Autodesk, SSI, and Absoft.<P>
Copies of the Tool Interface Standards specification are available on Compu- Serve (GO IntelAccess) or the Intel Literature Center (order #241597). Reader service no. 20.<P>

The HTI Map Developer's Kit from Horizon Technology is a set of three programming libraries that allow you to add detailed raster-mapping capabilities to any Windows- or DOS-based application. The Map Display Library, on which the Developer's Kit is based, supports functions such as loading, displaying, zooming, and seamless scrolling through a database of geo- referenced raster maps. It also contains functions to convert geographic coordinates to screen coordinates and vice versa.<P>
In addition to the Map Display Library, the Developer's Kit includes the Map Overlay and GPS Support add-on libraries. These tools can be used in conjunction with CD-ROM-based regional and metropolitan map sets, also available from Horizons.<P>
The Map Overlay Library allows you to create object-oriented databases using objects such as points, lines, ellipses, polygons, and so forth. These objects can be geo referenced to the underlying map database and application-<P>specific data.<P>
The Developer's Kit supports Microsoft C and Borland C++. The three-library kit sells for $1739.00. You can also buy the libraries separately. Reader service no. 25.<P>

Visual Edge's Visual Action Toolset is a collection of tools that incorporates Display PostScript and the OSF/Motif widget set for creating document interfaces which allow a PostScript image to be used as an interface element. Additionally, any standard interface element can be incorporated into a PostScript image or document. The tool set uses a layered approach to development that parallels X application development. The Visual Action Widget Set, comprised of rendering widgets, see-through controls and a Visual Manager, is analogous to Motif. In this layer, rendering widgets give the ability to display a PostScript image and to control interface graphics, see-through controls enable the developer to create widgets with transparent backgrounds, and Visual Manager widgets control the display and position of child widgets.<P>
The Visual Action Toolset Framework, analogous to the Xt toolkit, provides the functionality common to VA widgets. The framework can be used to subclass existing VA widgets or to create new widget classes. A Display PostScript Client Library, similar in nature to Xlib, provides a C language interface to the Display PostScript system.<P>
The Visual Action Toolset sells for $2500.00. It supports UNIX and Motif on SunOS 4.1.3, AIX 3.2.4, and SGI IRIX 5.1.1. Reader service no. 26.<P>

Procase Corporation is shipping SmartSystem 3.0, a software tool that helps programmers understand and fix large amounts of unfamiliar source code by graphically displaying code structure, providing information about errors and dependencies, and performing impact analysis. SmartSystem is distinguished by its large capacity (able to handle C programs in excess of 1 million lines of code) and robustness (able to handle code that is incomplete, does not compile, or has errors). It can handle many dialects of C, including code targeted for many UNIX platforms and embedded systems, providing both graphical and textual views of code, using a variety of formatting styles.<P>
Version 3.0 runs on Sparc/SunOS, Sparc/Solaris, HP9000/700, and IBM RS/6000 platforms. The major new functionality is the addition of a makefile analyzer to facilitate getting started in building the code database. It also provides additional code comprehension capabilities in the Call Graph display, by showing dependencies involving global data and function pointers (in addition to showing function and library calls, as supported in the previous version). There are also mechanisms for uncovering undefined preprocessor macros. Reader service no. 27.<P>

Intel and Microsoft have jointly announced an update to the Advanced Power Management (APM) Interface specification, which is designed to increase battery life for portable and other low-power consumption computers based on Intel platforms. Originally released in January 1992, APM allows the operating system to communicate through ROM BIOS to instruct system resources to power down during periods of nonuse. APM is already supported by the Plug and Play BIOS specification. New features of APM 1.1 include new power-management functions to enhance cross-platform compatibility, enhancements to the suspend/pause scheme for improved communication between the operation system and BIOS, and a BIOS-compatibility test so that BIOS developers can verify compliance with the specification.<P>
Copies of the APM 1.1 BIOS Interface specification are available through the Intel Literature Center, order #241704. The document is also available on <P>CompuServe through Intel Access, the company's developer-support service. Alternatively, the specification can be obtained through Microsoft's Hardware Vendor Relations Group, or through the Plug and Play forum on CompuServe. The APM 1.1 BIOS-compatibility test is available to OEMs and BIOS-developers through Intel's General Support Group (800-628-8686). Reader service no. 29.<P>
