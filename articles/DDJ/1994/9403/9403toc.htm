<h3><a href="9403a/9403a.htm">BINARY-DATA PORTABILITY</A></h3><P>
<i>by Jos&eacute; Luu</i><P>
The DDR compiler Jos&eacute; presents here makes it possible for you to create truly portable tools for handling binary-data representations between different environments. This means you can create a single source-code base without having to add elaborate data-translation code.<P>
<h3><a href="9403b/9403b.htm">THE WRAPI TOOLKIT</A></h3><P>
<i>by Gregory C. Sarafin</i><P>
WRAPI is a language-independent API that generates language-specific libraries. The host languages it supports include C, Clipper, FoxPro (DOS and Windows), Visual Basic (DOS and Windows), Pascal, Clarion, Fortran, and more.<P>
<h3><a href="9403c/9403c.htm">MULTIPLATFORM .INI FILES</A></h3><P>
<i>by Joseph J. Graf</i><P>
Joe's multiplatform implementations of the the Windows <I>GetPrivateProfileString()</I>, <I>GetPrivateProfileInt()</I>, and <I>WritePrivateProfileString()</I> functions support DOS and UNIX, too.<P>
<h3><a href="9403d/9403d.htm">PORTABILITY BY DESIGN</A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Ross</i><P>
Michael lifts the hood on MetaWare's compiler technology, sharing the mapping structures and techniques that make porting the compiler from one platform to another a relatively simple task.<P>
<h3><a href="9403e/9403e.htm">UNICODE AND SOFTWARE GLOBALIZATION</A></h3><P>
<i>by David Van Camp</i><P>
Writing code for international markets requires an understanding of the Unicode standard. David examines the standard and discusses how you go about implementing Unicode support.<P>
<h3><a href="9403f/9403f.htm">WRITING NON-SCSI CD-ROM DEVICE DRIVERS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Sing Li</i><P>
Compatibility is one of the main reasons why environments such as the Windows NT and OS/2 2.x operating systems support SCSI-based CD-ROM hardware. However, if you want to use non-SCSI CD-ROM drives with them, you'll have to write your own device drivers. This article discusses how you code those drivers for Windows NT.<P>
Thanks to Corinne H. Godon of Neuron Data (Palo Alto, CA) for helping with the systems and software shown on the cover and elsewhere in this issue.<P>
<h3><a href="9403g/9403g.htm">THE ADVANCED SCSI PROGRAMMING INTERFACE</A></h3><P>
<i>by Brian Sawert</i><P>
The advanced SCSI programming interface, available for DOS, OS/2, Novell NetWare, and other operating systems, provides a high-level function set that's easy to use because it hides the inner workings of SCSI protocol.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9403h/9403h.htm">EMULATING NON-DOS SYSTEMS UNDER MS-DOS </A></h3><P>
<i>by Dan Troy</i><P>
Dan describes a table-mapping mechanism to handle operating-system functions and their associated parameters. This allowed him to emulate non-DOS systems while running on DOS-based PC development environments.<P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9403i/9403i.htm">CROSS-PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT WITH VISUAL C++</A></h3><P>
<i>by Chane Cullens</i><P>
Although generally thought of as a DOS/Windows development tool, Microsoft's Visual C++ and the Microsoft Foundation Class library can be used for cross-platform development. Chane discusses how you can use them to write portable code, whether you're coding for Windows, UNIX, NT, Macintosh, or whatever.<P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9403j/9403j.htm">DATABASE DEVELOPMENT AND VISUAL BASIC 3.0</A></h3><P>
<i>by Ken North</i><P>
Although Microsoft calls it &quot;Visual Basic 3.0 Professional Edition,&quot; you could just as easily refer to the package as &quot;the Visual Basic Database Edition&quot; because of the available database tools and functionality. Ken examines the Visual Basic 3.0 environment and database tools, presenting a multimedia database app in the process.<P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9403k/9403k.htm">PORTING FROM DOS TO WINDOWS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Walter Oney</i><P>
WinGate's client/server API minimizes your recoding efforts when moving from DOS to Windows. Walter uses the tool to build a simple client/server database application.<P>

<h3><a href="9403l/9403l.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS </A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Swaine</i><P>
Last year, Apple introduced the Newton MessagePad, along with a new user-interface model, new development platform, and new object-oriented language. Michael discusses what Newton really is (and isn't), the first Newton Platform Development Conference, and the Newton Toolkit, and speculates on the unique challenges Newton presents.<P>
<h3><a href="9403m/9403m.htm">C PROGRAMMING</A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens</i><P>
Al takes a break from the rigors of coding to mull over software patents, electronic books, and the mysteries of placing a long (but not too long) distance phone call in Silicon Valley.<P>
<h3><a href="9403n/9403n.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY </A></h3><P>
<i>edited by Tom Swan</i><P>
Ernie Deel shares a data-compression technique that uses pattern recognition to quickly achieve efficient compression ratios.<P>
<h3><a href="9403o/9403o.htm">UNDOCUMENTED CORNER </A></h3><P>
<i>edited by Andrew Schulman</i><P>
Alex Shmidt presents a technique for dynamically loading and unloading VxDs without having to use VXDLDR or a VxD file. This is, in fact, a general technique for calling any 32-bit Ring 0 code from a normal Ring 3 Windows program.<P>
<h3><a href="9403p/9403p.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF </A></h3><P>
<i>by Jonathan Erickson</i><P>
Like it or not, self-help programming and legal books go hand-in-hand. This month, we examine two new legal self-help books, <I>Software Development: A Legal Guide</I>, and <I>The Software Developer's and Marketer's Legal Companion</I>.<P>
