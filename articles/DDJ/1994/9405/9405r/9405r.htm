Up until now, even if you wanted to use the Qualitas Memory Tester only to test RAM, you had to purchase Qualitas' 386MAX or BlueMAX packages. Now, however, Qualitas has released RAMexam, a stand-alone version of its Memory Tester. Unlike parity testing, which only catches a certain class of errors, RAMexam uses a fault model based on the multiple ways in which RAM is known to fail. This model employs a strategy of specific sequences of bit patterns designed to detect specific types of memory failures. The DOS-based utility sells for $29.95. Reader service no. 24.<P>

The Open Software Foundation has announced that OSF/Motif has been formally approved by a unanimous vote of the balloting group of the IEEE Computer Society Standards Board as the GUI standard P1295--the Modular Toolkit Environment. The P1295 standard specification of more than 600 pages is derived from the OSF/Motif documentation set, and specifies both the API and appearance and behavior (look and feel) for Motif. Motif 1.2 is compliant with the standard.<P>
Additionally, the Motif API specification has also been submitted to X/Open's Fast-Track review process. The Motif specification under X/Open review is a superset consistent with the core functionality in P1295, and is also derived from the OSF Motif documentation. The X/Open version of the Motif specification contains additional Motif features such as drag-and-drop, internationalization, and gadgets. Reader service no. 32.<P>

Now that they've buried their respective GUI hatchets, Microsoft and Apple have announced an agreement involving the interoperability of their messaging and directory services.<P>
As part of the agreement, the two companies will jointly develop a suite of Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI) service providers, and Apple Open Collaboration Environment (AOCE) technology-based gateways to allow programmers to build cross-platform client-server solutions.<P>
The new gateways and service providers will provide MAPI-compliant applications for Windows access to Apple's PowerShare Collaboration Servers; and will also give applications (based on the AOCE technology and PowerTalk APIs on Macs and PowerBooks) access to Microsoft information management software. Microsoft and Apple also agreed to provide a gateway between their server products and to support the basic send capability Common Mail Calls in their products. Reader service no. 33.<P>
