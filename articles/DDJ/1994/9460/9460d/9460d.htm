Tsunami Plus Wavelet Software Version 1.0 is a DOS library of wavelet-transform routines and support functions from Mac A. Cody Associates. The library contains routines to perform one- and two-dimensional discrete-wavelet and wavelet-packet transforms. The routines will work with either single- or double-precision data. In addition, the library contains support routines for the management and display of transform data and the design and verification of wavelet filters used by the transforms. The routines of the library are used in demonstration programs which are provided with the library.<P>

The package also provides wavelet filters to generate orthogonal wavelet-filter coefficients. The routines implement a new parameterization algorithm, developed by E. Kurt TeKolste, which is similar in concept to the parameterization method of Tewfek. The TeKolste algorithm can generate the Daubechies wavelets and other orthogonal wavelets. There is no limitation to the length of the filters that can be generated beyond that set by the number of parameterization angles and the floating-point precision.<P>

Tsunami Plus 1.0 is shipped as C source-code modules. The demonstration programs are shipped with 80x86 DOS executables as well as source code. Compilers directly supported are Borland Turbo C 2.0 Professional and Borland C++ 4.0 (Microsoft C is supported through macro definitions). Documentation for the various routines in the library, the demo programs, and tutorials are also provided.<P>

The library sells for $499.00 plus $10.00 shipping and handling in the U.S. and Canada ($20.00 elsewhere).<P>

Domain Technologies has released LINK-C30, a development system for the Texas Instruments TMS320C3x family of floating-point, digital-signal processors. The development system consists of a software symbolic debugger and a hardware-emulation plug-in board which interacts directly with the 030's built-in debugging port. LINK-C30 uses the PC as the host processor and the scan-path port as the emulation path to the DSP core.<P>

The debugger, which lets you debug C at the C level, supports trapping features such as conditional breakpoints and break-on expressions. An inline symbolic assembler lets you write or path the DSP program without leaving the debugger.<P>

LINK-C30, which is compatible with TI's assembler, linker, and C compiler, sells for $2600.00.<P>
