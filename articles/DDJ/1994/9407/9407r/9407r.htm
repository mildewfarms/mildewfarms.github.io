<a name="007e_001f"><a name="007e_0000">The Gamelon file-access library from Menai is designed to enable programmers to store program data as objects. The tool lets you create multidimensional file structures, enabling object-based and cross-platform file access. It does so by providing object nesting, &quot;logical navigation&quot; via logical object navigation rather than file-pointer and offset manipulation, and &quot;auto-object tracking,&quot; which makes it possible to automatically track the location of data regardless of changes in the structure of a file. <P>
Data objects created with the Gamelon library hold a single data value. Aggregate objects then associate a number of data objects. These aggregate objects can then be acted on as a single unit. Aggregate objects can also be placed within other aggregate objects, allowing you to create and connect nested objects.<P>
In addition to the library and API, Gamelon includes a browser, a compiler module that creates a Gamelon file from a text specification, a decompiler module that creates a text spec from a Gamelon file, and a journal-recovery application that rebuilds a Gamelon file from its journal. <P>
The first release of Gamelon is for OS/2 ($495.00) and Windows ($395.00). Releases for UNIX, Macintosh, and NT will follow. Reader service no. 20.<P>

The WinRT Toolkit from BlueWater Systems is a software-development kit for building Win32 real-time applications for Windows NT. The SDK allows you to write programs to directly access port I/O, memory I/O, and interrupts without having to deal with Microsoft's Windows NT Device Driver Kit (the NT DDK). With the WinRT kit, you only need to deal with three API calls to write device drivers, instead of coping with the 250+ calls required by the DDK. <P>
WinRT includes templates for developing real-time threads and connecting them to Visual Basic, Visual C++, and other programming languages. It also includes the WinRT Device Driver with royalty-free run time, the WinRT preprocessor, DOS simulator, the NT Registry editor, and samples. It sells for $595.00 and includes six months of technical support. Reader service no. 21.<P>

DataFocus has introduced NuTCRACKER, a family of tools for developers who want to port UNIX applications to Win32/Windows NT. NuTCRACKER enables developers to recompile UNIX source code and link it to NuTCRACKER's DLLs, resulting in native Win32 applications. NuTCRACKER, which includes a collection of UNIX calls based on SVR4 and POSIX, supports both C and C++. After the application has been ported, end users can run their UNIX applications in the Windows environment without having to learn complex UNIX commands.<P>
The NuTCRACKER family supports Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, SVR4, Ultrix, XPG4/POSIX, and other source platforms. It includes the NuTCRACKER SDK, which in turn, includes the NuTCRACKER API, based on UNIX SVR4 and POSIX, the MKS Toolkit, and utilities such as KornShell, make, vi, awk, and over 100 more. Also included are the NuTCRACKER X/Operating Environment, an X server that combined with the NuT-CRACKER DLLs, runs X Window apps; and NuTCRACKER X/SDK, which combines the SDK and X/OE products with libraries for porting X/Motif applications. The NuTCRACKER SDK sells for $995.00, including demo programs and online documentation. Reader service no. 22.<P>

Virtuoso Nano, a microkernel for DSP systems, has been released by Intelligent Systems International. The core nanokernel of the single-processor (SP) implementation of Virtuoso Nano uses less than 200 instructions and provides for sub-microsecond context switching, true multitasking, time events, and interprocess communication via semaphore-based, stack-based, linked-list-based, or FIFO-list-based channels. The multiprocessor extensions (MP) add about 300 more instructions, while the virtual single-processor (VSP) implementation provides what amounts to parallel processing in the system. The VSP does this by implementing the communication as part of the kernel services. The VSP uses less than 1000 instructions. <P>
Virtuoso Nano is available for the Texas Instruments 32040 and Motorola 96002 processors. Ports to Analog Devices' 21020 and 21060 are underway. Development-kit prices start at $2000.00. Reader service no. 31.<P>

The CD-R Personal Archiver from Marcan is a recorder which makes it possible for you to record and store information on CD-ROM. According to Marcan, the CD-ROM recorder (CD-R) is the only currently available system that lets you record and play back increments of data before finalizing the CD-ROM. As each session is recorded, it is labeled. When all sessions are ready to be burned into the CD-ROM, the Personal Archiver creates a table of contents. This process addresses the current lack of ISO multisession standards for CD-ROMs. The recorded data can be read by any standard CD-ROM drive.<P>
The Personal Archiver supports track-at-once (that is, regular CD-ROMs), incremental, and multisession recording and conforms to Hi-Sierra and ISO 9660 format standards. A half-height internal 5.25-inch CD-R sells for $4100.00 and includes recording software and SCSI adapter. External versions are also available. Versions of Personal Archiver are available for Windows, DOS, Macintosh, and UNIX. Reader service no. 33.<P>
