Borland ate<BR>
Ashton-Tate,<BR>
Learned that it was poison, but by then it was too late.
<P>***<P>
All praise to earnest Albert Gore,<BR>
The Veep.<BR>
He's working through the night while you're<BR>
Asleep.<BR>
Gonna build that highway,<BR>
Gonna build it my way,<BR>
Says straight, unbending Albert Gore,<BR>
The Veep.<BR>
But Al, is your way open, free, or<BR>
Cheap?
<P>***<P>
Kaleida had a kalision with Spindler's bottom line.<BR>
When Michael makes decisions, executives resign.<BR>
Heads of two divisions fell under Spindler's frown.<BR>
As well as lesser mortals: The shake-up trickles down.
<P>***<P>
Last year Utah-based Novell<BR>
Planned, when it bought USL,<BR>
To shake the Windows, rattle Gates.<BR>
Float UnixWare on the Great Salt Lake.<BR>
But new exec Bob Frankenberg<BR>
Thinks desktop Unix is absurd,<BR>
So former CEO Ray Noorda's<BR>
Plan floats dead upon the waters.
<P>***<P>
A bug in a chip that's already been shipped<BR>
Is rarely a thing to applaud.<BR>
But with Bill saying, &quot;Trust us,&quot; 'twas poetic justice<BR>
When the Clipper was shown to be flawed.
<P>***<P>
Richard Nixon, scum of the earth,<BR>
Was buried with honors in the land of his birth.<BR>
Kurt Cobain, the voice of our youth,<BR>
Considered a bullet the pathway to truth.<BR>
Isn't it time that somebody said,<BR>
It's not always wrong to speak ill of the dead?
<P>***<P>
Their RS systems sales were brisk,<BR>
So IBM thought, &quot;Run the RISC!&quot;<BR>
Apple beat them to the punch.<BR>
Will Compaq have them both for lunch?
<P>***<P>
Microsoft lost! Though it's hard to believe,<BR>
They're making the payments; there'll be no reprieve.<BR>
The judge gave his verdict, to anonymous cheers.<BR>
A million a month for almost four years.<BR>
And Stac Electronics has reason to grin:<BR>
They're now growing fat from making files thin.<BR>
But somewhere in Redmond there's code now in test<BR>
For sending out royalty payments compressed.<BR>
