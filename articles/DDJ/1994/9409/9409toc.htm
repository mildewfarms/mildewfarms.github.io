<h2>FEATURES  </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9409a/9409a.htm">THE BMP FILE FORMAT </A></h3><P>
<i>by Marv Luse </i><P>
When is a standard file format not a standard file format? When it is the well-known BMP image format. As Marv points out, the BMP format is actually a sheaf of formats bundled under the same name. In this article, he examines BMP's image format incarnations and presents techniques for encapsulating them, using C++.  <P>
<h3><a href="9409b/9409b.htm">K-TREE CONTAINER DATA STRUCTURES </A></h3><P>
<i>by Rodney Bates </i><P>
K-trees are container data structures that represent linear sequences of integers, pointers, and the like. Although Rodney initially developed K-trees to deal with the problem of browsing and debugging incomplete programs, they also have a more general applicability.  <P>
<h3><a href="9409c/9409c.htm">EXTENDING REXX WITH C++ </A></h3><P>
<i>by Art Sulger </i><P>
After writing his OS/2 database routines in C++, Art wanted to use visual development tools to build the UI. Consequently, he extended his C++ classes into REXX-callable external functions.  <P>
<h3><a href="9409d/9409d.htm">INSIDE THE RIFF SPECIFICATION </A></h3><P>
<i>by Hamish Hubbard </i><P>
The Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) specification is a tagged-file specification designed for the storage of various types of multimedia data. Wave Viewer, the program Hamish presents here, reads and writes RIFF files which contain waveform data. <P>
<h3><a href="9409e/9409e.htm">MEDIAN-CUT COLOR QUANTIZATION </A></h3><P>
<i>by Anton Kruger </i><P>
Mapping a continuous variable to a discrete set of values is called quantization, a concept Anton applies to the problem of how you go about mapping a true-color image to 256 colors. <P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS  </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9409f/9409f.htm">EPROM EMULATION </A></h3><P>
<i>by David Mockridge </i><P>
David discusses the software and hardware that make up an EPROM emulator, then presents a program for downloading code to an EPROM via a PC's parallel port. <P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9409g/9409g.htm">A PRINT FILTER FOR UNIX </A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael A. Covington and Mark Juric </i><P>
In this article, our authors present lj4m, a UNIX print filter that enhances the power of the versatile Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4M printer. <P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9409h/9409h.htm">EXAMINING OS/2 2.1 EXECUTABLE FILE FORMATS </A></h3><P>

The updated version of SHOWEXE.C that John presents here makes it possible for you to analyze 32-bit, flat-memory-model, LX-style executables.  <P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH  </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9409i/9409i.htm">IMAGE ACQUISITION USING TWAIN </A></h3><P>
<i>by Craig A. Lindley </i><P>
The TWAIN software specification provides a uniform interface between graphics-supporting software and image-capturing hardware. Craig presents a C++ class, implemented as a Windows DLL, which can be used to add image acquisition to any Windows application.  <P>
<h2>COLUMNS  </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9409j/9409j.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS </A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Swaine </i><P>

<h3><a href="9409k/9409k.htm">C PROGRAMMING </A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens </i><P>
The ANSI/ISO X3J16 committee's standard definition for C++ includes extensions to the language. Al discusses exception handling, one of the main new features. <P>
<h3><a href="9409l/9409l.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY </A></h3><P>
<i>by Bruce Schneier </i><P>
Complexity theory provides a methodology for analyzing the computational complexity of different programming algorithms. Using complexity theory, you can compare the efficiency of different algorithms, and determine which is faster.  <P>
