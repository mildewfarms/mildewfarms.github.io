<h3><a href="9404a/9404a.htm">THE CAMBRIDGE ALGORITHMS WORKSHOP</A></h3><P>
<i>by Bruce Schneier</i><P>
Some of the best and the brightest in the world of cryptography gathered at Cambridge University to challenge each other with new algorithms designed to run quickly in software. Bruce, who presented a paper at the workshop, reports on the conference, as well as on the current state of encryption technology in general.<P>
<h3><a href="9404b/9404b.htm">CRYPTOGRAPHY WITHOUT EXPONENTIATION</A></h3><P>
<i>by Peter Smith</i><P>
Peter, who presented LUC public-key encryption in <I>DDJ </I>over a year ago, extends the algorithm by adding three new cryptosystems: a Lucas-function El Gamal public-key encryption, a Lucas-function El Gamal digital signature, and a Lucas-function-based  key-negotiation method called LUCDIF.<P>
<h3><a href="9404c/9404c.htm">SHA: THE SECURE HASH ALGORITHM</A></h3><P>
<i>by William Stallings</i><P>
The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), based on Ron Rivest's MD4 algorithm and developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, can be used in any security application that requires a hash code.<P>
<h3><a href="9404d/9404d.htm">THE BLOWFISH ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM</A></h3><P>
<i>by Bruce Schneier</i><P>
Blowfish, a new block-encryption algorithm for 32-bit microprocessors, is designed to be fast, compact, simple, secure, and robust. Break it, and you can be the winner of our cryptography contest!<P>
<h3><a href="9404e/9404e.htm">THE WAVELET PACKET TRANSFORM </A></h3><P>
<i>by Mac A. Cody</i><P>
The discrete wavelet transform is a subset of the far more versatile wavelet packet transform, which generalizes the time-frequency analysis of the wavelet transform. Mac presents a C implementation of the discrete wavelet transform algorithm.<P>
<h3><a href="9404f/9404f.htm">FUZZY LOGIC IN C: AN UPDATE</A></h3><P>
<i>by John A.R. Tucker, Phillip E. Fraley, Lawrence P. Swanson</i><P>
In this article, our authors build upon Greg Viot's &quot;Fuzzy Logic in C&quot; by adding initialization, parsing, and output functions to provide a complete C implementation of fuzzy logic.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9404g/9404g.htm">DIGITAL I/O WITH THE PC</A></h3><P>
<i>by Brian Hook and Dennis Shuman</i><P>
You don't always have to resort to dedicated or expensive instruments for digital data acquisition. Brian and Dennis describe an integrated hardware/software system that enables digital I/O using a PC's parallel port.<P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9404h/9404h.htm">ECHONETS, E-MEMES, AND EXTENDED REALITIES</A></h3><P>
<i>by Scott B. Guthery</i><P>
Mobile computing requires a new way of thinking about networks. Scott discusses the concept of switchless networks, called &quot;echonets,&quot; and presents algorithms that make them possible.<P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9404i/9404i.htm">HELP FOR WINDOWS HELP AUTHORS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens</i><P>
Eventually, every Windows developer has to build a help database. Al discusses what makes a good Windows help system and examines approaches and tools for creating them.<P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9404j/9404j.htm">ALGORITHMS FOR DIRECTED GRAPHS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Salvatore R. Mangano</i><P>
Directed graphs underlie any tool that displays tree, class-relationship, or entity-relationship diagrams. Sal uses EOS, his C++ genetic-algorithm toolkit, and Visual C++ to create a Windows-hosted system for laying out directed graphs.<P>
<h2>COLUMNS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9404k/9404k.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS </A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Swaine</i><P>
Michael examines how the British microcomputer revolution in the early 1980s led to the object-oriented model Apple's Newton uses today.<P>
<h3><a href="9404l/9404l.htm">C PROGRAMMING</A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens</i><P>
Borland's recent attempt to rewrite its software-license agreements didn't make anyone happy, especially programmers who use Borland tools.<P>
<h3><a href="9404m/9404m.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY </A></h3><P>
<i>by Tom Swan</i><P>
Tom presents an information-retrieval system based on the trie-search algorithm.<P>
<h3><a href="9404n/9404n.htm">UNDOCUMENTED CORNER </A></h3><P>
<i>edited by Andrew Schulman</i><P>
In this month's &quot;Undocumented Corner,&quot; Klaus M&uuml;ller shows how to access the Windows internal instance-data structures, using a virtual device driver (VxD) loaded early in the Windows boot process, right after VMM.<P>
<h3><a href="9404o/9404o.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF </A></h3><P>
<i>by Tom Ochs</i><P>
Tom looks at two books on algorithm design and implementation--<I>Programming Classics: Implementing the World's Best Algorithms</I> and <I>Algorithms from P to NP</I>.<P>
