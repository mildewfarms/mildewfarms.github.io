<h3>Michael Swaine editor-at-large</h3><P>
It's Pentium vs. PowerPC. That's the simplistic view of what's going on in the area of personal-computer CPUs. DEC and MIPS Technology may see things differently, and this magazine is rarely simplistic about such matters, but this page is where we dumb down to the level of the rest of the computer press. Or even lower. And what's lower than a Lettermanesque Top Ten List? Generous to a fault, we give you two.<P>

<UL>
<LI>10.      Anybody out there using the Dvorak keyboard? You do know that it's been shown to be superior in every way to the ubiquitous Qwerty keyboard, don't you?</LI>
<LI> 9.     On the PowerPC you'll have to run Windows and DOS apps under emulation. On Apple's own PowerPC machines, which it is calling Macintoshes, you'll have to run Macintosh apps under emulation. Emulation is slow. Emulation is an unnecessary layer of complexity. Emulation is evil.</LI>
<LI> 8.     The subliminal message. It probably wasn't a good marketing decision to call the technology behind the PowerPC &quot;RISC.&quot;</LI>
<LI> 7.     Intel stock keeps going up.</LI>
<LI> 6.     In the short run, the ability to run DOS and Windows apps faster than a 486 machine is what will justify buying a new machine. In the short run, Intel wins.</LI>
<LI> 5.     In the long run, bet on the company with the deepest pockets. In the long run, Intel wins.</LI>
<LI> 4.     Everybody roots for the underdog. And puts their money on the favorite.</LI>
<LI> 3.     Compatibility. Compatibility. Compatibility.</LI>
<LI> 2.     Did I mention? Computer buyers value compatibility.</LI>
<LI> 1.     The Austin factor. Can we be absolutely sure that those Motorola guys won't withdraw the PowerPC from the market the first time <I>New York Times</I> columnist William Safire criticizes it? There's something in the water down there.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>10.      It's got significantly faster floating-point performance than Pentium.</LI>
<LI> 9.     It's cheaper. By half.</LI>
<LI> 8.     Apple and IBM are solidly behind it.</LI>
<LI> 7.     Apple and IBM stocks are recovering.</LI>
<LI> 6.     If anyone is looking for a bridge from Intel to RISC, and a lot of people are, it's here. The first generation of PowerPC machines will run existing apps <I>under emulation</I> at speeds comparable to existing mid-range to high-end PCs. Native apps will be considerably faster. Early indications are that the emulations will be very solid.</LI>
<LI> 5.     Precedent. IBM's RS/6000 workstations haven't done too badly, and PowerPC is the migration of the RS/6000 processor technology to the personal-computer market.</LI>
<LI> 4.     The portable edge. The portables market is critical, and by releasing a Pentium chip that won't work in portables, Intel has given PowerPC a huge head start in portables.</LI>
<LI> 3.     Price. Price. Price.</LI>
<LI> 2.     Well, <I>do</I> computer buyers value compatibility? I mean, even if it costs them something? When have they ever had to pay for it? How much are they willing to pay for it?</LI>
<LI> 1.     The Clinton clincher. The future belongs to those willing to embrace change.</LI>
</UL>
One reason that did not make the second list: It's Intel's turn to be the Evil Empire. No, IBM had the '80s and Microsoft gets the entire decade of the '90s. No honeymoon for Bill.<P>
