PC Media, a DSP-based approach to incorporating sound, speech, video, and other multimedia capabilities into one system (thereby eliminating the need for multiple add-in cards), has been announced by Motorola. The system is based on a speech-compression technology called &quot;Truespeech,&quot; that was developed by the DSP Group and licensed to Motorola for PC Media. System designers can get Truespeech driver software from either Motorola or the DSP Group.<P>


Truespeech compresses a 1-minute  voice file down to 60 Kbytes without noticeable degradation. This compression is suitable for voice mail, voice annotation, dictation, and the like. The compression scheme is based on algorithms derived from the way airflow from our lungs is shaped by the throat, mouth, and tongue when we speak. The DSP Group claims that its approach is 5 to 15 times more efficient than other methods of digital voice storage. Reader service no. 34.<P>
