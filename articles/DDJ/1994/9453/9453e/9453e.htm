<I>DDJ</I>'s March 1994 &quot;Programmer's Bookshelf&quot; column examines a couple of new self-help legal guides for software developers.

Appendices include relevant portions of copyright law and regulations, the trade-secret act, international copyright treaty tables, the 1991 European Software Directive, and so on. Sample forms are provided in both hardcopy and electronic versions. The book sells for $185.00; with disk, for $225.00.<P>
