XVT-Architect 1.0, from XVT Software, is a new visual programming tool for cross-platform development. XVT-Architect provides a graphical means of developing C++ programs using point-and-click interaction with the XVT-Power++ application framework. Integrated into XVT-Architect is the Rogue Wave Tools.h++ library, which consists of more than 100 classes for data, string, and character manipulation.<P>
The XVT-Architect package is composed of three modules: Blueprint, which is a hierarchy browser; Drafting Board, which is a graphical layout tool for designing windows, menus, strings, and the like; and Object Strata, which is a tool that lets you view the class inheritance of an object selected from either the Object Strata or Blueprint module.<P>
Once the program design is complete, XVT-Architect generates code separately for both the user-code shells and the GUI. XVT-Architect is included as part of the XVT Development System for C++ 3.0 and is available for Windows, Windows NT, Macintosh, OS/2, OSF/Motif, and Open Look. The development system sells for $1950.00 per developer for PCs, and $6300.00 for workstations. Reader service no. 21.<P>

The CodeSafe Protection Engine from EliaShim Microcomputers is a copy-protection system that prevents &quot;protected&quot; files on diskettes from being copied. However, the protected information is transferable from a CodeSafe diskette to a local hard drive without the need for a key disk. In other words, the unique serial number assigned by the CodeSafe system cannot be duplicated. <P>
One protection is based on an envelope method, which adds a protection shell and encrypts existing EXE or COM files. Encryption algorithms are included to prevent debugging. Another method uses calls embedded in the source code to a function contained in object files that are supplied for most programming languages. The engine, which supports DOS 3 through 6.x and Windows 3.x, is priced on a per-unit-of-protection basis starting at $1.00 per copy. Reader service no. 25.<P>
