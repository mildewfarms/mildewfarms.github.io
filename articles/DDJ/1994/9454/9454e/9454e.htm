Smalltalk programmers working in Windows will be interested in Digitalk's PARTS Workbench for Win32. PARTS, short for &quot;Parts Assembly and Reuse Tool Set,&quot; consists of a visual application workbench and collection of over 60 software components. These components include user-interface elements such as push buttons, drop-down lists, menus, text panes, scroll bars, check boxes, and the like, as well as nonvisual components to provide data access and computation. The data-access components support Btrieve, as well as DDE. The components also provide the ability to access .DLL functions and data structures, as well as the printer, file system, and program launcher. The announcement comes on the heels of Digitalk's release of Smalltalk/V for Win32.<P>

Software components (or parts) are constructed in object-oriented fashion allowing you to create base components from which child objects can be derived. In turn, these objects gain the usual object-oriented benefits of reuse and extensibility. Components can also be combined, or nested, to create specialized parts. The Parts Workbench can be used as a stand-alone development environment, or in conjunction with Smalltalk/V's environment. Parts Workbench for Win32 retails for $1995.00.<P>
