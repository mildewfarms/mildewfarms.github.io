<H3>Encore for Actor</H3><P>

<H3>Free Security</H3><P>

In the wake of reports of widespread Internet break-ins, Cygnus Support (Mountain View, CA) is making its Cygnus Network Security (CNS) package publicly available. CNS is Cygnus' version of the freely redistributable Kerberos network-security package developed at MIT. CNS uses DES encryption to validate users' passwords locally rather than sending clear text across the net. Technical support is available on a commercial basis from Cygnus. Contact Cygnus at 415-903-1414.<P>
