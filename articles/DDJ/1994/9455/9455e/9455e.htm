InfoModeler, a Windows-based database-design tool from Asymetrix, is based on the data-modeling methodology known as &quot;Object Role Modeling&quot; (ORM). This approach lets database designers create systems by conceptual modeling using English-language facts and examples. InfoModeler provides a suite of visual-modeling tools including: a fact compiler, which lets you enter statements about the information system; a fact diagrammer, which lets you enhance the model using graphical tools; a table browser, which lets you view information about the logical data model; the database generator, which generates an optimized database definition; and a report generator, which creates reports in graphical and tabular formats. With FORML (&quot;Formal Object Role Modeling Language&quot;), you enter a conceptual view of the information system that reflects the data requirements, along with data samples. Once the model is complete, the software validates that the facts and examples are correctly specified, then automatically generates the logical view of the information by mapping facts into relational databases. When the design is complete, InfoModeler generates the actual database--Access, FoxPro, Paradox, Oracle7, Sybase SQL Server, or Microsoft SQL Server--from the logical model. InfoModeler for Access, FoxPro, and Paradox sells for $795.00; for Oracle7 and Microsoft/Sybase SQL Servers, $1495.00.<P>

Sigma Designs has announced a real-time MPEG video-compression system for the ReelMagic platform. The ready-to-run system is built around a Sigma-designed real-time encoding compression board, and consists of a Compaq ProSignia 486/66 PC, a 2-gigabyte SCSI hard drive, Betacam VCR controller, double-speed CD-ROM drive, and the ReelMagic MPEG playback card. The MPEG compression board at the heart of the system accepts Y/C component video and stereo-audio inputs and produces MPEG output in real time. Additionally, the board supports full SIF resolution video (352h240v30fps), 16-bit audio compression and real-time MPEG system-layer multiplexing. Sigma Designs' ReelMagic plays back full-screen, full-motion, full-color video, and CD-quality stereo sound from a single-speed CD-ROM drive at 30 frames per second. The ReelMagic system sells for $30,000.<P>
