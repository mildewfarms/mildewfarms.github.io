<H1>The Next Generation of IP: Small Step or Giant Leap?</H1>

<P>

AMD has announced plans to build a CPU code-named K5 that will outperform the Pentium by at least 30 percent. Although not a Pentium clone, the K5 will execute the 80x86 instruction set by translating x86 instructions into RISC operations at fetch time. The instructions will then execute on a superscalar RISC core processor. Yes, it will run Windows.<P>
