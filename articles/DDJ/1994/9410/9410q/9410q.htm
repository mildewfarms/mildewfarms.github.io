<a name="0194_007c"><a name="0194_0000">PKWARE recently began shipping a Windows version of its Data Compression Library, which provides a small set of compression functions allowing developers to add data compression to their applications. The library provides an <I>implode()</I> function which encapsulates the data compression engine and an <I>explode() </I>function to handle decompression. These functions allow for compression and decompression of either ASCII or binary data from virtually any data source. The library also includes a 32-bit CRC function, provides support for error handling, and supplies a mechanism for handling user-defined callback functions. Two additional functions are provided explicitly for Visual Basic support. Other languages supported by the library include Microsoft C, Visual C++, and Turbo Pascal for Windows 1.5. Although the <I>implode()</I> compression format is not compatible with the company's PKZip format, it is compatible with the DOS and upcoming OS/2 versions of the compression library. The library is provided both as a DLL and as a static .LIB file. PKWARE claims that the DLL version requires only 36 Kbytes of memory for compression and 12.5 Kbytes for decompression. There are no royalties for DLL distribution. Both the Windows and upcoming OS/2 versions are priced at $350.00. Reader service no. 20.<P>

ILOG has announced two new tools. The first, ILOG Broker, is a tool that lets you turn any existing C++ application into a distributed app by changing header files. The second, the ILOG Server, is a tool for building dynamic servers of C++ objects so that programmers designing complex C++ applications can simultaneously access objects and the ILOG Broker. <P>
ILOG Server is based on the concept of view coherence and is an extension of the Smalltalk Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. ILOG Server provides a C++ preprocessor and a set of libraries with two types of services: Object Model classes and Object Server classes. <P>
ILOG Broker is designed for C++ programmers who need to develop distributed, object-oriented applications without leaving C++ or learning a new programming language. It is a light, distributed programming tool that can be used at several levels in cooperative processing environments. Its core technology utilizes the RPC protocol and can be used, for example, to effectively implement both C++-based Object Request Brokers and transparent C++ support for CORBA/IDL applications. Since ILOG Broker is an extension of the C++ language, you can revamp any existing C++ application. Both tools are currently available for UNIX-based systems and sell for $5000.00 each.

CommTouch has announced Pronto/IP, a PC-based e-mail client to TCP/IP hosts, which enables Windows users to directly (that is, without a gateway) exchange e-mail with UNIX-based TCP/IP hosts. The tool also makes it possible for text and binary attachments to be sent internally, as well as through the Internet, using UNIX or other TCP/IP-based hosts as mail servers.<P>
Pronto/IP uses the Windows Sockets (Winsock) API to interface with TCP/IP stacks such as those built into Windows for Workgroups or other commercial offerings. Pronto/IP uses the standard POP and SMTP protocols for exchanging incoming and outgoing mail with the host mail server. Pronto/IP sells for $69.00 in single quantities. Reader service no. 25.<P>

A consortium of computer companies have teamed up to define a common speech- recognition API for Windows. The Speech Recognition API Committee, which includes WordPerfect, Dragon Systems, IBM, Kolvox, Kurzweil, Lernout &amp; Hauspie, Philips, and Novell, is developing an open standard to enable the integration of speech-recognition technology into their Windows applications. The Speech Recognition API is promoting a consistent user interface, along with features and interactions that can be done more easily and efficiently by voice rather than by keyboard or by mouse. <P>
The Speech Recognition API will support continuous and discrete command and control speech capabilities (that is, individual voice commands such as &quot;File Print&quot;) as well as continuous and discrete dictation capabilities for inputting of text and data (natural-language input such as &quot;Print five copies of this document&quot;).

CardTrick FFS, a flash file system that's compatible with Microsoft's FFS2 linked- list, installable file system, has been released by Datalight. Flash memory is read/write, nonvolatile memory that can retain information without power. <P>
In addition to being compatible with FFS2, Datalight says that CardTrick FFS is about 10 percent smaller and less expensive when it comes to license fees. The company also claims that CardTrick FFS does not accumulate speed degradations (leading to increasingly slower access times) when files are changed, as does FFS2. Reader service no. 27.<P>

In a related announcement, Taligent has licensed the SNiFF+ development environment from TakeFive Software. SNiFF+ is a C++ portable programming environment that runs on UNIX workstations, including Sun SPARC, IBM RS/6000, HP 9000/7xx, DEC RISC, DEC Alpha, and SCO ODT. SNiFF+ provides browsing and design visualization, cross referencing, editing, and documentation support for any C++ compiler. For portability reasons, debugging support is delegated to the C++ compiler. The product features an extractor which retrieves information from the source code, making use of a fast fuzzy C++ parser to parse source files and send a tokenized stream of extracted information to client applications. An execution component either compiles and executes or interprets the source and provides debug information. The product also features an information repository based on a symbol table kept in main memory and provides tools to browse and manipulate information in the data repository. SNiFF+ is priced at $2990.00. Reader service no. 32.<P>

Versions 1.1, a version-control system for Windows and Windows NT, is now available from StarBase. The versioning software, which is based on a project-library concept, allows for any number of files to be checked in or out of the project library and provides access to both current and previous versions of a given file. The product supports all file types, including binary files, allowing users to collaborate on anything from source code and resource files to word processing, graphics, or spreadsheet files. Versions 1.1 includes a feature called &quot;delta versioning&quot; that allows side-by-side comparisons of ASCII files. Other features include a DOS command-line interface for batch operations, automatic schedule check-in, a Project Wizard for project setup, user-definable build and test commands, drag-and-drop support, and more. Versions 1.1 retails for $279.00. Reader service no. 34.<P>
