<h2>FEATURES  </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9415a/9415a.htm">The Parasol Programming Language </A></h3><P>
<i>by Robert Jervis </i><P>
Parasol, short for &quot;Parallel Systems Object Language,&quot; is a development environment influenced by C and Smalltalk, although its design also reflects C++, CLU, Algol, and Turbo Pascal. <P>
<h3><a href="9415b/9415b.htm">The Perl Programming Language </A></h3><P>
<i>by Oliver Sharp </i><P>
Perl, a language designed to handle a variety of network system-administration tasks, makes manipulating the socket protocol easier still. Oliver shows how to write Perl scripts that communicate across networks of UNIX machines. <P>
<h3><a href="9415c/9415c.htm">The Sather Programming Language </A></h3><P>
<i>by Stephen M. Omohundro </i><P>
Sather is a language that's simple, interactive, and nonproprietary. It sports parameterized classes, object-oriented display, statically checked strong typing, multiple inheritance, garbage collection, and more. <P>
<h3><a href="9415d/9415d.htm">The Modula-3 Programming  Language </A></h3><P>
<i>by Sam Harbison </i><P>
Feature-for-feature, Modula-3 is on a par with Ada and C++, but avoids complexity by simplifying individual features like inheritance and generics. Furthermore, Modula-3 is less of a moving target because it already has features only now being added to those other languages.  <P>
<h3><a href="9415e/9415e.htm">Bob: A Tiny Object-Oriented Language </A></h3><P>
<i>by David Betz </i><P>
This tiny C-like object-oriented language, developed by the creator of XLisp, XScheme, and other well-known public-domain languages, is a powerful extension language. <P>
<h3><a href="9415f/9415f.htm">The Tcl Programming Language </A></h3><P>
<i>by John K. Ousterhout </i><P>
Tcl (pronounced &quot;tickle&quot;) is a command language John designed to be a powerful and flexible &quot;glue&quot; language for assembling software components.  <P>
<h3><a href="9415g/9415g.htm">Quincy: The Architecture of a C Interpreter </A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens </i><P>
Quincy, a C interpreter with a front end based on Al's D-Flat windowing system, is fast, small, and efficient. <P>
<h3><a href="9415h/9415h.htm">The Dylan Programming Language </A></h3><P>
<i>by Tamme D. Bowen and Kelly M. Hall </i><P>
Originally based on Scheme, Dylan is an object-oriented, dynamic language designed to replace existing static languages for the development of large software systems.  <P>
<h3><a href="9415i/9415i.htm">The Oberon Programming Language </A></h3><P>
<i>by Josef Templ </i><P>
Oberon, a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that evolved from Pascal and Modula-2, has been implemented for DOS, Windows, Amiga, Mac, and UNIX. <P>
