<H3>Fiber Optic Now?</H3>

<P>In a surprise move, the nation's private and public electric
utilities are making a pitch to move data across the information
highway via their existing fiber-optic networks. These networks, which
are for the most part in place today, link energy management programs
and power grids. The Atlanta-based Southern Company (parent company of
Mississippi Power) alone currently has 2000 miles of fiber-optic lines
in place. Also pushing into telecommunications is Western Resources,
parent to three electric utilities in Kansas and Oklahoma, whose
chairman John Hayes, Jr., is the former chairman of Southwestern
Bell. The Electric Power Research Institute, wrapping up a five-month
study on the economic and technical feasibility of integrating utility
and data networks, reports that fiber-optic utility networks will go
95 percent unused, thereby opening the door to other uses. But
standing in the way are both federal laws and consumer group
protests. However, Congress is considering legislation that would
allow electric, gas, and water utilities to enter the
telecommunications business.</P>
