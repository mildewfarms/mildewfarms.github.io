<h1>The Multimedia Gold Rush of '94</h1>
<h3><i>by Ray Valdes</i></h3>

<p>

Not long ago, multimedia was being described as a
&quot;zero-billion-dollar industry.&quot; But then the gold rush
arrived in full force over last year's holiday season and has now
kicked into overdrive. This is true across the nation, but the
stampede seems particularly evident in California, especially in San
Francisco, where you'll run into store clerks and auto
mechanics--including grayhairs with WWII-vintage tattoos, not just
the twentysomethings with nose rings who live and work in
&quot;Multimedia Gulch&quot;--busily authoring a multimedia title or
two. In Hollywood, the computer industry is doing lunch en masse with
the entertainment industry: You may be a successful film star or
filmmaker, but you're nobody unless you've signed a contract to
produce a multimedia title with a computer-game publisher. It's a
sign of the times when the likes of ex-CIA director William Colby are
designing an interactive spy experience. Moving from the devil to the
deep blue sky, IBM has announced an exclusive licensing agreement
with the Vatican to digitize the vast library of illuminated
manuscripts and works of art spanning centuries.<P>

Like those who sold eggs to goldminers, suppliers abound to feed
those who want information and know-how via tradeshows, conferences,
and magazines. InterMedia kicked things off in March, followed by the
QuickTime Multimedia Conference in early April. Then it was the
NewMedia show in mid-April, Silicon Interactive in early May, and
finally VisiComm NewMedia in early June. Dave Bunnell's <I>New
Media</I> was one of the early entrants into the field of
developer-oriented magazines and is now almost venerable, while Doug
Millison's <I>Morph's Outpost On the Digital Frontier</I> (which
sometimes calls itself &quot;the <I>Dr. Dobb's</I> of
multimedia&quot;) is considered the young turk. In consumer-oriented
magazines, IDG has three overlapping titles: <I>MultiMedia World</I>,
<I>Electronic Entertainment</I>, and <I>Desktop Video World</I>
(recently renamed <I>Digital Video</I>). Ziff-Davis is establishing a
new division that will produce magazines, multimedia titles, and
online publications. And for the financiers, there is <I>The Red
Herring</I>, a pricey magazine ($15 per issue) that advertises:
&quot;Before you invest in multimedia, invest in the <I>Red
Herring</I>, the only magazine that covers the convergence of
entertainment, computers, and communications from a strategic
business perspective.&quot; While selling eggs to goldminers may be
lucrative, it seems you can charge even more by selling chickens to
those who sell the eggs.<P>

In this article, we'll look at the technology aspects of multimedia
and consider the implications for in-the-trenches programmers. But
first, some rough measure of the scale of this gold rush. In 1993,
Apple sold one million CD-ROM drives, a twenty-fold increase over the
previous year. Dataquest expects the installed base of CD-ROM drives
to grow from four million in 1993 to six million by the end of this
year. According to the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, 80 percent of
these are used for multimedia applications, rather than retrieval of
textual data. Apple says that 80 percent of its new PowerPC Macs ship
with CD-ROM drives installed. The numbers from Microsoft tell a
similar, albeit slightly inconsistent, story. According to
Microsoft's Paul Osborne, product manager of Video for Windows, 12
million Windows-capable PCs will be shipped this year, of which
&quot;40% are multimedia machines,&quot; resulting in &quot;400,000
new customers per month&quot; for multimedia titles. (What's not
clear is whether the definition of &quot;multimedia machine&quot;
includes a CD-ROM drive; if so, this number appears inconsistent with
the numbers from Apple and Dataquest.) The majority (60 percent, says
Microsoft) of these multimedia machines are ending up in the home,
rather than in the corporate office, and this lends emphasis to the
entertainment portion of the market. So for now, the equation is
simple: CD-ROM means multimedia, which means interactive
entertainment.<P>

In theory, you don't have to be a programmer to author a multimedia
title, because high-level tools such as MacroMind Director and Adobe
Premiere are supposed to enable anyone to create an interactive
work--in the same way that tools like Adobe Illustrator allow any
visual artist to create desktop-published graphics. But, in practice,
most successful teams have a programmer on board, if not driving the
project.<P>

One who has achieved some success is Farshid Almassizadeh. At 24,
Farshid is still officially a student at UCSD, not quite dropped out,
a double major in computer science and &quot;lighting and
design.&quot; But he and his cofounders at Presto Studios released
the highly regarded CD-ROM-based game, &quot;The JourneyMan
Project,&quot; in January 1992, now within striking distance of
selling 100,000 units. The founders of Presto Studios bootstrapped
their first title by working other jobs, but now have the resources
to devote 11 more-than-full-time staff members to producing the
sequel, which is estimated to require about 30,000 work-hours of
development. A significant portion of this effort, about 10,000
hours, is programmer time. Farshid is jazzed about the upcoming
release of MacroMind Director 4.0, because it now includes a compiler
for the Lingo language (not just an interpreter) as well as powerful
new constructs like heterogeneous lists. Along with increased control
over memory management, these improvements will result in better
performance and greater flexibility compared to previous versions of
Director.<P>

You can see parallels to the &quot;Fire in the Valley&quot; era of
Silicon Valley, those golden days when it seemed that any dropout
could start a successful company in a garage. The only difference is
now you must do it in a loft. These opportunities are refreshing
during a time in which the major software firms are following the
path of consolidation and merger blazed by the auto companies early
in this decade--moving from a field of many small firms, to the set
of the Big Three. Nowadays, it seems that launching a new spreadsheet
or word-processor requires more resources than GM or Ford would need
to launch a new minivan. Producing a multimedia title, by comparison,
is a shoestring operation.<P>

But unlike 1900, when you had a good 30 years to bootstrap an auto
company, or 1980, when you could dawdle for several years in a
PC-software startup, in the '90s, the window of opportunity shuts at
a much higher velocity. The thundering herd of financiers, Hollywood
types, and giant-media conglomerates is pouring in capital to raise
the barrier to entry. There are several ways they are seeking to gain
a competitive edge. One is to follow &quot;high production
values&quot; (slick film-industry standards for special effects,
video, lighting, acting, and screenplay) and make the competition
look amateurish by comparison. Professional screenwriters and actors
are increasingly part of the development team. Another way to gain an
edge is using the name recognition from a bankable star or famous
person, even non-glitterati like William Colby. Finally, there is
always the edge provided by proprietary technology.<P>

The premier example of the venture-funded approach is the startup
called Rocket Science, the sardonic, yet aptly named Silicon Valley
company composed of some high-octane talent, including Peter Barrett
(inventor of the industry-standard CinePak video-compression scheme),
Bruce Leak (one of the developers of Apple's QuickTime digital-video
architecture), Michael Backes (graphics supervisor for the movie
<I>Jurassic Park</I>), Ron Cobb (creative director for the movie
<I>Alien</I>) and Rich Cohen (creator of visual effects for the movie
<I>Terminator 2</I>). Venture-capital funded at a $7 million
valuation, Rocket Science plans to debut its new generation of gaming
technology for the coming holiday season. According to the newsletter
<I>Digital Media</I>, the production budget for the first three
titles averages around $800,000 each. This is about eight times the
starving-student budget used by The Journeyman Project.<P>

Less visible is a small startup called Open Mind, cofounded by Mitsu
Hadeishi, a Harvard physics graduate who did a stint as a game
programmer at Electronic Arts. Originally based in LA but now in
southern Oregon, Open Mind is working on a development project for
well-known game company Trilobyte, publisher of the top-selling
interactive multimedia title, The 7th Guest (which comes on
<I>two</I> CD-ROM discs). Mitsu and his partner Doug Cutrell (a
mathematics Caltech graduate) have been working for four years on an
object-oriented, knowledge-based environment for designing more
human-like interactions within the multimedia experience. Mitsu is
tight-lipped about the project, but acknowledges that he is an expert
in neural-net algorithms and that development is hosted on Windows
NT.<P>

As with the original California 49ers, participants in the new gold
rush are finding that things don't always pan out. Many multimedia
titles cannot stand on their own; instead, up to 80 percent of titles
are sold bundled with hardware (CD-ROM drives or upgrade kits),
resulting in revenues far below the standard list price. This is
partly due to the phenomenon of &quot;shovelware,&quot; in which
seemingly random piles of existing content are shoveled onto a
CD-ROM, without regard to consumer benefit. Some hapless consumers
are getting hit on the hardware front as well. Walter Mossberg of the
<I>Wall Street Journal</I> reports that anywhere from 25 to 40
percent of PC multimedia upgrade kits are returned to the store by
frustrated consumers unable to get the IRQs and INTs straight. And
those developers seduced by Microsoft's impressively large numbers
for the Windows platform are finding that the cost of supporting
Windows titles compared to the Mac ranges from 10:1 to 300:1. For
some developers as many as one-third of PC support calls fall into
the category called &quot;Packard Bell problems,&quot; due to
glitches encountered on these cut-rate but apparently
not-quite-compatible machines. Also, in eyeing the attractively large
installed base of CD-ROM drives, it is unclear how many are of the
older single-speed variety, and therefore less likely to keep up with
the increasingly stringent demands of digitized video and sound.<P>

Lastly, in case you were tempted to stockpile blank CDs for future
manufacturing, the consensus of many observers is that CD-ROM is a
transitional (and barely adequate) medium for delivering multimedia
content. According to the pundits, the future delivery vehicle is the
Information Superhighway (or InfoBahn, or whatever it's being called
this month). Audrey McLean, founder of KidSoft (distributor of
multimedia titles for children), calls CD-ROM the &quot;SCSI
Highway,&quot; and considers it an interim substitute for the real
thing.<P>

Unlike some multimedia authors who've packed their bags and headed
for California to be closer to the action (as did the author of the
popular &quot;HellCab&quot; title, who moved here from New York
City), you may be tempted to sit this one out. If so, what are the
implications of this gold rush for those on the sidelines?<P>

One implication is the influence on PC-system architectures. There is
a parallel with the effect of desktop publishing (DTP) applications
on PC-system designs over the last ten years. Although DTP was only
used by a small segment of the overall PC market at that time, the
hardware demands of this application area drove technology
development for almost a decade. Aspects of today's mainstream PCs,
such as VGA and SuperVGA-resolution graphics, square-pixel displays,
outline fonts rendered on the fly, device-independent printing,
virtual-memory operating systems, and so on, are in large measure due
to DTP's stringent demands. Even certain Windows API functions, like
the GDI function <I>ExtTextOut()</I>, were added at the specific
request of DTP implementors (in this case, the authors of Aldus
PageMaker). These enhancements were added even though the majority of
PC users at the time were quite content with the more modest
requirements of Lotus 1-2-3 running in character mode.<P>

Likewise, although many users are now quite content with today's
mainstream desktop configuration, you can brace yourself for
technological evolution along lines dictated by multimedia needs. One
basic requirement is incredibly high throughput: Without compression,
a 640x480 24-bit image, displayed at 30 frames per second, means an
uninterrupted data rate of 27 Mbytes per second. Satisfying this
requirement will impact all aspects of PC system design. First, of
course, is hardware support for compression and decompression. It's
possible that MPEG decoders will be added to motherboard designs over
the coming years. Graphics adapters may have hardware support for
RGB-to-CUY conversion (the CUY schema is used by video input devices
and is more amenable to compression algorithms). And, just when
you've made the decision between VESA local bus and PCI, you'll have
to choose between VESA Media Channel (VMC), a 132 Mbytes-per-second
bus architecture that supports digital motion-video processors, and
Intel's competing Shared Frame Buffer Interconnect (SFBI). In the
area of drive interfaces, IDE and SCSI no longer make the grade;
you'll need, at minimum, the 13 Mbytes/sec data rate provided by
SCSI-II with the &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;wide&quot; extensions.
Operating-system file structures and algorithms may be modified to
support uninterrupted large-data streams. The thirst for large
amounts of RAM will make NT's current demands seem paltry. In
networking protocols, neither TCP/IP nor IPX/SPX will hold a candle
to ATM. So a few years from now, when you are trading in your
doddering 90-MHz Pentium/PCI machine for one of these high-bandwidth
multimedia models, you can blame the Gold Rush of '94.<P>
