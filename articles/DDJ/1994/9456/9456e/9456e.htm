<H3>Public Patents?</H3>

<P>The U.S. Patent Office continues to reexamine the patent process in an
effort to avoid patent-inspired chaos in the software
industry. Responding to recent complaints, Commissioner Bruce
Lehman said &quot;I'm not going to let people sneak patents through
this office that shouldn't be issued.&quot; He is considering making
patent applications public so that knowledgeable observers have the
opportunity to come forward with relevant prior art. Examiners are now
tapping into the Software Patent Institute prior-art database.</P>

<H3>USL vs. UC</H3>

<P>The legal battles between UNIX System Labs and the University of
California over who has the right to what with UNIX seems to have been
resolved. UC has agreed not to use or distribute
&quot;restricted&quot; files on the BSD NET/2 release. USL is granting
UC the right to use and distribute &quot;encumbered&quot; files as
long as USL copyright is acknowledged. USL has also certified 4.4 BSD
Lite as being free of USL code. The list of restricted and encumbered
files remains secret.</P>
