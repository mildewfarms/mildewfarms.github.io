The Information Brokerage, an online marketplace for software development and information, has been announced by the Object Management Group (OMG) and Connect Inc. The Information Brokerage is an information service and marketplace for component software that lets vendors list their software, along with descriptive information and specifications. To purchase software, Information Brokerage subscribers install Connect client software, which is available through the Information Brokerage on their desktop, and dial-in to the network. <P>
Initially, the service will provide individual objects which can be &quot;taken for a test drive,&quot; purchased, and downloaded onto the subscriber's system. Later, the Information Brokerage will expand to include class libraries as standards define the architecture of objects and allow true component-level applications to be architected. Subscribers will also be able to participate in forums with other users and/or vendors to discuss current problems or successes in their environments. <P>
The Information Brokerage will go online in January 1995. Developers interested in placing software in the Information Brokerage, and subscribers who want to get connected to the industry's first commercial, online market should contact the OMG directly. Reader service no. 21.<P>

LANOpen is a specification for an open architecture API for Flash PROM firmware and has been released by McAfee. The software is designed to facilitate interoperability between different LAN-management applications. McAfee will publish the LANOpen specification so that any PC LAN Management vendor can support the interface in their applications. LANOpen will allow, for example, one vendor's asset- management application to pass information through a common set of calls to another vendor's help-desk application. Reader service no. 22.<P>

Novell has announced the availability of international-language versions of its LAN WorkPlace 2.4 and LAN WorkGroup 4.2 desktop TCP/IP products. Fully translated French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German language versions are now available. A Japanese version is available through Novell K.K. in Japan. Because TCP/IP allows interoperability among dissimilar systems, it has become the worldwide standard protocol for distributed, cross-platform networks. More than four million nodes of TCP/IP were installed worldwide by the end of 1993, with more than eight million projected by the end of 1994. LAN WorkPlace connects MS Windows and DOS users to UNIX minis and mainframes. LAN WorkGroup provides access for NetWare Networks to UNIX systems from their desktops. Both products are integral to the right-sizing efforts currently underway in corporations as IS managers move mission-critical information from mainframes to distributed computing environments.<P>
LAN WorkPlace has a suggested retail price of $399.00 for a single user, $1995.00 for 10 users, and $12,995.00 for 100 users. LAN WorkGroup is available for 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 250 users. It has a suggested price ranging from $1500.00 for 5 users to $12,495.00 for 250 users. Reader service no. 23.<P>

Hewlett-Packard's HP Object-Oriented DCE/9000 (OODCE/9000) is a recently introduced toolset for distributed-computing (DCE) application development for its HP 9000 family of workstations. Targeted for C++ programmers, HP OODCE/9000 encapsulates DCE API commands into C++ classes with default DCE behavior. HP plans that applications written with HP OODCE/9000 will eventually interoperate with applications based on the OMG's CORBA 2.0. HP OODCE/9000 and HP DCE/9000 are integrated with the HP SoftBench application-development environment. <P>
OODCE/9000 costs $995.00 per developer; there is no additional run-time fee. Documentation costs $2000.00. OODCE/9000 requires an HP DCE/9000 and HP C++ compiler. Reader service no. 24.<P>
