<i>by Mark Betz </i><P>
Before building an SQL server class for Sybase/Microsoft's SQL Server, Mark had to unravel its client/server message-handling mechanism. Here's what he found, along with the C++ class library he eventually developed. <P>
<h3><a href="9411b/9411b.htm">OBJECT DATABASES </A></h3><P>
<i>by Jonathan Wilcox </i><P>
As distributed computing and interoperable objects move into the forefront of computing, the need for object-database standards will become paramount. Jonathan examines the issues surrounding object methods and distributed programming, focusing on how these issues relate to object databases.  <P>
<h3><a href="9411c/9411c.htm">DATABASE MANAGEMENT IN C++ </A></h3><P>
<i>by Art Sulger </i><P>
Art presents a C++ class library which provides a single interface to multiple database file formats, saving you time and trouble during the development process.  <P>
<h3><a href="9411d/9411d.htm">ENDIAN-NEUTRAL SOFTWARE, PART 2 </A></h3><P>
<i>by James R. Gillig </i><P>
In this installment of his two-part article, Jim discusses how you write portable software by applying Endian-neutral design and programming principles. <P>
<h3><a href="9411e/9411e.htm">SHARING PERIPHERALS INTELLIGENTLY  </A></h3><P>
<i>by Ian Hirschsohn </i><P>
The key to coping with mountains of data is to be able to transfer and share it at reasonable transfer rates. Ian describes a system for moving data at high speeds using off-the-shelf hardware. <P>
<h3><a href="9411f/9411f.htm">PARTITIONS </A></h3><P>

Partitions provide a means for dividing data into meaningful groups. Joe examines algorithms and techniques for efficient partitioning.  <P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS  </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9411g/9411g.htm">INTERFACING LABORATORY INSTRUMENTS </A></h3><P>
<i>by Brian R. Anderson </i><P>
Brian presents a simple, instrument-independent system for making individual measurements under user control, or a timed series of measurements under program control--all using the PC's RS-232 port.  <P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9411h/9411h.htm">PACKET FILTERING IN THE SNMP REMOTE MONITOR </A></h3><P>
<i>by William Stallings </i><P>
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) was designed for managing complex, multivendor internetworks. Bill examines its remote-network monitoring facilities, while Steve Witten adds details on the abstract-syntax notation, an OSI language for defining the formats of SNMP packets. <P>
