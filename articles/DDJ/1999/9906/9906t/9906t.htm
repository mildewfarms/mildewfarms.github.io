Dr. Parse deploys DFA through LR(1) language-independent parse generators and can support multiple DFA through LR parse engines in a single application. Dr. Parse converts grammars into a parse data stream, detecting syntactical errors, and generating data into the developer's choice of languages. The Parser Foundation Classes (PFC) assemble parsing components, allowing manipulation of data. Dr. Parse VIP (Visually Interactive Parser) lets you view a variety of parsing modes and detect invalid sentences and incorrect ASTs. Its IDE consists of a syntax highlighter and debugger. The IDE lets you input a grammar and check for errors in syntax. Once the grammar is deemed syntactically correct, the parser's conflict resolutions can be viewed and modified. This static check can then be followed by a series of dynamic test scenarios using the VIP.</p><p>Transitive Dynamics Inc.</p><p>14150 NE 20th Street, Suite 373</p><p>Bellevue, WA 98007</p><p>425-519-3640</p><p>http://www.trandyne.com/</p><p>The 8051 Virtual Workshop from Crossware Products lets 8051 programmers simulate their complete target system.
