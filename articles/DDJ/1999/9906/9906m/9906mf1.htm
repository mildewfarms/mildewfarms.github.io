Each collaborator's independent view is indicated by a uniquely colored and labeled rectangle in the upper-left "Radar View" window, which lets collaborators know each other's locations. In this example, the users named Bo and Cliff are viewing the browser bean in the upper-left part of the workspace, while Isenhour is viewing other beans in the lower-middle area. Properties such as "Document String" may be edited directly on the browser bean or in the lower-left "Properties" window.</h4><a href="9906m.htm#rf1">Back to Article</a><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1999, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
