<!--Copyright &#169; Dr. Dobb's Journal--><h1>Of Interest</h1><hr><p>OneRealm has begun shipping a software suite for internationalizing software. The suite consists of three components: i18n Expeditor, Organizer, and the Global Encapsulation Library (GEL). i18n Expeditor performs static source-code analysis, detecting and correcting a variety of internationalization violations in source code. For errors that cannot be corrected automatically, the tool provides problem-specific advice. Organizer is an information repository that automatically keeps track of project files and the status of internationalization-related decisions and changes made to the source code. GEL provides a collection of ready-to-use, high-level components for functions such as text literals, date, time, and currency, that are fully internationalized and platform-independent. i18n Expeditor costs $1250.00 for a single seat and includes either C/C++ or Java support. Additional language support is available for $650.00. GEL is available for $650.00 a seat.</p><p>OneRealm Inc.<br>4810 Riverbend Road<br>Boulder, CO 80301<br>303-247-1284<br>http://www.onrealm.com/</p><p>FairCom has released c-tree Plus v6.8A, the most recent release of its C ISAM database API.
