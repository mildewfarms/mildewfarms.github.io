Wicker</i></p><p>Simulating severe storms and tornadoes takes lots of computer power. Louis examines severe weather simulation, starting with equations for turbulence and ending with Fortran source code.</p><a href="9903b/9903b.htm"><h3>HIERARCHICAL LOGIC SIMULATION</h3></a><p><i>by Donald C. Craig</i></p><p>Donald presents an approach by which hardware components can be represented and simulated hierarchically using C++. His simulation strategy is completely asynchronous, meaning that the concept of global time has been abandoned in favor of each component maintaining its own concept of local time.</p><a href="9903c/9903c.htm"><h3>THE JAVA PROVIDER ARCHITECTURE</h3></a><p><i>by Paul Tremblett</i></p><p>Paul uses the JDK's Java Cryptography Extension to implement a cipher algorithm that simulates the Enigma machine made famous by Germany in World War II.</p><a href="9903d/9903d.htm"><h3>WOOKIE: A 68HC11 EMULATOR</h3></a><p><i>by Kalle Anderson, Jason Buttron, Paul Clarke, and Matt Enwald</i></p><p>WOOKIE, short for the "Wireless Object-Oriented Kindly Interfaced Emulator," is a Win32 emulator for 68HC11-based software development. Our authors discuss both its development and use. Wilbert Bilderbeek, Harry Broeders, and Alex van Rooijen then introduce the THRSim11 68HC11 simulator which they designed and built.</p><a href="9903e/9903e.htm"><h3>THE WINDOWS CE EMULATOR</h3></a><p><i>by Aspi Havewala</i></p><p>The Windows CE SDK includes a functional emulation shell that mimics a Windows CE Handheld PC (HPC) shell. This emulation environment makes it possible for you to jumpstart development by prototyping applications.</p><h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><a href="9903f/9903f.htm"><h3>LOW-LEVEL APIS FOR EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h3></a><p><i>by Tom Cunningham and Chad Peckham</i></p><p>While desktop APIs address desktop-oriented issues such as window manipulation, process management, and file/database access, APIs for embedded and real-time systems tackle debugger interfacing, task management, low-level device I/O, and the like. Tom and Chad examine a pair of APIs that are typical of low-level programming interfaces in embedded environments.</p><h2>INTERNET PROGRAMMING</h2><a href="9903g/9903g.htm"><h3>UNDERSTANDING LDAP</h3></a><p><i>by Basit Hussain</i></p><p>LDAP, short for "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol," provides a platform-independent mechanism for searching, storing, and replicating information. Basit examines LDAP and presents examples of how you can use it.</p><h2>PROGRAMMER'S TOOLCHEST</h2><a href="9903h/9903h.htm"><h3>COMPILER CONSTRUCTION WITH ANTLR AND JAVA</h3></a><p><i>by Gary L. Schaps</i></p><p>ANTLR, short for "Another Tool for Language Recognition," is a language tool that gives you a framework for constructing recognizers, compilers, and translators for C, C++, and Java.</p><a href="9903i/9903i.htm"><h3>CONTROLLING MOTION-TRACKING DEVICES</h3></a><p><i>by Mike Harrington</i></p><p>Motion-tracking devices, which report on an object's position and/or orientation in real time as it moves, are necessary to navigate 3D simulated worlds.</p><h2>COLUMNS </h2><a href="9903j/9903j.htm"><h3>PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS </h3></a><p><i>by Michael Swaine </i></p><p>Nanotechnology is a big deal in Michael's mind this month.</p><a href="9903k/9903k.htm"><h3>C PROGRAMMING </h3></a><p><i>by Al Stevens </i></p><p>Al puts Quincy 99 and D-Flat 2000 on hold as he continues his discussion of Standard C++.</p><a href="9903l/9903l.htm"><h3>JAVA Q&amp;A</h3></a><p><i>by Andrew Wilson</i></p><p>How do you implement Microsoft's delegate keyword? Andrew presents classes that mimic the delegate keyword, letting you build a complex user interface with simpler event-handling code.</p><a href="9903m/9903m.htm"><h3>ALGORITHM ALLEY </h3></a><p><i>by Tim Kientzle</i></p><p>The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a crucial part of modern image and sound compression. Tim discusses several fast algorithms for computing the 8-point DCT and IDCT.</p><a href="9903n/9903n.htm"><h3>DR. ECCO'S OMNIHEURIST CORNER</h3></a><p><i>by Dennis E. Shasha</i></p><p>Ecco and crew look for the most efficient way to mix trains, stations, and passengers.</p><a href="9903o/9903o.htm"><h3>PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF </h3></a><p><i>by Jonathan Amsterdam </i></p><p>Jonathan catches up on Dennis Shasha and Cathy Lazere's <i>Out of Their Minds</i>, and Peter G.
