Line segments represent single tracks that trains can traverse in either direction, though only one direction at a time. Each line segment takes 15 minutes to traverse. Initially, there is one train in each station, though there is room for two. The time for passengers to get on/off a train is negligible compared to travel time. </H4><p><A HREF="9903n.htm#rf1">Back to Article</A></p><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1999, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
