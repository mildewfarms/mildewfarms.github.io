Called Real-time Asymmetric Multi Processing (RAMP), the new software provides an API and microkernel for distributing programs across multiple CPUs on a single board. RAMP runs out of the box on multiprocessor Pentium systems running VxWorks, but can be adapted to run on other real-time operating systems. RAMP is based on the concept of barely coupled multiprocessing, which is an efficient, inexpensive alternative to symmetric multiprocessing, according to the company. A single master processor coordinates the activities of multiple slave processors, with each processor running tasks independently and operating out of shared memory. The RAMP microkernel supports up to eight tasks and occupies less than 10 KB of memory.</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE>General Micro Systems<br>8358 Maple Place<br>Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730<br>909-980-4863<br>http://www.gms4vme.com/<p>InterNiche has released NicheView, a web browser for embedded devices such as PDAs, set-top boxes, and consumer electronics devices that require web connectivity. The company claims NicheView is less specifically tailored to a particular set of I/O devices such as keyboards, pointing devices, and color and bit-mapped displays. NicheView provides a generic interface for input events and output streams which pass text blocks, images, and other content to device drivers. Some added features are multiple font support, plug-ins, and a subset of the Javascript language. NicheView also includes a development environment for converting PC keystrokes and mouse clicks to browser events.</p>InterNiche Inc.<br>1340 S.
