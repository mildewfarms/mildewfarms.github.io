<!--Copyright &#169; Dr. Dobb's Journal--><h1>Of Interest</h1><hr><p>Metrowerks has announced its CodeWarrior Analysis Tools (CATS) hierarchical profiling and code coverage tools. Based on technology acquired from DEC and TracePoint Technology (which implemented the technology in its high-regarded HiProf and Visual Coverage tools), Metrowerks CATS supports instrumentation of both Microsoft Visual C++ and Metrowerks CodeWarrior Professional binaries for Intel's x86 and Pentium-class processors or AMD's K6 and K6-2 with 3DNow! processors. The CATS tool suite includes a graphical hierarchical profiler that analyzes the time spent in different sections of an executing program. This analysis is performed down to the instruction level. The CATS tool suite also includes a graphical code coverage software tool that, at run time, analyzes which sections of a given binary have actually been executed. </p><p>Metrowerks Inc.<br>9801 Metric Boulevard, Suite 100 <br>Austin, TX 78758 <br>512-873-4700<br>http://www.metrowerks.com/</p><p>Embedded Support Tools has released visionXD, a graphical C/C++ source-level debugger for debugging real-time, embedded PowerPC, ColdFire, and 68300 microprocessors on UNIX hosts. visionXD uses a Register Window to allow engineers to configure internal registers. visionXD costs $2995.00.</p><p>Embedded Support Tools Corp.<br>120 Royall Street<br>Canton, MA 02021<br>781-828-5588<br>http://www.estc.com/</p><p>RSA Data Security has announced BSAFES /MIME-C, a set of security components designed to let you simplify building secure messaging capabilities into e-commerce and communications applications.
