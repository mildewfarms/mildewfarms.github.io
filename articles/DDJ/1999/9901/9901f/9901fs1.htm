<!--Copyright &#169; Dr. Dobb's Journal--><p><i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i> January 1999 </p><h1>User Interface Dos and Don'ts</h1><ul><li>Do consider color choices that are compatible for various screen types.<li>Do restrict your user interface to a few elements.<li>Do provide continuous visual feedback for all user operations where a wait is involved.<li>Do use on-screen guides such as labels and graphics to lead users.<li>Don't use subtle colors, since you risk indistinguishable color blends on certain devices.<li>Don't use drag-and-drop, since it can confuse users, affect performance, and be infeasible for some displays.<li>Don't use overlapping windows - if required, use only one modal error window.<li>Don't use harsh words in error messages. This will make users panic.</ul><p>--J.D. and K.Y.</p><P><A HREF="9901f.htm#rs1">Back to Article</A></P><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1999, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
