<h2>Where Not</h2>
to Consult
<p>Let's say you're at a fairly successful company that depends -- perhaps dangerously so -- on the product you've designed from scratch. Let's also say that your work is greatly admired around the company and your word is highly respected. And that you believe your press so much that you deserve to be making consulting bucks. So where to look? The absolute last place to look is your current company. Even if your leaving meant the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars and the boss taking his own life, they will still walk you out the door. And not because they couldn't afford your new asking price, but because your change of status would destroy the morale of your former coworkers. There would be mutiny and moaning and disaster. </p>
