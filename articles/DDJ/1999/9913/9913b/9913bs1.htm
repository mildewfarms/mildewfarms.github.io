<h2>An IT Professional by any Other Name...</h2>

<p>A "programmer" at one company might be called a "software engineer" at another. Likewise, one organization's "network administrator" can be someone else's "web master." The point is that job seekers looking for a specific job -- a "software developer," for instance -- might miss an advertised opportunity from time to time if they adhere too rigidly to job titles. All in all, there are literally hundreds of job titles and categories in the information technology industry.</p>

<p>Underscoring this fact is <i>Software Industry Job Descriptions</i>, an annual study published by the market-research firm Culpepper and Associates. Although generally produced for management and HR staff members, the study is of interest because it identifies and details hundreds of job titles and descriptions ranging from executives and educators, to developers, sales forces, and system administrators. Job descriptions are presented to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Fair Labor Standards Act formats. As such, it is a valuable tool for HR staffs.</p>

<p>In the "Software Development" category (subtitled "Technology R&amp;D"), for instance, Culpepper identifies and describes more than 40 different job titles. These jobs are subdivided into Research and Architecture, Quality Control/Assurance, Software Development, and Documentation/Packaging. Part of the job of a "Software Developer I," for example, might involve "moderately complex product design, system analysis, and programming activities which may require some research." This might consume about 30 percent of the person's monthly working time. The other 70 percent of the time could include bug verification, release testing, and beta support (20 percent), performing on-site client work (20 percent), serving as product architects (20 percent), and researching and understanding marketing requirements for products (10 percent). A Software Developer I would require, at minimum, a bachelor's degree in business, software engineering, or computer science, and anywhere from six to nine years of experience. </p>

<p>The Software Developer I might report to a Software Development Manager who spends 50 percent of his time organizing, managing, and facilitating development, 30 percent ensuring that projects are completed according to specification and are properly documented, and 20 percent managing personnel. The manager is expected to have seven to nine years of experience, and an advanced degree.</p>

<p>Culpepper has subdivided the "Internal MIS" category into groups such as "DP Operations," "System Analysis and Programming," and "Systems Administration/Support." Job titles range from computer and data entry operators, to web and network/telecommunications specialists.</p>

<p>Salary information is not provided (Culpepper sells another report on this). The report is available both from Culpepper and Associates (http://www .culpepper.com/) and Software Success (http://www.softwaresuccess.com/).</p>
