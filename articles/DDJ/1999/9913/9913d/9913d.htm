<hr>

<p>Microsoft's Windows NT 4.0 comes in two flavors -- Workstation and Server. As Workstation, it is a robust desktop operating system for a stand-alone machine or network client. As NT Server, it becomes the backbone around which sturdy networks with various clients can be built. Consequently, when most network administrators speak of "Windows NT," they are speaking of the Server product.</p>
<p>The premier certification for network administrators and operating-system savvy programmers is that of Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE). The requirement for obtaining this certification is the passing of six multiple-choice exams. A lesser certification, Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP), is granted to people who have passed one exam, and it is generally considered an interim certification for anyone on the path to MCSE.</p>

<p>In this article, I'll look at Windows NT Server from the standpoint of where it fits into the MCSE certification, how it fits into MCP certification, and what skills are required for passing the exams. In the process, I'll focus on one test (the "70-067" exam) to illustrate how you should study and prepare for any of the Microsoft certification exams.</p>



<h3>MCSE Certification</h3>


<p>There are currently two "tracks" you can follow to obtain MCSE certification. Track One is based around Windows NT 3.51, while Track Two is based on NT 4.0. Microsoft has stated that it is only a matter of time (that is, with the release of Windows NT 5.0) before the 3.51 track is discontinued. Thus, the only logical course of seeking certification at this time is with the Windows NT 4.0 track.</p>


<p>To complete the certification requirements, you must pass six computer-    administered, multiple-choice exams in any order:  </p>


<ul>
  <li>Implementing and Supporting Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 (exam 70-067).
  <li>Implementing and Supporting Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 in the Enterprise (exam 70-068).

  <li>Networking Essentials (exam 70-058).

  <li>A client exam. Choices here include Implementing and Supporting Windows 95 (exam 70-064), Implementing and Supporting Windows 98 (exam 70-098), or Implementing and Supporting Windows NT Workstation 4.0 (exam 70-073).

  <li>An elective.

  <li>Another elective.


</ul>

<p>The electives chosen are generally for those categories or products with which you have the most experience. Available choices include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Administering Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 (exam 70-028).
  <li>Designing and Implementing Databases with Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 (exam 70-029).

  <li>Implementing and Supporting Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 (exam 70-081).

  <li>Implementing and Supporting Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 by Using the Internet Explorer Administration Kit (exam 70-079).

  <li>Implementing and Supporting Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 (exam 70-087).

  <li>Implementing and Supporting Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0 (exam 70-088).

  <li>Implementing and Supporting Microsoft SNA Server 4.0 (exam 70-085).

  <li>Implementing and Supporting Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 (exam 70-086).

  <li>Implementing and Supporting Web Sites Using Microsoft Site Server 3.0 (exam 70-056).

  <li>Internetworking with Microsoft TCP/IP on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 (exam 70-059).


</ul>

<p>If you plan your electives right, not only can you obtain MCSE status, but you can also create a specialty in a particular area. Microsoft currently offers specialties in Internet (TCP/IP, IIS, and a few other exams) and Site Builder.</p>

<p>Each exam costs about $100 and generally takes about 90 minutes to complete. In the middle of October, 1998, Microsoft began converting many exams to an adaptive format. While the objectives and subobjectives have not changed, the candidate now must only answer 25-30 questions in 30 minutes. Exams are administered by Sylvan Prometric (http:// www.prometric.com/) and Virtual University Enterprise (http://www. vue.com/). The exams are standard, multiple-choice questions. You can review answers during the exam, time permitting. </p>



<h3>The MCP Certification</h3>


<p>Upon passing the six exams, you are granted the status of MCSE. It used to be that if you had passed two or three of the exams in a specified area, you would become an MCP. Microsoft changed the program last fall, however, and now states that passing "...one certification exam that provides a valid and reliable measure of technical proficiency and expertise..." is all that is required for becoming an MCP.</p>


<p>This means that as an individual completely new to Microsoft certification, you can take and pass the 70-067 exam, and immediately become a Microsoft Certified Professional. You can take five more exams over a period of time and work your way up to an MCSE.</p>



<h3>The 70<b>-</b>067 Exam</h3>


<p>When preparing to study for an exam, the first step is always to visit the Microsoft certification site (http://www.microsoft .com/train_cert/) and get the latest objectives for the exam. The exam is divided into a number of main objectives, each of which is further divided into subobjectives. In short, this is the list of topics the exam will cover. </p>


<p>Look to see when the exam went live as well, as this date will give you a feel for the timeframe you need to use to study. For example, looking at the objectives for the 70-067 exam, there are six main categories, and the exam went live November 1, 1996. That means the objectives and subobjectives (and thus the exam, itself) precedes the Windows NT Service Packs, Option Pack, and the like. The exam will only be on the core product that comes in the box. Quoting from Microsoft's recent advertisements:</p>


<p>On July 29, 1996, we introduced Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0...To keep up with the changing needs of customers, we've added hundreds of enhancements since 1996. In fact, today's Windows NT Server 4.0 is far different from the one we first shipped...</p>

<p>And yet, the exam is centered on the first release of the product. Keep that in mind when studying for and taking the exam. When looking at <A NAME="rt1"><A HREF="9913dt1.htm">Table 1</A>, which lists the objectives for the exam, a few things should jump out. The first is that you must know everything you possibly can about installation. This is a big item on the objective list and on the exam. Compare that to the Monitoring section where you are really only expected to know one utility -- Performance Monitor.</p>

<p>Next, look at the number of times certain topics crop up. If a topic appears in more than one category, then it is a safe bet that you will need to know a great deal about it. In this category on this test are two items: Protocols and Fault-tolerance. </p>

<p>Now that you know what to study, determine a method by which you will study.</p>



<h3>Ways to Study</h3>


<p>There are almost as many ways to study for the exam as there are individuals who take the exam. Ways of learning what you need to know include books, videos, software test engines, online testing and training, computer-based training (CBT), and instructor-led courses.</p>


<p>Microsoft does not care which study method you use as long as you gain the knowledge needed to pass the exam(s). This is a tremendous benefit over some other certifications that require you to first attend an "approved" class before allowing you to sit for the exam. </p>



<h3>Find Out More About the Exam</h3>


<p>After you've picked a study method and brushed up on what you need to know for the exam, find out some of the specifics about it. By calling either Sylvan or VUE (the exam administrators), you can find out the amount of time you have and the number of questions on the exam. On the 70-067 exam, there are 55 questions in 90 minutes. While the time is pretty much universal, the number of questions differs for every exam. Neither vendor can give you any further specifics about the exam.</p>


<p>If you search the Web, however, you will find numerous "brain dumps" posted by others who have taken the exams. Looking at them, you can find additional specifics -- such as the passing score being 764 or 76.4 percent of the 55 questions (this, too, differs for every exam). The brain dumps are also useful because they reveal what others saw on the exam, and point out gaps in your knowledge. For each candidate the questions are pulled from a pool of possible questions, so no two individuals should ever get the same question set. Nevertheless, if you cannot answer questions about the topics covered in the brain dumps, you had better do some more studying.</p>



<h3>Taking the Exam</h3>


<p>When you are absolutely certain you know all you need to pass the exam, register for it with Sylvan or VUE. You will need to schedule a time to take it at a proctored center. At the center, you must leave all of your writing utensils, notes, pagers, and the like outside, and be escorted to a computer.</p>


<p>At the computer you'll find two #2 pencils and two blank pieces of paper that you can use to make notes on. At the conclusion of the exam, the paper and pencils stay behind. In summation -- you can take nothing in, and you can take nothing out. </p>

<p>Questions are primarily multiple choice (choose one correct answer, choose multiple correct answers, or choose all correct answers) with a handful of ranking order and simulation questions. Ranking questions provide you with a scenario, a list of required objectives, a list of optional objectives, a proposed solution, and then ask you to rank how well the solution meets the objectives. Simulation questions, also known as "performance-based questions," ask you to do a task in a simulator as you would if the product was really in front of you.</p>

<p>When you have a large number of questions in a relatively small period of time, it becomes every candidate's wish to have as few ranking questions (which take forever to read and figure out what the real question is) and simulation questions as possible. Luckily, you can mark any question you want to by clicking on the checkbox in the upper-left corner. At the conclusion of the exam, if there is time remaining, you can jump back to a marked (or any other) question and spend time working through it.</p>

<p>All questions count as either being right or wrong. If you are told to choose three items from a list of five and you choose two correct ones and one wrong one, there is no partial credit -- the whole question is counted as wrong.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the exam, a display will appear on the screen and a printout will appear on a sheet of paper. The screen display tells you if you passed or not. The printout will elaborate, showing how well (or not) you did in each of the objective categories.</p>



<h3>If You Fail</h3>


<p>Microsoft used to be very generous, allowing you to take the exam as many times and as often as you wanted until you passed. In the spring of 1998, the company realized that there was a problem with this openness (many software test simulator vendors were sending people to the exam daily, failing each time, until they had all of the test questions memorized and could incorporate them into their product).</p>


<p>To circumvent this sort of problem, Microsoft implemented some new restrictions. The first is that you must agree to a nondisclosure agreement at the start of the exam. If you do not agree, the test will not begin. The second change is that if you fail an exam, you may retake it anytime you want. If you fail it the second time, however, you must wait 14 days before you can take it the third time, and another 14 days for the fourth time, and so on.</p>



<h3>If You Pass</h3>


<p>If you pass, not only do you immediately become an MCP, and well on your way to being a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, but you should also schedule your next exam as soon as possible. When you look at the exam objectives for other Microsoft exams, you will see that there is a great deal of overlap between them. Knowing all you can about protocols is not only useful for this exam, but also for the Enterprise exam (70-068), Networking Essentials (70-058), Workstation (70-073), and TCP/IP (70-059). Studying for your next exam while this information is still fresh in your mind allows you to compound your investment in study and decrease your likelihood of being caught off guard by a tricky topic.</p>
