For example, I wear prescription eyeglasses, which help me compensate for being nearsighted. Other people may use wheelchairs, hearing aids, canes, and a host of other devices that help them with their disability. These devices are the most common types of assistive technology, but there are far more unusual products available.</p><p>Completely blind individuals may use screenreaders (programs that read a computer screen's contents aloud and speak each key typed); talking watches, calculators, and other speaking devices; Braille typewriters and printers; writing guides, and cooking aids.</p><p>People with limited or low vision often use many types of magnifiers, including CCTVs and head-mount video systems; large-print books, watches, and clocks; high-visibility pens and dark-line paper; task lamps, glare filters, and shades; and screen magnification programs (that magnify a portion of the screen image up to 20&times;).</p><p>For someone with a hearing impairment, there are assistive listening systems that work with a hearing aid, special telephones, telecommunication devices for the deaf (TDDs), vibrating alarm clocks, and doorbells that flash a light instead of ringing.</p><p>A physically impaired person may use scanning, code entry, or voice-input systems to access a computer; keyboards that are small, large, one-handed, and even onscreen types (see <A NAME="rf7"><A HREF="9908bf7.htm">Figure 7</A>); dressing, eating, and bathing aids; mouse alternatives such as trackballs, touchpads, and eyegaze devices; word prediction programs (used to increase the effective rate of typing); special switches of many different types; special chairs, workstations, braces and supports; typing and writing aids; and headwands or mouthsticks (a lightweight wand held by the teeth for typing).</p><p>People who cannot speak may use augmentative communications devices as their voice. This type of equipment may be controlled by using a keyboard, touch screen, or special switch to scan through preprogrammed phrases such as, "I'd like to eat lunch now."</p><p>Assistive technology isn't just equipment for people with disabilities; it's equipment that everyone may need to use at some point in his or her life. The symptoms of old age are very similar to common disabilities.</p><p> -- D.L.</p><a href="9908b.htm#rs1">Back to Article</a><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1999, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
