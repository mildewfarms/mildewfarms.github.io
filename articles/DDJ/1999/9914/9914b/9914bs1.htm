In this question, you will be required to understand the symbolic coding of instructions necessary to logically direct the "Starfire" spaceship to its various destinations. </p><p>Rules for creating instructions from the coding symbols:</p><DDJADVERTISEMENT INLINE><p>1. Every instruction must start with an S.</p><p>2. The next part of the instruction must be F, G, H, or I if Starfire is leaving Earth, or the number corresponding to the planet Starfire is departing from if it is not Earth.</p><p>3. The last part of every instruction must be the number of the planet destination plus "stop." However, if the code for the planet destination is an even number, it must be doubled before the "stop." Example: 32E for Venus destination.</p><p>4. The codes making up the middle of each instruction (between rules 2 and 3 above) are 1,2,3, and 4 in a combination necessary for Starfire to travel along the proper path.</p><p>Using our new "SYMBOLS," the instruction for sending Starfire from Earth (from the most northern space station) to Jupiter would be: SF131328E. (Please note that there is not enough information for you to actually solve this sample question.)</p><p><b> -- B.W.</b></p><a href="9914b.htm#rs1">Back to Article</a><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1999, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
