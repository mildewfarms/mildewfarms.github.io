CodeBalance targets 32-bit CPUs equipped with 16-bit instruction-set extensions, using a mix of 32- and 16-bit instructions to reduce code size while maximizing execution speed. You can optimize programs for small size, high speed, or any combination. For example, programmers can direct CodeBalance to optimize for the fastest possible performance given a particular code size reduction goal. Similarly, you can direct CodeBalance to optimize for the smallest possible code size given a particular minimum 32-bit performance level. CodeBalance uses a mix of 16- and 32-bit instructions to achieve the desired results. CodeBalance is currently available for the ARM7/TDMI and MIPS16 processors, both of which provide 16-bit extensions. CodeBalance is bundled with the MULTI Development Environment, which includes a C/C++/EC++ compiler, assembler, linker, and instruction set simulator. A single-seat MULTI developer's license costs $5900.00 for Windows 95/NT, and $8900 for UNIX hosts. </p><P>Green Hills Software Inc.<br>30 West Sola Street<br>Santa Barbara, CA 93101<br>805-965-6044<br>http://www.ghs.com/</P><p>Riverace's ACE Version 4.6 is a freely available, portable C++ class library for developing distributed, concurrent applications.
