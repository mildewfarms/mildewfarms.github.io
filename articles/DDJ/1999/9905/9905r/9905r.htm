Kernighan and Rob Pike, underscores the fundamental point that programming involves more than just writing code. As a working programmer, say Kernighan and Pike (both members of the technical staff at Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs), you must also assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance, and maintain software written by yourself and others. To this end, <i>The Practice of Programming</i> (ISBN 0-201-61586-X) offers practical advice and real-world examples in C, C++, Java, and a variety of special-purpose languages. You can find out more about the book, which retails for $24.95, by going directly to http://cseng.awl.com/bookdetail.qry?ISBN=0-201-61586-X&amp;ptype=0.</p><p>Addison-Wesley Longman Inc.</p><p>Computer &amp; Engineering Publishing Group</p><p>One Jacob Way</p><p>Reading, MA 01867-3999</p><p>781-944-3700</p><p>http://www.awl.com/cseng/</p><p>Software Emancipation Technology has announced Discover 7.0, tools for software quality process control and management.
