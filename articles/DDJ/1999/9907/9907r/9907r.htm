The ScoutMTS SDK leverages Microsoft COM to allow Windows developers to extend any application to a handheld device in a matter of hours. Other features include bidirectional information exchange, record-level synchronization, and automatic load balancing between multiple servers. New features include support for CE devices, an extended API, and advanced system management. The ScoutMTS suite runs on Windows NT; pricing begins at $995.00 for the developer edition. </p><p>Riverbed Technologies' MobileArchitect is a graphical-design tool for developing PalmOS and Windows CE mobile systems for use in enterprise deployments. With MobileArchitect, you can paint the critical elements of an enterprise application (such as tables and forms) and then automatically generate client code for a number of environments, including SatelliteForms and CodeWarrior R5 for the PalmOS, and Visual Basic and Visual C++ for Windows CE. MobileArchitect then generates the specified client and server code as well as a Riverbed Scout conduit for the target application. MobileArchitect includes the MobileArchitect plugin API, an open and documented API for creating customized plug-ins, wizards that generate application logic. The suggested list price for MobileArchitect is $1795.00.</p><p>Riverbed Technologies</p><p>2070 Chain Bridge Road, Suite 475</p><p>Vienna, VA 22182</p><p>703-847-3303</p><p>http://www.riverbedtech.com/</p><p>Reliable Software has released Code Co-op 2.0, a serverless version-control system for collaborative development. Code Co-op lets you perform standard version-control functions such as check-in, check-out, merge, and restore without a server or network connection. Code Co-op works on a peer-to-peer network, but allows synchronization over e-mail or through the exchange of diskettes. The release of Version 2.0 automates distribution of synchronization information. The e-mail distribution system works with any e-mail clients that support Simple MAPI.
