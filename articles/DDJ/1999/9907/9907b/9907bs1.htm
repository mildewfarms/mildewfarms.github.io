H.323- and SIP-based gateways must be upgraded each time a new feature or service is added to the network. Since software upgrades may intimidate consumers, the industry is searching for a protocol that balances media and call-control features to reduce the number of software upgrades.</p><p>The IETF's solution to this dilemma is the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP). Like SIP, MGCP is a stateless, text-based protocol. Unlike SIP, MGCP concentrates only on endpoint-specific issues (such as tone detection and media stream setup) and relies on a companion protocol (SIP, H.323, and the like) to locate users, connect parties, and perform other signaling functions. MGCP's concentration on  gateway-specific controls minimizes the need to upgrade consumer devices and simultaneously reduces the work effort required to implement a gateway.</p><p>The ITU has proposed its version of a simpler gateway protocol called "H.GCP," which breaks up the H.323 model into subcomponents and defines protocols over which the components interact. H.GCP does not specify how H.323 gateways, multipoint control units, or integrated voice response units work. Instead, it recommends a framework is suitable for such systems.</p><p>Before another H.323 versus SIP protocol war erupted between the ITU and IETF, the "MEGACO" protocol was drafted. It combines the best features of the IETF solution (MGCP) with the ITU solution (H.GCP), and currently is in draft status. The MGCP draft is available for review at http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/ draft-huitema-megaco-mgcp-v0r1-05.txt, the specification is available at http://search .ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-megaco-protocol-00.txt, and the specification for MGCP cable boxes is available at http://www.packetcable.com.
