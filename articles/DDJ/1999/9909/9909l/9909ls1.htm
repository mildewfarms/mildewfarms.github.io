B&eacute;zier (or Bernstein) polynomials provide a way of making complex curves that are anchored at corner points and distorted by other control points that pull it towards them as if by gravity. Cubic polynomial B&eacute;zier curves are defined by four control points. B&eacute;zier curves are a function of one real parameter, say <i>u</i>. As <i>u</i> varies, conventionally from 0.0 to 1.0, the x and y values are defined continuously. The B&eacute;zier curve starts on the first point and ends on the fourth point. The two points in the middle pull the curve towards them a little, but the curve will not, in general, intersect the two middle points. The resulting curve is very smooth.</p><p>B&eacute;zier surfaces in three dimensions are defined by sets of B&eacute;zier curves and two parameters, say <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>. If one parameter is held constant, perhaps at 0.5, and the other one varied, the curve defined is a B&eacute;zier curve and is called "isoparametric."</p><p>In the room program, I made the curves with PARM_STEP_QTY (64) steps. The parameters <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> step from 0 to 1 in 65 steps. Then a <i>b</i> vector is built for both <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> at each value (that's 64&times;64 values total; if you stored these 65 vectors for <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> you could skip recomputing them.)</p><blockquote><p><i>b</i>[0]=(1-<i>u</i>)<sup>3</sup></p><p><i>b</i>[1]=3<i>u</i>(1-<i>u</i>)<sup>2</sup></p><p><i>b</i>[2]=3(<i>u</i><sup>2</sup>)(1-<i>u</i>)</p><p><i>b</i>[3]=<i>u</i><sup>3</sup></p></blockquote><p>Notice how when <i>u</i>=0, then <i>b[0]</i> will be in control, and when <i>u</i>=1, <i>b[3]</i> will be in control; those are the end-points intersected by the curve I'm building. When <i>u </i>is between 0 and 1, the vectors <i>b</i>[1] and <i>b</i>[2] tug the curve toward them.</p><p></p><p> -- T.E.J.</p><a href="9909l.htm#rs1">Back to Article</a><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1999, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
