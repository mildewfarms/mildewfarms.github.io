ASIS provides a standard way for tools to extract data that are best collected by an Ada compiler or other source-code analyzer. Tools which use ASIS are themselves written in Ada, and can be ported between Ada compilers that support ASIS. Using ASIS, you can produce powerful code analysis tools with a high degree of portability. You can also save the expense of implementing the algorithms that extract semantic information from the source program. The ASIS Standard is available via the ISO Catalog at http://www.iso.ch/ infoe/catinfo.html; the ASIS specific reference is located at http://www.iso.ch/ cate/d27169.html.</p>Ada Resource Association<br>info@adaresource.com<br>http://www.adaresource.com/<p>REBOL Technologies has announced REBOL 2.1, the latest release of the scripting language that runs 30 platforms, including Windows, Macintosh, Linux, PalmOS, and Windows CE.
