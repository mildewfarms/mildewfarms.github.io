This table compares the approximate difficulty of three different problems. Each row presents cryptanalysis tasks of roughly equivalent difficulty. "Bits" is the problem of guessing a secret key of the given bit size. "EC size" is the problem of calculating discrete logarithms in an elliptic-curve group with so many elements. Last, "<i>Z<sup>*<sub>p </i></sub></sup>size" is the problem of discrete logarithms in the <i>Z<sup>*<sub>p</i></sub></sup> group. The table comes from interpolating data presented by the IEEE P1363 working group.</h4><a href="9912d.htm#rt2">Back to Article</a><HR><I>Copyright &copy; 1999, Dr. Dobb's Journal</I><BR>
