The UMS architecture is the basis of a line of low-cost, high-performance, fully software-programmable single-chip platforms that combine data processing, DSP, and I/O processing elements in one integrated circuit. The company claims that the UMS architecture allows processors to be produced at about $5.00 per gigaflop (about 20 times less than current costs), with a 25:1 reduction in power at 200 milliwatts per gigaflop. The UMS architecture consists of dozens of fast, RISC-like processors on a single chip. The processors are organized into small groups, with two digital signal processors and one data processor sharing a small block of local memory, and all groups having access to global data via a new type of on-chip bus. Initial UMS chips will offer in excess of 15 gigaflops of processing power in a standard, off-the-shelf single-chip processor format. Cradle and other third parties will offer function libraries which implement software standards such as MPEG2, IEEE 1394, PC, and USB.</p><p>Cradle Technologies<br>46472 Bayside Parkway<br>Fremont, CA 94538<br>510-979-7800<br>http://www.cradle.com/</p><p>Scriptics has announced BizConnect, an XML platform for developing applications, utilizing the company's open-source Tcl implementation to allow integration with software components developed using other languages.
