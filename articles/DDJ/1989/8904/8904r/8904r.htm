Database Applications has announced a business and scientific graphics product called dR&amp;G, which is driven by 4GL statements.  This software package combines graphics with tabular reporting, mail merge, and SQL-like queries of relational databases.<P>
Chart styles include bar, pie, line, area filled, histogram and scatter, as well as fitted curves with forward or backward moving averages, regression lines, and exponential/logarithmic curves with prediction and confidence limits displayed.  Up to six data sets may be plotted at once, with automatic scaling to fit the chart in vertical and horizontal formats.<P>
Charts and tabular reports are specified as 4GL statements, as in &quot;Graph as Bars, Sales by Day Across Region,&quot; which yields multilevel bars summarizing daily transaction data from a dBase file or 16 related dBase files.  4GL statements are stored in one or many program files and may be called by name or from a menu, or they can be entered as ad hoc queries.<P>
dR&amp;G produces charts, linear regression statistics for up to six dependent variables, new template files, tabular data reports, cross-table matrix reports, custom format reports, letter reports, mail-merge, and mailing labels, as well as program files to reproduce all of the above.  The user has control over chart labelling, the treatment of missing data values, the color palette, the page size and position, and the use of various type fonts.  33 hatch and line patterns, up to 128 colors, and over 30 type styles are supported.<P>
dR&amp;G integrates G-RUN software of Mightysoft Corp. of Seattle, Wash., with nonprocedural language (NPL) of the dNPL/Reporter report writer to provide access of 16 related databases, sorting, summarizing, computation, and chart plotting.<P>
dR&amp;G is priced at $179; the upgrade prepaid price for registered dNPL/Reporter users is $89.  The company will also upgrade NPL/R database application systems with dR&amp;G capability at the same upgrade price.  Reader Service No. 26.<P>

Lattice has released Version 3.4 of the Lattice C compiler for DOS and OS/2.  This latest upgrade includes CodeProbe, a full-screen, source-level debugger and also features an integrated editor, linker, and librarian.<P>
Lattice's debugger can be used with a mouse and offers three ways to display source code.  A high-level view shows only the C source lines, a low-level view shows only the assembler code, and the mixed view shows both.  Depending on which view is used, breakpoints and other program references can be made by way of source line numbers and either absolute or relative addresses.<P>
In Version 3.4, CodeProbe operates under DOS or OS/2 real mode.  Support is provided for debugging family-mode programs that use the OS/2 EXE format but run under DOS.  Registered users receive a free upgrade, which extends CodeProbe to OS/2 protected mode.  The upgraded version supports multithread and multiprocess debugging and includes features for testing Presentation Manager programs.<P>
Lattice C for DOS and OS/2, Version 3.4, sells for $450.  The package includes the compiler, linker, CodeProbe and C-SPRITE debuggers, integrated LSE editor, bind utility, object module librarian, disassembler, API, graphics, standard Lattice C libraries, and documentation. Registered users of Version 3.3 receive Version 3.4 at no charge; users of earlier versions may upgrade for $75.  Reader Service No. 28.<P>

The Waite Group's OS/2 Programmer's Reference is a debugged reference to the set of over 200 OS/2 API function calls.  This distillation of the OS/2 Software Developer's Kit is divided into categories, each with its own tutorial.  Within each category, functions are presented alphabetically, each with its purpose, syntax, and example, including explanations of error codes, uses, cautions, and references to related APIs.  Book no. 22645, it is 848 pages and sells for $24.95.<P>
For programmers using Borland's Turbo C compiler, The Waite Group's Turbo C Bible includes tutorials and explanations to point out the different purposes and uses of each function. Compatibility check boxes show portability with Microsoft C, Versions 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0; Microsoft QuickC; and the Unix System V compilers.  This book, no. 22631, sells for $24.95.<P>
Turbo C Programming for the PC, Revised Edition includes graphics and debugger features. This book moves through the fundamentals of the language with a structured step-by-step approach.  Expanded to include Version 2.0 (but still compatible with Turbo C 1.0 and 1.5), it covers the graphics library, graphics modes, the Debugging Tracer, and it highlights ANSI C features.

Oregon Software has released Version 1.2a of Oregon C+ + for the Sun-3.  This update is highlighted by the introduction of a mouse-driven, window interface to the C+ + source-level debugger.<P>
The window interface consists of five windows: a status window that displays file name, line number, function name, and scope information; a source window that displays the source text; a button-panel window that allows mouse-click access to the debugger's commands; a dialog window for the debugger's I/0; and an application window for the application's I/0.  The separate windows for application and debugger I/O mean that the graphical layout of an application's I/0 is not scrambled by the debugger's I/0.  The source, dialog, and application windows are scrolling.<P>
Oregon C+ +, Version 1.2a, sells for $1,900 for a single-user license, $4,750 for 1 - 6 node network on a single file server, and $12,000 for an unlimited node network on a one file server.  Reader Service No. 36.<P>
