Here's a technique for swapping a calling program into expanded memory or  onto disk -- and back -- so that a child process can have more free memory.   This is particularly useful when one program invokes another says Kim.
</p><h3><a href="8904b/8904b.htm">ADVANCED 80386 MEMORY MANAGEMENT</a></h3><p><br> by Neal Margulis
Paging is the 80386's answer to the memory management for multitasking  operating systems.  In this article, Neal examines how the 386 handles this  complex task.
</p><h3><a href="8904c/8904c.htm">DEMAND PAGED VIRTUAL MEMORY</a></h3><p><br> by Kent Dablgren
Demand paging involves the dynamic partitioning of a program's linear  address space into individual &quot;pages.&quot;  It comes as no surprise that  different CPU's such as Intel's 80386, Motorola's 68030, and AMD's Am29000  manage pages differently.
</p><h3><a href="8904d/8904d.htm">SWAP</a></h3><p><br> by Nico Mak

Memory fragmentation has given has given DOS programmers headaches for a  long time.  Steve prescribes a memory compaction scheme that can spell  relief</a></h3><p><br> by, among other things, letting you allocate movable memory blocks.
