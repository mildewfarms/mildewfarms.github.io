<h3><a name="007e_0006">Ada<a name="007e_0006"></h3><P>
Intel Corp. has demonstrated its validated Ada-386 compilation package with the Intel 32-bit, real-time kernel iRMK and has announced plans to introduce an Ada-960 cross-compiler.<P>
The Ada-386 cross compilation package runs under VAX/VMS and features a set of language tools, which a designer uses to go from code development to optimizing, downloading, and debugging.<P>
The package enables designers to generate 32-bit 386 microprocessor code supported by an 80387 numerics coprocessor.  The &quot;pragma interface&quot; permits calls to high-level languages, including Intel's ASM-386, PL/M-386, and C-386.  Optional download and debug paths are available via either a ROM-resident debug monitor or by using Intel's ICE-386 for transparent, real-time emulation.<P>
Intel anticipates similar capabilities in the future for designers using the new Ada-960 development tools.  The validated Ada-960 cross-compiler will be available in the first half of this year.<P>
The Ada-386 cross compilation package is available now.  Pricing is dependent upon the class of VAX host: The price for MicroVAX version is $36,000.  The price for the Ada-386 cross compilation package includes Intel's 90-day support offering plus 12 months of maintenance. Reader Service No. 29.

Texas Instruments and Tartan Laboratories have announced an agreement to jointly develop an Ada compiler for a digital signal processor (DSP) chip.  Target processor for the compiler is TI's SMJ320C30, a third-generation DSP being developed for military applications requiring advanced signal processing capabilities, such as radar, sonar, image processing, missile guidance and tracking, and communications.  The companies will work together to define the capabilities of the compiler.  Completion of the compiler is expected late this year.<P>
The compiler, to be hosted on a DEC-VAX/VMS system, will implement Ada as defined in ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A-1983 and will target the SMJ320C30 instruction set architecture.<P>
Still in development, the 32-bit SMJ320C30 is a third-generation device in TI's family of DSP chips for military applications.  The SMJ320C30, built in CMOS technology, executes single-cycle instructions in 60 nanoseconds and can perform more than 33 million floating-point operations per second (MFLOPs).  The chip can perform complex algorithms in real time.  Reader Service No. 30. Texas Instruments Inc. Semiconductor Group (SC-871) P.O. Box 809066 Dallas, TX 75380-9077 800-232-3200, ext. 700<P>

<h3><a name="007e_0008">Miscellaneous<a name="007e_0008"></h3><P>
SofTools Inc. has released CASE:W, a computer-aided software engineering tool that generates the windows portion of applications.  It includes a programming environment to generate pretested window code.<P>
The package features a front-end prototyper that provides a way to describe the application program's windows and controls.  Using an inference engine, CASE:W then evaluates the prototype specification, applies the stored programming knowledge, and generates the window-based application.<P>
CASE:W produces commented code and the operating controls for windows applications; it also supports windows controls, such as menu bars, pop-up menus, and dialogue boxes.  CASE:W generates only C code, but programmers may use application routines in languages that can receive a C language call (such as assembler, Pascal, Fortran, Basic) using Microsoft's mixed language conventions.<P>
The product also interfaces with a variety of text editors and has a facility that regenerates programmer-added codes into future versions of a program.  Additionally, the CASE:W programming environment encompasses the Microsoft Software Development Kit components (icon editor, font editor, and dialogue editor) and 12 other configurable tools, such as a debugger, Spy, Heapwalker, and Shaker.<P>
CASE:W can be used on a 286-based machine or a 386 with at least 2 Mbytes of main memory. The package also requires the Microsoft Software Development Kit, the C Compiler, make utility and linker, and a DOS-or Windows compatible text editor.  The company recommends the use of Microsoft's Code-View debugger.  CASE:W sells for $1,495.  Reader Service No. 32. SofTools Inc. 1 Dunwoody Park, Ste. 130 Atlanta, GA 30338 404-399-6236<P>
