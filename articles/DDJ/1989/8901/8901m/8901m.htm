Edward K. Ream has begun shipping Sherlock, a productivity tool that works to trace, debug, and profile C programs.  Sherlock consists of C language macros and support routines called by these macros.  The macros are inserted with a separate tool (included with Sherlock), and the macros contain tracing and debugging code that lies dormant until enabled during the execution of the program.<P>
Sherlock can be used during coding, testing, and maintenance phases of programming and will work with Microsoft, Turbo C, or any full C compiler.  Programs containing Sherlock macros may also be debugged using traditional debuggers.  Sherlock can also be used with C++ compilers that produce C language output.<P>
Sherlock, which sells for $195, counts how many times each macro is encountered and measures the time spent in functions.  It comes with three utility programs: The SPP program inserts macros into a file, the SDEL program removes all Sherlock macros from a file, and the SDIF compares a file containing Sherlock macros to a file without them.

SOFTGRAF, Version 5.0, has been released by Sunrise-Littleton.  SOFTGRAF is a menu-driven TSR software driver that &quot;fools&quot; a monochrome PC, allowing it to run CGA color graphics programs and games, without use of a color card or monitor.  It does this by setting the system's flags for a CGA environment, intercepting graphics signals sent to the video buffer, and translating video formats so that the monochrome pixel coordinates that of a CGA color system.  Colors appear as tones of amber or green.<P>
SOFTGRAF operates from its own startup menu.  Other software features include running programs in large 40 character text mode, an AFC feature, and the ability for the user to adjust the screen refresh rate interval from 16 to 1,024 times per second.<P>
The upgraded version commits about 12K of RAM, and it senses to determine if color graphics commands are being sent to the video buffer.  If a color-oriented program is detected, SOFTGRAF switches to CGA resolution and then reverts back to the higher Hercules monochrome resolution as soon as the application requiring color is terminated.<P>
SOFTGRAF supports most commercial and public domain software and operates in Hercules compatible or EGA environments.  Systems such as a Tandy 1000 and leading edge models are also supported.<P>
Not copy protected, SOFTGRAF sells for $34.95.  Reader Service No. 33.<P>
