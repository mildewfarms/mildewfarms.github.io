A specification describing a general approach to object-oriented software design has been published by Interactive Development Environments Inc.  The specification, called Object-Oriented Structured Design (OOSD), is a non-proprietary notation for design of software systems that is language-independent (supporting languages such as C++, Eiffel, Smalltalk, Fortran, C, and Pascal) and synthesizes traditional top-down design with modern concepts for object-oriented design into a comprehensive approach to modeling software architecture.  In addition to providing improved support for the pivotal architectural design step of the software development process, OOSD supports automated generation of code for multiple programming languages, provides partitioning of a system into a coherent software architecture, facilitates reuse of design elements, and provides a clear notation for communication among designers and reviewers.  The key building blocks in OOSD are modules, lasses, and monitors.  Reader Service No. 20.<P>

Hamilton C shell, recently released by Hamilton Laboratories is an interactive language for OS/2.  The company says that its key benefit is that it allows you to describe what you want the machine to do much more quickly and easily, even if what you want is fairly complex.  Some of its features include: Fully nestable programming constructs for iteration and condition-testing; variables, arrays, and a wide range of expression operators and built-in functions; a powerful history mechanism for recalling and editing past commands; language constructs for I/O redirection, piping, background execution, and parallel threading; and more.  Hamilton C shell complies with the Berkeley 4.3 Unix Programmer's Manual.  C shell requires 286- or 386-based AT or PS/2 or compatible with a minimum of 2 Mbyte of RAM and a 2-Mbyte hard disk.  All executables will run properly inside a Presentation Manager window. The cost is $350. Reader Service No. 22.<P>

VM-DEBUG (The Virtual Machine Debugger), a debugging tool for PCs, XTs, and ATs, has been released by Wendin Inc.  VM-DEBUG is an interpreter whose language is 8088 machine code extended with the real-mode instructions of an 80286. It can stop the execution of a program at any point, examine or alter memory or registers, examine the program, and determine where the program has been.  Unlike normal debuggers, these functions are accomplished by a program outside the addressing space of the program or system under test, so that VM-DEBUG can never be altered or destroyed by an errant program.  VM-DEBUG also has the ability to trace DOS itself or the ROMs, and set breakpoints within ROM.  It retails for $99.  Reader Service No. 23.<P>

A protocol specification called the Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI), which is designed to prevent conflicts between 386 software from different companies, has been sanctioned by a number of different hardware and software companies.  Originally sponsored by Phar Lap Software Inc., VCPI addresses technical issues between control programs and DOS extenders that arise due to the nature of the 386.  These conflicts include CPU mode switching, hardware interrupt processing, and the sharing of extended memory.  Left unresolved, these conflicts force the user to turn off control programs in order to run an extended application.  The agreement of a programming standard allows the new categories of software brought on by 386 PCs to play together.  In addition to Phar Lap, other sponsors of the VCPI specification are Quarterdeck, Auadram, Lotus, A.I.  Architects, Qualitas, and Rational Systems.  The new VCPI specification will be available on June 1, 1989, at no cost through Phar Lap Software.  Reader Service No. 29.<P>

Clear Software Inc. has recently introduced Clear+ for C, a product that helps developers understand C code.  It is designed to instantly produce high-quality system documentation and to clarify the logic of C programs and applications.  According to Sandy Rudy, who designed the language portions of the program, &quot;Clear+ acts like a compiler but the output doesn't run, it shows [on the screen].&quot;  Clear President Yadim Yasinovsky went on to tell DDJ that &quot;Clear+ is ideal in an environment when you inherit someone else's code.&quot;<P>
Clear reads the source code of any C application and instantly produces the system tree chart, function flow charts, formatted source listings, function cross references, and prototype files.  As flow charts and tree charts are output to a printer, screen, or a file, the program automatically calculates the spacing, number of pages (or screens) required, and the placement of symbols for the flow chart.  And diagrams look exactly the same on screen as they do in print.  Clear also features powerful hardcopy controls, various graphics options, and options to directly invoke a text editor or compiler of the user's choice.  Clear can analyze C source code as is or after it has been preprocessed with either an external or internal preprocessor.<P>
Clear has been designed for use with any IBM PC/XT/AT or compatible and supports Hercules, CGA, EGA, VGA, most dot-matrix printers, and HP LaserJet+ printer.  Minimum RAM requirement is 512K.  Clear currently supports Microsoft C, QuickC, Turbo C, and any generic C compiler. Clear+ for C retails for $199.95 plus $5.00 for shipping and handling.  Clear+ for dBase is also available for the same price.  A combination package (Clear+ for C and Clear+ for dBase) is sold for $310.00 plus $10.00 for shipping and handling.

The QuickC family has grown with Microsoft Corporation's introduction of the QuickC Compiler with QuickAssembler 2.01.  This package is an integrated C-and-assembler environment which includes an integrated editor, compiler, and debugger.  The C portion of the compiler has not changed from QuickC 2.0.  The assembler portion consists of a macro-assembler add-in module built around MASM 5.1, which features single-pass assembly technology.<P>
Additionally, the package provides incremental compiling/linking and recompiles/reassembles and relinks only modules that have been changed since the previous compilation.  The debugger can be used to debug both assembler and mixed-language programs.  The package is supported by an on-line reference system in addition to books and manuals.<P>
System requirements are MS-DOS 2.1 or higher and 512K of RAM; a mouse is optional.  The QuickC compiler and QuickAssembler package sells for $199 although registered QuickC Compiler 2.0 owners can buy the assembler addin module directly from Microsoft for $75.  Reader Service No. 33.<P>

A page makeup system that supports C compilers is now available through Quality Software.  The system, called FutureComp Laserline, is a MS-DOS version of the company's FutureComp Page Makeup Environment which is primarily designed to produce custom page makeup programs for directories, catalogues, parts lists, technical manuals, and similar applications.<P>
The Laserline version of FutureComp can output to most printers and typesetters that support PCL or PostScript.  (The Proline version of the system supports high-resolution typesetters like those from Mergenthaler and Autologic.)<P>
In addition to font handling and hyphenation dictionary utilities, FutureComp provides C functions for composing blocks of text, placing illustrations and tables, and for positioning these blocks anyway on a page.  Users can also construct logical fonts for special applications.<P>
The system supports any compiler that can call ANSI C functions, and applications programs created with FutureComp can be recompiled on any computer system that supports C.  The system runs on any IBM PC/XT/AT using DOS 2.0 or higher; Microsoft C 5.1 is also required. FutureComp sells for $695 and includes PostScript and HP PCL translators.  Reader Service No. 34.<P>

As C portability tools become increasingly important, new ones continue to pop up, the most recent being Abraxas Software's CodeCheck.  What this package does is analyze C source code in terms of its portability between PC-DOS, OS/2, Macintosh, Unix, and VMS.  &quot;In essence, CodeCheck is an expert system that looks at the code and tells if it is portable or not,&quot; Abraxas president Patrick Conley told DDJ.  During set-up, the system loads a set of rules for a particular platform (DOS, 0S/2, Mac, and so on), then checks the code against those rules. It then identifies any code that is not portable to or from any environment, including C++ and ANSI C.  It also quantifies code maintainability with user-defined measures at all levels and identifies unacceptable style or usage.<P>
CodeCheck supports all C compilers from major vendors and requires 512K of memory.  It sells for $295 and Conley said it would be shipping in mid-August.  Reader Service No. 35.<P>

HCR Corporation has introduced the packaged version of an advanced Unix C++ compiler based on C++, Release 2.0, from AT&amp;T.  HCR/C++ provides all of the key features of C++, such as type safe linkages, default membership initialization, and the ability of each class to define its own operators.  It will run on most 386-based systems.  HCR's dbXtra, based on dbx Version 3 from Berkeley 4.3 BSD Unix, adds the ability to operate through windows, permitting users to review their output and source code easily, even on standard terminals.  HCR/C++ allows direct debugging of C++ and window access to the translated C source code.  All C++ code is translated into C before execution so programmers can apply dbXtra to examine either C or C++ code during debugging.<P>
Initial copies will be available at an introductory price of $499 (50 percent off the list price of $995).  HCR's standard support and upgrade options are available; each user of HCR/C++, Version 1, also will have the option to upgrade to Version 2 for a delivered price of $99.  Reader Service No. 36.<P>
