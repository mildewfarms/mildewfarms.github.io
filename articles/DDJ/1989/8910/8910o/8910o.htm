<a name="021e_0001"><a name="021e_0000">Erik Labs has released BiModem, a file transfer protocol for the IBM PC and compatibles that can send and receive files simultaneously, and which allows operators to chat during file transfer.  The protocol is capable of attaining transfer speeds over 98 percent efficient in both directions at the same time.  While many bulletin board interfaces are available and can be used with any communications program that permits execution of an external program, the protocol has been implemented in GT POWER (P&amp;M Software).<P>
A modified 32-bit CRC and a 32-bit Filesum insure file accuracy, and the feature &quot;refresh transfers&quot; compares files and sends only the information that has changed.  Download requests can be located through multiple directories; files may be recovered from either an aborted files directory or the receiving directory.  Additional file requests may be added and transfers in progress canceled during the process of transferring files.  Doubledos and DesqView are automatically recognized, giving time to other tasks.<P>
The protocol has the ability to tag file requests from disk or a files list, and a Hot key program is included to tag files displayed on your screen.  Transfer requests can be addressed to specific users to take place automatically the next time they connect.  The price is $25 ($32.50 with laser printed documentation).<P>

Matrix Software Technology has introduced a telecommunications black box called &quot;BlackBox&quot; that contains a series of objects that support communications between computers via modem or direct connection.  This enables users to add independent telecommunications sessions and sophisticated scripting to their Layout programs.  &quot;Inside every BlackBox,&quot; according to Vincent Garofalo, president of Matrix, &quot;our software engineers have built a set of the most wanted capabilities.  Rather than reinventing the wheel, our users can concentrate on building better applications.&quot;<P>
BlackBoxes are software objects that users can manipulate in Layout.  It is unnecessary for users to know what is happening inside the object -- they can concentrate instead on connecting BlackBoxes with other objects on their cards.<P>
Inside the BlackBox, Layout employs objects that perform complex functions, which allows users to add a range of capabilities in a particular area when they create their applications.  These include functions for electronically exchanging text, documents, programs, and graphics between two different computers.  Additional objects are phone book management, VT100 terminal emulation, and a graphical scripting capability (which facilitates the design of programs that allow users to outline a series of steps based on the telecommunications dialog).  The individual, modular nature of the BlackBox makes it easy for users to incorporate one or more of these capabilities as they build their programs.<P>
At the same time, Matrix is introducing a dBase BlackBox to create standard user interfaces.  Both are priced at $69.95, and run with Matrix Layout, Version 2.0, now available for $199.95. Layout and the BlackBoxes both run on all IBM PCs, PS/2s, and compatibles, with support for all major graphics cards.  A mouse is optional.<P>

Jensen &amp; Partners International Inc. are shipping a new TopSpeed Modula-2 Communications Toolkit that is designed to help programmers write applications that use IBM PC serial port hardware.  The toolkit was written entirely in Modula-2, and gives access to a wide range of capabilities, from utilizing hardware registers to terminal emulation.<P>
The Communications Toolkit provides for low-level device driving.  Procedures in the RS-232 module allow you to select and initialize any of four hardware ports, test for carrier, install/uninstall the serial interrupt handler, select XON/XOFF or RTS/CTS flow control, perform serial read and write, and assert the break signal to the modem interface.<P>
Procedures in the file transfer support module include status window support to monitor the transfer status, and sending and receiving data via XModem, YModem, windowed XModem, and Kermit protocols.<P>
Applications support includes routines, macro transmission procedures, timer routines, and VT1OO, VT52, and BBS ANSI terminal emulation.  There are also procedures for testing and setting logging modes, reading, writing, and printing files, file selections, and parsing and building file names.<P>
Scripting for automatic logon to remote services includes a compiled script language with commands for loading new scripts, condition testing, screen clearing, downloading/uploading files, manipulating log files, transmitting/ receiving strings to the modem interface or keyboard, and more.<P>
The Communications Toolkit includes over 8000 lines (260K) of source code for 21 modules. There is documentation on the 8250 UART, cabling information for PC XT and AT, and a demonstration program.<P>
TopSpeed is also shipping a Modula-2 B-tree Toolkit with tools for writing powerful database applications.  Both toolkits sell for $79.95 each.<P>

FORTH Inc. has released pF/x, a real-time multiuser, multitasking operating system in a version designed to run coresident with PC/MS-DOS on 80386-based systems.  &quot;pF/x will support as many concurrent, asynchronous tasks and users as the 80386 will allow,&quot; according to spokesperson Mary Hawkins, and &quot;is ideal for developing applications such as instrumentation, process control, industrial sensors, and anywhere else there is a need for real-time data acquisition, analysis, and control.&quot;<P>
pF/x is compatible with PC/MS-DOS, Versions 3.3 and higher.  It normally runs in protected mode, but transparently switches to compatibility mode when accessing system resources.  It can increase processing speed by linking time-critical interrupt routines directly to the hardware interrupt vectors (for zero interrupt latency), and takes only 9.28 microseconds for a multi-tasker loop of two tasks on a 25 MHz 80386.<P>
pF/x is part of the polyForth development environment, which features the Forth language, macro-assemblers for the 80386 and 80387, editor, target and turnkey compilers, graphics, database support, and utilities.  pF/x costs $3850.<P>

Lattice Inc. has released the new Lattice Communications Library, which they claim is a comprehensive set of high-level and low-level C functions for creating applications that perform asynchronous communications.<P>
&quot;The library supports DOS, OS/2, and AmigaDOS environments with a full set of functions for XModem, YModem, Kermit, and ASCII protocols,&quot; according to Robert Hansen, Lattice vice president.  Functions included in the library give programmers the ability to select, open, and close a communications port; set baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits, and buffer size; and send and receive characters from the communications port.  Other functions dial and hang up the telephone; reset the modem; set automatic answering; send and receive files using ASCII, XModem, YModem, or Kermit error-checking protocols; and display the progress of file transfers.<P>
The price is $250, with source code available for an additional $250. It supports Lattice C, Version 3.4. Versions for Microsoft and Turbo C compilers, as well as an AmigaDOS version, are also available.  Lattice will include the library in Version 6.0 of the Lattice C Compiler for DOS and OS/2.<P>

American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) announces AMIDIAG, a menu-driven diagnostic utility for 286- and 386-based IBM PCs and compatibles.  According to AMI, AMIDIAG exhaustively tests all hardware subsystems, including motherboard, memory, hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, keyboard, video adapter, monitor, printer port, and serial port.<P>
AMIDIAG features easy-to-use menus, English-language diagnostic messages, user-configurable test routines, error logging, graphic display of the location of defective DIP and SIMM memory chips, and a choice of continuous, time-bound, or count-bound testing in batch or interactive modes.<P>
Hard disk tests for hard disk controllers using MFM and ESDI data encoding include media analysis, force bad tracks, data transfer rate, track-to-track seek time, seek test, read/verify test, and check cylinder test.  Users can either select from the first 46 drive types defined in the machine's ROM BIOS or define their own.  AMIDIAG can also perform partial or full hard disk formatting, with optional optimized interleave for faster performance. Floppy drive tests include random and sequential read/write, disk change line test, and speed test.<P>
AMI president S. Shankar says that &quot;AMIDIAG can diagnose defective memory chips, bad hard disk sectors, and other critical subsystems before they become a problem.&quot;  AMIDIAG retails for $99.  A monitor ROM and diagnostics card is also available, for $995.<P>
