<hr>
<h2>FEATURES</h2>
</p><h3><a href="8910a/8910a.htm">IMPLEMENTING MULTIPLE COMPUTER COMMUNICATION LINKS</a></h3><p> by Mark Servello<br>
If you've been asking yourself what to do with that dust-covered  microcomputer in the back room, Mark offers a productive suggestion, and  shows you how to do it.
</p><h3><a href="8910b/8910b.htm">LZW DATA COMPRESSION</a></h3><p> by Mark R. Nelson<br>
We all know that less is better, especially when it comes to data transfer  and storage.  Mark shows how more can be less, and that's what data  compression is all about.
</p><h3><a href="8910c/8910c.htm">HIGH-SPEED FILE TRANSFERS WITH NETBIOS</a></h3><p> by Costas Menico<br>
Costas shows you how to take advantage of the high-speed data transfer  facilities LAN's provide, without having to bite the LAN bullet.
</p><h3><a href="8910d/8910d.htm">FINITE STATE MACHINES FOR XMODEM</a></h3><p> by  Donald W. Smith<br>
If the chaos of communications is getting you down, a finite state machine may be what you need.  Don describes how to implement one for the XModem  protocol.
</p><h3><a href="8910e/8910e.htm">HAMMING-CODE DECODING</a></h3><p> by Ben White<br>
Reliability and efficiency are the cornerstones if data communications.   Ben examines the Hamming-code method of ensuring these qualities and shows  you how to implement this approach.
</p><h3><a href="8910f/8910f.htm">EXECUTABLE SPECIFICATIONS WITH PROLOG</a></h3><p> by Gregory L. Lazarev<br>
Gregory discusses how executable specifications can be generated from a  data flow diagram using Prolog's declarative and procedural capabilities.
</p><h3><a href="8910g/8910g.htm">A GLOBAL VARIABLE DEVICE DRIVER FOR MS-DOS</a></h3><p> by Jim Mischel<br>
If you need a way to maintain true system-wide global variables for your  DOS applications. Jim's GLOVAR program should fill the bill.
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2>
</p><h3><a href="8910h/8910h.htm">FIRST LOOK AT COMMONVIEW</a></h3><p> by Noel J. Bergman<br>
This month in 'Examining Room,' Noel examines CommonView, an object-oriented library for mapping graphical-user interfaces onto a set of object  classes, to find out if it really does make it easier to write Windows and  Presentation Manager applications.
<h2>COLUMNS</h2>
</p><h3><a href="8910i/8910i.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</a></h3><p> by Michael Swaine<br>
Delving deeper into neural nets, Michael arrives at Dave Parker's doorstep  to find out what this NN pioneer is up to now; and Parker shares a back  propagation demonstration program from way back when.
</p><h3><a href="8910j/8910j.htm">C PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p> by Al Stevens<br>
Al's collection of C++ tools continues to grow, as he provides object-oriented versions of standard menus he developed last year with regular C.   He also brings you up to date on ANSI C.
</p><h3><a href="8910k/8910k.htm">STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p> by  Jeff Duntemann<br>
Object-oriented programming has introduced more new terms than we'd care to  shake a stick at.  This month, Jeff sorts out and clears up some of those  terms, at least as they apply to Smalltalk, Actor, QuickPascal, and Turbo  Pascal.
