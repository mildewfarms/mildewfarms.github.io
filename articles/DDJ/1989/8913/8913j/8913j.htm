While enthusiasm for the Macintosh as a programming platform has been largely responsible for the more than 3000 currently available applications, Apple realizes that programmers and developers need support if they are to continue producing new and better software for Macintosh (and Apple II) systems.  Although the company has supported developers through their Certified Developer program since 1983, it's just recently that Apple expanded that service by creating three basic programs -- the Apple Programmers and Developers Association (APDA), Apple Associates, and Apple Partners (formerly Certified Developers)--through which third-party developers have access to what previously were in-house resources.<P>
<h3><a name="029a_0004">APDA Update<a name="029a_0004"></h3><P>
APDA is an international direct distribution channel open to anyone interested in developing Mac products.  Members can order Apple development tools, like the Macintosh Programmers Workshop (MPW) and MacApp, and documentation, such as &quot;Inside Macintosh,&quot; and &quot;Macintosh and Apple II Technical Notes.&quot;  Members can also order third-party development products -- compilers, development utilities, and books.  The $20 annual membership fee includes a subscription to the quarterly APDAlog product catalog.<P>
Furthermore, says Wendy Tajima, APDA's marketing manager, APDA &quot;offers HyperCard for the Macintosh and Applesoft Basic or Basic compilers for the Apple II&quot; for end users interested in programming.  Corporate in-house developers can get MacWorkstation and MacAPPC, the tools for building network and mainframe access software.  And professional developers of in-house products and products for resale have access to MPW for the Mac and APW for the Apple II, not to mention development tools such as A/UX (Apple's Unix).<P>
APDA, formerly administered by TechAlliance (a national user group based in Renton, Wash.), was brought in-house by Apple to expand services and provide additional resources, to get closer to Apple's development customers, and to better coordinate with other developer-oriented groups within Apple.  This transition, according to Sue Espinosa of Apple's developer channels group, has increased companywide awareness -- beyond the engineering department -- of the value of programming development products.<P>
APDAlog is billed as an information catalog for developers and programmers.  The first half of the magazine consists of short articles on programming languages and development tools. What follows is a complete catalog of development products, the majority of which are for the Mac.  Through the Apple Partners Program and the Apple Associates Program (described later), those who intend to develop products for resale or for in-house use can directly connect with the people at Apple, for a fee, of course (see <a href="8913j.htm#029a_0005">Table 1</A>).<P>

<h3><a name="029a_0006">The Associates Program<a name="029a_0006"></h3><P>
Apple created the Associates Program in order to lend support to a wider group of developers than was formerly reached by the Certified Developer program.  The Associates Program targets educators, researchers, and in-house developers, all of whom might develop software for the Mac or Apple II for their own use, not for resale.  (See <a href="8913j.htm#029a_0007">Table 2</A> for a longer list of participants.)  Development information available to associates includes system software and updates, the Technical Guidebook (containing datasheets about Apple products), technical notes, sample code, hotline support (non-technical), an AppleLink subscription (the proprietary worldwide communication network, which includes current product and program information, sample code, and technical libraries and notes), the AppleDirect monthly newsletter, the Apple Viewpoints biweekly newsletter, an APDA subscription, and the Developer Library discount (optional).<P>

<P>
Two publications, Apple Viewpoints (biweekly) and AppleDirect (monthly), are published to keep developers informed of the latest development-related information, and contain technical and marketing information, news, interviews, insights and perspectives on trends in the computer industry, and information on future Apple directions.<P>
<h3><a name="029a_0008">The Partners Program<a name="029a_0008"></h3><P>
The Apple Partners Program replaces the Certified Developers Program, and targets developers who intend to sell Apple-compatible products within two years.  Participants include third-party developers, VARs, and contract programmers, among others (<a href="8913j.htm#029a_0007"> Table 2</A>).  The benefits of this program include all of those provided to associates plus technical support via electronic mail, the Marketing Guidebook, an AppleLink subscription (plus 12 hours of connect time, one hour per month), the Marketing Assistance Program (including the Customer Mailing Program), an invitation to the annual Developer's Conference, hardware discounts (30-50 percent off retail), and leasing and credit options for equipment purchase.<P>
One benefit of being a partner is that Apple provides marketing assistance, sharing strategies and helps developers analyze potential markets.<P>
<h3><a name="029a_0009">Additional Services<a name="029a_0009"></h3><P>
Both partners and associates have the option of purchasing the Macintosh or Apple II Developer Libraries, which consist of programming manuals, user interface guidelines, technical notes, development guidelines, and sample code, for an extra $150.  And both receive subscriptions to AppleLink and its electronic mail system that connects developers not only with Apple, but with other developers, VARs, Apple dealers, and user groups.  Apple partners can connect with the Developer Technical Support through this service and reach engineers who are there to help solve problems, answer questions, or address concerns.  Participants in both programs receive advance copies of new versions of Apple system software in order to conduct compatibility testing.<P>
Also available to partners and associates are the courses on Mac programming at Apple's Developer University, which runs from two to five days, and costs between $900 and $1420. Though all are available in Cupertino, Calif others are available in locations throughout the U.S.  The curriculum includes Macintosh Programming Fundamentals, Advanced Macintosh Programming, MPW (Macintosh Programmers Workshop development system), Technical Introduction to AppleTalk, and MacApp and Object-Oriented Programming.<P>
Beneath the umbrella of the Developer Group are Developer Services, including programs, technical support, special events, the university, and the press.  This includes &quot;evangelism,&quot; which targets developers who are implementing key products and provides them with product-design assistance during all phases of the product development cycle, such as guidance on standards compliance, competitive analysis, and international marketing.  The Developer Tools Product Marketing is another branch; it works with Apple development tools engineers and with third parties to make development systems and tools available.  And developer technical publications produces technical books and manuals that describe Apple products and development techniques.<P>
Apple currently has about 10,000 registered developers working on new software and hardware.  With an installed base of over two million Macintosh computers, the market is definitely there.<P>
