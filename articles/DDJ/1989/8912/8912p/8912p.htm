Apple Computer announced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop (MPW) C++ at OOPSLA '89.  MPW C++ fully supports the AT&amp;T 2.0 specification including multiple inheritance, operator overloading, and protected members.  Support of the Macintosh Toolbox and the operating system as well as Object Pascal-based methods found in MacApp are also provided. MPW C++ includes the MPW C++ translator, C++ interfaces, and libraries for complex math and stream processing, an unmangler for CFront messages, and a collection of example programs.  In addition, Apple's Symbolic Application Debugging Environment (SADE) can be used to debug programs at the C++ source level.  A beta version of MPW C++ (v 3.1B1 at the time of this writing) is available through the Apple Programmers and Developers Association (APDA) for $175.  MPW C++ also requires MPW C, Version 3.0, or higher and the Macintosh System Software 6.0.2 or later.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

ObjectVision Inc. of Berkeley Calif. has just released its visual object-oriented programming environment of the same name.  ObjectVision allows the programmer to both organize object hierarchies and design objects visually on the screen.  Once an object is created, the programmer can implement its methods through a pop-up editor by using an English-like syntax. Once the design is completed, ObjectVision generates either C++ or Turbo Pascal 5.5 source code.  A &quot;hide&quot; function encapsulates the details of a newly designed object, keeping the screen free of clutter.  In addition, a built-in browser allows the designer to easily traverse the object hierarchy.  ObjectVision also provides a pixel editor for the creation of icons, the ability to import dBase data into specialized database objects, built-in drawing functions, and a rather slick UI that includes mouse support.  Support for multiple inheritance is not included in the current version, although such support is being considered for future versions.  System requirements for ObjectVision are minimal -- IBM PC or compatible with at least 256K, either a VGA or EGA and a mouse.  ObjectVision sells for $399.  A demo disk is also available at $30.

To follow-up on last month's &quot;Of Interest,&quot; Digitalk was demonstrating the recently announced Smalltalk/V PM at OOPSLA '89.  Smalltalk/V PM is an object-oriented development environment for Presentation Manager under OS/2 and allows developers to take advantage of PM's capabilities while hiding its complexities.  The product is positioned as a prototyping tool for UI-intensive applications, even though it is the first fully compiled Smalltalk under OS/2.<P>
Developers can pass data to and from PM tools, as well as applications, through Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) and Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE).  Digitalk also provides tools to organize and browse source code including PM code.  A source-level debugger provides most of the features you'd expect including breakpoints, single-stepping, and an object inspector.  The object inspector additionally allows the programmer to change instance variables during the debugging session.<P>
Smalltalk/V PM comes complete with 150+ classes and is source code compatible with Smalltalk/V 286 and Smalltalk/V Mac.  The package requires OS/2 Presentation Manager 1.1 or later and is priced at $499.95.  Reader service no. 22.<P>

Stepstone's new release of their Objective-C compiler marks the fourth generation of the product, which runs under DOS.  Stepstone also offers versions under other platforms including OS/2, Sun 3, 4, and Sun 386i under SunOS, and the Apollo workstation.<P>
Objective-C more closely follows the message sending paradigm found in pure object-oriented languages such as Smalltalk than does C++.  The strength of Objective-C lies in its strong type checking.  The compiler extends ANSI C features such as function prototyping with method prototyping and type mismatch detection for objects.  Debugging tools include a message trace facility that allows the programmer to view the message's receiver, the name of the message, arguments to the message, and the sender of the message.  Another tool, back tracing, allows the programmer to back trace through the current stack after an exception has occurred.  Also available from Stepstone is an object-oriented user interface toolkit, ICpak2O1, for workstations running under X-Windows.  The toolkit provides 58 classes with over 1100 methods to support pop-ups, scroll bars, dialog boxes, and the like.  Other classes support the UI by managing the environment, providing controllers, fixtures, and other abstract classes.  A set of container classes is also included.  Reader service no. 23.<P>

A new book from MIS Press, Object-Oriented Environment in C++, by David Hu, presents concepts and code to create graphical environments such as those found in Smalltalk or MacApp using C++.  Hu covers Zortech, Guidelines, and Advantage C++ (from Lifeboat) as well as Stepstone's Objective-C and Smalltalk/V from Digitalk.  The strengths and weaknesses of the various languages are compared so that the reader can make informed decisions as to which tool is best suited to a given project.<P>
Hu also shows how to create windows, bit-mapped icons and menus, and how to support the mouse using Zortech's C++.  In addition, he presents schemes for knowledge representation, and shows how to create an expert system including methods for defining forward- and backward-chaining inference engines.  In a final chapter, the author presents object-oriented database concepts and provides insights into the Gemstone Database system from Servio Logic. The book is priced at 29.95, or with a source code disk at $59.95.  Reader service no. 24.<P>

Addison-Wesley has published The Renderman Companion, A Programmer's Guide to Realistic Computer Graphics by Steve Upstill of Pixar (Steve wrote the article &quot;Photorealism in Computer Graphics,&quot; DDJ November 1988, on the Renderman Shading Language).  The book is a tutorial based on Pixar's Renderman Interface for 3-D scene description, which can produce computer graphics that are indistinguishable from actual photographs.  Steve said he wrote The Renderman Companion &quot;to demonstrate that any programmer with some 3-D computer graphics experience can produce stunning pictures with the use of our Renderman Interface.&quot;<P>
Some of the topics covered in the book are quadric surfaces, polygons, parametric surfaces, hierarchical modeling, the digital camera, lighting and shading, surface mapping, and the Renderman Shading Language.  The paperback sells for $26.95, ISBN 0-201-50868-0.  Reader service no. 27.<P>

Blaise Computing Inc. has announced C TOOLS PLUS/6.0, the latest version of Blaise's library products for Microsoft C.  This library of compiled C functions supposedly gives programmers advanced routines for developing high-powered C applications, and includes virtual, stackable menus and windows with full mouse support and optional &quot;drop shadows.&quot;  It also has multiple virtual pop-up help screens; a miniature multiline editor for gathering user responses; a single function call that can move, resize, and promote a window or menu on top of all others; the ability to update covered windows automatically when they are written to; support for EGA, VGA. and MCGA text modes including 30-, 43-, and 50-line modes; and support for the enhanced (101/102 key) keyboard.<P>
The library comes with adaptable source code for study or emulation.  Blaise claims that their attention to detail, like the use of function prototyping and the const modifier, the pre-built libraries for the four standard memory models, the organized header files, and an indexed manual makes C TOOLS PLUS/6.0 appropriate for both experienced software developers and newcomers to C.<P>
The library also supports mouse detection, cursor control, and button presses and releases, with mouse support integrated into the windows and menus.  Functions written in C can be installed to be called whenever certain classes of mouse events occur; even DOS functions can be accessed in response to mouse events.<P>
Fully documented source code is included with the product, and the manual gives a general overview for every function category and descriptions of each function.  C TOOLS PLUS/6.0 can be used for product development without obligation to Blaise Computing.  It requires the Microsoft C 5.0 or later or QuickC, DOS 2.0 or later, and an IBM or compatible.  The mouse functions require a Microsoft-compatible mouse and its driver software.  The product sells for $149.  Reader service no. 29.<P>
