<h2>FEATURES</h2>
</p><h3><a href="8907a/8907a.htm">LINE-OF-BEST-FIT</a></h3><p> by William H. Murray and Chris H. Pappas<br>
Bill and Chris describe how to use the mouse and Presentation Manager to  define a group of points and draw the resulting line, all in a protected-mode environment.
</p><h3><a href="8907b/8907b.htm">AN ICON EDITOR</a></h3><p> by Keith Weiskamp and Loren Heiny<br>
Creating, saving, and editing icons for graphics applications is a snap  with Keith and Loren's icon editor and its support tools.
</p><h3><a href="8907c/8907c.htm">MULTITASKING OS AND GRAPHICS COPROCESSORS</a></h3><p> by Chuck McManis<br>
&quot;High-performance graphics applications&quot; is often a contradiction of terms,  especially on low-end systems.  Chuck shows how the Amiga's multitasking OS  and built-in graphics coprocessor coax 32-bit graphics performance out of a  16-bit machine.
</p><h3><a href="8907d/8907d.htm">IMAGE MATHEMATICS</a></h3><p> by Victor Duvanenko<br>
Photographers use chemicals to enhance and enrich images.  Victor shows how  programmers can achieve the same special effects by manipulating numbers.
</p><h3><a href="8907e/8907e.htm">TURBO PASCAL WITH OBJECTS</a></h3><p> by Michael Floyd<br>
Mike puts Turbo Pascal 5.5's new object-oriented features to work and  uncovers some secrets about the Overlay Manager ad Smart Linker in the process.
</p><h3><a href="8907f/8907f.htm">FASTER STRING SEARCHES</a></h3><p> by Costas Menico<br>
Boyer-Moore is a hybrid algorithm that combines pattern analysis with brute  force to produce faster string searches.  This method speeds up Costas'  programs, and he shows how it can speed up yours too.
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2>
</p><h3><a href="8907g/8907g.htm">GETTING THE BUGS OUT WITH TURBO DEBUGGER</a></h3><p> by Bill Catchings and Mark L. Van Name<br>
Bill and Mark put Borland's Turbo Debugger through its paces and find that,  although correcting programming mistakes isn't necessarily fun, it doesn't  have to be all that painful either.
<h2>COLUMNS</h2>
</p><h3><a href="8907h/8907h.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</a></h3><p> by Michael Swaine<br>
While picking up some spare change, Michael asks Hal Hardenbergh why a  hardware engineer would find neural networks fun.
</p><h3><a href="8907i/8907i.htm">C PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p> by Al Stevens<br>
The Blackjack simulation program Al presents this month saved him some  money and you can bet that it will save you some too.
</p><h3><a href="8907j/8907j.htm">GRAPHICS PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p> by Kent Porter<br>
It's possible to have do-it-yourself screen coordinates by simply  redefining the coordinate system in any terms you like.  And doing so,  says Kent, opens the door to new graphics programming tricks and  techniques.
</p><h3><a href="8907k/8907k.htm">STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p> by Jeff Duntemann<br>
Turbo Pascal's object-oriented extensions launch Jeff into the swirling  waters of  OOP.
