<h2>FEATURES</h2>
</p><h3><a href="8905a/8905a.htm">CREATING TSRS PROGRAMS WITH TURBO PASCAL: PART 1</a></h3><p><br> by Ken L. Pottebaum
In this first installment of a two-part series, Ken discusses TSR basics  and presents the tools necessary to write memory-resident programs.  Next  month he will put this theory to work.
</p><h3><a href="8905b/8905b.htm">KERMIT MEETS MODULA-2</a></h3><p><br> by Brian R. Anderson
Modula-2 enabled Brian to implement each layer of the Kermit  communications protocol as separate modules and in this article he shows  you how he did it.
</p><h3><a href="8905c/8905c.htm">LANGUAGE-INDEPENDENT DYNAMIC PSEUDOSTRUCTURES</a></h3><p><br> by Bruce W. Tonkin
Whenever data must be compared in a variety of formats, data conversion  sometimes pays off. Bruce discusses how you perform conversion and what  kind of results you can expect.
</p><h3><a href="8905d/8905d.htm">TAWK: A SIMPLE INTERPRETER IN C++</a></h3><p><br> by Bruce Eckel
The data-encapsulation features of C++ let you create more sophisticated  programs without adding complexity.  Bruce's &quot;tiny&quot; AWK implementation  illustrates this and more.
</p><h3><a href="8905e/8905e.htm">QUICKDRAWING WITH XCMDS</a></h3><p><br> by Jay Martin Anderson
Speed up your HyperCard applications</a></h3><p><br> by accessing QuickDraw directly, Jay  shows you how -- and how to avoid pitfalls when doing so.
</p><h3><a href="8905f/8905f.htm">RUN LENGTH ENCODING REVISITED </a></h3><p><br> by Phil Daley
The run-length encoding technique we presented in February generated a  flurry of response, and so here's another approach to the problem.
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2>
</p><h3><a href="8905g/8905g.htm">QUICK C VERSUS TURBO C</a></h3><p><br> by Scott Robert Ladd
At first glance, Borland's Turbo C and Microsoft C might appear to be  similar feathers from the same bird but, as Scott discovers, that isn't  necessarily the case.  Join him as he discusses the strengths and  weaknesses of these two popular C compilers.
<h2>COLUMNS</h2>
</p><h3><a href="8905h/8905h.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</a></h3><p><br> by Michael Swaine
It was Robert Floyd's 1978 Turing Award lecture on programming paradigms  that inspired Michael's, column in the first place.  Now, more than 10  years later, Michael interviews Professor Floyd to see how he and the  world of programming have changed.
</p><h3><a href="8905i/8905i.htm">C PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p><br> by Al Stevens
This month, Al builds the engine of a C-like interpreter, which can be  added as a script interpreter to his SMALLCOM communications project.  Al  then follows up earlier columns</a></h3><p><br> by adding his two cents about Quick 2.0, as well as the goings on of ANSI C.
</p><h3><a href="8905j/8905j.htm">GRAPHICS PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p><br> by Kent Porter
Viewpoints not only provide you with a window to the world, they let you  define the boundaries of that world.  At least that's what Kent and his dog  found out.
</p><h3><a href="8905k/8905k.htm">STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING</a></h3><p><br> by Jeff Duntemann
Typecasting is a problem that has traditionally plagued Hollywood actors,  but as Jeff points out, it can be a problem for programmers as well.
