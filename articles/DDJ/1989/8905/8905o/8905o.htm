The Lattice C++ compiler package now includes new documentation for the standard Lattice C library.  The separate volume describes the more than 300 Lattice C functions that are also available to C++.<P>
Lattice C++ translates C++ source code into C programs that are then compiled by the Lattice C compiler.  The new volume of documentation gives users a synopsis of each C function's use, a description of the function's purpose, the return value provided by the function, and a cross reference.  The reference manual also provides application examples.<P>
C++ programmers can call a Lattice C function for math, file I/O, memory allocation, and system functions; write complete program modules in C when the programs do not require C++ features; and build C++ objects utilizing C functions.<P>
Lattice's C++ package uses the AT&amp;T translator kit.  A driver, similar to the LC driver in the Lattice AmigaDOS C compiler, is provided for translating, compiling, and linking.<P>
The price of Lattice C++ is $500.  Registered users of Lattice C++ will receive a copy of the new Lattice C Library manual at no charge.  Lattice C++ requires 1.5-Mbyte memory and two floppy drives; a hard disk is recommended.  Reader Service No. 21.<P>

Cortex Computing Corp.'s Enhance!  adds several features to DOS 2.0 and greater.  Accessed from the command line and/or batch files, Enhance!  coexists with, not replaces, DOS and COMMAND.COM.<P>
According to Cortex, Enhance!  adds symbol/alias defining and processing, file management (move, copy, remove, append, list, locate, and change files/ groups/attributes), retrieval and reissuing of previously entered commands, the ability to issue several commands at one DOS prompt, command line editing, and simplified DOS directory/ drive maneuvering.  Enhance! is RAM resident and can load and run in expanded memory.<P>
Symbol (alias) processing allows the user to use symbols (words) at the DOS command line for which Enhance!  will substitute one or more other words.  Symbols may be defined to represent commands, parts of commands, several commands, and other symbols.  In some instances, symbol processing replaces batch files with symbols and exact commands with abbreviations.  For instance, entering any of DIR through DIRECTORY could perform as though DIR were entered.<P>
With Enhance!'s file management, the user can perform the following from the command line: list, copy, move, remove, protect, hide, and change the date and time values of disk files. Another feature is the ability to specify and/or exclude files with names and/ or extensions that begin with one or more sets of letters, end with a certain letter or letters, or have a certain letter or letters somewhere in between.<P>
Retrieval and reissuing of previously entered commands allows the user to recall and optionally modify and resend commands that have already been entered.  Several commands can be entered at once, and command line editing supports lines longer than 80 characters.<P>
This product sells for $79.95 and supports the IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2, and compatibles with at least 256K RAM and DOS 2.0 or greater.  Reader Service No. 20.<P>

Quadram has released Version 1.1 of its program development toolkit for the JT Fax 9600 PC facsimile board.  The toolkit contains instructions that enable programmers to write to the JT Fax 9600's shared RAM interface, as well as working programs for operations supported by the board.<P>
The code necessary to transmit a facsimile resides on the board.  In addition, the board's facsimile capabilities can be accessed without Quadram code being resident with the PC's main memory.  The JT Fax 9600 can also be adapted to PC bus systems running operating systems other than MS-DOS, such as Unix or Xenix.<P>
This product is a three-quarter size 9600 baud background board with an on-board 80188 processor.  It installs in an IBM PC, XT, AT, and most compatibles, plus PS/2 Models 25 and 30.  A unit retails for $795.  The toolkit is available free to registered JT Fax 9600 users by contacting Tom McElroy at 404-564-2353, ext. 2135.<P>
Quadram produces three other PC facsimile products.  JT Fax Internal, which sells for $395, is a 4800 baud half card for the IBM PC, XT, AT, and PS/2 Models 25 and 30, as well as most compatibles.  JT Fax Portable sells for $495 and is a 4800 baud external version, which plugs into a computer's serial port.  Selling for $595, JT Fax PS/Q is a 4800 baud full-length card that installs inside the IBM PS/2 Models 50, 5OZ, 60, 70, 80, and most compatibles.  Reader Service No. 22.<P>

Formation, Version 1.1, by Aspen Scientific supports various application interfaces, such as overlapping windows, different menu styles, and dialog boxes.  Formation in source code form is transported to several operating systems.  The source code is compatible with MS-DOS, OS/2, and Unix System V, as well as Unix System look-a-likes, such as SCO Xenix System V/386.<P>
Formation not only supports menu interfaces, such as drop-down menus, pop-up menus, and Lotus-style menus, but it also provides dialog boxes for user-to-application input.  Formation dialog boxes support scrolling text prompters, option buttons, check boxes, command buttons, and scrolling list boxes.  Additionally, Formation supports line borders, shadowing, and exploding window refreshes.<P>
Under MS-DOS and OS/2, this product supports VGA, EGA, CGA, and MDA displays and C compilers.  Formation under Unix supports terminals defined in the terminfo database and exploits line-graphics capabilities where available.<P>
Prices are $399 for the source code bundle supporting MS-DOS, OS/2, and Unix, and $159 for the binary bundle supporting MS-DOS and OS/2.  Formation requires Aspen Scientific's Curses, Version 4.0, for MS-DOS and OS/2, and Unix Curses (provided with Unix).  Reader Service No. 23.<P>

For writing memory-resident programs in Basic, MicroHelp has released Stay-Res Plus, Version 3.0.  One feature of Stay-Res Plus is the ability to specify up to 21 &quot;hot keys&quot; that will pop up the program.  Each hot key can be a regular key press or a &quot;shift only&quot; hot key, such as Ctrl-Alt.  The SysReq key can also be used as a hot key.<P>
The SRPOKER.COM program can be used to pop up the program from the DOS command prompt or a batch file, or pop the program up after n ticks have occurred.  Other features include shelling other programs or batch files from resident programs and removing the program from memory from within the program, or by executing a .COM program from the DOS command line or a batch file.<P>
The system's current environment variables can be accessed even if they have been changed after the program has become resident.  This includes PATH, COMSPEC, and LIB.  In addition, files can be left open between pop ups.<P>
System requirements include an IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2, 80386, or compatible; Microsoft QuickBasic 2 - 4 or Bascom 6 with DOS 3.0 or later; QuickBasic 1 or Bascom 1 - 5 with DOS 2.1 or later; an 80 column monitor; and a 360K floppy disk.<P>
Stay-Res Plus, Version 3.0, sells for $89; upgrades are $60.  Reader Service No. 24.<P>
