Productivity Products International is offering an object-oriented software engineering environment that contains Objective-C, Vici, and a catalog of Software-ICs. Objective-C is an object-oriented software engineering language that includes such features as encapsulation, which holds data within an object and surrounds the data with a shell of procedures; inheritance, which builds and reuses code; and dynamic binding, which allows Objective-C objects to decide at run time which routine to run. Vici is a prototyping and debugging environment. Software-ICs are modules of reusable code that give programmers the same advantages as integrated circuits give hardware designers.<P>
The PPI product set is available for the DEC VAX, Sun Microsystems, HP-9000, and Apollo lines and the IBM PC AT. Source code licenses are available for users who want to port the environment to their own proprietary hardware. Reader Service No. 16.<P>

A Modula-2 language systems is now available from ana-systems. Modula-2/68 is suitable for professional software development or academic instruction on systems using the Motorola line of 32-bit microprocessors. With Modula-2/68, program modules can be compiled separately. An executable process can be built by linking with previously compiled program modules or by linking with library procedures written in C. Modula-2  programs can easily access standard C object libraries, which means that modules can use previously written and debugged subroutine libraries written in other programming languages. For special applications based on the MC68000 processor line, the linked Modula-2 programs can be written out in the Motorola 5-record format and then easily downloaded to standard development systems.<P>
Modula-2/68 is available for the Convergent Technologies line of Unix systems and sells for $1,200. Reader Service No. 18. ana-systems 697 Saturn Ct. P.O. Box 4759 Foster City, CA 94404-0759 (415) 341-1768<P>

PL/D from Dair Computer Systems is a new system language that allows users the speed and control of assembly language with the ease of expression of a compiler. Like assembly language, PL/D has no run-time library overhead. PL/D code is inherently capable of relocation for EPROM-based embedded control, a common PL/D application. Features of the language include macro and conditional compile facilities, library functions that can be incorporated into the program at compile time as SYS source files, 17 options that can be specified within the source, and some features similar to Forth and C. Source code of the compiler is available. PL/D requires a 192K IBM PC AT or PC/XT with MS-DOS 2.0 or later and sells for $124.95. Reader Service No. 21.<P>
