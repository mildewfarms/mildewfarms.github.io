The C Programming Language, Second Edition by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie has been published by Prentice Hall. This new edition is based on the draft-proposed ANSI C Standard. The book makes precise the features that were not spelled out in the original definition of C, and states explicitly which aspects of the language remain machine dependent. New features from the ANSI standard, such as function prototypes and the standard library, are also explained. Additional changes in the new edition include a C reference manual, an appendix describing the standard library, and an appendix summarizing changes between the first edition and the draft-proposed ANSI standard. The price of the book is $40 for cloth and $28 for paper. Prentice Hall will continue to publish the first edition.  Reader Service No. 22.<P>

Programs in Motion offers a shortcut to large-system expert system developers by parlaying its facile, direct handling of decision trees with its new ability to generate production rules in a variety of programming languages. This expert system development software can work as a scratch pad for quick decision-tree prototyping, or even as a working breadboard. Once a decision tree functions as desired, the software can generate corresponding production rules of program code in C or Pascal. In most cases, these modules can transfer into big expert system environments with little or no change. 1st-Class Fusion for IBM PCs, IBM XT, IBM ATs, or compatibles is priced at $1,295.
