Dis*Doc, a new automated disassembler and patcher for the IBM PC, XT, AT, and compatibles, has been released by RJ Swantek &amp; Associates. Dis*Doc uses four algorithms to separate code from data at a rate of 10,000 lines per minute on a hard disk.<P>
It also processes the 80386/80387 instruction set; disassembles anything in files or RAM memory; patches any file using the same addresses given in the disassembled listing; creates a MASM ready output, including program declarations; automatically generates five different labels from Jump, Branch, Call, Data, Stack, or allows programmers to create their own; automatically generates comments for MS-DOS and BIOS services as well as 1/0 commands; keeps patches in a separate file for documentation purposes; saves the results of its first program pass to expedite the creation of future listings; and has error messages that tell the programmer how to fix the problem.<P>
Selling for $99.95 plus $4 shipping and handling, Dis*Doc requires two floppy drives, or a hard disk and floppy drive, and at least 256K bytes of memory for MS-DOS or PC-DOS 2.0 or higher. Reader Service No. 23.<P>

Microcosm Inc. has released hyperICE-386, a real-time in-circuit emulator that allows engineers to develop systems based on the Intel 80386 microprocessor. HyperICE-386 consists of a microprocessor-specific probe and a universal chassis.<P>
The product offers software and hardware engineers a host-independent way to debug systems at full speed by emulating the 80386 at clock speeds up to 25 MHz. Also, overlay memory runs with zero wait states at speeds up to 20 MHz.<P>
Instead of using the 80386's debug registers, hyperICE-386 incorporates three 8,000-gate arrays. hyperICE-386 provides extensive trigger logic, monitoring all address, data and status lines, and 16 logic probe lines. Triggering controls trace collection and can stop the emulator at any point, down to the register level. Also, the transparent tracing of hyperICE-386 gives users a record of all chip functions as it runs in real time.<P>
Fully configured systems, including chassis and probe, start at $17,500.<P>
