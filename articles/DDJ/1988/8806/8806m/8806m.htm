Applied Logic Systems has announced the release of Professional Version  1.2 of the ALS Prolog Compiler for MS-DOS computers. This version is an  interactive Prolog compiler designed for programmers building complex  intelligent applications and expert systems. Based upon Edinburgh-style  syntax, the ALS compiler produces code which executes native reverse at 3,400 LIPS on an IBM PC XT and 31,000 LIPS on a 16 MHz Compaq 386.  Features include: a module system, tail recursion optimization, garbage  collection, and the ability to create stand-alone .EXE applications. A  virtual code space allows programs larger than available memory to run.  Price for the compiler is $499, which includes one year of free  updates. Reader Service No. 20.<P>

Release 5.0 of FORTRIX-C is now available from Rapitecb Systems. FORTRIX-C is a software converter that provides automated Fortran to C.  The new release adds the ability to support all of MIL-STD-1753  Fortran, all but five VMS Fortran enhancements, and virtually all ANSIFortran-66. Other new features include: an improved error handler  with more complete diagnostics; a 30 percent reduction in the size of the output module; a post-processor that the user may elect to use to eliminate awkward (though correct) C constructs in the translated code; a makefile generator that creates a dependency script for the Unix  system make utility; and a simple common handler designed to generate more efficient C source code under certain conditions.

BBx, from BASIS, is a derivative of Basic enhanced for business data processing. It offers file structures from flat files to multi-keyed  files. Intrinsic locking at the record and file level prevent  corruption of data during concurrent access. Designed for interactive processing, BBx provides data verification and error handling allowing  development of userproof applications. Decimal arithmetic with  programmer specified precision eliminates undesired rounding of  calculations. Device-independent I/O facilitates the use of terminal screen manipulation (including windowing), printer forms control, and  graphics devices. All implementations of BBx are binary compatible with  each other.<P>
BBx is available for MS-DOS, PC-DOS, Xenix, and Unix on over 65 different computers. All versions of BBx include a full set of  developer utilities. Reader Service No. 22.<P>

HiSoft has just released two new language products for the Atari ST: PowerBasic and ITL Modula-2.<P>
PowerBasic is a Basic compiler that includes features such as  procedures, functions, local variables, the CASE statement, WHILE and  UNTIL loops, and character and integer constants. It also has short and  long integer variable types, single- and double-precision floating  point numbers and string variables. PowerBasic is a no-limit compiler-no  program size limit, no variable size limit, no string size limit, and no  array size limit.<P>
PowerBasic will run on any ST with a disk drive and sells for &pound;39.95.<P>
FTL Modula-2 is a fully standard Modula-2 compiler with linker, 68000  assembler, the complete source code of most of the standard modules,  and a host of utilities including a library manager and a complete CLI.  Porting source code from other versions is straightforward. Some of the  features specific to the ST are a menu creator and a desk accessory  builder. The compiler sells for &pound;69.95.

OASYS has introduced a family of native and cross development tools for  the Intel 80386. The OASYS 80386 development tool kit runs on VAX (VMS  or Ultrix), Sun, and other 68000-based systems; and 80386-based workstations such as the IBM PC and the Compaq Deskpro 386.<P>
OASYS' 80386 compilers use global optimization techniques and employ  register allocation in generation dense code. Full support is provided  for two floating point units, the Intel 80387 and the Weitek 1167. Additionally, each compiler has interlanguage calling capability, for instance, C programs may call Fortran and Pascal subroutines.<P>
The OASYS C 80386 compiler may be used with host system debuggers,  such as dbx, or with the OASYS C and Fortran Source Level Debuggers for  debugging in cross mode. OASYS' Designer C + +, an optional C + +  front-end preprocessor, is also available with the compiler. The 80386 compilers operate with other components of the tool kit: editors, profilers, and math libraries.<P>
The OASYS Avalon 80386 Assembler/Linker and the OASYS Phar Lap 80386  Assembler and LinkLoc (linker/ locator) complete the tool kit. Reader  Service No. 26.<P>
