<a name="00b3_0002"><a name="00b3_0000">In case you didn't catch my first back in January, let me say it again: reviewing makes me uncomfortable. Creators put a lot of sweat into getting a product to market. Print is powerful stuff, and a bad review can do much harm. On the other hand, I like to share good news. So, in this column I'll talk about things I've used for a while and fundamentally like. Just call me Pollyana Krut.....<P>
On objectivity: I hate to crush any world views, but it's a myth. Product reviews are inevitably subjective. The best I can do is let you in on some of the experiential baggage I filter through. Also, I know and/or have worked with some of the people whose goodies I'll be reviewing. I'll always mention any such connections. Just know it's done to help you weigh my opinions, not as name dropping.<P>
<h3><a name="00b3_0004">QUED/M 2.04<a name="00b3_0004"></h3><P>
DDJ ran a nice article by Levi Thomas and Nick Turner on programmers and their text editors last year (February 1987). The article suggested that programmers might be a bit like baby ducks, bonding strongly with the first warm editor they meet. So, to help you assess the forthcoming opinions, my first computer assisted writing was on IBM card punches and Teletype paper-printing terminals. Though primitive, both tools sported evocative sound effects.<P>
Editing sounds have devolved, but text hacking's come a long way. I've done a lot of writing in succeeding decades, and currently work with several text editing programs. My current favorite is QUED/M 2.04. It gives me power, speed, ease of use, and a smooth-sloped learning curve. Though I briefly mentioned the product back in column 1, I'd like to give a few more details.<P>
Got a bad case of featuritis? QUED/ M's got almost all the ones I've ever seen and/or wanted and a few more. A nonexhaustive list is:<P>
<ul>
<li>a powerful macro language, complete with a real-time recording mode</li>
<li>high levels of user-configurability</li>
<li>undos up to 32,767 (love that number) actions deep, depending on your RAM resources</li>
<li>powerful regular expression and metacharacter facilities</li>
<li>text folding</li>
<li>line sorting</li>
<li>ten clipboards</li>
<li>automatic saves to two directories</li>
<li>automatic saves after a configurable number of keystrokes</li>
<li>backups of previous versions of a saved file</li>
<li>adjustable scrolling parameters</li>
<li>a full set of capitalization/casing commands</li>
<li>multiline horizontal motion by tabs or spaces</li>
<li>gremlin zapping</li>
<li>windows with much status information</li>
<li>window tiling and stacking commands</li>
<li>user-configurable transfer menu</li>
<li>parentheses balancing, with user designatable definitions of &quot;parentheses&quot;</li>
<li>the ability to open many files simultaneously</li>
<li>multifile search/replace operations</li>
<li>windows with horizontal and vertical split-pairing</li>
<li>text markers</li>
<li>intelligent extensions to Apple's standard file-opening dialog</li>
</ul>
And on and on. ... I sense QUED/M's designers have used a lot of text editors and Mac applications and have kept lists of features they've liked, detested, and wished for. And, unlike some applications that sport an abundance of commands and options, QUED/M's design and implementation seem clean, well organized, and intuitive.<P>
There are three things I'd like in a future QUED/M:<P>
<ul>
<li>the ability to extend the command set via user-written standard Mac CODE resources</li>
<li>the ability to work with files that don't fit whole hog into RAM</li>
<li>a thicker manual, with slower/deeper explication and many more examples, particularly in the discussions of regular expressions and macros</li>
</ul>
Victor Romano programmed QUED/M 2.04. He and Jerry Lewak designed it. Jerry also wrote the manual. Two people, one fine text-editing product. Kudos, gentlemen, and thanks. I wish I had QUED/M in all my other computing worlds.<P>
<h3><a name="00b3_0005">TMON 2.81<a name="00b3_0005"></h3><P>
Here's more detail on another product I mentioned briefly back in column 1. TMON 2.81 is the Mac debugger I use all the time. It's small and rugged and works on a wide range of code resource types in a variety of complex environments.<P>
TMON 2.81 provides a full range of standard debugging features. It runs in a simplified windowing environment that won't go down if your code munches critical parts of the Mac's regular windowing operations. In a variety of ways, you can:<P>
<ul>
<li>examine and change memory at several levels of abstraction</li>
<li>stop and start code execution</li>
<li>fiddle with heaps</li>
<li>convert and resolve quantities and expressions relevant to Mac programming work</li>
<li>customize the program by extending its command set</li>
<li>recover from crashes</li>
</ul>
There is one glaring omission in this version of TMON: though it won't blow when used with a 68020 or 68881, it won't disassemble non-68000 instructions or display non68000 registers. So you can't really debug anything involving 68020s, 68881s, 68851s, et al. Shame, shame.<P>
TMON was originally developed as an in-house tool by ICOM Simulations, whose other products include the graphic adventures Deja Vu and Uninvited. Waldemar Horwat (not a pseudonym, he actually exists) wrote the bulk of the program, albeit at a frighteningly young age. Darin Adler, currently working for Apple's expanding Mac Tech Support team, did the set of command extensions (known as the User Area) that accompanies this version of the debugger. The new manual is quite good; Paul Snively wrote the users' guide section, and Waldemar wrote the technical reference part.<P>
TMON may face some rough marketing pressures over the next few months as Think, Borland, and Apple bring out new source-level debuggers. TMON works primarily at the assembly level, though it has rudimentary source code label capabilities. But those other tools aren't out yet. And, even when they are, TMON should still be useful as a robust common denominator tool, especially when it's upgraded to full 680x0 support.<P>
<h3><a name="00b3_0006">BFS Navigator<a name="00b3_0006"></h3><P>
HFS Navigator is a small utility that Michael Kahl, chief programming force behind Lightspeed C, showed me on my September visit to Think central. It hooks into the Mac's standard file-opening and saving dialogs and lets you hop quickly to favorite directories on file opens and saves. It also finds files and directories and can create new directories on the fly.<P>
That's not a bad set of features, but I already had desk accessories that pulled off the last three functions, and I've become quick and comfortable mousing up, down, and sideways through my carefully organized HFS directories. Sure, Navigator looked like a nice hack, but I didn't think I needed it.<P>
I was (eventually) wrong. I tried Navigator for a week, gave it up, came back in a day, and now I'm hooked. You know how it is: a little taste of Mac ergonomics only makes you hunger for more, and HFS Navigator feeds the pangs.<P>
A simple installation program lets you add Navigator to your HFS disk. Thereafter, whenever you mouse-press on the directory button in a standard HFS file dialog, HFS Navigator pops up a special menu of your favorite directories (see <a href="198800b5.htm">Figure 1</A>, page 108). You just select the directory you want to go to, and you're there, without having to mouse up and down the branches of the HFS directory tree. The current directory, shown at the top of Navigator's pop-up menu, can either be added to or deleted from the list of favorites.<P>
<a href="198800b6.htm">Figure 1</A>: A click on the directory name box in a standard file dialog brings up HFS NAvigator;s handy list of favorite directories.<P>
If you hold down the Option key when you mouse-press the standard file dialog's directory button, up comes the standard pop-up menu, showing the path to the current disk's root directory. And, if you hold down the Command key during the mouse-press, a master menu pops up that lets you find files and directories and create new folders (see <a href="198800b7.htm">Figure 2</A>, page 108). Folder making at such an opportune moment is very useful.<P>
<a href="198800b8.htm">Figure 2</A>: Pressing the Command key causes Navigator to bring up its action menu.<P>
I do have two things I'd like the makers to tweak, in the name of even greater egomania. First, as currently configured, the menu of favorite directories is limited to 16 entries. I keep bumping up against that ceiling. My solution would be to raise the limit and, to keep user access fast, arrange the entries in two dimensions, as a table rather than as a list. See <a href="198800b9.htm">Figure 3</A>, page 113, for my vision.<P>
<a href="198800ba.htm">Figure 3</A>: Author's vision of an improved Navigator, stretching the user interface along an orthogonal path.<P>
Second, I don't like having to hold down the Option or Command keys when I want the standard path-to-root or master pop-up menus. A possible solution would be to give a mouse-press on one side of the directory button to get the favorites, a press on the other side to get the path-to-root, and a press within a few pixels of the top of the directory button to bring up the master menu.<P>
HFS Navigator has a competitor, FindSwell, but I haven't got my hands on it yet. When I do I'll report back. Meanwhile, as I said earlier, Navigator's got me hooked.<P>
<h3><a name="00b3_0007">WYSIWYG Ain't<a name="00b3_0007"></h3><P>
I do like to maintain a positive attitude. So view the next few paragraphs as an opportunity for fabulous personal financial growth. See a need and fill it, as the kitty litter and blue toilet water inventors say.<P>
Here's the situation: I recently spent three weeks doing production desktop publishing with a friend who's a commercial printer. I was also involved in producing the first issue of another friend's desktop published magazine. And I just finished putting out my own little software company's latest quarterly catalog. In all three instances Macs were used, and the overall process and results were quite satisfying. But we repeatedly came up against an irritating and needless bugaboo, one that creates the incredible opportunity noted earlier.<P>
WYSIWYG is a myth. What you see on the Macintosh screen is not what you get on the laser-printed page. Oh, it's close. Frustratingly close. But not close enough for real commercial production work. Hairlines vary in size. Text and graphic elements lose their relationships. Whole sentences can switch pages. On-screen measurements indicate you're controlling placement to four or five decimal places, and the finished result can vary by big pieces of inches. And this is true, to varying but never completely insignificant degrees, with every piece of desktop software we used. So you proof and kiudge and proof and kiudge until the result's acceptable.<P>
There's no good reason for such behavior. These are computers, kids, and they're very good at arithmetic. The Mac has SANE, with ungodly levels of precision. If software SANE's too slow, you can write directly to the hardware. If Apple's LaserWriter driver doesn't work properly, just send PostScript out directly. If PostScript's the problem, learn how to work around it. But, please, somebody, do something. This is intolerable.<P>
Deliver desktop publishing accuracy along with ease of use and automated power, and you'll get very rich. `Cos there are a lot of people out there doing this stuff, and they all know the truth: the WYSIWYG emperor's walking around stark jaybird nekkid!<P>
<h3><a name="00b3_0008">Code Corner<a name="00b3_0008"></h3><P>
I spent some time this last month wandering around HyperCard and HyperTalk. Serendipitous travel's my most fruitful learning mode. This month's code corner features a small toolkit I built to aid that exploration. Building and running it revealed some of HypesCard 1.0.1's contradictory qualities.<P>
First, the script editing facilities can be politely described as primitive, but the graphics editing facilities are elegant.<P>
Second, execution speed can be slow. Depending on the hardware, this month's project takes 0.5 to 4 minutes to copy less than 20 objects from one stack to another. Third, execution speed can be fast. My buddy Bruce The Q. Hammond built a 40,000 card HyperCard database (he likes to break and fix things). Searches over this multimegabyte file were in the sub-30-second range.<P>
Fourth, HyperTalk syntax can be intuitive. Right from the start I could write large pieces of code without continual manual browsing. Fifth, HyperTalk syntax can be inconsistent for example, the usage of the word the. Sometimes it's optional, sometimes it's mandatory, sometimes it's forbidden. Aargh! Who can keep track?<P>
Sixth, HyperCard can be used to build large, complex coordinating tools. Take a look at some of the commercial applications starting to appear.<P>
And finally, HyperTalk can bog down while running through large amounts of complex code. Take a look at some of the commercial applications starting to appear.<P>
Notice the seesaw here. It's good, it's bad. It's fun, it's irritating. It breaks Macintosh conventions, it extends the Macintosh metaphor. ..... .final judgments will obviously have to wait. Let's just hope Bill and his team keep at it `til they get it right. Meanwhile, on to the project.<P>
<h3><a name="00b3_0009">Getting a Toehold<a name="00b3_0009"></h3><P>
As I learned long ago from the Kernighan/Ritchie/Plauger crowd, the first thing you want to do in a new environment is build some simple tools, then lever yourself up into power and sophistication. HyperCard's no exception to the rule.<P>
Whenever I started work on a new stack or card, I found myself spending quite a bit of time bringing in the basic buttons that let me hook into HyperCard's facilities. I'd find myself unable to go Home or without a menu bar. And I hate memorizing key combinations. So, I built a useful set of buttons that can be installed with one click and one paste-automatically. It's the Scouting Toolkit.<P>
<h3><a name="00b3_000a">Toolkit Descriptions and Behaviors<a name="00b3_000a"></h3><P>
<a href="198800bb.htm">Figure 4</A>, page 113, shows the self- documenting card the toolkit lives on. <a href="198800bc.htm">Figure 5</A>, page 113, identifies the 15 buttons and two (hidden) text fields that make up the domicile card's object world. All but one field and one button go with the toolkit when it travels to new stacks and cards. <a href="198800bd.htm">Figure 6</A>, left, details the 12 icons used in the buttons. <a href="8804f.htm#00b3_000e">Listing One</A>, page 72, gives complete descriptions and scripts for the card, its stack, the buttons, and the fields.<P>
<a href="198800be.htm">Figure 4</A>: The Scouting Toolkit's card of residence.<P>
<a href="198800bf.htm">Figure 5</A>: Where the 15 buttons and 2 (hidden) fields live on the toolkit's residence card.<P>
<a href="198800c0.htm">Figure 6</A>: Design details of the 12 icons used in the Scouting toolkit.<P>
Installing the toolkit on a new card is easy. First, make sure your Home card knows where the toolkit's stack lives. Then click on button 14. It copies itself to the clipboard. Now go to your target stack and card, and give a Paste command. As ceaselessly mentioned, the rest is automatic.<P>
The toolkit proper contains eight major buttons, numbers 5 through 12. The top four let you toggle various environmental windows. The bottom four take you to useful places. The other toolkit buttons support the big eight.<P>
The whole toolkit folds up and disappears if you click in its interior outside the buttons. lt reinflates when you click on its iconic remainder, button 13.<P>
Like all good organisms, the toolkit knows when to fold its tent and scoot off into the night. Button number 1 removes all traces of the toolkit from a card, including itself. Snake tail swallowing is one useful byproduct of HyperTalk's ability to self-reference.<P>
<h3><a name="00b3_000b">Trees Saved As Description's Delayed<a name="00b3_000b"></h3><P>
I keep telling Tyler I'll cut down the size of these columns and their listings. And I'm trying. But once again I've exceeded my spatial budget. So you'll have to wait until next month for the remaining discussion of the Scouting Toolkit's objects and their operation.<P>
Of course, Marvel and DC always come up with dramatic catchphrase hooks for their continued graphic stories. But all I can think of is this small section's subhead. Who ever said comic books ain't superior literature?<P>
<h3><a name="00b3_000c">Wrap-up<a name="00b3_000c"></h3><P>
I've worked without reader feedback on these first few columns--frightening but true. So, if you get a chance and have the interest, drop me a note detailing what you want to see more and less of.<P>
Next time out, besides the project wrap-up: reader mail, Mac Expo, parentheses surrender, the Cambridge ambience, intelligent pictures, Microsoft madness. And, of course, another code project. See you in 31.<P>
