Big Bang Software has released an MC68020 symbolic simulator/debugger for the professional cross-developer. The software package, a companion to the MC68000/10 simulator released in 1986, enables the user to test and debug 68020 software on IBM PCs or compatibles. Hex files of Motorola 5-Records can be disassembled and displayed. Instructions can be executed in either fast or single-step mode. Results of each executed instruction on registers, flags, and 68020 memory are immediately available for display. During single-stepping  the  display shows the last instruction executed, the current contents of all registers, and the instruction following the last executed. All 68020 instructions, addressing modes and condition codes are fully supported. Load, dump, and breakpoint facilities are included. The product runs on IBM PCs, IBM PC XTs, IBM PC ATs, and compatibles with DOS 2.0 or later and 256K.<P>
The price is $395. Reader Service No. 21.<P>

Genus Microprogramming has announced the PCX Programmer's Toolkit, which provides complete documentation and software that allows software developers to create applications with the ability to display, save, capture, and manipulate PCX format images. The Toolkit supports all display modes of the Hercules, CGA, EGA, and VGA display adapters, and contains a comprehensive set of compiler interfaces. These interfaces include Microsoft C, Quick C, Turbo C, Lattice C, Quick Basic, Turbo Basic, Turbo Pascal, and Clipper. Except for Turbo Basic, libraries are provided that are directly linked to the user's program, and Quick Libraries are provided for the Microsoft integrated compilers. All routines are written in assembly language.<P>
Additional features include several utility programs that display and capture screens, cut out sections of an image, locate screen coordinates, inspect image headers, and manage image libraries. An image library manager allows images to be grouped together and compressed, saving as much as 50 percent of disk space.<P>
The Toolkit is priced at $89.95. Source code is available for an additional $100. Reader Service No. 23.<P>

The C Programmer's Association has been formed to provide C programmers with inexpensive C functions and to offer C programmers the opportunity to make profit from the C functions they have written. Programmers can purchase single C functions or entire libraries. Programs can be ordered through the C Programmer's Association's bulletin board. All functions purchased are licensed to members only. Members may include these functions in programs intended for commercial distribution.<P>
Programmers may also submit C functions to the association. If the function is accepted by the association, the programmer will receive a percentage of each one that is sold, Reader Service No. 25,<P>
