P.J. Plauger, contributing editor Computer Language Magazine<P>
P.J.,<P>
I heartily endorse your argument, in the April 1988 issue of Computer Language, for not crediting the authors of your ideas. I like the way you extended the principle beyond mere programming by snubbing Anton Chekhov in that same issue. Sure, Isaac Newton comes off as magnanimous in that famous quote about seeing farther than other men because he stood on the shoulders of giants, but I don't recall that he identified the giants. Could Newton have continued to see farther than others if he had told them where he was looking? I think not.<P>
Besides, references are ugly. When HyperText becomes a reality, every document will include its own intellectual audit trail. Until then let's not clutter up the pages of magazines with boring academic citations. Why would anyone want to read further about a topic discussed in Computer Language anyway?<P>
What I meant by that, of course, was that Computer Language always publishes the last word on any topic.<P>
So, thanks for the idea, which I plan to use. Don't worry, though; whenever I do, I'll cite what I call the Plauger Principle.<P>
Magnanimously,<P>

I think you missed a bet in your instant analysis of John Sculley's comments on suing Microsoft. What Sculley said in Odyssey was, &quot;If we sued our most important software supplier, our business customers would think we'd lost our minds.&quot; Clearly, Microsoft is no longer Apple's most important software supplier. Do I get a T-shirt or something for this?<P>

The legal ramifications of publishing are getting more and more complicated. Thanks for telling us about the important Congressional report, Science, Technology, and the First Amendment, I am writing to see if I got the facts straight, since I forgot in which of your magazines you discussed it. As I recall, the report costs $3.50, its GPO stock number is 052003-01090-9, and I can get it by writing to the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325. Is that right? By the way, how's the Windows magazine coming along?<P>
Curiously,<P>

I'm sorry that you were unable to use the copy of Microsoft Systems Journal that I sent you for your annual redesign issue. At least you agree with me that the publication uses garish and overdesigned pages, with a look and feel that bears little resemblance to a real magazine. Guess that just wasn't what you were looking for.<P>

I'm glad that you were able to use the Microsoft Windows' screen dumps that I sent you for your Windows 2.03 legal defense. I see that you agree with me that the product encourages garish and overdesigned screens, with a look and feel that bears little resemblance to the Macintosh's. Guess that was just what you were looking for.<P>
Legally,<P>

Fine &quot;HyperTalk&quot; column, but the cowboy hat is strange. And where's Doug Clapp?<P>

You've been looking a little tired lately. I think you're stretching yourself too thin. Too many writing assignments. No good will come of it, Mike, mark my words. One of these days you're going to be tapped out when the copy comes due, and then what'll you do? By the way, there are several other letters on this disk. Could you see that they get to the people to whom they're addressed?<P>
