Language Extensions 1, which adds nine features to Actor has been released by The whitewater Group. The features include macros, object storage, stringpattern matching, Method Browser, EditWindow enhancements, ordered dictionary, change log compression utility, literal collections, and deep copy.<P>
The define macros introduce new syntactical forms and shortcuts, allowing conditional compiling and a variable number of arguments. With macros, you can compile one Actor program in different modes. Object storage stores whole objects onto streams or DOS files for recall at a later time. String pattern matching compares strings using wildcard characters, such as ? and *.<P>
Method Browser appears as a popup window in response to a senders or implementators menu choice. It displays source code from a select group of methods. The class EditWindow has been enhanced to support horizontal scrolling and the cursor keys. With it you can edit files wider than the size of your browser and file windows.<P>
Ordered dictionary introduces a modifiable ordering convention for dictionaries that is either chronological or sorted. Change log compression utility removes outdated code from Actor's backup log, and literal collections eliminates runtime creation of objects.<P>
Deep copy is an object copying method that copies one object to another object recursively through all levels of data, eliminating aliasing. Language Extensions I sells for $99. Reader Service No. 28.<P>

Cogent Software has announced the availability of HyperBase, an application development tool for the IBM PC. Combining Hypertext, interactive graphics, and the artificial intelligence programming language Prolog, HyperBase permits users to develop and deliver intelligent documents on an IBM PC.<P>
Authors and readers of documents do not have to be familiar with Prolog to develop or use applications, yet they can produce documents that contain complete expert systems attached to both graphics and text. Furthermore intelligent Hypertext links may be constructed that aid a reader in using the document and that modify themselves according to the reader's skill level.<P>
HyperBase comes with a toolkit for capturing images directly from the computer screen and incorporating them into documents. A built-in Prolog interpreter supplies the intelligence engine. Intelligent HyperBase documents may be created by annotating pre-existing documents in a text editor.<P>
HyperBase requires an IBM PC, AT, PS/2, or compatible with at least 384K free memory and DOS 2.1 or later. A hard disk and graphics display are recommended, and mouse support is provided.<P>
HyperBase is available in two versions, a $99 personal version and a $249 developer system, which permits the creation and distribution of standalone applications. HyperBase is compatible with the Cogent Prolog compiler ( available separately for $199), and code produced with the compiler may be attached dynamically to HyperBase documents.
