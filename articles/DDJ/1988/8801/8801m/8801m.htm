ExperTelligence is now shipping two Al products for the Macintosh: ExperCommonOPS5 and ExperCommon LISP Foreign Function Interface.<P>
Some of the features of ExperCommonOPS5 include a forward-chaining, rule-based, expert system language; a custom tracing mechanism of rule firings and changes to memory; the ability to pause, examine memory, and undo rule firings to revert to an earlier state; conformation to the de facto OPS5 standard described in Programming Expert Systems Using OPS5 (Brownston et al Addison-Wesley); complete port ability to other implementations of OPS5; facilities to interface with other programming languages and tools; the ability to create complex Macintosh user interfaces for developed expert systems; and integration with the most powerful AI development environments available today. ExperCommonOPS5 runs in both ExperCommon LISP for the Macintosh Plus and SE and ExperCommon LISP II for the Macintosh II, Version 2.2 or later. The retail price is $595.<P>
The ExperCommon LISP Foreign Function Interface is an add-on component of the complete ExperProfessional Development System. Users can create a new version of the ExperCommon LISP language that contains functions written in any Macintosh Programmer's Workshop language: C, Pascal, or assembly language. Once the new version has been created, the foreign functions can be called from ExperCommon LISP in the same way as any other built-in function. The Foreign Function Interface runs in ExperCommon LISP on the Macintosh Plus and the Macintosh SE and runs on the Macintosh II with ExperCommon LISP II. The price is $295. Reader Service No. 19.<P>

Addison-Wesley has released the Programmer's Online Companion by Steven Capps, a disk-based database reference to Inside Macintosh, Volumes 14, and the Apple Numerics Manual. The companion is a utility program that allows programmers immediate access to bits of information from within any language development system and includes almost all the system calls, system globals, and assembly-language equates found in those volumes. The program controller resides in 5K RAM. The structure assumes a basic knowledge of Pascal or assembly language, Inside Macintosh, and the Macintosh itself. The package includes a 3.5-inch disk and 32 pages of documentation. It runs on the Macintosh 128K, Macintosh 512K, Macintosh 512Ke, and Macintosh Plus and sells for $34.95. Reader Service No. 24.<P>
