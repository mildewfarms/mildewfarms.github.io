&quot;We who have had some degree of involvement with DDJ and People's Computer Company (PCC) modestly think of this publication as the lever which, with the slightest degree of pressure, just might move the world a bit. By serving the high end of the technological spectrum. some of our efforts do find their way by mysterious means into products and services which help people. This happens when one of our readers who sees the true potential of computers. and some piece of software we publish. puts them together in new ways.&quot; Editorial, Marlin Ouverson, Editor, DDJ, December 1982.<P>

&quot;The Xanadu Hypertext System is one of the most powerful systems in existence for managing text in a micro-to-main-frame database environment. It can store arbitrary numbers of documents and retrieve them on demand. It can organize them by using a highly generalized link facility and by allowing (and keeping track of) multiple users on the same system. and allow those users to work with each other on a common document base. It can grow indefinitely over a large distributed network with minimal degradation in performance Roger Gregory, &quot;Xanadu--Hypertext from the Future.&quot; DDJ, January 1983.<P>

&quot;The laws of entropy insure that the line numbers of a debugged and operational BASIC program give the appearance of having been selected by a KENO machine. In fact, while several texts detail how the boundary conditions of a KENO game lead to predictable outcomes. finished programs seldom exhibit this property. Many a time I have spent an extra hour retyping a finished program while spacing the line numbers evenly just to make it look good.&quot; &quot;Renumbering &amp; Appending BASIC Programs on the Apple II Computer.&quot; Steve Wozniak, DDJ, February 1978.<P>
