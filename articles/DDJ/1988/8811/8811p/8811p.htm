Genus has announced the release of the PCX Programmer's Toolkit, which provides documentation and software to create applications that can display, save, capture, and manipulate PCX format images.<P>
The toolkit supports all display modes of the Hercules CGA, EGA, and VGA display adapters. It contains a set of compiler interfaces, including Microsoft C, QuickC, Turbo C, Lattice C, QuickBasic, Turbo Pascal, and Clipper. Libraries are provided that are directly linkable to the user's program, and quick libraries are provided for the Microsoft integrated compilers. The toolkit also includes over 35 routines written in assembly language capable of producing on-screen animation.<P>
In addition to the programming libraries, several utility programs are provided to display and capture screens cut out sections of an image, locate screen coordinates, inspect image headers, and manage image libraries. An images library manager allows images to be grouped together and be directly displayed from the library without extracting first so that necessary images may be grouped with the program.<P>
The price of the PCX Programmer's Toolkit is $89.95, source code is an additional $100. Existing users of the PBUTILS package may upgrade for $35.<P>

Rational Systems has released DOS/16M, Version 2.0, which enables developers working under MS-DOS to create programs that directly address the 16 Mbytes of memory available on 80286 and 80386 PCs.<P>
Rational claims that the DOS/16M, Version 2.0, boasts the reduction of DOS memory overhead to 24K Bytes for tasks running under DOS/16M; more terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) support allowing TSRs of any size to be moved into extended memory and occupy 24K Bytes of DOS memory; support for several additional compilers; support for all currently marketed ATs and PS/2s (model 50 and higher) and compatibles; compatibility with most programs that use extended memory such as Desqview, AutoCad, Ramdrive, and VDisk; and enhanced debugging capabilities.<P>
The product supports the following compilers: Microsoft C 4.0 and 5.0, Microsoft Fortran 4.0, Lattice C 3.10 and 3.20, Aztec C 4.10b, and Metaware's High C and Professional Pascal. Also supported is LinkLoc from Phar Lap Software, which allows programs with more than 1 Mbyte of code to work with DOS/16M.<P>
Rational Systems has also enhanced DOS/16M's protected-mode symbolic debugger. Features that have been added include a built-in performance monitor to assist in analyzing the program's activity by counting DOS and BIOS service requests, interrupts, and CPU time for each function in a program; allowing execution history to be recorded in a disk file; and a new Files command to assist in analyzing file management problems by listing open file handles with the device type and full pathname.<P>
Under Rational Systems' $5,000 initial development license, users receive replacement libraries for supported compilers, a program to convert an .EXE file into an .EXE executable file under protected-mode, the DOS/15M symbolic debugger, and the right to distribute up to 200 copies of one converted, protected-mode program developed using DOS/16M. Source code may be licensed for $10,000. The upgrade to DOS/16M 2.0 is free to all holders of the initial development license.<P>

Intel Corporation has added Iceview to its I2Ice in-circuit emulator. Iceview, a graphical user interface featuring pulldown menus, display windows, and command line prompts, is now included with all standard I2Ice kits.<P>
The Intel Integrated Instrumentation and in-circuit emulation (I2ICE) system supports real-time testing and debugging of systems that use the 8086, 8088, 80186, 80188, and 80286 microprocessors at speeds up to 10 MHz. Among its standard features are source-level symbolic software debugging, software and hardware breakpoints, execution trace, and bus and data trace.<P>
The combination of the two products allows the user to open and maintain windows for immediate access to application source display, execution trace, registers, and other debugging information. Users can view data as it changes at breakpoints or by stepping through their programs.<P>
Iceview is available to registered I2ICE customers as an upgrade through December for $495. Volume pricing is available.<P>
