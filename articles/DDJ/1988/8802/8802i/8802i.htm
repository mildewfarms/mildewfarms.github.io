&quot;One principal difficulty with newly evolving computer technology is that software generation tools generally lag corresponding hardware facilities, thus forcing the software engineer to resort to outmoded techniques to produce software systems.&quot;--Gary A. Kildall, DDJ, February 1983.<P>

&quot;It is often true that along with articles of major import come  listings of considerable length. Dr. Dobb's Journal traditionally  offers useflistings in their entirety, rather than just short  excerpts, as illustrations for an article. Sometimes that means we do  not have enough space to present the usual variety of articles, because  the listings in a particular issue are so voluminous. But we are  banking on the fact that the usefulness of the listings will more than  compensate for those occasional times when the number of articles is fewer than normal.&quot;--Marlin Ouverson, Editor, DDJ, August 1981.<P>

&quot;Partly as a matter of self preservation, we have become interested  in the problem of standards for the Pascal language. The United States  Defense Department and many large industrtal corporations have recently decided to use Pascal as a base language which they would extend, and  possibly alter, to create system implementation languages.... we, and many others in the Pascal User Group, are very much concerned that all this extension and alteration activity will result in Pascal going the  way of BASIC for which hundreds of dialects are in common use. We  believe that a chance still exists to gain consensus on a substantial  family of Pascal extensions for system progranlming, provided that  this can be brought about within the next 6 to 12 months. Unless  someone does so before us, we intend to convene a summer workshop for  representatives of some of the major using organizations in the hope  that such a consensus can be reached.&quot;--Kenneth L Bowles, DDJ, March 1978.<P>
