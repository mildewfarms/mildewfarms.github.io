Software Development Systems has introduced CrossCode C, an optimizing C compiler targeting the Motorola 68000 family. This compiler is designed primarily to address the needs of embedded systems designers. CrossCode C generates ROMable code for all 68000 family members, including the 68020 and 68881 floating point coprocessor.<P>
The compiler comes with a Motorola-style macro assembler, a linker, a librarian, and a C library containing the source to over 47 C functions. Also included is a downloader that communicates with EPROM programmers, emulators, and target hardware.This utility converts user's compiler C code into Motorola S-Records and a variety of other industry standard file formats.<P>
CrossCode C is available for $1,595 under MS-DOS or Xenix, and is available for $4,795 on most Unix-based machines. Reader Service No. 20.<P>

Lattice now offers the C ++ language for Amiga programmers. Lattice C ++ is a preprocessor that translates the C ++ language into C source code which is then compiled by the Lattice AmigaDOS C compiler and linked to create an executable program. A driver similar to the LC driver in the Lattice AmigaDOS C compiler is provided to allow translating, compiling, and linking in one step.<P>
The Lattice C ++ language allows programmers to declare in-line functions for small frequently-called operations. These in-line functions can replace macros and thereby utilize the same semantics as other functions, yet they retain the code size and run-time efficiency of a macro.<P>
Other features of the Lattice C ++ give programmers the ability to declare variables as statements anywhere in the program; it provides a mechanism for expressing commonality among different types by explicitly defining one class to be part of another; it allows a reference, which when initialized, becomes an alternative name for the object it is initialized with; and it provides many other functions designed to improve the C language. The product is priced at $500. Reader Service No. 24.<P>

AIM Technology unveiled its OS/2 Unix Multitasking Benchmark, a program that measures the performance of the new generation of CISC and RISC workstations operating in a multitasking environment. The program evaluates and compares OS/2 system capabilities with similar Unix systems under a wide variety of application mixes.<P>
The OS/2-Unix Multitasking Benchmark enables the following comparisons: OS/2 system to OS/2 system; OS/2 system to Unix system; and Unix system to Unix system. It allows end users to tailor tests for unique environments and measure the amount of computer processing power that can be applied to a specific mix of application software.<P>
The benchmark uses 31 functional tests to evaluate performance under user-defined application mixes as found in office automation, scientific, and engineering environments. The functional tests can also be used to evaluate the performance of subsystems such as disk drives, math coprocessors, and memory. Users can tailor the program by adding functional tests that are integrated into the benchmark. The program can also be run during regular system operation in order to evaluate actual work environments.<P>
The benchmark is designed to run on all OS/2 and Unix implementations. It is distributed in binary format for OS/2 and 80286/80386 Unix machines and in source code for other Unix machines in a variety of media formats. A basic General License Agreement starts at $3,950. Reader Service No. 25.<P>

LynxOS, from Lynx Real-Time Systems, is a real-time operating system fully compatible with Unix. LynxOS was designed to give real-time capabilities to 32-bit microcomputers such as the Motorola 68000 processor family, the Intel 80386, and RISC processors, including SPARC.<P>
LynxOS is fully compatible with Unix, runs existing Unix application software, and provides a familiar software development environment. The program also supports a fully preemptible kernel with minimal interrupt disabling. The highest priority task that is not waiting for resource usage or I/O has the CPU. A task's priority is set by the user and is not changed by LynxOS.<P>
The LynxOS package includes the LynxOS kernel, run-time libraries, device drivers, more than 100 utility programs, and full documentation. Price for a source code license for the initial CPU is $65,000. Reader Service No. 26.<P>

Tools &amp; Techniques has released DataPlex, an intelligent front-end software for complete data handling. The core of the product is a uniform data entry engine that accepts data at optimum levels of speed, accuracy, and ease of use independent of destination. DataPlex employs a human interface coupled to Al techniques such as dynamic data dictionaries and pattern recognition to expedite data entry. The product learns validation rules from the inherent nature of the data, and auto-styles field formats accordingly. if necessary, the user can navigate menu options to override with fixed format attributes. Because the connections from DataPlex to different formats have been engineered as read/write two-way data paths, the product serves as a central conversion hub, or dataplexor, for transferring data between applications.<P>
DataPlex was written in Microsoft C and versions are also available for Xenix-286/386 and Unix V-6800. The price for Version 1.0 is $149, and the price for Version 2.0 is $195. Reader Service No. 30.<P>
