Solution Systems has recently released C-Worthy interface Library for OS/2. C-Worthy allows developers to port their code from MS-DOS to OS/2 and back again.<P>
C-Worthy is a system for creating and managing an entire user interface including on-line help, errors, screen display, and data input. Programmers can use C-Worthy to create interfaces that resemble the Presentation Manager and Lotus 1-2-3 or interfaces that are uniquely suited to a particular application's needs.<P>
C-Worthy contains over 350 functions as well as documentation exceeding 1,000 pages of examples, indexes, and descriptions. The product is compatible with Microsoft C, Version 5.1. Source code is available for both the MS-DOS and OS/2 versions.<P>
C-Worthy Interface Library sells for $195, $295 with the Form Interface Library, and for $495 with Forms and Library Source. The &quot;All Compiler&quot; version (Lattice C, Microsoft C, Quick C, and Turbo C) for MS-DOS can be purchased for $595. Reader Service No. 21.<P>

Lattice Inc. now offers the Lattice C Compiler with features specific for creating programs to run under Digital Research's Concurrent DOS. Containing all the functions of the current Lattice C Compiler, the new C compiler also generates native mode programs which means applications created by the new C compiler will not require PC mode emulation when running under concurrent DOS operating system.<P>
Lattice has also added library functions for file passwords and file sharing, alternative end-of-file treatment, multi-sector I/O, and shared peripherals. Additionally, an option on the compiler can generate code that can be shared to save memory when multiple copies of the program are running simultaneously.<P>
For $500, the compiler comes with libraries for each of the four memory models supported, a disassembler to examine code the compiler generates, header files, examples and sample programs, and complete documentation. Digital Research's linker is also included. Reader Service No. 22.<P>

Oasys has recently announced C2PS, a program which automatically generates PostScript from C programs. The product is targeted at developers of applications for PostScript-based windowing systems like Sun Microsystems' NeWs and Adobe's Display PostScript; those who wish to use preexisting C or C ++ code in a PostScript environment; and anyone who uses PostScript but is more proficient in C.<P>
Once C2PS has been used to generate a PostScript module, that code may be used directly (e.g., sent to a printer to produce a graphic image) or with other PostScript packages to build a complete application. C2PS sells for $2,995. Reader Service No. 23.<P>
