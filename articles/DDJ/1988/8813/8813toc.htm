<h2>ARTICLES</h2>
</p><h3><a href="8813a/8813a.htm">SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ENVIRONMENTS</a></h3><p> by Stowe Boyd<br>
Stowe provides readers with a map of the meandering journey toward a  coherent software engineering environment.  He also presents the strengths  and weaknesses of various languages and environments with respect to their  suitability for large programming projects.
</p><h3><a href="8813b/8813b.htm">SOFTWARE AND THE SINGLE PROGRAMMER</a></h3><p> by T. G. Lewis<br>
Professor Lewis of Oregon State begins with a discussion of several  programming methodologies.  This leads to an examination of OSU (the Oregon Speedcode Universe), an intelligent graphic prototyping system that lets  programmers construct an application WYSIWYG-style</a></h3><p> by showing -- rather than telling -- the computer what to do.
</p><h3><a href="8813c/8813c.htm">USING AN API AS A DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM</a></h3><p> by Jeff Parker<br>
Jeff makes the case that an application specific programming environment  may be just what you need so that you can spend your time on the content,  rather than the form, of your program.
</p><h3><a href="8813d/8813d.htm">EMBEDDED SYSTEMS DESIGN--A SPECIAL CASE?</a></h3><p> by David Kalinsky and James Ready<br>
David and Jim discuss the difficulties of splicing CASE tools together  which unfolds into a charter for the ideal integrated programming  environment that would address the particular problems encountered in  real-time systems development.
</p><h3><a href="8813e/8813e.htm">TACKLING LARGE-SCALE PROGRAMMING PROJECTS</a></h3><p> by W. Courington, J. Feiber, and M. Honda<br>
Three of Sun's technical team members explain how intelligently controlled  distributed computing can bring the unused power of networked workstations  to the local desktop and how this technology is only &quot;a motion away&quot; from  you and your PC.
</p><h3><a href="8813f/8813f.htm">APPLYING WORKSTATION TECHNOLOGY TO CASE</a></h3><p> by David Leblang<br>
David describes how object-oriented programming and distributed computing environments like Apollo's DSEE let users take maximum advantage of the combined graphics, network, and computational power of contemporary workstations.
