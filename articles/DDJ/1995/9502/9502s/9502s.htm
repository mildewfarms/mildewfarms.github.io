<a name="00ec_0041"><a name="00ec_0000">MetaWare's recently released High C/C++ Version 3.3 compiler fully implements C++ exception handling (including nested exceptions), C++ namespaces for compatibility with third-party class libraries, and new-style casting notation. The C++ namespace capabilities let you avoid name clashes with third-party libraries and run-time type information (RTTI). With RTTI and <I>dynamic_cast</I> (new cast notation), you can write applications that perform dynamic, object-specific operations based on an object's size, type, or methods. New style-casting notation provides safer typecasts than the old C notation, and it's versatile and easy to identify in program code.<P>
Version 3.3 also provides OMF common support for templates, virtual function tables, RTTI, and inline functions. A 32-bit source-level debugger is included. <P>
Version 3.3 requires a 386, 486, or Pentium-processor-based PC with a minimum of 8 Mbytes RAM. Fifteen Mbytes of disk space are required for compiler installation. Programs created with High C/C++ can be run in Phar Lap's TNT DOS-Extender SDK run-time environment, or in Windows 3.x 386 Enhanced mode.<P>
In a related announcement, MetaWare announced the availability of Version 3.3 of the SPARC to DOS Cross Compiler. The cross compiler enables applications developed on Sun SPARCstations to be distributed on Intel 386, 486, or Pentium architectures running Windows or DOS.<P>
High C/C++ 3.3 sells for $795.00, while the cross compiler sells for $2895.00. Reader service no. 20.<P>

3Dlabs has begun sampling its GLINT 300SX 3-D processor that, the company claims, enables OpenGL applications running on GLINT-accelerated Pentium PCs to outperform high-priced workstations. The GLINT processor incorporates the equivalent of a high-end workstation graphics-board chip set in a single chip. Target platforms include desktop PCs, workstations, and embedded systems. GLINT is capable of processing 300,000 shaded, depth-buffered, and anti-aliased polygons/second. The chip provides complete 32-bit color; 2-D and 3-D acceleration; and an on-chip, PCI-compliant, localbus interface and integrated LUT-DAC control, making a complete graphics subsystem possible with minimal chip count. GLINT implements all the 3-D rendering operations of OpenGL in silicon, including Gouraud shading, depth buffering, anti-aliasing, and texture mapping. The GLINT 300SX costs $150.00 in volume, with full-volume shipments expected in the first quarter of 1995. Reader service no. 22.<P>

Microsoft has started shipping its Visual C++ Version 2.0 Cross-Development Edition for Macintosh, designed for developers who want to port Windows-based applications to the Macintosh. The development environment is a Windows-hosted/Macintosh-target system. <P>
Visual C++ 2.0 Cross-Development Edition for Macintosh is an add-on to Visual C++ 2.0 running Windows NT on an Intel processor. The toolset includes the Windows Portability Libraries (WPL), an implementation of the Win32 API and architecture for System 7.x that allows MFC and Win32-based applications to run largely unchanged on the Macintosh. These libraries automatically address user-interface differences so the resulting application incorporates a native Macintosh look. Developers can also access System 7.x features to implement Macintosh-system specific features. Visual C++ 2.0 Cross-Development Edition for Macintosh also includes: a version of Microsoft Foundation Classes 3.0 for the Macintosh; high- performance optimizing C/C++ 680x0 cross compiler seamlessly integrated into the Visual C++ development environment; C++ language support for templates and exception handling; C++ debugging support for remote debugging of applications for the Macintosh; new wizard and project-management features tailored to the development of applications for the Macintosh; tools for building Macintosh-specific menu items and dialog boxes; and a porting tool for identifying nonportable constructs in Windows-based applications.<P>
Macintosh apps developed with Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0 Cross-Development Edition for Macintosh can be distributed royalty free. You can license the toolset for approximately $2000.00. Since the tools were actually developed by the Microsoft applications group to port Word and Excel to the Mac, developers of general-purpose word processors and spreadsheets will have to work out special licensing terms with Microsoft.

Dialogic has announced the release of the SCSA Telephony Application Objects (TAO) Framework API Version 3.0, the software portion of the Signal Computing System Architecture. The SCSA APIs provide a hardware- and vendor-independent interface that simplifies development of multitechnology computer-telephony applications and makes developed applications more scalable and portable. Because both locally hosted and remote applications can control the underlying server using the same APIs, they are ideal for client/server environments in which multiple computer-telephony applications can share the same server resources.<P>
SCSA APIs are independent of the underlying hardware platform so that application-software developers no longer need to directly control hardware- and software- technology resources by means of their physical location; their applications can be implemented on top of various hardware platforms. <P>
The SCSA APIs form the top layer of the SCSA TAO Framework, a hardware-independent software architecture that simplifies developing computer-telephony applications. The SCSA TAO Framework consists of: SCSA APIs, a standard set of function calls that allow applications to easily control system resources and server-management functions; SCSA System Services, middleware for controlling various server-management tasks; and SCSA Service Provider Interfaces, a standardized means for communication between the various system providers in an SCSA Server. <P>
A white paper describing the SCSA Telephony Application Objects Framework is also available at no charge from Dialogic. Reader service no. 26.<P>
