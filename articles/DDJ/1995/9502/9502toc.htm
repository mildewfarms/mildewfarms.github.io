<h2>FEATURES </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9502a/9502a.htm">DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND THE OSF/DCE</A></h3><P>
<i>by John Bloomer</i><P>
DCE from the Open Software Foundation is a specification for building distributed-computing systems. John examines the DCE system and API, then presents both  single-process and client/server implementations of an image database.<P>
<h3><a href="9502b/9502b.htm">DISTRIBUTED REAL-TIME OPERATING SYSTEMS</A></h3><P>
<i>by E. Douglas Jensen</i><P>
The emerging class of real-time operating systems are modular, adaptable, and scalable in functionality. And, as Doug describes here, they'll support global, distributed, and cooperative computing across and between levels in the application-control hierarchy. <P>
<h3><a href="9502c/9502c.htm">THE CONDOR DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING SYSTEM</A></h3><P>
<i>by Todd Tannenbaum and Michael Litzkow</i><P>
Condor is a powerful, distributed batch-processing system that lets you use otherwise idle CPU cycles in a cluster of workstations. <P>
<h3><a href="9502d/9502d.htm">EXTENDING C++ FOR DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Patrick Suel</i><P>
Developing groupware requires new programming tools and techniques. Here, Patrick uses the ILOG Server to extend C++ objects for developing dynamic servers.<P>
<h3><a href="9502e/9502e.htm">READING GIF FILES</A></h3><P>
<i>by Wilson MacGyver Liaw</i><P>
The GIF file format has become one of the most popular formats for storing images. Wilson examines the format and presents a program for reading GIF files.<P>
<h3><a href="9502f/9502f.htm">RTFHELP FOR WINDOWS HELP FILES</A></h3><P>
<i>by Joseph Hlavaty</i><P>
With Joe's RTFHelp filter, you aren't limited to nonintuitive commands and RTF-based word processors when generating Windows help files.<P>
<h3><a href="9502g/9502g.htm">IDENTIFYING SERIAL PORT IRQs</A></h3><P>
<i>by John Ridley</i><P>
John presents a program that detects all relevant information about serial ports--how many ports are installed, where they are, and to which IRQ they are set.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9502h/9502h.htm">THE MICROSOFT FLASH FILE SYSTEM</A></h3><P>
<i>by Peter Torelli</i><P>
Peter examines flash file systems for DOS, focusing on the mechanics behind a flash file system based on the Microsoft data structures.<P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9502i/9502i.htm">DESIGNING SERVERS WITH CPI-C</A></h3><P>
<i>by Peter J. Schwaller and John Q. Walker II</i><P>
Since the Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPI-C) provides a consistent set of calls for systems ranging from Windows, OS/2, UNIX, to AS/400, CICS, and MVS, you need deal with only one set of calls to write client/server applications for different systems.  <P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9502j/9502j.htm">BUILDING AN OLE SERVER USING VISUAL C++ 2.0</A></h3><P>
<i>by John LaPlante</i><P>
John uses the recently released Visual C++ 2.0 for building an OLE server that lets you embed a GIF image file into an OLE 2.0-compatible document. <P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9502k/9502k.htm">DEPLOYING DCE AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE</A></h3><P>
<i>by Jack Danahy</i><P>
When Hewlett-Packard's Chelmsford Systems Software Lab decided to implement a distributed infrastructure throughout the organization, they faced barriers ranging from system security and clock synchronization to user skepticism. Jack describes how the Lab overcame both.<P>
<h2>COLUMNS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9502l/9502l.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS </A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Swaine</i><P>
Is the art and science of computer programming old enough to have a history? Michael thinks so, and he begins chronicling it.<P>
<h3><a href="9502m/9502m.htm">C PROGRAMMING </A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens</i><P>
Al continues his static text-search engine project by building a common word list which determines the hierarchical organization of the database. <P>
<h3><a href="9502n/9502n.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY </A></h3><P>
<i>edited by Bruce Schneier</i><P>
Iwan Dobbe presents techniques for generating faster fast Fourier transforms, then implements these approaches in both C and assembler. <P>
<h3><a href="9502o/9502o.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF </A></h3><P>
<i>by Steve Gallagher</i><P>
Steve examines a pair of books that tackle the subjects of object-oriented programming, OS/2, and the SOM/DSOM object models from IBM.<P>
