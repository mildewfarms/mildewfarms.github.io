In what could be a major blow to the development of a truly
interactive Internet, it has been revealed that a pending patent on
executable content currently exists. The patent, held by the
University of California and licensed exclusively to Eolas
Technologies, covers the use of embedded program objects ("applets")
within Web documents. The patent also covers the use of any algorithm
that implements dynamic, bi-directional communications between Web
browsers and external applications. Most leading Web browsers,
including those from Netscape, Spyglass, Microsoft, AOL, Navisoft, and
others, currently support embedded applets. More importantly, Sun's
Java language (and HotJava browser) is based on the concept of
executable content. The technology was developed in 1993 by
Dr. Michael Doyle, a UCSF faculty member and Eolas CEO. The first
"Weblet" application was an interactive 3-D medical visualization used
in conjunction with Mosaic-based Eolas browser.<p>
