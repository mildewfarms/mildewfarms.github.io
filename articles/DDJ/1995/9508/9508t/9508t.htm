VisualFlow, from Momentum Software, is an object-oriented, visual application-development tool for designing and managing information between heterogeneous, distributed systems. Using point-and-click techniques, developers can integrate systems by selecting objects from an object catalog, then configuring and linking them. Additionally, VisualFlow objects can perform mapping functions (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one) to bridge data from one application or database to another. Data can then be translated, filtered, rearranged, and merged. VisualFlow supports objects that interface to APIs, including SQL, RPC, IPCs, files, screens, and message-oriented middleware (MOM). VisualFlow, which sells for $4500.00, runs on OSF/Motif and X Window System platforms.<P>

Micro Focus has announced the BridgeWare family of development and run-time tools to provide seamless access from GUI development environments such as PowerBuilder and Visual Basic to Micro Focus Cobol and CICS applications. The BridgeWare family includes Micro Focus DeskTop BridgeWare (PowerBridge and VisualBridge) and the Micro Focus BridgeWare Server Enabling Kit. BridgeWare generates external function calls, including all 4GL presentation logic, from existing legacy and newly developed Cobol source without requiring you to reengineer or rewrite the program interface. <P>
DeskTop BridgeWare is a Windows-based, client/server code-construction middleware toolset that generates API requests in the form of 4GL script-language external function calls. BridgeWare generates all 4GL script necessary to provide access to Cobol from GUI 4GL applications in a single, nonprocedural (point-and-click) process. Desktop BridgeWare apps can be deployed as single user or as Windows clients on any 4GL-Cobol supported platform across the enterprise without requiring additional run-time license fees. You can also create Cobol-Windows DLLs through a GUI Administration System that allows you to customize Cobol-Windows executables and organize the Cobol and CICS components. A GUI compile and link facility generates Windows DLLs in a simple point-and-click process.<P>
The BridgeWare Server Enabling Kit lets you connect PowerBuilder and Visual Basic client applications to networked Cobol application servers and offload CPU-intensive processing in a true scalable, distributed-processing environment. The BridgeWare Server Enabling Kit requires DeskTop BridgeWare and the Micro Focus Transaction System, a multiuser, multitasking, multiplatform online transaction- processing system for designing distributed client/server systems. <P>
Desktop BridgeWare sells for $399.00 per programmer, with the Micro Focus Server Enabling Kit for $500.00 per server.<P>
