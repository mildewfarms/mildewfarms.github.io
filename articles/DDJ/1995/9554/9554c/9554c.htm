<h2> Do Books Have a Future?</h2>
<h3><i>by George Gurley </i></h3>
<p>

  The sign on the Information Superhighway says, ``Slow traffic
keep right.'' I see and obey. I wouldn't know about life in the fast
lane. I'm plodding along on the path for ox-drawn carts with an
old-fashioned book in my hands, watching the info-joy riders pass me by. <p>

  To me, they're forlorn pilgrims searching for trinkets in a
landfill. To them, I'm a dodo bird gathering dust in the basement of a
museum. <p>

  1994 was officially proclaimed the year of ``The End of the
Book.'' That's the ominous title of an essay in The Atlantic Monthly
(September 1994), by D.T. Max. We're undergoing a revolution, a return
to the oral tradition and a book-free society, according to Max.
Information will ``explode.'' <p>

  Cybervisionaries crow about innovations like hypertext which
give the reader, ``the choice of whether Alice goes down the hole or
decides to stick around and read alongside her sister on the riverbank.'' <p>

  The coming revolution, according to one prophet, ``makes political
revolution seem like a game.'' It will change how people work, communicate,
entertain themselves. ``It is the biggest engine for change in the world
today.''  <p>

  In this brave new world, everyone becomes an author, everyone a
cinematographer with video camera in hand, recording every half-baked
thought and pothole in the road. We will organize ourselves into new
types of communities and societies. We will develop new worlds and
values. <p>

  In his article ``Society's Subcultures Meet by Modem'' in The
Wall Street Journal (December 8, 1994), Scott McCartney tells how
teenagers find it easier to communicate on the Internet, the global
computer highway, than talk to their peers directly. Notes left on
hallway lockers are ``snail mail.'' Anonymous electronic communication
helps them come out of their adolescent shells, express their true
selves, even build self-esteem. <p>

  The communications explosion is heralded as the ultimate
democracy. It has toppled totalitarian regimes and has been a boon to
freedom. George Orwell was wrong, according to Joan E. Rigdon in another
Wall Street Journal article (December 8, 1994). Big Brother is not
in control. <p>

   But democracy presupposes literacy. Can television junkies and
Internet addicts follow an argument, spot inconsistencies and bunk?
Our political debate has degenerated into mindless slogans, and
illiterates are easily suckered. A return to the ``oral tradition''
sounds like cave-people enchanted by shamans. What good is instant
access to information if you don't know how to interpret and transform
it? How can we sift through an explosion of information to find the
messages worth reading? <p>

  According to multimedia cheerleaders, books are handicapped
because they can't make you literally see and hear. But making you see
and hear is precisely what's wrong with contemporary entertainments.
They do the work of the imagination, depriving us of life's most
rewarding labor. <p>

  Great books are the work of geniuses. One of the miracles and
privileges of existence is the opportunity to become familiar with them.
Reading is the ultimate interactive pastime. <p>

  In The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in the Electronic
Age (Faber and Faber, 1994), critic Sven Birkerts argues that new
technologies supplanting the printed work threaten the core premises of
humanism. <p>

  In A is for Ox (Pantheon), Barry Sanders connects illiteracy and
addiction to electronic images with the growing violence of our youth.
Reading is essential for the development of self, according to him. <p>

  ``My generation may be the lastto have a strong visceral affection
for books,'' said a publishing industry spokesperson quoted by Max. <p>

  Novelist John Calvin Batchelor attended a symposium of America's
literary-intellectual elite sponsored by the New York Review of Books and
reported that virtually no one other than the featured speakers showed
up. <p>

  ``If you write badly enough, you'll have an audience,'' sniffed
William Gass. ``If you write well enough, you'll have readers.'' <p>

  Sign in our office: ``One civilized reader is worth a thousand
boneheads.'' Newspaper writers worry that they're an endangered species,
too. <p>

  But if masses aren't reading, why is the $18 billion book-publishing
industry going great guns? Nearly 50,000 titles were published last
year. Someone apparently believes there's a market, even for The
Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus and The Guide to Bodily Fluids, with
chapters on mucus, saliva, sweat. <p>

  One cyberprophet predicts that the coming revolution is going
to be like a ``communication cocktail party.'' Exactly. We're
creating a forum for incoherent babble, the kind produced by boring
drunks. <p>
