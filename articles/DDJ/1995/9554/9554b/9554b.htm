<h1>1994 U.S. Software Patent Statistics</h1>
<h3><i>by  Gregory Aharonian </i></h3>
<p><p>

   The Internet Patent News Service has completed its analysis of
U.S. software patents issued in 1994. The final total was 4569, pushing
the total number of software patents issued since 1970 to over 15,000.
As the following list shows, hot topics for software patenting
include object-oriented programming, interactive television,
networking, health care, and automobiles. The year's software patents
were issued in the following categories (some patents were counted
in more than one category): <p>

  The flood continues in 1995, with an all-time high of 125 software
patents issued in the first week of January. My prediction is that 5500
software patents will be granted in 1995, giving a two-year total of
10,000 software patents --- and this in an industry where the last
original software idea was published ten years ago. <p>

  Unfortunately, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is making
little progress on the complex problem of software prior art. The
average number of nonpatent prior-art items cited in U.S. software
patents rose from 1.8 to 2.0 items per patent in 1994; still a tiny
fraction of the 50 or more nonpatent prior-art items per patent that an
experienced prior-art researcher can locate. Analysis of the 1994 software
patents using the largest software prior-art database in the country
(maintained by Source Translation & Optimization, publisher of the
Internet Patent News Service) shows that over 70 percent of the 1994
software patents should have had one or more of their claims disallowed
on prior-art grounds. As such, expect more and more software
infringement lawsuits in the years to come. <p>

  To illustrate, I have selected two of the worst software patents
recently issued. The claims and abstracts are reflective of the patent
as a whole. They also typify the large group of software patents
issued that cite, on the average, two nonpatent prior-art references
where two dozen should be cited. <p>

  Source Translation & Optimization has just released a report
detailing over a dozen statistical views of the problems of prior art
for U.S. software patents. The report, titled ``Demographics of US
Software Patents: Foundation for Software Prior Art Planning,'' is
available from STO, P.O. Box 404, Belmont, MA 02178, for $100.00. <p>

  Patent #5,365,473 <p>

 <dl><dt>Integral value calculating device and function gradient calculating device.<p>

  <dd>Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan <p>

 <dd> Filing date: November 27, 1992 <p>

  <dd>6 prior patent references <p>

  <dd>0 prior non-patent references <p>

  <dd>PTO group 2360 <p>
</DL>
What is claimed: <p>

  1. An integral value calculating device for calculating an
integral value of a function, comprising: <p>

<UL>
  

<LI>a computer, comprising:<P>


<LI> graph display means for outputting a graph for a function according
to received data;<P>


<LI>  calculation range input means, communicating with said graph
display means, for designating an integral range for said function
according to position data externally designated for said graph, and;<P>
 

<LI> integral value calculating means, communicating with said
calculation range input means, for calculating the integral value of
said function for said designated integral range, and;<P>
 

<LI>  an external unit connected to said computer and receiving the
graph and the integral range. <p>
</UL>

  Abstract: An integral value calculating device is used for
calculating an integral value of a function, and a function gradient
calculating device is used for calculating the gradient of the graph for
a function. The object is to obtain a transport coefficient, etc.
by designating an appropriate calculation range in analyzing the
data output by a molecular dynamics simulator. In the integral value
calculating device, a graph display unit outputs a graph according to
received data, for example, a graph of a time correlation function F(t)
of the time differential W'(t) to the dynamics volume W(T), in the
format applicable to an external unit, for example, a display unit. A
calculation range input unit designates an integral range for the function
according to the position data externally input for the graph. An integral
value calculating unit calculates an integral value for a function
F(t), for example, for the designated integral range. In the function
gradient calculating device, two points on a graph in which the gradient
should be calculated are designated according to the position data
input for a graph displayed on the display unit, for example. Then, a
function gradient calculating unit calculates the gradient of the
graph. <p>

  In this patent, filed in 1992, the first claim basically describes
dozens of commercially available mathematical-analysis programs
released in the 1980s --- MathCad, Macsyma, MathLab, Gauss, IMSL, and
others --- programs that display an equation on the screen, allow the
user to choose two endpoints, and then perform an integration and
display the results. Engineering journals have published thousands
of papers over the past 20 years that directly relate to this claim.
For example, the papers ``Computer Graphics Assisted Numerical
Analysis Instruction'' (Computers & Graphics, 1976) and ``Interactive
Computing and Graphics in the Interpretation of Geomagnetic Spectra''
(Physics of Earth and Planetary Interiors, 1976) relate to the first
claim, and its use for physics data analysis. The technique described
in this patent is also described in several journals on numerical
analysis, several physics journals dealing with quantum chemistry and
molecular dynamics, numerous books (including Numerical Recipes, which
the PTO has cited in a few other patents), and conference proceedings. <p>

  Still, neither Fujitsu, one of the largest computer companies
in the world, nor the PTO cited any of these materials as prior art,
and probably did not even bother to look. This first claim is too
obvious: It basically patents graphical numeric integration. Even if
the rest of the claims and specification restrict its scope to
molecular dynamics simulation, there is still prior art (see Computer
Physics Communications, or the QCPE library). <p>

  Patent #5,374,996 <p>

  <dl><dt>Image Processing System <p>

  <dd>Matsushita Electric Industrial, Osaka, Japan <p>

  <dd>Filing date: June 26, 1991 (in Japan) <p>

  <dd>12 prior patent references <p>

  <dd>0 prior non-patent references <p>

 <dd> PTO group 2170 <p>
</DL>
  What is claimed: <p>

  1. An image-processing system, comprising: <p>

 <UL>
<LI> reading means for outputting multi-level image data corresponding
to a density of each of pixels, to which an image of a draft is
partitioned; <p>

<LI>  sampling means for obtaining density data by sampling the image
data output from the reading means at a predetermined rate of the
number of the pixels, which correspond to image data to be sampled, to
that of all of the pixels; <p>

<LI>  storing means for storing the density data obtained by the
sampling means; <p>

<LI>  image processing means for performing a processing on the image
data output from the reading means; <p>

<LI>  displaying means for displaying an image represented by data
obtained as a result of the processing by the image processing means; <p>

<LI>  indicating means for indicating a position in the image displayed
by the displaying means; and <p>
</UL>
  control means for reading the density data corresponding to the
position indicated by the indicating means from the storing means and
making the displaying means display the read density data. <p>

  Abstract: An image processing system for reading multi-level
image data corresponding to each pixel of an input image from a
multi-tone-level draft image such as a photograph and correcting a density
level at each of the pixels, which is represented by the obtained image
data, and outputting data representing corrected density levels. The
image-processing system first performs an appropriate sampling of the read
image data of the pixels at a sampling rate in such a manner to enable
reference to the density levels at the pixels when correcting the density
levels. The sampling rate is most appropriately predetermined. <p>

  The first claim in this patent includes nearly every image-processing
system described since the 1970s, including the 1000+ image-processing
patents and 5000+ image-processing journal articles and technical
reports. Citing just 12 prior patents and no nonpatent prior-art
references --- given the broad, obvious structure of claim 1 --- is a
mistake. Maybe somewhere in the dependent claims there is something
novel, but if so, it should be brought up into the independent claim.
The PTO should have a blanket policy of rejecting every new
image-processing patent it gets --- there is just nothing left to invent
(applications included) that hasn't been previously published. <p>
