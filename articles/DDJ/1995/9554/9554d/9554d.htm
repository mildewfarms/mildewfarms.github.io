   The Electronic Frontier Foundation is backing a federal lawsuit
seeking to bar the government from restricting publication of
cryptographic documents and software. The plaintiff in the suit, Daniel
J. Bernstein, has developed, and wishes to publish, an encryption
algorithm, along with a program that implements the algorithm. The
lawsuit challenges the export-control scheme as an ``impermissible
prior restraint on speech, in violation of the First Amendment.'' <p><P>


  Apple was let off the hook in a Minnesota lawsuit, although IBM
wasn't. District Judge Richard Spicer has allowed damages to be
considered by a jury if IBM is found liable for damages related to
repetitive-stress injuries caused by computer keyboards. Spicer said
``sufficient'' evidence exists that IBM should have warned users about a
possible link between keyboard use and repetitive-stress injuries.
Apple got off because it released an alternative keyboard designed
to reduce injuries. <p>
