<H1>Performance Comparison: Sun SPARCstation 5 versus Intel Pentium
90</H1>

<H3><i>by Thomas W. Barlock and David S. Lindsay</i></H3><p>

Is a workstation faster than a high-end PC of similar price? There are
varying claims by different manufacturers. We decided to find out by
comparing an entry-level workstation and reasonably high-end PC. For
the entry-level workstation, we chose the Sun SPARCstation 5 with a
70-MHz clock and 32 MB of memory, which cost $5664. For the PC, we
selected a Pentium-based system with an internal 90-MHz clock and a
frequency divider that reduced the external clock speed to 60 MHz. It
had 32 MB of memory and cost $3989. To supplement the original
hard-disk drives, we installed 4-GB Seagate drives in both machines.
The database, user's home directories, and data files used for the
tests resided solely on the Seagate drives.<p>

We tried to use the same operating system (Solaris 2.4) on both
machines, but, of course, some variations had to occur since the chips
execute different instruction sets.<p>

We configured each machine with 32 MB of memory - enough to run most
of our tests with up to 32 simulated users. Because of time
considerations, we ran most of the tests using only 1, 4, 8, 12, 16,
20, 24, 28, and 32 users.<p>

We used the Neal Nelson Remote Terminal Emulator (RTE) to generate the
commands and to measure the response times. For each test, the RTE
started all the users simultaneously, emulated the desired number of
users, and measured all the response times.<p>

To compare these two machines (see Figure 1), we ran several tests
using the following real-world software:<p>

<p>
<DL>
	<DD> Informix database.
	<DD> Oleo spreadsheet.
	<DD> Software-development commands.
        <DD> SPSS statistical analysis.
	<DD> Frequently used UNIX system commands.
	<DD> WordPerfect word processor.
</DL>
<p>

While this selection should allow you to pick and choose the tests
that most closely approximate your situation, in this article, we'll
focus on the results of tests that use software-development
commands. For results from the other tests, please contact us.<p>

The test suites were conducted "categorically," which means two
things: Every user executes the same RTE script, and every user
simultaneously executes the same instruction. Solaris's default kernel
configuration was used on both machines.<p>

In the software-development-command portion of the tests, the scripts
edited a C program containing 11,229 lines and 333,146 bytes, used the
stream editor and program checker, looked at the space and files on a
directory structure with 3016 files in 64 directories, and converted,
compressed and compared files containing 8000 lines and 400 KB of
data.<p>

<H3>Results</H3>

Each measurement category had hundreds of individual tests. All
together, we had almost 2000 timings for the SPARC 5 and the same
number for the Pentium. To determine the relative performance of these
machines, we needed the ratio <i>(Time on the SPARC 5)/(Time on the
Pentium)</i>. Since performance is inversely proportional to time,
this ratio represents the performance of the Pentium relative to the
SPARC 5. But we didn't have one ratio, we had thousands.<p>

To analyze the data points, we could have taken the average, but the
average doesn't tell the whole story, and can be very misleading. We
decided to analyze each measurement category separately. We plotted
all the associated performance ratios in ascending order and
immediately uncovered invalid data points.<p>

One problem was that the RTE measured the response times using "clock
ticks" set to four per second for many of the tests. Very short
measurements - say, half a second - were therefore imprecise.  So we
eliminated any test where the result measured less than one second.<p>
But there were other invalid data points. For example, while a
database runs, the database manager occasionally writes its log
file. The user usually has no control over logging, and if it happens
during a performance test, that test is invalid. Similar problems may
occur with other applications. We therefore eliminated the best and
worst 5 percent of the remaining data from each category. Still, one
category showed a few badly skewed performance ratios. For that
category, we eliminated the best and worst 10 percent of the data.<p>

Figure 2 is a graph of the performance ratios for the
software-development-commands category, with outlying data
deleted. The vertical axis of the graph is the performance ratio; the
horizontal axis shows the test number. Table 1 presents the ten
highest and lowest performance ratios we graphed for the
software-development category. The table contains brief descriptions
of each test.<p>

Figure 2 presents the performance ratios less the fastest and slowest
5 percent. Here the Pentium was never slower than the SPARC 5. Table 1
indicates that the Pentium was worse than the SPARC 5 on simple
commands and better on more-complex commands, particularly
<i>sort</i>.<p>

<H3>Conclusions</H3>

Some of the tests in which the Pentium performed best and worst
(compared with the SPARC) suggested that the Pentium was best at
complex computation, and the SPARC 5 might have an advantage on simple
operations that include I/O.  There's no real surprise here - it is
well known that architectures such as the Pentium are stronger in
integer operations than in floating point, and that the opposite is
true for the SPARCstation.<p>
