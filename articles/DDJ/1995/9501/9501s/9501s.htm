<a name="0073_0021"><a name="0073_0000">ISDN*tek has released the CyberSpace Internet Card, an ISDN-compatible, half-size plug-in card that enables high-speed data transfers for ISDN users between for Windows- or OS/2-based PCs and the Internet or other UNIX hosts. Running six times faster than modems, the CyberSpace Internet Card allows connection to the Internet using compatible TCP/IP software to support Mosaic, Gopher, and other applications. <P>
The card can also be used for high-speed data transfers directly between ISDN users or sites which have HDLC and synchronous PPP hardware and software. The CyberSpace Card supports all Basic Rate ISDN in the U.S. and automatically configures itself for AT&amp;T 5ESS, Northern Telecom DMS, and National ISDN-1 standards. It offers a 56/64 data call on either B-channel and is supplied with interface drivers for any WinISDN compatible TCP/IP software. The card comes with a Windows DLL driver that implements the WinISDN API, a public interface by ISDN*tek and NetManage, and Performance System International that uses 18 calls to provide ISDN-specific data services between the hardware and software.<P>
The CyberSpace Internet Card sells for $395.00. Reader service no. 20.<P>

Microware has announced that its OS-9 real-time operating system is available for the PowerPC platform. Additionally, the company has ported FasTrak, an integrated C cross-development environment for UNIX and Windows (based on the Microware Ultra C compiler), and DAVID (digital audio/video interactive decoder) to the PowerPC.<P>
To ensure deterministic, real-time response, OS-9 for PowerPC takes advantage of the PowerPC's visual caching mechanism, which enables developers to lock time-critical sections of code in the cache. Likewise, the FasTrak debugger has also been optimized for the PowerPC by making use of the processor's watchpoint registers.<P>
The developer's package consists of various file managers ranging from ISP and NFS to ISDN and MPEG, as well as the development environment and drop-in board; it sells for $7500.00. Reader service no. 21.<P>

Texas Instruments has released the TMS320C44, a floating-point DSP chip targeted for multiprocessor telecommunication systems. Although based on the TI C40 processor, the C44 differs in that it has a reduced pin count, lower-cost packaging, reduced power requirements, and power management. Because it is software compatible with the C40, all existing C40-based software tools can be used for system development. The C44 is available in 40/50/60-MHz versions, starting at $130.00 each in quantities of 1000. Reader service no. 26.<P>

Object Bridge, middleware technology that provides interoperability for object-based systems, has been announced by Visual Edge. The Object Bridge SDK is a C++ class library that initially supports Microsoft's COM and OLE Automation, Iona's Orbix, and IBM's SOM/DSOM. Central to the Object Bridge technology is a class registry to which the features of each object system are described. Added to the class registry are Object System Adapters (OSAs) that describe each support object system. These OSAs can be purchased and dynamically added to Object Bridge as required. <P>
The Object Bridge SDK lets you write C++ for a target-object model, then access objects from other systems using familiar native mechanisms (such as COM's IClassFactory). Reader service no. 28.<P>

Wireless Connect has announced its CDPD Starter Kit and CDPD SDK. The CDPD Starter Kit includes source code for Windows, UNIX, Macintosh, and DOS; two wireless modems and airtime. The CDPD SDK is a full set of tools and libraries--including built-in encryption, compression, and modem independence--that lets developers build Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) applications. CDPD is similar to packet radio networks in that data is moved in small packets that can be checked for errors and retransmitted. However, CDPD does this in the current cellular voice network using a technique known as &quot;channel hopping&quot; to locate idle voice channels and weave data packets into them.
