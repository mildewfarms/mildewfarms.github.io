<a name="013c_0060"><a name="013c_0000">DataFocus has announced the availability of the X/Software SDK (X/SDK), the second product in its Nutcracker line of porting tools. While the original Nutcracker SDK supports the porting of character-mode UNIX applications written in C or C++ to Win32, the X/SDK allows you to port X and Motif applications to Windows NT. The X/SDK packages an X Server, UNIX tools, and a set of APIs within Windows DLLs. Once system dependencies such as pathnames, user IDs, or illegal C++ keywords have been resolved, you can recompile the source code and link in the X/SDK DLLs. Because a Nutcracker application is native to Windows, it can be debugged with tools such as WINDBG. The DLLs include the ANSI C run time and provide support for interprocess communication, file I/O, curses, and memory management, as well as X and Motif APIs, including xlib and the xt toolkit.<P>
Nutcracker bundles in the MKS Toolkit to provide common UNIX tools including awk, vi, touch, and so on. The X/SDK retails for $2995.00. Reader service no. 20.<P>

MainSoft has announced an upgrade to MainWin, its UNIX library that makes the Windows API available to applications running under Motif. With this tool, Windows applications can run natively under UNIX. The new release includes support for 32-bit Windows NT; both 16- and 32-bit code is supported from a single shared library, thus allowing Windows 3.1 and Windows NT code to execute simultaneously; and MainWin now supports Microsoft's Dynamic Data Exchange Management Library (DDEML). <P>
Developers wishing to write MainWin applications will need to purchase the MainWin Cross-Development Kit (CDK). The CDK allows developers to target both Windows and X Windows from a single source-code base using standard Windows API calls. The CDK includes a workstation copy of MainWin; a Windows-compliant API; support for the Microsoft Foundation Class library; the ability for end users to select either a Windows or Motif look-and-feel; and a common file format that allows data to be shared between UNIX and Windows applications. MainWin 1.1 retails for $199.00. The CDK sells for $5000.00 for a single copy with price reductions for subsequent copies. Reader service no. 21.<P>

ViewSoft is shipping Version 1.1 of its C/C++ GUI development environment, Utah for Windows. Like many such products, Utah begins with an interface builder that generates C++ code. Unique to the product, however, is its Editable Object System (EOS), a C++ class library with platform-independent extensions that provide reflection (self-describing objects) and dynamic binding. Programmer-defined objects can inherit the same functionality by deriving from base EOS objects. The only platforms currently supported are Windows and Windows NT. However, the company indicates that OS/2, Macintosh, and Motif versions are under development. In fact, Utah already provides mappings between EOS's self-describing object structure and IBM's System Object Model (SOM).<P>
Other features of the product include ViewSoft's Semantic Interface Technology which uses &quot;smart components,&quot; developed to eliminate GUI dependencies; support for OLE; and the ability to both create and use VBXs. Utah retails for $1495.00. Reader service no. 23.<P>

WinRez is a library of C functions that simulates Macintosh resource-handling and memory-management routines under Windows. Mac resource files are converted by renaming existing API calls to WinRez function calls and using the supplied resource fork conversion utility to convert resources, which can then be accessed by any Windows application. The product is supplied in both .DLL and .LIB file formats. C libraries support Windows 3.1, Win32s, Windows NT, and OS/2. The company claims that WinRez has minimal overhead requirements, adding less than 64 Kbytes and using minimal stack space when linking in the .LIB  version. A &quot;no-nonsense&quot; license agreement lets you distribute the .DLL with applications, provided that the app doesn't allow end users to directly modify or edit resources. WinRez retails for $349.00. Reader service no. 24.<P>

Coming out of Intel's Embedded Processor Division is the PCI I/O Software Development Kit (PCI-SDK), which is based on the i960 embedded RISC processor. The kit bundles a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus I/O add-in card with interchangeable i960 processor modules; PLX technologies PCI 9060, eliminating the need to write proprietary ASIC, FPGA, or PAL components; and an 80960-to-PCI bus bridge chip for the i960. Also available are user-selectable I/O modules from Cyclone Microsystems, including SCSI-2, SCSI-3, Ethernet, and a high-speed serial I/O module. <P>
The SDK also provides programmer tools, including a C compiler, profiler, and debugger. Intel hopes that developers creating software for intelligent I/O cards will take advantage of the increased bandwidth, throughput, and concurrency that the PCI bus offers. For more information and pricing on the SDK, contact Intel at 800-628-8686, or request packet #272612 from the Intel Literature Center at 800-548-4725; for information regarding the bridge chips, contact PLX Technologies at 415-960-0448; for information on the customized I/O modules, contact Cyclone Systems at 203-786-5536.
