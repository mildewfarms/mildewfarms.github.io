Richard summarizes common techniques for interprocess communication, presenting a library that implements semaphores in a platform-independent manner to allow signaling or controlling of shared resources between processes and threads. <P>
<h3><a href="9503c/9503c.htm">A PORTABLE FONT SPECIFICATION</A></h3><P>
<i>by Ronald G. White and John Biard</i><P>
When it comes to portability, fonts present a variety of problems. Our authors share an approach to flexible cross-platform fonts that doesn't require additional coding when moving from platform to platform.<P>
<h3><a href="9503d/9503d.htm">CROSS-PLATFORM DATABASE PROGRAMMING</A></h3><P>
<i>by William Fairman and Randal Hoff</i><P>
If you want to write software that's portable on platforms from supercomputers to embedded systems, you'll want to use the programming techniques presented here. <P>
<h3><a href="9503e/9503e.htm">THE BMP FILE FORMAT, PART 1</A></h3><P>
<i>by David Charlap</i><P>
In the first installment of this two-part article, David examines how the &quot;standard&quot; BMP file format has been implemented differently on different platforms.<P>

In a popular <I>Microsoft Systems Journal</I> article, &quot;Building Component Software with Visual C++ and the OLE Custom Control Developer's Kit,&quot; Eric Lang described how to create an OLE Custom Control using Visual C++, MFC, and the CDK. Here, our authors do the same thing using OpenDoc for OS/2. <P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9503g/9503g.htm">SIMULATION COMPILATION AND PORTABILITY</A></h3><P>
<i>by Marc E. Hoffman</i><P>
Simulation compilation is a technique that lets you compile a simulation, then run an executable representing the original code instead of simulating the code directly.<P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9503h/9503h.htm">CONGESTION CONTROL IN FRAME-RELAY NETWORKS</A></h3><P>
<i>by William Stallings</i><P>
Frame relay is a standardized service that functions as a public wide area network backbone connecting individual local area networks. As William points out, however, the standard does not specify what you're supposed to do when it comes to flow and error control.<P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9503i/9503i.htm">EXAMINING THE POWERBASIC DEVELOPER KIT</A></h3><P>
<i>by Raymond J. Schneider</i><P>
Ray uses the PowerBASIC Developer Kit to write a Windows application for vocabulary-frequency analysis. <P>

<h3><a href="9503j/9503j.htm">BUILDING DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS WITH GALAXY</A></h3><P>
<i>by Stan Dolberg</i><P>
Galaxy 2.0, a cross-platform toolset for building complex distributed applications, lets you write applications that can communicate with other Galaxy applications running on any platform. <P>
<h2>COLUMNS </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9503k/9503k.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Swaine</i><P>
Say what you want, but there's nothing ambiguous about what Michael has to say this month, as he rambles from the Industrial Revolution to Apple's Newton Toolkit.<P>
<h3><a href="9503l/9503l.htm">C PROGRAMMING</A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens</i><P>
Al chats with Alexander Stepanov, the creator of the Standard Template Library, which ANSI/ISO has approved as a part of Standard C++.<P>
<h3><a href="9503m/9503m.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY</A></h3><P>
<i>edited by Bruce Schneier</i><P>
Micha Hofri looks at the analysis of algorithms--specifically at techniques where you can throw extra memory at a problem in order to increase performance, or sacrifice performance in order to decrease memory requirements. <P>
<h3><a href="9503n/9503n.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF</A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens</i><P>
Adrian King's <I>Inside Windows 95</I>, the first book out on Microsoft's next operating system, is notable on one level because it was published months before Windows 95 is due for release.<P>
