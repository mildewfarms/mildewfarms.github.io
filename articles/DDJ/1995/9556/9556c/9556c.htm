<h3>Hey, Didn't You Used to Be Nintendo... </h3>

<P>With all the hoopla over interactive video, WinG, the Windows 
95 Game SDK, MUDs, VRML, and the like, we tend to forget about game- 
pioneers Nintendo and Sega. Since it's launching in November, 1994, 
Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country game has sold 7.4 million copies, helping 
Nintendo to gain a 54 percent market share in the 16-bit game world. 
Sega, meanwhile, slipped from 60 percent in February, 1994 to 47 
percent in February 1995. </p>

<h3>What's Next for Objective-C? </h3>

<P>Rights to the Objective-C programming language have been acquired 
by NeXT Computer. Originally developed by Stepstone, Objective-C 
is a C-based object-oriented language. Stepstone will continue to 
market its implementation. In addition to continuing support of 
Objective-C in its NextStep development environment, NeXT will submit the 
language to standards bodies, including ANSI.</p>

<h3>Saved at the Bell </h3>

<P>The once highflying but recently struggling Wang Laboratories 
has been given new life by a $90 million infusion from Microsoft. 
Precipating the investment was 1993 suit by Wang claiming patent ownership 
of OLE technology. With the settlement, Microsoft gets a 10 percent 
stake in Wang, along with access to Wang's document imaging and 
work-flow management technology for inclusion in Windows-related 
software. </p>
