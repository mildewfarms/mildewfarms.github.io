<h1>The Ninth Game Developer's Conference</h1>
<H3><i>John Dorsey</i></H3>
<hr>

  Reflecting an increasing interest in interactivity and multimedia, 
this year's Ninth Computer Game Developer's Conference (CGDC) was a 
sellout, with 2,400 attendees (up 50 percent over last year) viewing 
demos from more than 65 hardware and software vendors. The conference's 
lectures and roundtables focused on traditional, entertainment games 
(the kind usually involving polygon counts and ammo levels), as well 
as educational and interactive entertainment software development. 
 <p>

       Technical lecture topics included gaming on networks and the 
Internet, virtual reality, 3-D modeling, and emerging audio standards. 
Also covered were nontechnical industry concerns-- legal problems, 
content acquisition, gender roles and violence, the industry's 
relationship with Hollywood, and the like. <p>

       Rob Glidden, president of Soft Press, gave his predictions 
for real-time 3-D on the PC. Far from merely a gaming concern, Glidden 
stated that over the next three years, real-time 3-D will become an 
essential PC standard--the "ultimate intuitive interface." He noted 
that while some people define reality as 10 million polygons-per-second, 
he believes "reality is a volumetric rendering algorithm." Driving 
the push toward real-time 3-D is heavy investment in 3-D graphics, 
including Intel's 3DR API and Microsoft's Reality Labs acquisition, 
and technology such as the virtual reality markup language (VRML). 
Developments by graphics- chip and board makers, such as Brooktree, 
Synema, ATI, and Matrox will further enable real-time 3-D. However, 
Glidden says, one impediment to real-time 3-D may be patents that could 
hamper standards. <p>

       The Internet as a developer's resource was the topic of a 
lecture given by Phillip King. Other Net-related talks included Frederic 
Vincent Bien, of Bien Logic, discussing Intelligent Tutors and the 
Internet, and an overview of MUDs, by Dr. Cat. <p>

       DDJ contributing editor Michael Abrash discussed the 3-D 
Device Driver Interface (3-D DDI) as a 3-D hardware acceleration 
standard. 3-D DDI is Microsoft's Windows device driver between 3- D APIs 
and hardware. Abrash assured programmers that standards conflicts 
will keep them employed for the next five years. <p>

       Any game conference worth its salt has a few DOOM demos for 
attendees to perfect their shotgun aim. Echo Speech added a new wrinkle 
to the DOOM experience by providing multiplayer voice communications. 
Their Simultaneous Voice and Gaming (SVG) technology uses a DSP audio 
card and EchoSpeech compression to achieve a compression ratio of 
18:1. SVG mixes in good-quality speech (8 or 16 bit at 11 KHz) with the 
game data before sending it over modems and networks. SVG's computational 
efficiency, which allows it to be used on a 386-class PCs, offers a new 
level of interaction for networked games and potentially other 
applications <p>

       A major problem with 3-D, stereographic software is the eye 
and neck strain caused by clumsy display hardware. To that end, 
Virtual i-O was showing off their solution: Virtual i-glasses, a 
head-mounted 3-D display with stereo headphones weighing in at just eight 
ounces. The Virtual i-glasses were endorsed by VRML pioneer Mark Pesce 
who is quoted in Virtual i-O's promotional brochure as saying, "Their 
comfort, ease of use, and ergonomic features make them by far the most 
impressive and safest virtual displays yet developed." The i-glasses 
could be used in lieu of a monitor with any 2-D application and they 
can provide a see- through display, allowing the user to see both the 
screen image and the room beyond. Virtual i-O offers a developers kit 
that includes head-tracking specifications, software routines and 
tech support. <p>

       Imersion Corporation demonstrated their 3-D modeling digitizer, 
MicroScribe 3-D. The device resembles a multi-jointed mechanical arm 
with a pen attached to the end. As the operator traces the pen along 
the surface of an object, a wire-frame replica appears on a monitor. 
The end-result could then be exported to a 3-D modeling application 
using standard formats such as .dxf, .obj, .txt, and others. <p>

       Several 3-D rendering APIs were on display, including Argonaut's 
Brender and Criterion's RenderWare. Microsoft released beta versions 
of four multimedia APIs: DirectDraw, DirectSound, DirectInput, and 
DirectPlay, for graphics, sound, input devices and data transmissions, 
respectively. <p>

       At the close of the CGDC, Microsoft hosted a "Ground Zero" 
party which served as a kickoff for their own seminar, focusing on the 
Windows 95 game SDK. The day-long session followed on the heels of (some 
conference goers said "on the toes of") CGDC conference and was free to 
CGDC attendees. <p>

       The CGDC is sponsored by the Computer Game Developer's 
Association. Membership in CGDA is $75.00 per year. Members receive news 
and information about the interactive, education, and entertainment 
software industry. For more information, contact the CGDA, 5339 Prospect 
Road, Ste. 330, San Jose, CA 95129. <p>
