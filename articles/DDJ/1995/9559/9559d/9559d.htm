Guy Kawasaki has returned to Apple as an Apple Fellow for developer issues.
Apple has been criticized for a perceived lack of support for third-party
developers. Kawasaki's return to Apple, which he left in 1987, is seen
as a signal to developers that they really are important to the company.<p>

In a surprise move, Apple has designated Apple Fellow Donald Norman to head its
Advanced Technology Group. A recognized expert in human-interface design,
Norman will lead the group responsible for R&amp;D of new innovations,
including operating systems.<p><HR AlIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="33%">

Following the lead of Utah's Digital Signature Act, state legislatures
in New York, Texas, Oregon, California, Florida, and Washington are in
the process of drafting legislation on digital signatures. Similar
proposals are being made at the federal level. The specific question
being addressed is whether or not digital signatures have the same
legal status as handwritten signatures. Presumably, "legalized"
digital signature would enable contracts, financial transactions, and
other legal documents to be filed electronically.
