<h1> ATASPI and the Standards Process</h1>
<h3><i>by Kevin Calvert </i></h3>

<HR>
The IDE standard, which paved the way for today's low-cost hard-disk
drives by including drive and host-interface electronics in the disk assembly
itself, is now ten years old. A more recent superset of IDE is Enhanced IDE
(EIDE), which delivers support on the motherboard. Generally speaking, all
IDE-based peripherals - including both IDE and EIDE - fall under the
guidelines established by the AT Attachment (ATA) specification, which extended
the AT (ISA) bus to the disk drive across a 40-pin connector.<p>

To provide software support for the ATA specification, EIDE vendors, including
disk, CD-ROM, and tape-drive manufacturers, have developed the AT Attachment
Software Programming Interface (ATASPI). In general, the goal of ATASPI is to
provide an industry-standard API for the EIDE bus in an effort to eliminate
incompatibilities between new EIDE devices as this technology develops. More
specifically, this allows widespread end-user installation of tape drives.
Ultimately, ATASPI will enable plug-and-play addition of tape drives without
switching settings or cables.<p>

ATASPI serves as an I/O manager and programming interface for EIDE disk drives
and AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) peripherals, which now share the
same bus. DOS and Windows 3 environments lack an I/O manager to serialize
requests for access when these devices are connected to the same bus. <p>
The specification covers the application interface to the ATASPI I/O manager.
ATASPI has its roots in the Advanced SCSI Programming Interface (ASPI). The API
is accessed via a far call (for DOS) or a function call (within Windows) and is
passed a structure containing the command packet and the address of the device
to process the request. Upon completion, status is passed back through the same
structure.<p>

ATASPI is an open specification, available for use by all developers. It was
introduced to the standards community by Future Domain (in concert with Western
Digital, Sony, Seagate, and others) in December 1994 at the Small Form Factor
meeting for ATAPI devices, held in Irvine, CA. In January 1995, the spec was
presented at the ANSI X3T10 ATA working group. The ANSI X3T10 group saw ATASPI
as a systems-level issue and has formed the Systems Issues study group to
address systems-level issues. I serve as secretary of the Systems Issues study
group; Duncan Penman of IIX Consulting is the chair.<p>

As with any standards effort, the process is long and involved. The first step
is to determine which standards body should deal with each issue. There are
bodies that address domestic, international, market, or industry-specific
standards. ANSI (American National Standards Institute) is the best known of
the domestic organizations, and ISO (International Standards Organization) is
the best-known international organization. The rules used by each standards
body vary. It is best to be a member of the body selected to study your
proposal. If not, you need to enlist an industry consultant or other member
company to guide your proposal through the standards process.<p>

Generally, a document must be sponsored by a member and submitted to the body
for work. If accepted, the document is assigned to a work group and converted
to that body's format. Changes are made, and votes are taken to move
the document forward. Group members who have a serious interest in the proposal
often lobby behind the scenes. The parent body then reviews the document and
any proposed modifications. These changes are voted on and, if approved, are
incorporated back into the document.<p>

This process continues until no more modifications are proposed or the number
of allowable review cycles is met. At this point, a vote is taken and the
document either becomes a standard or is sent back to the working group to
address the issues that stalled the document. At various stages the document is
made available for public comment, either through publication or on the
Internet.<p>

At best, the standards process will take many months. X3T10, for instance, only
has two meetings scheduled for the remainder of this year. (To keep up with
X3T10 activities, visit the X3 home page at <A HREF="http://www.x3.org/">http://www.x3.org/</A>.) Still, several
companies are already developing products that incorporate ATASPI, or are
ATASPI-aware. If you wish to contribute ideas to the development of ATASPI, or
wish to become involved in this standards process, feel free to contact me.<p>
