  <H1>MacHack '95</H1>

From CPUs to APIs, the computer industry embodies change. The one thing that
has generally remained constant, however, is programming. This year's
"MacHack '95, the Tenth Annual Technical Conference for Leading
Edge Developers" (held in Southfield, Michigan) was a reminder of this.
MacHack is a throwback to the days of pizza and coke all-nighters.
It's a 72-hour, no-sleep, full-tilt boogie to produce the best (and
sometimes most pointless) software. It's a reminder of what
programming was like before it became an "industry."<p>

Chris Crawford, author of the hit game "Balance of Power" and the
seminal book <i>The Art of Computer Game Design</i>
(Osborne/McGraw-Hill, 1984), kicked off MacHack with an inspirational
keynote address about how he created games that were considered
commercially unconventional at the time, but enjoyed great success
when end users discovered them. From that point on the action never
stopped, with technology sessions, business presentations, code
clinics, and hacking in the 24-hour-a-day computer room. Technology
sessions lasted anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours. Session topics
included cross-platform development with the Win32 API, CyberDog,
Copland, OLE, SOM, OpenDoc, and the MacOS. Formal papers presented
included "Video: Implications of 60-Year Old Technology, How To Deal
With Its Idiosyncrasies," by Chris Russ; "A Macintosh-based
Real-time, Multitasking Data Acquisition System," by Greg King;
"Design Methods for Task Prioritization, Fragmentation, and
Inter-process Cooperation," by Grant Neufeld; and "Creating
Interactive Television (ITV) Applications," by Timothy Knox. <p>

The business presentations lasted about an hour each. These sessions
provided information on business-related topics such as "Market
Research: How, What, and Why," "Project Planning and Management," and
"Getting Funded: Start-up and Growth." The code clinics, scheduled
for about two hours every afternoon, gave attendees the opportunity
to dissect, debug, and discuss code - hands-on and up close.<p>

The "machine" room had 100 or so Macs and about 50 Windows PCs
(provided by Apple and Microsoft, respectively) for seeing who could
write the best hack. The MacHax "Best Hack Contest," which originated
in 1987 with the MacHax Group, is still a no-holds-barred hacking
contest. The fundamental rule is that the hack not have any
commercial overtones, as source code is typically made available.
Beyond that, the specific rules are that "Scott and Greg make all the
rules," "any entry must have been written some time during the last
year, "supplying source code will get you more votes," and "all hacks
shown will be included on the conference CD (unless you can give us a
really good reason to exclude it)." (The MacHax Group, reachable at
http://www.hax.com/hax.html, is a software development company
that created and continues to sponsor the MacHax Best Hack Contest.) <p>

The hacks themselves are divided into two categories - those started
before the contest, and those started and completed during the
three-day conference. Nearly 60 participants submitted hacks. Two of
the most memorable were a Mac startup animation (by Bob Desoff and
Jerry Felipe) and a Mac QuickDraw3D/QuickTime movie. The startup
animation depicted the two words "Mac" and "OS" squeezing the Windows
logo until it disappeared, leaving only the MacOS logo. The
QuickDraw3D/ QuickTime movie was a user-controlled, 3-D fly-through
of the Grand Canyon.<p>

The hack contest is the essence not only of MacHack, but of
programming in general: Contestants aspire to a much more valuable
prize than anything money can buy - peer respect. It's the ooohs and
aaahs of those who know and can appreciate the effort of a good idea
and its implementation. It is what causes us all to stay up
programming into the wee hours of the morning.  MacHack - and the
software industry in general - is not just about money. It is also
about expressing a vision and sharing cool hacks with your
friends.<p>

Interestingly, while MacHack has historically been considered the
preeminent conference on Macintosh programming, this year Microsoft
tagged along with a preconference workshop entitled "Windows 95 for
Mac Developers."  Among the seminars presented to traditional Mac
programmers were the Win32 API, virtual memory management, memory,
mapped files, processes and threads, structured exception handling,
Windows 95 user-interface architecture, development tools, and code
portability. <p>

Expotech, the conference organizer, is making this year's hacks
available on a CD-ROM ($34.95); contact Expotech at
