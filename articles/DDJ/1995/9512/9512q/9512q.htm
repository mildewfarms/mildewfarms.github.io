Stingray Software has announced a pair of Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) extension class libraries--the MFC++ 1.0 (Mantaray Foundation Classes++) and Objective Grid 1.0. Both tools provide a variety of new MFC-based C++ classes that Microsoft Visual C++ users can start using immediately for Windows 95 application development.<P>
MFC++ 1.0 is a set of over 20 general-purpose MFC extension classes that fall into a wide range of categories, including: document/view enhancements; image classes for reading, writing, and manipulating popular image formats; Win32 classes; MDI alternative classes; and MFC-based control classes.<P>
Objective Grid 1.0 is a grid control that supports a variety of cell types and can be used in different contexts. For example, Objective Grid can be used as a child window, as a pop-up window, and even in a dialog. Full ODBC support is provided via a set of <I>CRecordSet</I> derivatives. You can easily attach Objective Grid to any data source by overriding one C++ virtual function. Also, printing, print-preview, find/replace, and cut/copy/paste are supported and completely integrated with existing MFC classes. <P>
MFC++ sells for $495.00; Objective Grid, for $395.00; or bundled together, for $795.00. Both packages include full source code.<P>
