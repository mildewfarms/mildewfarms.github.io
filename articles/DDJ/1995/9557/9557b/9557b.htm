<H2>More on Internet Protocols</H2> <p>
<H3><I>by Ray Valdes</I></H3><p>

Even while the protocols for transporting video and audio
data over the Internet continue to evolve, there are a
number of efforts that use the technology already in place.
KJHK at the University of Kansas is one, as mentioned in Rob
Burcham's article. <p>

Carl Malamud's Internet Multicasting Service (IMS) is a
high-profile operation that has been broadcasting on the
Internet, via MBone, for more than two years. IMS now offers
a range of radio programming, on a number of ``channels.''
These programs are also available via ftp from
<A HREF="ftp://town.hall.org/">town.hall.org</A>, and via audio cassette from O'Reilly &
Associates. IMS' Town Hall channel covers public-affairs
topics, including broadcasts of speakers at the National
Press Club. <p>

Perhaps the largest audience for an MBone broadcast occurred
on November 18, 1994, when the Rolling Stones broadcast
portions of their Dallas concert. How do you access MBone?
The Rolling Stones' Web site has some simple instructions:
``Here's what you do: get access to a Sun SPARCstation (or
other suitable computer) and a fat connection to the
Internet and MBONE, install sd, vat and nv (aka nvbin). Tune
in and invite other people to watch too.'' <p>

As you can imagine, MBone is not for those of us with
SLIP/PPP connections over a skimpy 14.4-Kbps link. MBone is
a virtual network layered over the existing Internet, via
the technique known as ``tunneling,'' which encapsulates
packets of the new protocol within packets of the existing
IP protocol. This requires a network of routers running
mrouted, the multicast IP routing software. Eventually,
multicasting will be built into commercial routers, but
today the MBone is built on workstation-class machines (SGI
boxes, SPARCstations, DECstations) running the routing
software, connected by T1 or higher bandwidth links. To run
mrouted, certain patches are needed to the operating system
kernel. The number of participating networks with Mbone
traffic has been estimated at 1400, a fraction of the
current Internet.<p>

On the client side, the workstations on an MBone subnet need
modifications to the TCP/IP stack. At the moment, Apple Computer is
the only PC vendor providing support for IP multicast on client
workstations, in the successor to MacTCP (known as
``OpenTransport/TCP'') that has just emerged from beta and will ship
on the new Mac PCI models. There will be an upgrade for existing Mac
users. For more information, check out <A

A comprehensive source of info about MBone is the Web site

For those of us left out in the cold with 14.4 SLIP/PPP
links, there is one commercial technology that works over
lower bandwidth connections. RealAudio, from Progressive
Networks of Seattle, makes several products that let you
publish sounds on your Web pages, and access this data over
low-speed links using a proprietary compression format.<p>

How is RealAudio different from existing Web technology? WWW
users have always been able to access Web pages that have
audio and video data. But this data can't be heard or seen
in real time. When you view a Web page with an interlaced
GIF image, it shows up in real time along with the text. By
contrast, when your Web browser encounters audio or video
data, you have to wait until the data file is downloaded.<p>

The RealAudio system consists of several components. On the
client side, the RealAudio Player (a ``helper application''
for your Web browser) runs on Windows PCs with sound cards
or on Macintoshes. Progressive Networks makes server
software that transfers data over the internet to the
player. The company also makes space available on their Web
site for your audio files (for free, at the moment). Your
pages are located on the server of your existing provider,
but can contain links to audio data on the server at
Progressive Networks. However, as you might expect, there
currently are severe capacity problems on this server.<p>

The final component in RealAudio sound publishing is
creating audio files. This is done via an encoder/converter
known as ``RealAudio Studio,'' which can convert WAV, AU, and
AIFF files to the proprietary RAM format. Currently
RealAudio Player, Studio, and Server are in beta, and
available free of charge from <A HREF="http://www.realaudio.com">http://www.realaudio.com</A>.<p>

One broadcaster using RealAudio technology is Radio HK,
which bills itself as ``the first 24-hour, Internet-only
radio station.'' This station is a project of Hajjar/Kaufman
Advertising (<A HREF="http://www.hkweb.com/radio">http://www.hkweb.com/radio</A>). Radio HK initially
was on the MBone, but switched to RealAudio to gain the
(potentially) wider audience.<p><HR AlIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="66%"><P>
