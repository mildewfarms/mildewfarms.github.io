<h2> <I>Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure</I></h2>
<h3><i>reviewed by Ray Valdes </i></h3>
<p>

Those of us who've worked in the computer industry sometimes
find it hard to explain to non-techie loved ones what it is
we do at work, why the hours are so long, why software
doesn't do what one would it like to do, or why programmers
like Chinese food, among other imponderables. When my own
words fail, I resort to pointing out a book, such as Tracy
Kidder's <I>Soul of a New Machine</I>, Paschal Zachary's
<I>Showstopper</I>, Steve Levy's <I>Hackers</I>, or Michael Swaine and
Paul Freiberger's <I>Fire in the Valley</I>. Each of these books is
a vivid snapshot of a particular time and place, but also
depicts situations that are generalizable to the rest of the
industry, and from which we can often draw lessons.<p>

One problem with most of these books, as useful as they are,
is that they are usually written by a journalist or outside
observer, rather than by those in the eye of the storm.
Jerry Kaplan's <I>Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure</I>
(Houghton-Mifflin, 1995. ISBN 0-395-71133-9) is different:
Kaplan was principal founder and CEO of GO Corporation, a
highly visible pen-computing startup that in the early '90s
enjoyed center stage as the leading player in an emerging
industry, one that would revitalize a stagnant sector of the
U.S. economy.<p>

Kaplan's book is surprisingly well-written, and chronicles
the history of GO, from initial flash of insight (a 1987
epiphany during a flight in Mitch Kapor's private jet) to
the initial $1.5 million in funding (a commitment secured
after a 10-minute pitch to a blue-chip venture-capital firm,
without a formal business plan, financial projections or a
technical VP) to the key initial product demo (the machine
was assembled for the first time the day before, with no
guarantee that it would work a second time) to early
adulation by the press, to the insatiable thirst for capital
($75 million over five years, burning $2 million a month at
its peak) that ultimately led to GO's demise and the
undignified picking apart of its bones at public auction.
Along the way, many paper fortunes vanished in the stroke of
a pen, while a few lucky GO employees were able to cash in,
in one fleeting moment by jumping ship to a derivative
startup called EO, which was acquired by AT&T and dissolved
shortly thereafter. (These employees were not necessarily
the most hard-working or deserving of the 200+ employees who
devoted countless burn-out hours furthering Kaplan's vision
of pen computing.)<p>

The book lives up to its jacket blurb about being a
``kiss-and-tell'' story about the birth, life, and death of
GO. Kaplan depicts most of the movers and shakers in the
personal computer industry, not always in flattering terms.
Kaplan's story has the drama and timing of a page-turner,
and is well-stocked with rapacious villains, pompous
buffoons, back-stabbing martinets, and bullgoose-looney
venture capitalists (Bill Gates, John Sculley, Alain
Rossman, John Doerr). IBM is shown as a club-footed giant
beset by a panoply of bumbling bureaucrats, beady-eyed
wannabees, and the occasional power player (Jim Cannavino).
After reading this book, you'll understand why OS/2 will
never succeed, and why Microsoft rules the roost. <p>

Of course, the narrative is guided (and warped) by Kaplan's
personal agenda-as with any autobiographer, he cannot escape
the all-too-human desire to portray one's own role in the
best possible light.<p>

Kaplan prefers to set the scene with a few well-chosen
sentences, and let the characters portray themselves in
their own words.<p>

For example, here is a vignette about arriving, in mid-1988,
at Apple's headquarters for a meeting with John Sculley:<p>

<blockquote>

Jean-Louis Gassee [Apple's VP of
technology]...instantaneously appeared as if out of thin
air. He must have been watching me eye the place. He leaned
toward me and said: ``Obscene gross margins.''<p>

 ``What?'' <p>

 ``This splendor is the happy result of Apple's obscene gross
margins. And do you know why?'' He spoke with a smooth French
accent: ``Because we control the whole platform, both the
hardware and the software. The rest of the PC manufacturers
are going to the dogs, eating each other for lunch as they
get squeezed by Microsoft on the software side and Intel on
the hardware side.'' He gestured out the window, to the world
outside Apple. ``Would you believe they want us to license
our software to others?'' He narrowed his eyes at me, as
though I should know precisely what fools he might be
referring to. ``But we don't have any competition. I say keep
the prices high and profits will roll in.''<p>

</blockquote>


These almost comic-book characterizations add to the overall
sense of drama, and seem true in essence even if they may
lack verbatim fidelity. The author relies on his own
recollection, of course, but bolsters his memory with a
diary that was recorded verbally on tape three times a week
during seven years of GO's existence. When transcribed,
there were a thousand pages of notes, corroborated by 50 MB
of archived e-mail and internal company documents and memos.
A story this complex has many angles and players, and
draconian filtering is a necessity.<p>

Kaplan meticulously stays on the safe side of legal
propriety. For example, he himself does not outright state
that Microsoft stole GO's ideas and concepts and, through
numerous Machiavellian machinations that bordered on the
unethical, was able to get PenPoint ISVs to abandon GO in
favor of Windows/Pens. Instead, he leaves it to other
characters in the book:<p>

<blockquote>

[Robert] whispered through clenched teeth: ``They ripped off
our stuff!'' <p>

 ``I'm just glad we showed Lloyd [the Microsoft engineer in
charge of Windows/Pens] our ideas so long ago, so he could
only copy our earlier stuff!''<p>

``You got [******], plain and simple,'' said Michael Baum of
Pensoft. ``They just figure you don't have the wherewithal to
go after them.''<p>

</blockquote>


Kaplan also describes meeting with the FTC about Microsoft's
trade practices and shortly thereafter getting a phone call
from Bill Gates:<p>

<blockquote>

``[Gates said] I just hope you understand what you could be
getting into. You know our look-and-feel dispute with
Apple?'' Now Gates spoke with restrained emphasis, ``I've
spent over four million dollars so far on that one
lawsuit!''... We both knew what he was talking about. There
was no way a small startup company like GO could possibly
afford the cost of legal action against Microsoft. <p>
</blockquote>

More than once, the journey undertaken by GO's staff is
described as a ``joyride to hell.'' Although the book is a
jolly good read, Kaplan's story is limited by some key blind
spots, demonstrating that even a center-stage seat does not
provide omniscience or self-awareness. One of Kaplan's goals
in this book is to write ``a cautionary tale about what can
happen to a young company when its timing is wrong, its
technology too speculative, and its market not yet ready.''
He doesn't quite succeed, missing or soft-pedaling some key
aspects of the story of GO.<p>

One reason is that Kaplan's book is mostly devoid of
technical content. Of course, this is largely because it is
written for a mass audience; but part of the reason is that
Kaplan, who has impressive technical credentials (doctorate
in computer science, principal author of Lotus Agenda), gave
up hands-on development early on, and seems to have spent
most of his time on jet planes, speaking at conferences,
seeking out deep-pockets investors and making deals with
large-volume customers. Essential tasks, to be sure, but all
the product demos, investment capital, and purchase orders
in the world won't help if your product is unfinished and/or
unworkable.<p>

In early 1988, soon after GO embarked on its development, I
was lucky enough to visit the company in a converted loft
and see the early prototype, whose descendant would be
unveiled to the general public three years later. I later
spent a week at its first developer camp for its PenPoint
operating system, and wrote applications for a PenPoint ISV.
Along with many other software developers, I was impressed
by PenPoint's innovative design and elegant architecture.
There are aspects of Carr's creation, such as PenPoint's
embedded-document architecture, that are only now being
copied or finding their way into mainstream software systems
(OLE, OpenDoc, Taligent).<p>

Despite my respect for the talents of GO's technical staff,
I came to the realization, a year or two before GO's doors
were to finally shut, that PenPoint would not succeed. After
seeing a prototype pen application that took four skilled
engineers four months to build in PenPoint, I was able to
knock off the same application in three weeks of part-time
work, writing for Microsoft's competing Windows/Pens
environment, using pedestrian tools like QuickC and Visual
Basic. Although the Windows/Pens environment is a
kludge-layered-upon-kludge and its convoluted architecture
makes San Francisco's famous Lombard Street seem as straight
as the Route 280 expressway, Windows' longevity in the
marketplace gave Windows developers order-of-magnitude
advantage in time-to-market (never mind that the market was
largely nonexistent). The PenPoint system was like an
elegant castle in the air, lacking the infrastructure and
foundation of tools, documentation, support, or a
sufficiently large native population of developers to
support this structure (nevermind the bugs, or the
four-minute boot time). Kaplan does not mention this, nor
does he dwell on other shortcomings of GO's pen system, such
as that the machine was too heavy and expensive, and the
handwriting recognition was not adequate for its intended
market (although, for that matter, neither was anybody
else's).<p>

Although by necessity there is much of GO's story that ended
up on the cutting-room floor, Kaplan's book contains some
interesting, and heretofore secret, tidbits. I was surprised
to find out that Intel invested several million in GO, yet
succeeded in keeping this investment a secret. Likewise, IBM
almost blindsided GO by negotiating with Apple to
joint-market the Newton. No matter how much you think you
know about this industry, you'll learn something new from
this book.<p>
