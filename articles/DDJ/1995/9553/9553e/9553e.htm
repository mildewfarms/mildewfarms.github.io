  Lawyers for Phil Zimmermann, developer of PGP encryption software,
have met for the first time with U.S. government attorneys who, after
a two-year investigation, are apparently ready to proceed with an
indictment that could result in a ten-year prison sentence and $1 million
fine for Zimmermann. At issue is how PGP software was distributed
over the Internet in what the government claims was a violation of
export laws. How the case is resolved could have far-reaching
Internet-related ramifications. <p>



  Learning from its mistakes, Intel will begin publicly documenting
and disclosing flaws in its microprocessors and microcontrollers
via addenda to design handboooks. Under the new procedure, hardware
and software customers will be the first to learn of bugs, then the
public. <p>


  Microsoft and the Justice Department are back in court, but this
time both have been scolded by U.S. District Court Judge Stanley
Sporkin over the terms of the July 1994 consent decree, which restricts
Microsoft's licensing practices. Sporkin said his current understanding
of the consent decree suggests he should reject it. <p>
