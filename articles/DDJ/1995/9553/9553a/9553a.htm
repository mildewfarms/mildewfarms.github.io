<h1>Apple Shines at MacWorld Expo </h1>

<h3><i>by Michael Swaine</i></h3>
  <p>

  Neil Ticktin was grabbing developers and journalists as they
passed the Developer Central area at MacWorld Expo 95, dragging them
through a gauntlet of developer booths and stations. <p>

  Ticktin's enthusiasm was easily understood: Apple had beefed
up its developer area for the show, giving it more floor space than
ever before. Companies often use booth-space size as a symbol of
prosperity, and Apple can't be chided for using the same symbol to suggest increased attention to developer support. Only a cynic would point out
that Apple had a cosponsor to help it beef up Developer Central this
year: Ticktin's company, which publishes MacTech Magazine. <p>

  There actually was a lot going on at Developer Central, although
developer developments had big competition for visitor attention at
the Expo. A lot was going on at the show generally, which was well
attended by any standard. Exhibitors seemed cheerful. The mood bore
little resemblance to last year, when there was much handwringing over
the future of Apple and of the Macintosh platform. <p>

  <H3>The Wall Comes Down </H3><p>

  From this point in time and space --- January 1995, San Francisco
--- 1995 looks promising for Apple. Sales of PowerMacs are brisk.
Profits are running ahead of analysts' predictions. The transition to
PowerPC is proceeding apace. Three new PowerPC machines were introduced
at the Expo, just upgrades to current PowerPC offerings, but with
more muscle for less money, a nice sign. <p>

  Apple also announced the Power Macintosh 6100 DOS Compatible,
containing a PowerPC 601 and a 486 DX2/66. This machine improves on a similar 68040 machine from last year. The hard disk handles Mac and
PC/Windows files, support for dual monitors, including VGA tubes, is
provided, and the optional CD-ROM drive reads Mac and PC/Windows CD-ROMs.
Meanwhile, Apple also announced Windows client software for its AppleShare
and AppleSearch software. Do you sense a theme here? Apple took pains
to point out how the Power Macintosh 6100 DOS Compatible demonstrated
the company's commitment to cross-platform solutions, and how
compatibility should not be a barrier to converting to Macintosh. Bill
Clinton should study Apple's press releases. <p>

  Not only is Apple yanking its CPU out from under its operating
system, but it is also moving to a new hardware architecture, starting
by scrapping the SCSI bus for PCI. After the PCI move, Apple intends
to replace the operating system. That's a lot to change in a short
time, but at the Expo, the signs were all positive. The transition to
the PCI bus was moving along, scheduled to start in the spring with
new machines. Apple announced a long list of vendors lined up to
produce PCI products. But the new operating system, code-named
``Copeland'' and featuring hardware abstraction and other nifty features,
was delayed until 1996. <p>

  And then there were the clones. After years of nagging from
advisors inside and outside the company, after false starts and miscues,
Apple had finally licensed the Mac O/S to a couple of domestic computer
manufacturers who announced intentions to build private-label machines
that will include the Mac O/S and run Mac applications. <p>

  Power Computing Corp. (Milpitas, CA) announced its hopes to push
up to 100,000 units through mail order in a year, beating Apple's
prices for similar machines. And Radius (San Jose, CA) announced that
it will initially use its Mac O/S license to produce high-end
video-editing systems, although it may broaden its Mac O/S-based offerings
later. Later, Cutting Edge (El Cajon, CA) joined the clone crowd.
Crowd? Well, by the time this sees print, maybe it will be. <p>

  The current clones are being licensed to companies that Apple
thinks will not threaten its markets, but Apple claims that, as the
new PowerPC Reference Platform (PReP) hardware platform phases in
over the next few years, it will license the Mac O/S to more or less
anybody who builds a PReP machine and pays the license fee. At that time
the Mac-clone market will truly be a clone market. Just how many
clones there will be is anybody's guess. <p>

  But none of those machines will be called ``Macs.'' <p>

  While Apple was announcing the first clones, another erosion of
the Mac mystique was under way within Apple. It was leaked during the
show that Apple will begin producing machines that do not include the
Mac O/S. <p>

  Code-named ``Shiner'' and designed as servers, the new machines
are expected to ship by the end of the year. According to a MacWeek
report, they are intended for NetWare for PowerPC for IBM's AIX operating
systems, and will not include Macintosh ROMs. <p>

  After being repeatedly rebuffed by the business community, after
repeatedly blowing it with server strategies, does Apple now plan to
sacrifice the Macintosh name (in the business area) to save its own? Is
it saying that this server is not a liberal, but a new Democrat? <p>

 <H3> New Developer Tools Released </H3><p>

  Against that background of news noise, developments at Developer
Central had to be pretty significant to get much attention. It turns
out that there were a number of developer developments, and some of
them were pretty significant. <p>

  Dylan was in beta. Dylan is the object-oriented dynamic language
and incremental development environment currently under development
for Apple. The goal of Dylan is to let the developer work at a higher
level of abstraction and create commercial-grade software at prototyping
speed. It is to have safe and efficient memory management, compile-time
and run-time type checking, and a high-level exception-handling and
error-recovery mechanism. A project is stored in a database rather than
in files, as is the case with conventional development environments.
(For more on Dylan, see ``A Taste of Dylan,'' by David Betz, DDJ,
October 1992, and ``The Dylan Programming Language,'' by Tamme D. Bowen
and Kelly M. Hall, <I>Dr. Dobb's Sourcebook of Alternative Programming
Languages, Winter 1994</I>.) <p>

  Kaleida Labs (Mountain View, CA) announced shipment of its
Kaleida Media Player and ScriptX, the object-oriented, dynamic
programming language designed for writing programs for the KMP (for more
information, see ``Character Simulation with ScriptX,'' by Assaf Reznik,
DDJ, November 1994). The KMP is Kaleida's software platform for
interactive multimedia. It is a layer of software that sits above the
operating system and runs a ScriptX application, providing it with all
the platform-independent audio, video, and graphical support and
synchronization it needs. The KMP announcement was for the Mac O/S and
Windows; OS/2 Warp support is scheduled for mid-year. <p>

  Last fall, Apple sold MacCommon LISP to Digitool (Cambridge,
MA). At the Expo, Digitool announced MCL 3.0, which will ship in May
and support multiple processes. <p>

  Quasar Knowledge Systems (Bethesda, MD) announced VisualAgents,
an object-oriented authoring tool. QKS is in the Smalltalk camp,
and VisualAgents is built on its solid Smalltalk technology. <p>

  There were a number of AppleScript and OpenDoc tools at the Expo.
SDU (Chapel Hill, NC) announced Version 2.0 of its FaceSpan ``interface
processor,'' which generates front ends for AppleScript. Heizer Software
(Pleasant Hill, CA) announced ODTools, a toolkit it describes as ``ResEdit
for OpenDoc,'' and showed the first of its line of small books, Steve
Michel's Scripting the Scriptable Finder. It also showed off PreFab
Player, a clever tool that adds certain verbs to AppleScript to get
around limitations in scriptable apps, including the scriptable
Finder. <p>

  And Main Event Software (Washington, DC) released Rosanne Data
Processing Package, which is: 1. a collection of tools for manipulating
large text files like those used in mainframe databases and statistical
databases, and 2. a hot product that really puts AppleScript to good use. <p>

  Prograph (San Francisco, CA) was at Developer Central, and justly
so. Its visual programming system deserves more attention than it
has been getting. <p>

  One developer tool wasn't represented in Developer Central and
should have been: Allegiant Technologies (San Diego, CA) was elsewhere
at the show, demonstrating its latest version of SuperCard. Allegiant
is more or less the original SuperCard team from its Silicon Beach
days and has done a remarkable job of upgrading a good product that
started life as a HyperCard clone and grew into a serious tool for
multimedia development. The latest version is PowerMac native and
produces stand-alone applications. A Windows version is in the works. <p>

  The Allegiant team knew that their product was powerful, but
were nevertheless taken by surprise when one SuperCard developer
used the product to produce an application that won an award at the
Expo. Realizing that SuperCard could be used to create a product that
competed with SuperCard, they quickly established a new royalty plan
for just such applications. All others fly free. <p>

  Many of these tools point to new models of programming or computer
use. OpenDoc presages small, focused apps. Some of the other tools
represent at least small steps forward in the areas of scripting and
visual programming. Kaleida is all about new media and new markets.
Dylan promises to shake up software development at least a little.
With these new directions on display at the Expo, with Apple sales
looking good, with new Mac O/S machines coming from elsewhere and new
non-Mac O/S machines coming from Apple, the old hue and cry over Apple's
and the Mac's survival seems less relevant. <p>

  Looks like the pundits will just have to dust off those takeover
rumors. <P>
