Imagix 4D (from Imagix) is a tool designed to help developers better understand C/C++ code by providing a graphical, 3-D view of application code. The Imagix data-collection system enables Imagix 4D to analyze any source code written in K&amp;R, ANSI, Microsoft, or GNU C.<P>
The tool collects data from different sources, ranging from the software itself (source code and makefiles) to static- and dynamic-analysis data files generated by the compiler. Once collected, the data is integrated into an entity/relationship/attribute database. This information is then used to create a series of views--from high-level architecture snapshots, to the nitty-gritty of class and function dependencies. <P>
Imagix 4D is currently available for Sun workstations, under both Solaris and SunOS. It sells for $795.00 per seat.<P>

NetManage has released Version 4.5 of its TCP/IP software-development kit, NEWT-SDK. The NEWT-SDK suite provides developers with tools for creating custom TCP/IP applications. The SDK lets developers work at a higher level than the WinSock API by packaging all of the protocol intelligence into DLLs and VBXs.<P>
The SDK includes five new VBXs and six new APIs. The new VBX support includes custom controls for FTP, SMTP, and SNMP, allowing you to create network applications in Visual Basic without knowing the underlying application protocols or the TCP/IP protocols. All of the VBXs are based on the Windows Sockets TCP/IP API, so any application developed with these VBXs can communicate across the Internet. The new APIs include a Win-CGI interface to NetManage's Personal Web Server.<P>
NEWT-SDK 4.5 also includes support for the WinSNMP standard that allows SNMP applications to be portable across different TCP/IP protocol stacks. NEWT-SDK 4.5 sells for $500.00 per single copy.<P>

Intel has announced Version 2 of its 3DR high-performance 3-D graphics library for real-time animation and the display of photo-realistic images on 486/Pentium-based PCs running Windows. 3DR Version 2 adds a Geometry Pipeline (3DR/GP) to the original technology's Rasterization Engine (3DR/RE) core to support enhancements such as a fully general lighting model, texture processing and UI toolkits, and a comprehensive geometric-math library. Version 2 offers a general-purpose programming model, plus optimized capabilities designed for games.<P>
3DR/RE software provides Windows-compatible 3-D rasterization functions. With its high-performance, software-only rendering providing base-line capabilities, the 3DR Rasterization Engine provides scalable performance through the Intel/Microsoft Display Control Interface (DCI) standard, 3D-DDI, and custom 3DR drivers. With the addition of a Geometry Pipeline, 3DR Version 2 provides a geometry-level solution for games, multimedia, CAD, visualization, and scientific applications. Both the RE and GP interfaces are exposed, and application developers can write to either separately or to both layers at the same time in the software stack. Version 2 includes the following features: a complete set of 3-D primitives for rendering triangles, polygons, polylines, lines, and points; raster images and bitmaps for fonts and sprites; multiple texture-mapping algorithms with true perspective correction, filtering, and mipmapping; true-color programming model at all pixel depths; optional Z buffering with a complete set of logical Z operations; antialiasing; transparency and alpha blending; and message-passing architecture.<P>
The 3DR Version 2 SDK, available free of charge from Intel's Architecture Labs, includes 3DR development libraries, a run-time system, documentation, and example programs. The run time can be distributed royalty free.<P>
