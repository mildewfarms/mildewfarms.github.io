<a name="0231_00a0"><a name="0231_0000">Visual Parse++, a visual parsing generator from SandStone Technology, is designed to provide developers with parsing technology for user commands, protocols, data-file structures, edit-field validators, user parameter files, scripting, tagged data, formatted files, and data filters. Using regular expression and BNF-like notation, the lexing and parsing engines let you define multiple expression lists and push and pop them as regular expressions are matched. The tool also provides advanced error recovery as well as error tokens and supports Unicode, DBCS, and any 32-bit quantity.<P>
Visual Parse++ works by creating tables and a skeleton application for a developer from a specification. Support for C, C++, and REXX is currently included. The current version supports OS/2, with a Windows implementation forthcoming. Visual Parse++ for OS/2 sells for $699.00.<P>

Strategic Mapping has extended its AtlasView SDK 4.1 for creating mapping software to support Powersoft's PowerBuilder. The AtlasView SDK lets you create apps that enable users to connect their own information to digital maps through relational database-management systems. Information can be linked by street address, postal code, city, county, state, and region, depending on the type of information and geographic data available. With AtlasView support, PowerBuilder developers can now access Strategic Mapping's 1.5 gigabytes of digital maps. <P>

Novell has begun shipping the Novell Embedded Systems Technology (NEST) 1.0 SDK to OEMs who want to build network technology and services directly into electronic devices such as printers and copiers, security systems, building controls, settops, and home appliances. Early NEST licensees include Ricoh, Fujitsu, Lexmark, Digital Products, QMS, Canon, Andover Controls, Xerox, IC Card, Securicor Telecoms, and Castelle.<P>
NEST devices can plug directly into Novell's networks and take advantage of NetWare services, security, and management facilities. Written in C, NEST is hardware, processor, and operating-system independent; it is open and extensible by both Novell and others. Written in C, NEST is designed for embedded-system developers who need to port software from one platform to another. The NEST architecture employs a building-block approach, so developers need only include those functions and software modules required by their embedded systems. The NEST SDK provides software tools for testing SPX and IPX protocols as well as printer applications. The NEST 1.0 SDK includes source code, documentation, training, test tools, and support. <P>
