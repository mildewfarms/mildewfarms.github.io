<h2>FEATURES </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9511a/9511a.htm">NETWORKING OBJECTS WITH CORBA</A></h3><P>
<i>by Mark Betz</i><P>
Mark presents a CORBA-based architecture that demonstrates the power of distributed objects. His project also sheds light on the Internet technologies over which distributed-object computing can work.<P>
<h3><a href="9511b/9511b.htm">YOUR OWN ENDIAN ENGINE</A></h3><P>
<i>by John Rogers</i><P>
Big-endian, Little-endian, or anything in between--you won't have to worry about byte order with the &quot;endian engine&quot; presented here. In fact, John has used this engine to simulate a 36-bit machine with 9-bit bytes on a 32-bit machine with 8-bit bytes. <P>
<h3><a href="9511c/9511c.htm">THE ORACLE CALL INTERFACE AND C++</A></h3><P>
<i>by Jeremy Woo-Sam and Tony Murphy</i><P>
Our authors present a C++ class library that provides database connectivity and query access to an Oracle RDBMS. In doing so, they implement C++ classes that support the concept of array fetching within the interface classes. <P>
<h3><a href="9511d/9511d.htm">PROGRAMMING TI's MULTIMEDIA VIDEO PROCESSOR</A></h3><P>
<i>by William May</i><P>
The 320C80 multimedia video processor from Texas Instruments may be your key to writing software for real-time video. Bill examines the DSP's architecture and shows you how to write client/server apps for it.<P>
<h3><a href="9511e/9511e.htm">INDEXED TEXT RETRIEVAL</A></h3><P>
<i>by Robert Krten</i><P>
Robert presents a text-retrieval system that's fast and flexible. His design and implementation can easily be adapted to other types of text databases and formats.<P>
<h3><a href="9511f/9511f.htm">PORTING VxDs FROM WINDOWS 3.1 TO WINDOWS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Don Matthews </i><P>
Don't throw away your Windows 3.1 VxDs just because Windows 95 is available. Don presents a VxD that works with both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, then describes the different techniques for calling its services. <P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9511g/9511g.htm">PORTABLE MULTITASKING IN C++</A></h3><P>
<i>by Stig Kofoed</i><P>
Stig presents a portable kernel, written in C++, that implements non-preemptive multitasking using <I>setjmp()</I> and <I>longjmp()</I>, and provides semaphores as a means of synchronizing processes.<P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9511h/9511h.htm">USING MAPI FOR INTERAPPLICATION COMMUNICATION</A></h3><P>
<i>by William Stamatakis</i><P>
Bill shows how programs written in Visual Basic and Delphi can communicate via the MAPI interface. <P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9511i/9511i.htm">WRITING ODBC DRIVERS</A></h3><P>
<i>by Dennis R. McCarthy</i><P>
Developing an ODBC driver can be an expensive proposition. That's why Dennis turned to Syware's Dr. DeeBee ODBC Driver Kit to get a driver up and running in a timely fashion.<P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9511j/9511j.htm">DATA MODELS, CASE TOOLS, AND CLIENT/SERVER DEVELOPMENT</A></h3><P>
<i>by Tim Wittenburg</i><P>
Tim presents a tool called &quot;DBA Assistant&quot; that's designed to smooth the transition between the project phases. DBA Assistant, which is written in Microsoft Access Basic, provides a two-way link between the System Architect CASE tool and an Access database.<P>
