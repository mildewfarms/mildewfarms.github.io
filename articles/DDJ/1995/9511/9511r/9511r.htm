It is available as either a Windows DLL, or in ANSI C source for all other platforms. A companion Dialogs DLL can check and correct the contents of standard Windows edit controls, including Windows 95 Rich Text Edit controls. French, Italian, German, and Spanish dictionaries are also available.<P>

Autodesk has begun shipping prerelease versions of its AutoCAD Runtime Extension (ARX), an object-oriented programming environment for AutoCAD Release 13. The ARX SDK, which supports both C++ and COM-based programming interfaces, provides a CAD engine that is the basis for creating software encompassing the entire design-workflow process. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) are the first component of object-based tools being developed jointly by Autodesk and the Industry Alliance for Interoperability (IAI), and they are being implemented using ARX. The IFC and their Guidelines define, at a basic level, the items most commonly used in buildings, and create descriptions of intelligent, real-world objects that are transferred through software applications from different vendors, from design to estimating, through engineering to construction, and on to facilities management. These real-world objects have relationships to each other that let them react intelligently to changes in the project model. <P>

Virtual Genetic Systems has released its Hyperspace Search and Recovery Vehicle (HSRV), a genetic algorithm framework written in C++. HSRV supports a variety of encoding schemes, genetic operators, and population structures. Many common phenotypes are supported using predefined chromosomes and genetic operators (integer and real-valued vectors, text strings, algebraic and regular expressions, and geometric shapes). A definition of the solution domain and a fitness function are all that is required to construct a genetic algorithm. User-defined phenotypes, encoding schemes, genetic operators, population structures, and operator sequences are easily assembled to address user-specific needs. HSRV currently supports Borland C++ 4.x, Watcom C/C++ 10.x, Microsoft Visual C++ 2.x, and GNU C++ 2.5.8. <P>

Emultek has announced the release of Rapid Design 3.0, a Windows-based tool for prototyping embedded system UIs. It allows you to quickly create an interactive working prototype that operates exactly as the real-world system. <P>
Rapid Design 3.0 comes with an extensible object library. Objects are the building blocks of any Rapid simulation. These prefabricated, reusable components can be physical items such as switches, dials, displays, pipes, system schemata, or drawings. Objects can also be nonphysical items such as timers, numbers, strings, or data stores. By applying Rapid's visual technique these objects are linked to create fully interactive simulations in a completely code-free environment. Rapid Design 3.0 sells for $6,000.00.<P>
