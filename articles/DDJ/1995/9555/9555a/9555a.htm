<h1>Here's the Internet, Where's the Money?</h1>

<H3><i>by Ray Valdes</i></H3>
<p>

  Perhaps you've recently the '90s version of matchbook-cover ads 
extolling a variety of get-rich-quick schemes. In today's ads, a smug 
bald guy standing next to a Rolls Royce trumpets: "Be part of the 
billion-dollar industry that is connecting bulletin boards, corporations 
and individuals to the Internet!"   <p>

       Your attention is immediately captured. The ad continues, 
"Someone's making millions... shouldn't it be you? Only $99.95! Complete 
manual details how to become an Internet provider!" You snicker, glad 
that you're not that gullible--but, still, there's a nagging feeling 
that you might be missing out on something. <p>

       Certainly, the statistics documenting the Internet's explosive 
growth continue to appear with mind-numbing regularity: traffic on 
the World Wide Web (WWW) last year increased 1800 percent, one major 
provider of Internet connectivity (Sprint) saw its traffic increase 
700 percent last year and is bracing for an 800 percent increase this 
year, hoping that it has not underestimated the demand. By 1998, 
Forrester Research predicts 11.8 million Web users, outpacing the users 
of conventional online services (CompuServe, AOL, Prodigy), which 
will peak at 6 million. Goldman-Sachs estimates the Internet market 
will grow ten-fold from 1994 to 1998, reaching $3.7 billion. Compared 
to the stagnant growth of much of the computer industry, the Internet 
is a market that can't be ignored. <p>

       So who's making money? Last year in this publication ("The 
Internet: Here Today," by Ray Valdes, DDDU, August 1994) I said tool 
vendors and Internet access providers were making money, as opposed 
to those selling content or (to a lesser extent) physical goods. 
Before looking at the provider business, let's review what's been 
happening in the content/goods arena and the tools marketplace.  <p>

<h2> Content Purveyors Wait and See </h2>

  Secure commercial transactions would let you pay small amounts 
of money each time you consume a tidbit of information or order an 
impulse item. The mechanisms that enable this have yet to fall into 
place, although there are a number of proposals (DigiCash, CyberCash, 
and First Virtual, among them). One of these should move to the 
forefront, perhaps by the end of the year. <p>

       Although Web sites continue to proliferate, many clueless 
content providers are putting up pages that resemble repackaged annual 
reports and recycled marketing brochures, rather than offering 
information of genuine value. Unfortunately, this kind of banal material 
has made the transition from hard copy to electronic media with its 
sleep-inducing qualities intact. <p>

       A few content publishers are finding success--not in dollars, 
but in "hits-per-day." The Web sites for Playboy and Penthouse are 
neck-and-neck for first place in number of accesses (on a good day, each 
can rack up 800,000 hits). In third place, Wired magazine's popular 
HotWired site reportedly gets 400,000 hits per day. (A "hit" can be a 
misleading metric because it depends on the graphical content of the 
page; each graphic counts as a hit. To get the number of actual users 
visting a site, you need to divide the hits by a factor, say between 3 
and 6, that depends on the characteristics of the site.) Reflecting 
its popularity, HotWired recently raised its ad rates to $15,000 per 
month.  <p>

       Other publishers are still testing the waters, leading to 
some information-economy bargains. You can, for example, conduct 
free full-text searches of the Wall Street Journal at 
http://wais.dowvision.com. Compare this to accessing the same database through 
Dow Jones Information Service, at $100 or more per hour.  <p>

       A few content providers are seeking to score big, either 
through chutzpah, greed, or plain ignorance. ESPN is launching a Web 
site with Paul Allen's Starwave Corporation and reportedly asking 
corporate advertisers to commit to a $1 million one-year sponsorship. 
These steep fees have elicited tsk-tsks from some advertising 
executives, one of whom commented: "Let's provoke use by being affordable." 
(Advertising Age, March 20, 1995). The rush is on, but no content publisher 
has struck gold yet.  <p>

<h2>Tool Vendors Cash Out </h2>

  Then there are the tool vendors, who prefer to sell eggs and 
shovels to gold miners, rather than mining for gold directly. Many 
observers are astounded by how much these eggs can sell for: neophyte 
vendor Spry Inc. was bought by CompuServe for $100 million--money that 
went to a tool vendor that did not build its product from scratch, but 
licensed the core technology from someone else. (Spry's principal 
product is based on the NCSA's Mosaic software. The Spry-added 
enhancements are not particularly earth-shattering.) The size of this 
deal must make the twenty- somethings at competitor Netscape 
Communications eye their stock options in a whole new light. <p>

       On the heels of America Online's $30 million acquisition of 
Booklink Technologies (creators of the Internetworks browser), TCI's 
investment of $125 million for 20 percent of Microsoft Network, and PSI's 
$10 million purchase of wet-behind-the-ears Pipeline, you can see 
that some serious money is being spent on tools as well-heeled 
corporations chase the apparitions of the present and future information 
superhighway.  <p>

       But before you download the Mosaic source code and see if you 
can do a better job than Spry, be aware that it's probably too late 
to get into the browser business. Netscape Communications has 
established clear dominance in that category, and the personal-use 
version of its Netscape browser is free. One Web site tabulated its 
browser usage and found that about 80 percent of its net.surfers used 
Netscape, 10 percent used Mosaic, 7 percent Lynx (a text-mode browser 
for those with shell-based dialup access), and 3 percent for other 
tools. <p>

For competitors, the Netscape browser is a moving target. The company
has in the last few weeks made available Netscape Version 1.1 beta,
which adds new features on top of the existing proprietary HTML
extensions. These features include support for tables, "dynamic
documents" (in which a page gets automatically reloaded every few
seconds, to allow for simple animation), graphical backdrops (opening
up a whole new mechanism with which neophyte designers can inflict
graphical abuse on users who've now become immune to the BLINK
attribute), enhanced security (using "non-exportable" encryption),
and a client application API that provides access to the Netscape
"engine" from third-party applications via OLE, DDE, AppleEvents, and
X Events. <p>

       Several months ago, the headline in this publication stated 
"Web Wars Widen" (DDDU, January 1995). But in the area of browsers, 
that war is over. The new arena of competition will be, as 
industry-commentator Jesse Berst puts it, with "just-add- water" Web servers 
which encapsulate and simplify the presently tedious and error-prone 
process of configuring and operating a Web site. The supply of UNIX 
gurus is not growing as fast as demand for Web sites to administer, 
leading to an opportunity for those tool vendors that can rationalize 
the process.      However, this choice is not for everyone. Those who 
cut classes at UNIX-guru school may wonder: Instead of selling tools 
or content, how about selling access? So we return to the question 
posed by the matchbook-style ad. <p>

<h2>Into the Pit of ISPs </h2>

  As with the rest of the Internet and World Wide Web, there has 
been explosive growth in the connectivity business. In the San 
Francisco area, the number of access providers (known as "Internet 
service providers," or ISPs), is over 70. By access, of course, I mean 
various forms of connectivity, such as dial-up (part-time) access 
using SLIP or PPP protocols, or dedicated (full-time) access via 
leased lines or frame relay, and (coming real soon now) ISDN.   <p>

       If you call up some of these ISPs, you are as likely to encounter 
a scratchy answering machine as to talk to the president (and chief 
bottle-washer) of the company. It is legitimate to wonder if your precious 
e-mail is sitting in a corner of his or her living room. In the case of 
one ISP, who has multiple T1 links (1.544 Mbps data lines) and provides 
connectivity for several countries in Africa, the e-mail reportedly does 
go through his living room. Another provider, whose Web site announces 
"We are a NATIONAL Service Provider" and lists 30 cities across the 
U.S. from which you can obtain access, only recently moved from a KOA 
campground where it was located. Then there's DC-area silkroad.com, 
which provides access, sets up Web sites for the military (the Air 
Combat Command server, which is classified but somehow available to 
the public), and "imports fine Asian art and Antiques and distributes 
fine art to experienced and knowledgeable collectors."  <p>

       If you browse the Web site of Southern California vendor 
kaiwan.com, you'll find a price list with a wide range of services (ISDN, 
56K, and T1 connections) at low cost. However, you'll have to sort 
out the grammatical errors from the typos first: "Prices is for 
referenced only and may be changed without notice... Below pricing does 
not include equipments... Our Dial- In service is equipped with 16.8k 
and 14.4k super high speed modems...KAIWAN uses Taylor UUCP system 
which supports aijGgfte protocols...Normal Personal Shell Account 
[allows] 1 Mega disk space with 4 Mega more temporary disk space." <p>

       And in case you're thinking of hanging out on a street corner 
with a sign, "Will provide bandwidth for food," then check out ISP 
forfood.com first. <p>

       Perhaps the weirdest page on a provider Web site is at The 
Little Garden (TLG), a Bay Area ISP. Founder Tom Jennings maintains a 
"Toilet Cam" at http://wps.com/toilet, so that you can, literally, 
"See if we give a s***". In a recent interview with the New York Times, 
however, Jennings maintained that the Toilet Cam is not really active, 
all you get is the same static image of an empty toilet. (Note also 
that wps.com is Jenning's personal site, while tlg.org is the official 
provider site.) <p>

       Lest you write off Jennings, be advised that his outfit is a 
major source of connectivity for many small Bay Area ISPs: including 
DNAI, ScruzNet, QuakeNet, LanMinds, Zoom, Zocalo, TDL, SlipNet, as 
well as popular sites such as wired.com. Unlike most providers, TLG 
has redundant links to the Internet backbone, via multiple vendors. <p>

       The connectivity food chain extends further from tlg.org, 
because Jennings does not restrict re-sale of bandwidth by his customers. 
TLG customer ScruzNet, for example, provides connectivity to several 
even-smaller ISPs, such as cruzio.com and armory.com. By locating further 
up the food chain, TLG avoids the vagaries of the fickle retail-consumer 
market. If you follow the discussions on the ba.internet and 
alt.internet.services newsgroups, you'll see that, from one month to the next, 
an ISP will go in and out of fashion, as customers search for the 
optimum mix of price, reliability and support. Among the cognoscenti, 
Netcom was popular a year or two ago, when there were few connectivity 
options outside of academia and large corporations. As it grew from 
10,000 to over 40,000 in two years, Netcom alienated some early customers 
with busy signals, heavy traffic, billing problems, lack of support, 
proprietary access software (NetCruiser, which was buggy in its initial 
release) and relatively high prices. Some these customers went over to 
new ISPs, which have sprung up almost on a weekly basis over the last 
year. Each ISP arrives on the scene dressed up in attractive pricing 
and offering additional services, such as free home pages or custom 
domain names. It then becomes a hit for a while, until the load overwhelms 
its single server, and busy signals multiply.  <p>

       At the moment, the Bay Area provider-du-jour is Best 
Communications (best.com) of Mountain View, which provides unlimited 
personal SLIP/PPP connections for $30.00 per month. In addition to home 
pages, and custom domain names, Best operates a storefront in which 
customers can come in and surf the net at full Ethernet speeds. My favorite 
ISP, however, is scruznet.com, because it is one of the few that 
provides unlimited-use dial-on- demand ISDN for only $75/month. I 
hesitate to mention this, because, like a favorite cafe or restaurant 
that gets discovered, I worry that soon I'll no longer be able to get 
in. <p>

       To make sense of all this, I prepared a table of providers and 
services. The list is by no means complete, and focuses, not on personal 
SLIP/PPP accounts (which have become a rock-bottom- priced commodity), 
but on mid-level bandwidth options, such as frame relay, leased line, 
and ISDN, in various flavors (full-time versus part-time, metered 
usage versus unlimited use, Centrex versus non-Centrex). This market 
is highly dynamic and prices are likely to change. Almost all providers 
now have Web sites listing their prices. You can find a listing of 
providers at http://www.dobbs.com/dddu/providers/. This list also 
available by e-mailing me at ray@valdes.com. <p>

       Since the mid-level market is not yet a commodity arena, you'll 
find tremendous swings in price from one vendor to another. For the 
same amount of bits-per-second, your two-year cost can vary by a 
factor of four, from about $6500 to almost $27,000. Don't take these 
numbers are gospel because they contain certain assumptions about 
equipment purchase and daily usage that may not apply to your situation. 
For example, I assume the part- time ISDN link will be active no more 
than 12 hours per day; I also assume that you can cobble together a 
low-cost frame-relay- capable router and CSU/DSU interface for $1000 
(compared to $1750 quoted by one vendor and $3702 quoted by another); 
another assumption is that leased-line distances are short. Centrex 
is not an option for most vendors, except for QuakeNet, which is 
located in close proximity to the DDJ offices (and therefore shares 
the same digital switch at the telephone central office). If you're 
close to your ISP, ISDN Centrex becomes a very attractive option for 
avoiding the per-minute charges of regular ISDN, which can otherwise 
be more expensive than frame relay. <p>

<h2>Throwing the Hat</h2>

  Returning to the get-rich-quick ad with which I began, what are 
the prospects for ISP wannabees? Tom Jennings is sanguine, but other 
experts that I spoke with have an answer: don't give up your day job. 
Randy Bush, owner and operator of RainNet, a Portland-area ISP offers 
some advice: "Be careful in how much infrastructure you build." He 
thinks that a large part of the reseller market is not going be around 
much longer, as the inevitable shakeout occurs. <p>

       Netcom did go public a few months ago and its IPO went well. 
During the first few days, almost 2.5 million shares changed hands at 
an average of $18/share, climbing to $28/share a few weeks later. 
But Gordon Cook, an astute industry observer and publisher of the 
The Cook Report on Internet -> NREN (cook@cookreport.com), says: "I 
would be reluctant to set up an ISP business in a major metropolitan 
area in this country....There certainly will be a shakeout." It's 
not just competition among the regional small fry, there are "ominous 
rumblings" at the national level, as the national service providers 
(NSPs) such as Sprint, MCI, AT&T, ANS, PSI, BBN, and UUNET compete with 
each other along different fronts.  <p>

       For a period of time, members of the industry consortium known 
as CIX (pronounced "kicks") tried to corner the connectivity market 
by restricting resale of bandwidth among their customers. However, 
last year, Sprint broke ranks and started providing low-cost 
connectivity to wholesalers without restrictions on resale (although 
this was never spelled out in the contract). This let to a spurt in 
growth among the small regional ISPs, like TLG and others further down 
the food chain. However, these policies can change at any time, and 
small ISPs be wiped out with an arbitrary stroke of a pen. <p>

       One hope that free and open connectivity will continue is 
startup Net99 Inc., founded by Joe Stroup and partners (http://www.net99.net). 
Although in existence less than six months with 28 employees, Net99 is 
on its way to becoming a national service provider. Stroup says: "We 
see ourselves as the reseller's reseller," adding that, unlike 
Sprint, Net99 will put the resale permission in writing.  <p>

       Although such a contract gives you, as a would-be ISP, a measure 
of confidence, the situation is also likely to change. Assuming it 
is successful, Net99 will be the the only NSP that is not owned by a 
multi-billion large corporation. This raises the question of how long can 
such a startup last without its founders succumbing to the temptation 
of being acquired. Once that happens, the prospects for the small 
access provider are again up in the air. Don't buy the Rolls-Royce just 
yet.  <p>
