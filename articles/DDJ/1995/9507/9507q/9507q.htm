At this year's Computer Game Developers Conference, Microsoft announced the Windows 95 Game SDK. Developers attending the announcement received a free beta copy of the SDK along with a beta release of Windows 95. The company hopes to gain the mindshare of game developers who have traditionally targeted DOS for their apps. Microsoft concedes that over 90 percent of the games currently on the market and in development run under DOS. Windows 3.1's sluggish display performance has been a sore point with games programmers and has been a primary reason for its slow acceptance in the game industry. The company hopes that the new features of Windows 95 along with improvements provided through the Game SDK will change that.<P>
The SDK includes a Windows 95 game subsystem to enable high-performance game play. The game subsystem, a new component of Windows 95, will eventually be included in a future release of the operating system. In the interim, developers can use the game subsystem on a royalty-free basis to create games and will have permission to redistribute the run time with their software.<P>
The SDK also features four C APIs: DirectDraw, DirectSound, DirectPlay, and DirectInput. DirectDraw supports Blt, transparent Blt, and page flipping through hardware acceleration. On a 486/66, Blts can be moved at rates up to 70 frames per second at 640x480 pixels using 256 colors. DirectSound allows mixing and playback of up to eight audio streams with full volume, frequency, and pan control over individual streams. Latency on playback has been cut from the roughly 200 milliseconds it takes for current WAV drivers to approximately 50 milliseconds. The DirectPlay API allows multiplayer games to connect either through Winsock or modem. DirectPlay  provides the functionality to open a connection, create a player, and send messages between players. This is accomplished using a &quot;send- receive-reply&quot; model. DirectInput supports digital joysticks using a mini-driver model; drivers will be supplied by individual vendors.<P>
In a related announcement, Microsoft detailed plans to include the Reality Lab real-time 3-D engine in future versions of Windows. Microsoft obtained the product through its acquisition of RenderMorphics in February of this year. Reality Lab, an API for creating and rendering 3-D graphics in real time, already takes advantage of hardware acceleration at any stage of the graphics pipeline. According to a Microsoft spokesperson, &quot;the 3-D engine will also benefit from hardware acceleration features of DirectDraw.&quot; Microsoft plans to release a beta version of Reality Lab in early 1996. Questions regarding Reality Lab can be sent to reality3@microsoft.com. <P>

3Dlabs has announced its GLINT 3D graphics-accelerator chip, which supports VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) 3-D graphics and virtual-reality applications available on the World Wide Web. Silicon Graphics (SGI), Template Graphics Software (TGS), and Netscape Communications have endorsed the accelerator for their VRML-based software. With GLINT-based graphics boards, VRML browser software will be seamlessly accelerated for a real-time 3-D experience on low-cost desktop PC systems.<P>
As part of this announcement, SGI and TGS introduced WebSpace, a VRML-based Internet browser that's an add-on module to existing Web browsers. TGS will be providing its Open Inventor SDK with VRML Internet extensions compatible with GLINT boards.<P>
Both Open Inventor and WebSpace use OpenGL as their graphics-rendering engine, and GLINT silicon was designed to enable the high-speed processing of all OpenGL commands and operations.<P>
The 3Dlabs GLINT processor incorporates the equivalent of a high-end workstation graphics board set in a single chip. Target platforms include desktop PCs, workstations, and embedded systems. GLINT is capable of processing 300,000 shaded, depth-buffered, anti-aliased polygons/sec. The chip provides 32-bit color, 2-D and 3-D acceleration, an on-chip, PCI-compliant local bus interface, and integrated LUT-DAC control, making a complete graphics subsystem possible with minimal chip count. GLINT implements sophisticated rendering operations in silicon, including Gouraud shading, depth buffering, anti-aliasing, and texture mapping.<P>

InContext has released its InContext Spider, an HTML Web processor that lets you create dynamic Web pages while browsing on the World Wide Web. The company claims that Spider, unlike other HTML editors, does not require specialized knowledge of HTML to produce valid Web documents. You can run InContext Spider on any Windows-based system, and do everything from simple text editing to creating interactive pages linked to any number of Web sites. Spider speaks directly to the browser, allowing you to create Web pages interactively by inserting URLs to other topics, or external links which connect to other sites on the Web. By using the InContext SDK with InContext Spider, you can customize the interface, making it as simple or as advanced as the work environment demands. InContext Spider retails for about $100.00.<P>

Beame &amp; Whiteside Software has announced its BW-Connect News Server for Windows NT, which will let network administrators set up and maintain network news groups on any Windows NT-based PC. BW-Connect News Server for Windows NT supports multiple Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) clients and allows administrators to synchronize messages on news servers scattered throughout a network.<P>
The software includes INN-like news extensions, such as NNTP commands (article, body, group, head, help, ihave, last, list, newsgroups, newnews, next, post, quit, slave, stat, listgroup, and xhdr). Since it is multithreaded, BW-Connect News Server for Windows NT can support an unlimited number of users; the only limitation is the capacity of the hardware platform and the memory space available. BW-Connect News Server for Windows NT also includes support for news synchronization so NNTP messages can be automatically forwarded at preset intervals to update other NNTP news servers located around the network. By using news forwarding, each news server can be synchronized to other NNTP servers so all network servers can carry the same newsgroup information, which should help localize network news traffic. Administrators will be able to set the news feeds to run fully synchronized or to only synchronize limited news groups. <P>
BW-Connect News Server for Windows NT retails for $599.00.<P>
