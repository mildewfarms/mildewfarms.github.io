Last month's issue of <I>Dr. Dobb's Developer Update</I> described how
the structural underpinnings of the Internet are being revamped via
the new version of the IP protocol. This month we look at one aspect
of the superstructure that is growing rapidly on top of the IP
technological foundation. Of the numerous applications that rest on
the TCP/IP suite of protocols--such as ftp, gopher, telnet, wais,
netnews, and irc--by far the most successful is Mosaic and its kindred
World Wide Web (WWW) browsers. According to Netscape Communications,
there are now over 3 million WWW users accessing 10,000 Web
servers--three times the number of one year ago.<P>

It was not too long ago that the Mosaic package emerged as the clear
winner in a crowded field of public-domain or non-profit Web browsers
such as Cello, Viola, Emacs-W3, Lynx, Chimera, MacWeb, WinWeb, and
OmniWeb. Mosaic was developed at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and is based on the HTTP protocols
(designed by Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN European physics facility)
that define the World Wide Web.<P>

In the December 1994 issue of <I>Dr. Dobb's Journal</I>, Ray Duncan
reviewed dozens of existing Internet books. Leafing through these
books, you'll notice that many of these discuss classic Internet
applications (ftp and its archaic ilk) with scant mention of Mosaic
and other Web browsers. This will rapidly change. Look for bookstore
shelves to sag under the weight of an upcoming flood of WWW-related
books. But book authors will be hard-pressed to keep up with
fast-moving changes in this market. For some time to come, the only
up-to-date information will be available electronically, via the Web
itself. Bob Allison, posting in comp.infosystems.www, writes:<P>

<P>

<DL><DD> The Net is the world's McLuhanesque nervous system in the
age of information, and the Web points to the future. The Web allows
us to quickly access, view and download all kinds of information,
anywhere in the world by clicking on links. No logging in, no
commands. Just as Internet email addresses are hip to put on business
cards, an http URL [a Web home page] is ever hipper, because the Web
is sexier (graphics, typography, live links, interactive forms,
etc).<P> </DL>

While Mosaic has certainly earned bragging rights as the &quot;killer
app&quot; of the Internet, it has become long in the tooth, and its
position is now being challenged by a host of new contenders. These
challengers include direct offspring from the Mosaic code base--such
as packages from O'Reilly, Spry, Spyglass, Quarterdeck, Infoseek,
Ubique, and Quadralay--as well as products that lack a bloodline
connection, such as BookLink Internetworks, IBM Web Explorer, Netcom
NetCruiser, Pipeline, and Apple's rumored &quot;Cyberdog&quot;
project. And then there's Microsoft Network, which I'll discuss a bit
later.<P>

At the moment, the principal pretender to the Mosaic throne is
Netscape Navigator, from Netscape Communications. As has been widely
reported here and elsewhere, Netscape Communications (formerly Mosaic
Communications Corp.) was founded by Marc Andreessen, the original
author of NCSA Mosaic (or, in Netscape's words, &quot;creator of the
NCSA Mosaic research prototype&quot;), together with Jim Clark,
founder and ex-CEO of Silicon Graphics (SGI), plus a host of talented
engineers hired away from NCSA and SGI. Although the company was only
founded in April 1994, it has already released a beta version of its
Web browser. Version 0.9 of Netscape Navigator has been available
since early October from ftp.mcom.com and several other ftp
sites. Version 0.93 was recently released, for Windows, Mac, X
(including Linux).<P>

Netscape Navigator has quickly become the Web browser of choice, given
that it is free, fast, and robust. The company has stated that Version
1.0 will also be free, for personal use. What does it do that NCSA
Mosaic doesn't? At the moment, not much. One early user says:
&quot;There isn't anything particularly new in it, it's basically just
an industrial-strength version of Mosaic.&quot; Reducing the bug count
is nothing to sneer at, however. NCSA Mosaic is not known for being
bug free, although it has a better reputation than some of its other
university-bred brethren. Another user adds:<P>

<DL><DD> There's only so much that a browser can do given a
vanilla server and standard HTTP. But pair a proprietary browser with
a proprietary server, doing clever negotiation between themselves,
then you've got something interesting.<P></DL>

This is exactly what Netscape Communications is planning. Due for
imminent release is an industrial-strength Web server--actually, two
servers: Netsite Communications Server, a basic Web server priced
at $1495, and Netsite Commerce Server, a $5000 product that allows for
commercial transactions and the exchange of sensitive data on the
Internet via enhanced security, encryption, and authentication
features.<P>

Navigator V0.93 has built-in proprietary security features that
support Netscape's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) extension to the HTTP
protocol. The encryption and authentication facilities (using
technology licensed from RSA Data Security) go beyond the basic HTTP
access authorization now in use at a number of Web sites (for example,
Wired magazine's popular HotWired site). This basic access
authorization is supported in many other browsers. The SSL layers over
HTTP and can layer over any TCP/IP protocol, such as NNTP, FTP, and so
on. SSL is different from a similar proposal by Enterprise Integration
Technologies (EIT), called Secure-HTTP (SHTTP). Marc Andreessen
writes: &quot;SHTTP and SSL have different motivations and provide
different capabilities; however, we all have a common interest in
interoperability.&quot;<P>

When the first beta of Navigator was released, there was a flurry of
speculation in the comp.infosystems.www newsgroup that perhaps parts
of the original NCSA codebase had found their way into
Navigator. Suspicions arose because, when Navigator crashed, the
following message would appear: &quot;Mosaic caused a General
Protection Fault at_&quot; Users found you could not launch both NCSA
Mosaic and Navigator on Windows at the same time, because NCSA Mosaic
would complain that you can only have &quot;one copy of Mosaic&quot;
running at a time, due to having the same Windows instance
name. However, Jon Mittelhauser of Netscape explained:<P>

<DL><DD> The original name [of Navigator] was going to be
MosaicXS. The executable was originally named mosaic.exe so that it
could share an existing NCSA Mosaic INI file. The executable name is
stored in the DEF file and this is what we missed during the name
change. This was changed at the last minute to avoid confusion with
the NCSA product. We, unfortunately, didn't catch all occurrences of
the name, which led to confusion.<P></DL>

<P>

But one user noted:<P>

<DL><DD>Both Mosaic and Netscape have an identical bug. If you are
scrolled down into a page and then jump to another page that is
shorter than the first page, the scroll bar doesn't get reset to the
top of the document. What are the odds of reproducing this exact
broken behavior twice?<P></DL>

<P>

Guy Harris, who is not affiliated with Netscape, provides an answer:<P>

<DL><DD> [The odds are] fairly good, if the same person implemented
the HTML-viewer widget in both Mosaic and Netscape_ It's certainly
possible for a person to make the same error when doing implementation
#2 of something that they made when doing implementation #1, or even
for two different implementors to make the same error.<P></DL>

Netscape Communications is perhaps the most visible company offering a
Web browser, but it is by no means the only one. Another promising
contender that has also stormed out of the starting gate is the
Internetworks package from BookLink Technologies. Like Netscape
Communications, BookLink is a startup that spun off an established
organization, in this case Interleaf, a Massachusetts-based, high-end
electronic-publishing vendor. BookLink Technologies presently
numbers about 20 people, compared to Netscape's 75. Both companies are
top-heavy with engineering talent. Like Netscape, BookLink was
demonstrating a highly functional package within a few months of its
founding; the company was started in March 1994 and demonstrated its
impressively fast browser in June. Part of the reason for the
extremely short implementation time may be that most Web browsers
consist of user-interface code sitting on top of a sizable existing
library: libWWW from CERN, which was placed into the public domain by
Tim Berners-Lee. The original NCSA Mosaic is only 9000 lines of
code.<P>

The distinguishing features of the BookLink browser are: speed,
multithreading (which allows simultaneous multiple data- transfer
sessions in an unlimited number of windows), multipaned windows that
allow different documents in each window, progressive rendering of
graphical elements (GIFs) so that you don't have to wait to see the
completed page, persistent caching of rendered pages so that you don't
wait for redraws, and extensive support of OLE 2 features, including
OLE Automation. The OLE support allows you to drag-and-drop a Web page
into Microsoft Word, then later double-click on that element and
navigate the Web from your memo or document. With the possible
exception of OLE support, which has to be designed in from the outset,
it's likely that Netscape Navigator will soon incorporate desirable
features found in Internetworks, and vice versa. Like Netscape, the
software is available for free via the Internet, from
ftp.booklink.com. Unlike Netscape, this free version is a
reduced-functionality version (Internetworks Lite). Jane Lennon of
Booklink says that the company is also implementing a server to
accompany the browser, but could not reveal more details at this
time. Although Internetworks is now only available for Windows, Lennon
says a Mac version will appear in a few months.<P>

BookLink passed below most people's radar until America Online
recently bought the company in a stock swap valued around $30M, which
is about $1.5M per employee if it were equally divided (chances are a
good portion of that went to Booklink's parent company, CMG). In any
case, not bad for six months of work.<P>

This king's ransom will turn out to be a bargain if it enables America
Online to survive the onslaught of Microsoft Network (formerly
&quot;Marvel&quot;). Microsoft Network, recently unveiled by Bill
Gates in his Comdex keynote address, is now part of the M7 beta of
Windows 95 (formerly &quot;Chicago&quot;). Microsoft has reportedly
predicted that 35 million Windows 3.x users will upgrade to Windows 95
in the first year, and of these, 10 percent will connect to Microsoft
Network, resulting in an installed base three times larger than the
major online services (Compuserve, Prodigy, America Online). America
Online's stock has fluctuated in response to Microsoft's perceived and
actual movements, dropping 13 percent in value after a single story on
Marvel appeared in the Wall Street Journal.<P>

All this is not lost on Marc Andreessen, who reportedly views Bill
Gates as his primary competitor. The established PC software
companies, such as Lotus, Novell, Borland, and Symantec are no match
for the Microsoft army. Only by mustering the world-wide resources of
the Internet, namely the legions of talented hackers working for
something other than cash, can the giant of Redmond be
challenged. Perhaps hedging its bets, Netscape Communications recently
announced that MCI's new Internet service, internetMCI, will use
Navigator as its front end.<P>

Although both Windows 95 and NT include TCP/IP support, neither will
provide Internet-specific applications such as a Web browser. However,
Microsoft strategists are well aware of reasons behind the Internet's
tremendous growth and seek to leverage some of that energy by an open
business model, different from the closed models of newly launched
online services like Ziff Interchange and Apple's eWorld. Note that
this business model is open only with respect to publishing
information, not to consuming it (that is, users must possess Windows
95 to join the party). This match between an Internet-style
free-for-all versus Microsoft's more disciplined approach will become
increasingly interesting over the next few months.<P>
