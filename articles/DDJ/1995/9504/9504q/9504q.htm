Surety Technologies has announced the Digital Notary System, an Internet-accessible system that securely certifies the contents of digital documents and electronic records. The system works by affixing a secure digital time-stamp without revealing the document's contents to a third party. The Digital Notary System can be used to certify any digital document: word processing files, text documents, database records, e-mail messages, spreadsheet files, graphic images, audio or video recordings, or any other kind of electronic files. The company claims that the Digital Notary System is to electronic records what a notary public is to paper records. <P>
The Digital Notary System, which was developed and patented by Scott Stornetta and Stuart Haber, is based on the one-way-hashing cryptographic technique. In the certification process, the Digital Notary software creates a unique &quot;digital fingerprint&quot; for each electronic document and sends the fingerprint to a Digital Notary coordinating server over the Internet, a leased line, or an ISDN connection. Based on information sent back by the server, the Digital Notary software then issues time-stamped certificates for electronic documents and stores the certificates in a local Digital Notary database. The entire certification process takes only seconds, and the document stays on the user's computer. No one can alter or backdate the document in the record. The Digital Notary software has an API so that developers can integrate it with other software in a network or other computing environments. <P>
A special single-user version, called the &quot;Personal Edition for Windows,&quot; is available over the Internet via ftp to ftp.surety.com or by downloading it from Surety's World Wide Web home page at http://www.surety.com. The Personal Edition software, account setup, and 50 certificates sells for $49.00. Users can order additional Digital Notary certificates over the Internet for $37.50/50 certificates. A Personal Edition for SunSPARC systems is forthcoming.<P>

Wolfram has introduced an add-on package to its Mathematica programming environment, which aids engineers working on laser designs and other optical systems. The package, called &quot;Optica,'' features 3-D ray tracing, symbolic parameter manipulation, publication-quality graphics, and a set of standard optical components which can be customized. These components include lenses, mirrors, prisms, optical fibers, screens, pinholes, and gratings. Predefined surfaces include spherical, cylindrical, parabolic, and elliptical. Source code is also included for both built-in components and functions, allowing developers to design, model, and analyze virtually any optical system. <P>
Optica draws on Mathematica's capabilities for equation solving, visualization, and animation. Mathematica is a high-level programming environment that provides hundreds of built-in functions to perform a broad range of mathematical operations and is capable of numeric, symbolic, and graphical computation. Mathematica also allows users to create documents that combine text, 2- and 3-D graphics, and animation to create technical reports, blueprints, and the like.<P>
Optica is available for Windows, Windows NT, Macintosh, Power Macintosh, Silicon Graphics, SunSPARC, Solaris, NextStep, HP 700 Series, IBM RISC System/ 6000, DEC MIPS, and OSF/1AXP. The software sells for $695.00.<P>

With products such as Visual C++ completely abandoning their MS-DOS constituencies, it is rare to find new development products for the DOS programmers--particularly high-end products. Nevertheless, Borland has quietly begun shipping its Power Pack for DOS, a collection of development tools aimed at high-end developers still working in MS-DOS. The product comprises 16- and 32-bit DOS extenders, and two older libraries updated for 16- and 32-bit protected mode. It also includes the Turbo Vision C++ class library and the Borland Graphics Interface (BGI) library.<P>
The DOS extenders are based on the same technology that Borland has long used in its protected-mode compilers and database tools. The extenders rely on DPMI 0.9, which, if absent, is simulated by a Borland utility. Borland has made some unique extensions to the DOS extenders. The 16-bit extender uses the same executable file format as Windows 3.x and OS/2 1.x. Because of this compatibility, DOS programs can make calls to Windows DLLs or generate and use Windows-compatible DLLs of their own. To make use of Windows DLLs, the Borland run-time manager (shipped with the Power Pack) implements a subset of the Windows API. This subset consists primarily of the memory-management routines and some ancillary functions.<P>
The 32-bit extender uses the Portable Executable (PE) format. It, too, supports DLLs and implements a sizable portion of Win32--eliminating Windows-specific functions, multithreading, and multitasking capabilities. Under Windows NT, the 32-bit applications can only run in console mode. Both extenders offer virtual memory with swapping to disk.<P>
The BGI libraries are protected-mode versions of Borland's graphical libraries; while Turbo Vision 2.0 is an update to Borland's C++ class library for character-mode interfaces. The Power Pack can be seamlessly integrated into Borland's C++ IDE, provided that the environment is version 4.02 or later. The software sells for $99.95.<P>
