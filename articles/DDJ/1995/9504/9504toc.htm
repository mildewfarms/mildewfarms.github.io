<h2>FEATURES </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9504a/9504a.htm">IMAGE AUTHENTICATION FOR A SLIPPERY NEW AGE</A></h3><P>
<i>by Steve Walton</i><P>
Is seeing really believing anymore? Can we trust images as evidence of true events? The answer is generally &quot;no,&quot; although image-authentication algorithms do make it possible to tell whether or not an image has been modified. Steve describes and implements a class of algorithms that makes it possible to authenticate digital images.<P>
<h3><a href="9504b/9504b.htm">THE DETRIMENTAL WIRE-EXCLUSION HEURISTIC</A></h3><P>
<i>by Paul J. Martino</i><P>
Combinatorial optimization involves finding the optimal solution to problems such as computer wiring and the now-familiar traveling-salesman problem. Paul presents a heuristic that's efficient and portable. <P>
<h3><a href="9504c/9504c.htm">THE BMP FILE FORMAT, PART 2</A></h3><P>
<i>by David Charlap</i><P>
In last month's installment of this two-part article, David examined how the &quot;standard&quot; BMP file format has been implemented differently on different platforms. This month, he explains how to use the structures to read and interpret bits.<P>
<h3><a href="9504d/9504d.htm">DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH UNIFICATION </A></h3><P>
<i>by David Perelman-Hall</i><P>
David describes and implements an object-oriented method of enacting a constraint system, which has been adapted from directed acyclic graph unification. Although he implements this approach for a natural-language parsing system, it can be used in applications as well.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9504e/9504e.htm">ABOVE-REAL-TIME TRAINING AND THE HYPER-TIME ALGORITHM</A></h3><P>
<i>by Dutch Guckenberger, Liz Guckenberger, Frank Luongo, Kay Stanney and Jose Sepulveda.</i><P>
The hyper-time algorithm lets you alter the flow of &quot;simulated time&quot; to benefit users--slower than real time can be used for novice users, while faster than real time can be used for experts or persons &quot;time surfing&quot; over uninteresting portions of information. Applying the algorithm to &quot;Above-Real-Time Training&quot; also improves human performance, increases retention and training-device effectiveness, and decreases stress. <P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9504f/9504f.htm">A POP3 MAIL CLIENT USING WINSOCK</A></h3><P>
<i>by Robert A. Duffy</i><P>
Robert presents a C++ foundation for Internet client applications running on Windows. In doing so, he implements a mail client that understands the Post Office Protocol (POP), a powerful Internet protocol for processing e-mail. <P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9504g/9504g.htm">BORLAND C++ 4.5 AND OLE 2.0 PROGRAMMING</A></h3><P>
<i>by Ted Faison</i><P>
In examining the recently released Borland C++ 4.5, Ted focuses on its OLE 2.0 support, using it to create an OLE server that he then embeds into a Word for Windows 6.0 document. <P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9504h/9504h.htm">SERIALIZATION AND MFC</A></h3><P>
<i>by Chane Cullens</i><P>
Serialization is the process of writing or reading one or more objects to or from a persistent-storage medium, such as a disk file. Chane examines MFC's serialization mechanism and what it offers cross-platform developers.<P>
<h2>COLUMNS </h2><P>
<h3><a href="9504i/9504i.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS </A></h3><P>
<i>by Michael Swaine</i><P>
Michael takes a look-see at what's new with visual programming.<P>
<h3><a href="9504j/9504j.htm">C PROGRAMMING </A></h3><P>
<i>by Al Stevens</i><P>
Al analyzes the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), then wraps up his text-search project by discussing the C source-code module of the interface between the Visual Basic front end and the Windows DLL that implements the search engine. <P>
<h3><a href="9504k/9504k.htm">ALGORITHM ALLEY </A></h3><P>
<i>edited by Bruce Schneier</i><P>
In this month's &quot;Algorithm Alley,&quot; Kim Larsen presents a simple yet clever approach for computing the correct day of the week. <P>
<h3><a href="9504l/9504l.htm">UNDOCUMENTED CORNER</A></h3><P>
<i>edited by Andrew Schulman</i><P>
Tim unravels the floating-point-division algorithm that Intel didn't quite implement correctly with its Pentium processor. <P>
<h3><a href="9504m/9504m.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF </A></h3><P>
