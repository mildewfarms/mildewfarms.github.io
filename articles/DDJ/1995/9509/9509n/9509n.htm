<h2>Nontraditional Education Alternatives</h2><P>
<h3>Jonathan Erickson</h3><P>
<a name="012f_005d"><a name="012f_0000">As with just about every other part of society, digital communications is changing the face of higher education. In fact, no less an authority than Stanford University President Gerhard Casper has said, that as the electronic revolution shortens the course of studies and lowers the cost, educators, students, and taxpayers have to wonder if the &quot;physical&quot; university will be worth attending in the future. <P>
Digital classroom instruction has become commonplace at most universities around the country. As an example, Casper points to medical schools where CD-ROMs with &quot;virtual corpses&quot; have replaced real cadavers for anatomical instruction. There's little doubt, Casper said in a recent annual State of the University address, that some CD-ROMs are superior to classroom &quot;talking heads.&quot; Still, the real impact of digital communication is being felt in the area of &quot;distance learning,&quot; where teachers, students, and resources are dispersed--not just in location, but also in time. In typical distance-learning scenarios, students &quot;attend&quot; courses at universities hundreds or thousands of miles away. Instead of attending lectures with other bleary-eyed classmates, distance-learning students attend their classes where and when they want to. And increasingly, they are using the Internet or BBSs to communicate with instructors, submit homework, and take exams. The college credits they earn are just as valid as those granted to their traditional, on-campus counterparts.<P>
There are those who would argue that for students leaving home for the first time, the university environment--from dorm life to football in the fall--is often as important as an introduction to, say, Hegel. But Internet-based distance learning can expand the scope of university programs (especially at smaller colleges) by providing access to individuals and resources around the world.<P>
With this in mind, perhaps the greatest potential for distance learning exists for individuals who want (or need) to return to school. Perhaps you want to hone existing skills--or acquire new ones--and don't have time to attend a traditional university program. Maybe you have the time, but an acceptable university program isn't conveniently accessible. Maybe you just enjoy structured learning programs. In such cases, nontraditional educational programs may be your best option. <P>
In the past, nontraditional education programs were associated with trade-school correspondence courses advertised on the inside of matchbook covers. Now, however, independent study programs are offered by most colleges and universities in the country. Need a few credits to supplement your work with user interfaces? The Rochester Institute of Technology offers bachelors and masters degrees by nontraditional methods--videocassettes, e-mail, cable TV, courses on disk, and the like--in everything from graphic arts to computer science. Want to pick up some business credits so that you can slide into management? Check out the MBA programs offered by Syracuse University or the University of Pittsburgh. Want a master's degree in engineering from Stanford University, an MS in computer science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, or a master's in mathematics from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst? You can do it, even if you live on the other side of the world. <P>
So where do you go to find out about nontraditional programs offered by universities? The best place to start is <I>Bear's Guide to Earning College Degrees Nontraditionally</I>, by John Bear and Mariah Bear. First published in 1974, this book  provides information ranging from equivalency exams to financial aid. The heart of the book, however, is its descriptions of courses and programs offered by universities and colleges around the world; see <a href="#012f_005f">Example 1</A>.<P>
Pay particular attention to the term &quot;accreditation.&quot; Reputable school programs are accredited (validated) by agencies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Among the regional accrediting agencies are the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Professional accrediting agencies include the Computer Science Accreditation Board or the Accrediting Board for Engineering and Technology. Accrediting agencies typically evaluate schools or programs on the basis of their curricula, faculty, facilities, program length, tuition, fees, academic objectives, credit received, and so on. Not all programs covered by Bear and Bear are accredited; others have been accredited by some pretty obscure agencies.<P>
Not being accredited doesn't mean a program isn't any good (it may be too new for accreditation). However, accreditation does provide you with an official stamp of approval. It is significant that Bear and Bear devote a 15-page chapter to the subject. If you're serious about completing a program of study for an advanced degree, you'll be making a significant investment of time, effort, and money. Investing your resources in a fly-by-night diploma mill may not pay off in the long run. <P>
<I>High-Technology Degree Alternatives</I>, by Joel Butler, also devotes a chapter to the topic of accreditation. Butler, however, only describes programs accredited by recognized agencies. In general, however, <I>High-Technology Degree Alternatives</I> is more focused than <I>Bear's Guide</I>. Butler zeros in on strategies for earning a degree while working. As the title suggests, he also limits coverage to high-tech careers--engineering, programming, and the like. While Butler's book covers much of the same ground as the Bears', his discussion of turning company-sponsored training sessions into college credits, or earning credit from professional certificates and licenses is particularly valuable if you're already in the work force. And, as you'd expect from a more narrowly focused book, Butler presents dozens of program descriptions in a standardized format; see <a href="#012f_0060">Example 2</A>. <P>
Both books suffer when it comes to timeliness. Distance-learning programs are rapidly evolving, and books such as these have a difficult time keeping up. Since new programs come online and existing ones disappear all the time, you should use these books as a pointer rather than the final word. In particular, the recent surge in Internet-based programs isn't reflected in either book. For instance, an art-appreciation course offered by Penn State via the World Wide Web is not mentioned. Also, I called numerous listings in the Bear book and found a number of minor discrepancies in phone or fax numbers, programs offered, and the like. <P>
Similarly, there are programs that, for whatever reason, both books fail to mention. For instance, the University of Missouri at Columbia's Independent Study Program isn't discussed at all. Offering dozens of courses across all disciplines, the MU program provides a dial-up BBS for communicating with faculty, submitting homework, and taking exams. Individual professors at the university are also interacting via the Internet with students as far away as Germany. <P>
If there's any question in your mind whether or not nontraditional distance learning works, be assured that it does. One frequent <I>DDJ </I>contributor is about to finish a PhD through Nova Southeastern University, and he's loved every minute of it. For my part, I've completed over 30 credits (the equivalent of a full year of course work) through the aforementioned University of Missouri Center for Independent Study. I found that when I took the courses I wanted at my own speed and on my own time, I enjoyed the learning process much more than in my days as a full-time student.<P>
Stanford's Gerhard Casper was only partially right when he said that the beauty of the Internet is that it &quot;makes it unnecessary for students to travel long distances.&quot; The beauty of digital communication in general, and the Internet in particular, is that it brings education to students, letting us explore, learn, and grow in ways that are more meaningful to ourselves.<P>

Nova University has one of the more nontraditional doctoral programs ever to achieve regional accreditation. The typical student attends one group meeting a month (generally two or three days), plus two one-week residential sessions, and from three to six practica which emphasize direct application of research to the workplace. Total time: about three-and-a-half years. The university also offers a Doctor of Arts in information science in which students use interactive computers. A major part of instruction in this program is through teleconferencing, TELNET, and TYMENET. Residential work has been offered in 23 states. Nova will consider offering the program in the continental United States wherever a cluster of 20-25 students can be formed. Formerly Nova University; they recently merged with Southeastern Medical School, hence the name change.<P>
