Microsoft has licensed MPEG software- playback technology from Mediamatics for inclusion in future versions of Windows. This will enable users to experience TV-like video and CD-quality sound without special add-on hardware. MPEG is a compression/decompression (codec) system for compressing full-screen, VHS-quality digital video and CD-quality audio into small files. Currently, Windows 95-based MPEG video playback performance from CD-ROMs on 90-MHz Pentium-class computers is approximately 24 frames per second with 11-kHz audio. <P>

SQA has announced object-level support for the testing of all Visual Basic objects and Visual Basic custom controls (VBXs) in its SQA TeamTest tool. With SQA TeamTest's support for VBXs, you simply click on the VBX while running SQA TeamTest. All properties and data of that VBX are displayed, allowing you to create a baseline for testing subsequent builds of the application. SQA's VBX testing technology requires no modifications to the application being tested. In addition, SQA TeamTest allows users to edit the baseline data during test recording, changing any data or properties.<P>

S3 Inc. has announced a new multimedia chipset based on its &quot;cooperative accelerator architecture&quot; which, the company claims, offers TV-quality video and CD-quality audio for desktop applications. S3's three-chip offering is hardware that integrates graphics, audio, and MPEG onto the PC motherboard.<P>
S3's Cooperative Accelerator Architecture divides the work between dedicated S3 hardware and software executing on the PC's CPU to provide enhanced graphics and MPEG-based video and audio performance. The result is TV-quality, full-screen 30 frames-per-second (FPS) live video or MPEG video, and CD-quality audio. The S3 Streams Processor uses parallel processing to provide the broadcast-quality special effects and greatly reduced response times required for graphics-packed interactive games and multimedia titles.<P>

Microsoft has announced that Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server Version 3.51 includes support for PowerPC-based systems. PowerPC becomes the fourth platform supported by Windows NT (others include Intel, DEC Alpha AXP, and MIPS). Hardware vendors planning to sell Windows NT on the PowerPC include FirePower Systems, IBM, IPC Technologies, Motorola Computer Group, and Reply Corp. During the next few months, Microsoft plans to release development tools for the PowerPC, including Visual C++, Microsoft Test, and SNA Server. <P>
Windows NT Server 3.51 also contains the upgraded Network Client Administrator utility, making it easier for customers to deploy Windows 95. The expanded utility allows administrators to create a boot disk to install Windows 95 over the network.<P>

The Multimedia PC Working Group has released the Multimedia PC Level 3 Specification, an updated standard for Multimedia PCs. The new standard includes improved sound and video performance requirements. <P>
Minimum requirements for MPC3 include support for MPEG1 plus software-implemented video codecs, a 75-MHz Pentium or similar processor, quadruple-speed CD-ROM drive, and wavetable sound. The new requirements will provide hardware that delivers full-screen, full-motion video, and enhanced CD-quality sound while playing demanding multimedia programs. MPC3 does not replace MPC2, which was released in 1993. Software that runs on MPC- and MPC2-compliant hardware will also run on MPC3-compliant hardware. <P>
The Multimedia PC Working Group will provide hardware test suites to measure MPC3 compliance. The test suites, produced in cooperation with the National Software Testing Laboratories, check for individual component compliance as well as total system performance. The tests establish whether the computer is delivering MPC compliance in the key areas of processing speed, video playback, graphics performance, and audio. <P>

California Software is shipping InterAp, a set of integrated and customizable windows applications for accessing services and information on the Internet. InterAp includes several &quot;intelligent agents&quot; that automate many Internet processes for searching and retrieving information on the Internet, and then publishing the results in many useful ways. These agents may also be integrated with existing windows applications, or with other InterAp applications, including the World Wide Web Navigator, Telnet, FTP, and secure mail messaging.<P>
InterAp's intelligent agents are based on the published NetScripts API and are designed to do many of the repetitive and time-consuming Internet tasks. They work in conjunction with the scheduler to perform these tasks in attended or unattended modes. Once the information is found, it can be received in the form of an e-mail message or formatted and published as a Word document or Excel spreadsheet. Four intelligent agents ship with the toolkit: NetNews Wizard, which enables the user to conduct key word searches through NetNews articles; Web Publisher, which provides users with the ability to do research on the Internet by automatically accessing information published on the World Wide Web; FTP Publisher, which automates the FTP process and allows users to intelligently move binary and text files around the Internet; and Mail Publisher, which scans the to, from, subject, and text fields of incoming messages and then redistributes messages to a defined list of recipients.<P>
The intelligent agents supplied within InterAp are Visual Basic programs that can be further integrated with existing applications or used to create new agents using Visual Basic, Visual C++, and other programming languages. Programmers can develop customized agents that match their own business model using the NetScripts API reference guide. InterAp sells for $99.95. <P>

Ryan McFarland has announced VanGui for RM/Cobol, an interface builder that uses Visual Basic custom control (VBXs) for building Windows-based front ends for Cobol applications. VanGui consists of two major components: a design tool and a run-time system. The design tool is a Windows app that provides Cobol developers with the capability to define windows, populate those windows with standard Windows and VBX controls, adjust the properties of the controls, and attach Cobol event-handling logic to the events. The run-time system is a Windows DLL that manages Windows messages, provides run-time support for the controls, and provides a Cobol interface to the Windows API. <P>
