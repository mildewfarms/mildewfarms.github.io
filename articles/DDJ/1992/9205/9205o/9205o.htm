<a name="0106_0002"><a name="0106_0000">Maybe it's time for computer industry movers and shakers to step back and see what they can learn from other industries  the airline business, for instance. There are a lot of practices airlines adhere to that no enterprise should emulate. so let's narrow it down to. say, handling legal disputes.<P>
A case in point is the recent squabble between Southwest Airlines of Dallas and Stevens Aviation of Greenville. South Carolina over the use of an advertising slogan. When I first saw Southwest's motto &quot;Just Plane Smart&quot; a few months ago, I thought it was pretty clever. Lawyers and copywriters at Stevens must have agreed, because their company has been using the catch-phrase &quot;Plane Smart&quot; for quite a while.<P>
Instead of slugging it out in court for a few years, the two companies took a logical and refreshing step they decided to arm wrestle for the rights to the slogan.<P>
The rules were simple: a best-of-three contest between the chairmen of both companies, winner take all. After two rounds (both companies brought in ringers, including a former Texas arm- wrestling champion), the match was tied when Southwest's chairman. Herb Kelleher, 61, grasped the mitt of Stevens chairman Kurt Herwald, 38, who happens to lift weights as a hobby. Herwald easily pinned Kelleher (who was jokingly carried away on a stretcher), while Stevens walked away with the rights to the slogan. In a Texas-size gesture, Herwald granted Southwest the rights to continue using &quot;Just Plane Smart.&quot; Both companies won. They got tons of good publicity, had some fun, and got back to the business they know best-running airlines. (The next chance I get. I'll fly Southwest.)<P>
Let's now suppose that computer industry disputes could be handled in the same fashion and, for the sake of example, a good place to start might be the beef between Apple and Microsoft. At the core of this long-running proceeding is Apple's claim that Microsoft Windows infringes on Apple copyrights. (Apple recently amended its claim and is now asking for $5.55 billion: $3.12 billion for supposedly lost profits resulting from reduced sales and lower selling prices of Apple products, and $2.43 billion because Windows-based products such as Excel for Windows and Word for Windows have cut into Apple sales.)<P>
I can see it now. John Sculley-nose-to-nose, cheek-to-cheek, mano-a-mano--with Bill Gates, winner take all. They could meet halfway, perhaps on stage at the Shakespeare festival in Medford, Oregon, and they could bring their seconds, maybe Steve Ballmer from Microsoft and Debi Coleman from Apple. (My money's on Coleman.) The rules would be the same as with Southwest vs. Stevens but with--you guessed it--handshaking protocol.<P>
<h3><a name="0106_0004">The Handwriting on the Wall (Well okay, on page 96)<a name="0106_0004"></h3><P>
In conjunction with Ron Avitzur's article on handprinting recognition last month, we announced the upcoming DDJ Recognition Contest. Details of the contest have been finalized and are described on page 96 of this issue. We're looking forward to your participation, and as we said last month, its time to start your recognition engines.<P>
<h3><a name="0106_0005">Paying for the Free Press with a Rubber Check<a name="0106_0005"></h3><P>
The same bunch that made it politically correct to write bad checks has another rubber ace up its collective sleeve, one that might eventually make it possible for them to hush up scandals like that currently bouncing around Washington.<P>
House Resolution 2407, a bill designed to guard federally funded animal research, is the wolf in sheep's clothing. This measure would prohibit anyone from giving research materials to unauthorized persons. More frightening, HR 2407 would establish criminal penalties against the press for publishing said information. If, for example. a whistle-blower leaked information to a newspaper, the newspaper and reporter could be prosecuted for publishing the story.<P>
Legitimate security concerns aside, HR 2407 would set unheard of precedents. If laws like this currently existed, for instance, we'd never have known of House members' right to bounce checks. Of course, that would've been fine with those members who didn't suffer from writer's block.<P>
