<a name="0131_0007">Double Click Software has announced Winix, a visual UNIX toolkit for Windows. The development environment, which runs under Windows, presents a visual, point-and-click interface for each UNIX tool in the toolkit that makes it easy for experienced UNIX programmers to develop Windows 3 apps. The tools allow you to: point and click between directories, perform operations on text files, and use the notation of regular expressions to search for, filter, and replace information.<P>
Winix also aids in advanced operations that require stringing commands together via the UNIX scripting language. The graphic symbols for each tool are linked with a click of the mouse. The, flow of text, generated by each operation can be visually directed to files, windows, or subsequent operations; when text is directed to a window, Winix automatically calls its text browser so that the results can be reviewed.<P>
Winix is available for $35, a free copy of Double Click's DCedit text editor for Windows is included as an introductory offer. Reader service no. 23.<P>

FLL 3.2. <a name="0131_0008">Fifo Elcktronik's serial communications analyzer, uses standard serial ports COM1 and COM2 to debug, log, and generate asynchronous data. Incoming bidirectional data is logged in hex/ASCII format, allowing detection of normally unprintable characters, while a programmable trigger facility avoids unnecessary data sampling.<P>
Data can be transmitted from the keyboard, files, or user-programmable strings. Together, the trigger and the string-transinission feature can transmit a string as a response to received data. Control signal inputs are monitored continuously on screen, and outputs are set as needed.<P>
The FLL BreakOut Box (FLLBOB) is an additional option that can be used to simplifv the physical connection to the serial line. Supports standard baud rates of up to 115,200.<P>
FLL 3.2 retails for $95; FLLBOB costs $195. Reader service no. 24.<P>
