A new version of Dolphin Encrypt, a private-key encryption system that uses an 8-60 character encryption key, is available from Dolphin Software.  Dolphin Encrypt can encrypt multiple files in a single operation without limit on size, type, or number of files.  Files are compressed during encryption.<P>
Dolphin Encrypt can be run from a batch file to encrypt or decrypt multiple files in multiple subdirectories with a single command.  You can encrypt to binary, text, or a script language which allows complex and conditional encryption operations.  A recoverability option is included to allow the encryption key to be recovered if it is lost or becomes unavailable.<P>
The encryption algorithm encrypts files at about 8 Kbytes per second and produces encrypted data indistinguishable from random bytes.  This is available separately as a C-function library.<P>
Dolphin Encrypt sells for $195.00.  A decryption-only version that can be sent to recipients of encrypted material is sold separately.  Reader service no. 24.<P>

Otter Research has released AUTODIF, an array-language extension to C++.  AUTODIF incorporates the reverse mode of automatic differentiation to calculate the derivatives of a function of one or many variables.  Derivative calculations take no more than five times the time needed to evaluate the function itself, even with hundreds of independent variables, and derivatives are calculated to the same precision as the function itself.<P>
Using AUTODIF's vector and matrix classes, you can produce tight, efficient code for rapid prototyping of nonlinear models.  There are no restrictions on allowable code constructions; AUTODIF features backward compatibility with C code so that existing numerical routines written in C can be incorporated in minutes.  Included are methods and examples for implementing robust nonlinear regression techniques; sample code for defining and training a feed-forward neural network with hidden layers and nodes; and Quasi-Newton and conjugate-gradient function-minimization routines.<P>
AUTODIF for Borland and Zortech C++ costs $149.00; for the cfront C++ translator for SPARCstations the price is $299.00.  Reader service no. 26.<P>

<h3><a name="0173_0003"><a name="0173_0004">The DDJ Handprinting Recognition Contest<a name="0173_0004"></h3><P>
Last month we announced that DDJ is conducting a first-ever contest of handwriting-recognition software.  Here's an update with some truly exciting news: Apple Computer is providing a PowerBook 100 as first prize.  Many observers agree that the PowerBook series represents the state of the art in mobile graphical computing, so it's only fitting that a contest involving emerging technology begin with the current best of the breed.<P>
Recapping some of the contest details; the contest officially begins on June 15th, when source code, test data, and contest entry blank will be available electronically and by mail. Some components are available now, so contact us now for more information.  The deadline for submissions is September 15th.  We'll announce a winner in our December 1992 issue.<P>
Remember that you don't need a pen computer or pen operating system to participate in the contest.  We've built a platform-independent test harness that, in the most general case, allows you to plug in your C function and check the result.<P>
The core code of the test harness consists of 200 lines of C, and was written by Ron Avitzur to run as a batch process using the standard I/O library functions.  This code has been tested on the Macintosh, SPARC, and DOS platforms.  On the PC, the code compiles with both Borland and Microsoft compilers.<P>
The harness processes a data file containing stored &quot;ink&quot; (stylus data points).  The data in this file represents characters that were captured with an interactive program, from at least a dozen different individuals.  The test alphabet consists of alphanumeric characters and some punctuation marks.  There are multiple instances of each character, some of which are used for training the recognizer (if your engine requires this), and the rest for testing.<P>
During the training phase, the test harness reads multiple instances of a character and, for each instance, calls your recognizer's training routine, Train().  Then, during the testing phase, the harness calls your recognizer's recognition routine, Guess(), with a different set of instances of each character.  Both Train() and Guess() are passed pointers to an in-memory data structure representing the strokes that compose a character.  Your routines must know how to parse this data structure.  To serve as a guide, we are publishing both the test harness and a sample recognizer that works with that harness.  The harness, sample recognizer, and a small data file are all available now.<P>
Of course, it's more fun to work with the system interactively and to visually inspect the data that the system is munching on, but this is not essential to the process.  Ron has implemented an interactive ink-capture program that currently runs on the Macintosh and assumes the Wacom digitizer.  A version of this program appeared with Ron's article in the April issue of DDJ.  That version stored ink data in processed form rather than as raw-data points; now available is an updated version that reads and writes raw ink data files.  We are in the process of writing an equivalent program for Microsoft Windows, to be ready by June 15th.<P>
