In addition to announcing support of Microsoft C7 and Borland C++ 3.1, MultiScope has released its debugger for OS/2 2.0.  The OS/2 2.0 version offers full 32-bit support and the ability to debug Presentation Manager (PM) applications with a PM-hosted debugger.  New features include an advanced message-spying capability, complete use of the 80386/486 processor's watch-point debugging capabilities, a VCR-style remote-control interface for allocating most of the PM screen to the application, and network debugging over any NetBIOS-compatible network.<P>
Also included are a runtime debugging capability for controlling program execution and a Crash Analyzer System with MED (Monitor Execution and DUMP), a utility to be sent to Beta sites for testing.  If the application crashes, a dump file is automatically created.  The developer can then run the file through the Crash Analyzer Debugger to determine the cause of the crash.<P>
MultiScope Debuggers for OS/2 2.0 retails for $449; upgrades are $129.00.  Reader service no. 21.<P>

The Michaelangelo VRAM 1280 graphic accelerator from IOcomm is a Windows accelerator based on S3's 86C9ll graphics processor.  Michaelangelo's most outstanding feature is its capability to generate non-interlaced 1280x1024 graphics.  It paints in up to 65,768 colors in lower resolutions (using built-in Sierra HiColor RAMDAC technology) and up to 256 colors in non-interlaced 128OxlO24 mode with 2 Mbytes of VRAM.<P>
Non-interlaced operation ensures flicker-free performance, and the 70/72/ 75-Hz refresh rates enhance stability and provide VESA compliance.  To boost speed and performance, Michaelangelo uses dual-ported fast page VRAM in 1- and 2-Mbyte standard configurations and proprietary ASICs, BIOS, and caching techniques.<P>

Two new C++ libraries, View.h++ and MouseWrapper.h++, have been released by Rogue Wave.<P>
View.h++ is a library based on Motif that offers two levels of functionality.  At the lower level, it offers the functionality of the Open Software Foundation's Motif GUI in a C++ library.  At the higher level, it offers a Model-View-Controller architecture with an abstract, powerful programming interface which ensures that all of a user's data is refreshed and up-to-date whenever the data changes.  Complex objects such as a file dialog box can be created with a single function call, and many precanned views are provided.  Custom views can be created by inheriting from an existing view.<P>
MouseWrapper.h++ is a system for managing object picks, drags, rubber banding, and interactive graphics.  Any object created with it contains mouse sensitivity.  Grabbers are included for interactive construction of complex graphical composite objects.<P>
In both View.h++ and MouseWrapper.h++ all objects are fully persistent, and graphical views of data can be recreated in a new application or on a different operating system.<P>
Prices start at $795.00 for View.h++ and $495.00 for MouseWrapper.h++.  Reader service no. 27.<P>

Two window classes are available from SE International: PrimaryWindow Class, a tool and methods library for developing OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM) applications with C; and FormattedEntryfields, which dynamically validates and formats numeric user input in PM entry fields.<P>
PrimaryWindow Class lets you create SAA/CUA-conforming, sizable, scrollable primary windows that contain controls in their client areas.  The layout of the primary windows can be designed using the OS/2 Dialogbox Editor.<P>
FormattedEntryfields has upper and lower bounds determined by C data types and application-specific ranges.  It validates the number of decimal digits, omits leading zeros, and permits logical checks.  The OS/2 Dialogbox Editor embeds FormattedEntryfields in Dialog templates.<P>
The PrimaryWindow Class costs $420.00 per workstation, $2095.00 for LAN server; FormattedEntryfields is $329.00 per workstation, $1495.00 for LAN server.  Reader service no. 30.<P>

Icarus has announced SourceSafe for DOS version control.  SourceSafe enables you to track old versions of source code and other text and binary files without storing every version independently.  It also coordinates access by multiple developers, thus preventing collisions that cause one programmer to overwrite the code of another.  SourceSafe is targeted at programmers who rely on modular, shared code -- those who have a base of core code that they port to different products, who tailor one program to individual clients, or who use object-oriented languages.  SourceSafe stores code in user-defined projects that can literally share the same file; file update is automatically reflected in every project that uses a file.<P>
DDJ spoke with Gary Loew of MCG Ltd.  in West Orange, New Jersey, a company that develops accounting and distribution and document-assembly software.  According to Loew, SourceSafe's outstanding feature is its transparency.  &quot;It requires few commands and does its work in the background,&quot; he said, &quot;plus it has incredible ease of setup and use and very good documentation.&quot;<P>
Prices for SourceSafe start at $245.00 for a single-user license.  Reader service no. 31.<P>

The Manifold Editor from Fuzzy Systems provides an intuitively helpful interface for capturing the expert judgments needed to build any fuzzy system.<P>
The Manifold Editor allows two-dimensional matrix display of the fuzzy system rules for viewing and editing.  It permits up to five input dimensions and two output dimensions in the fuzzy estimation surface design; output selection in each rule is performed by point and click.  Piecewise and freeform fuzzy-set editing are both provided.  Up to 77 arbitrary fuzzy sets may be defined and edited.  Editing tools include: simple graphical editing of triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy sets; detailed graphical editing of arbitrary fuzzy sets; and translation from the simple piecewise fuzzy sets to the arbitrary freeform fuzzy sets.  All expert information is output in an include file for use in your applications code.  Output languages include C, Basic, and Fortran.<P>
Also included is the Manifold Walker, a testing tool that allows static testing of the fuzzy estimation surface at any time in the design cycle.<P>
The Manifold Editor costs $250.00.  Reader service no.  32.<P>
