Andsor Research has released the Andsor Database Engine, a Windows add-on library for adding advanced database-management capabilities to any program through DLL function calls.  You can replace many sections of an application, such as reports, queries, and updating operations, with simple procedures written in ADL, a database language.  These procedures can be embedded in the program, but are usually stored in the database itself, resulting in smaller, simpler Windows programs which need contain only function calls to execute the stored procedures.  All programs that access the database can use the same procedures.  An interactive database-management utility is included for creating, testing, and modifying the stored procedures without recompiling the program.<P>
A full set of traditional ISAM file operations is also provided.  The programmer controls the database with code and variables that reside in the program and calls the DLL functions to perform one operation at a time.<P>
DDJ spoke with Brent Eldstrom, president of Custom Software Solutions in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, who develops Windows applications for the insurance industry.  Brent needs to include many support files with his applications, and by using the Andsor engine they can all be kept in a single DOS file.  &quot;Because of this,&quot; he said, &quot;the engine has excellent ease of use--there's no opening and closing of files because DOS sees it as only one file.&quot;<P>
The engine can be used from C, Visual Basic, and all languages or front ends with DLL interfaces.  It sells for $149.00.  Reader service no. 22.<P>

DAB is a new distributed application-builder toolset from Real-Time Intelligent Systems.  It provides automatic network-wide data exchange between programs running on PCs connected by LANs and serial data links.  DAB facilitates parallel processing and building cooperatively used applications.<P>
DAB establishes a multiprocessing environment in each PC: A DOS application program runs in the foreground and the communications software runs automatically in the background.  The programs cooperate on a peer-to-peer basis: DAB automatically encodes data records into messages, handles all message transmission and routing between computers, and decodes messages into data records for the recipient program.  The communications protocol lets data links be broken and connected again without data loss.<P>
DAB identifies each computer via an electronic identification key that plugs into the computer's parallel port.  The data-distribution network is formed automatically and user programs communicate via data-distribution nodes that automatically relay data throughout the network to all programs that need it.<P>

Access Softek has announced 16 graphics import filters for Windows that plug into any Windows application, allowing it to import graphics.  The filters translate in a one-step process directly into the Windows MetaFile or QuickDraw for the Macintosh, unlike others, which translate first into an intermediate format.  As a result, those from Access Softek tend to be faster and more accurate.<P>
The interface used for graphics import is the Aldus interface, which contains only three function calls.  (This is the only graphics-import standard currently in widespread use; the filters also, however, support the proposed TWAIN API spec.)  For more information on graphic import filters, see Evangelo Prodromou's article, &quot;Graphics Import Filters for Windows Applications&quot; in the July 1992 DDJ.  Contact Access Softek for pricing.  Reader service no. 25.<P>

Sierra Systems has released version 3.00 of its C cross-compiler and language-development system for Motorola 68000 microprocessors.  The new version includes a hole-compression optimization utility that operates as follows: The linker determines on the first pass when a more compact addressing mode can be used and passes this information to the assembler, which makes a second pass and shrinks the appropriate address holes; the application is then relinked.<P>
Optimization techniques such as loop invariant removal, common subexpression removal, global register allocation by coloring, and register scorecarding are included, obviating the need for assembly language.  Also new to this version are: inclusion of the Phar Lap DOS-Extender, floating-point enhancements, enhanced implementation of multiplication by constant, a string-copy function, and improved function-call stack cleanup.<P>
Sierra C includes an optimizing compiler, assembler, linker, absolute address mapper, object librarian and source archiver, symbol-table listing utility, object-code size utility, command driver, parallel downloader, serial downloader, and runtime library.  It costs $2000.00 for DOS or OS/2 and $3500.00 for UNIX workstations.  Reader service no. 26.<P>

Windows Sockets APIs are in the news with two new releases from Distinct and Frontier Technologies.  Distinct's TCP/IP for Windows now includes the Windows Sockets API. This standard API can be used by developers of shrink-wrapped software, while those developing more technical products have access to monitoring, debugging, data capture, and internal data structures.  Also new to this version is the ONC RPC/XDR toolkit, including features such as an RPC server and an enhanced RPC client that run over UDP or TCP. A Windows RPCGEN program allows you to generate XDR routines directly on the PC for applications distributed over PC-only or heterogeneous networks.  In addition to SLIP protocol support, there is now the more secure Point to Point Protocol for data transfer over serial lines.<P>
Distinct TCP/IP supports Packet, NDIS, and ODI drivers.  The price of the SDK is $495.00. Reader service no. 35.<P>
The Frontier developer's toolkit provides the sockets-library interface for the Windows environment for Frontier's Super-TCP for Windows.  This allows custom applications to connect to a TCP/IP network, open connections, transmit and receive data, and disconnect from the network easily.  The toolkit includes the following: a Windows TCP/IP kernel with a PING application; Borland C++ libraries; sample source code; and a copy of the Windows Sockets API technical specification.  The socket-interface DLL design takes advantage of Windows' memory-management services, allows the interface to be used simultaneously by several applications, and avoids taking up base memory.<P>
