CodeTAP, a source-level, runtime debugger for embedded systems using Intel's 8OC186/C188EA, XL, EB, and EC microprocessors, has been released by <a name="007e_0002">Applied Microsystems. CodeTAP provides a transparent window into the internal functioning of the processor for runtime debugging in the target environment.  It requires no target memory space, I/0 ports, or interrupts, and quickly plugs into the target.<P>
The components that make up CodeTAP are a Target Access Probe, an RS232 Communications Adapter, and the VALIDATE/Soft-Scope III windowed source-and assembly-level debugger.  CodeTAP supports Intel, Microsoft, and Microtec Research C compilers and provides access to high-level data structures, arrays, and dynamic variables.  It also provides eight hardware breakpoints, and software breakpoints are unlimited.  You can single-step or operate at full clock speed up to 20 MHz with no wait states.<P>

<a name="007e_0004">Open has released Aspect, software that allows a single application source to work with Motif, Open Look, Windows, and Macintosh.  It also features a windowing system for character terminals that emulates a graphical user interface.<P>
Aspect does not simulate look and feel, but instead works directly with the native toolbox. It provides a C-callable Application Programming Interface and an Interactive Design Tool (IDT) used to graphically design the user interface.  The IDT and its resource database also let you delay binding parts of the user interface until run time, making it possible to customize the application's user interface without recompilation.<P>
We spoke with a company that is using Aspect to build an interface for their UNIX product. They were impressed with the intuitive editor for the resource definition language, which they claimed boosted programmer productivity without compromising functionality.  In addition, they believe Aspect has the most refined event-driven, object-oriented architecture for an open, portable API.<P>
Aspect for Motif is shipping on several UNIX platforms; additional platforms and models will follow soon.  Prices start at $795.  Reader service no. 22.<P>

Two new C++ class libraries are now available from <a name="007e_0005">Rogue Wave Matrix.h++ and Linpack.h++.  They extend C++ to include numerical algorithms previously available only in Fortran.<P>
Both libraries are compatible with Rogue Wave's other C++ class libraries, Tools.h++ and Math.h++.  Matrix.h++ includes all the functionality of Math.h++: general matrices, vectors, statistics, complex numbers, Fast Fourier Transformation, and so on.  It adds specialized matrix classes such as banded, symmetric, positive-definite, Heritian, and triagonal, while taking advantage of Math.h++'s optimized low-level assembly routines.<P>
Linpack.h++ includes all of Matrix.h++ and all the functionality of the original Fortran version: solutions of systems of equations for a variety of matrix types, solutions of over- and underdetermined systems of equations, incremental least squares solvers, and more.<P>
Prices start at $199 for Matrix.h++ and $299 for Linpack.h++.  Reader service no. 23.<P>

The Xenix 386 version of C4, <a name="007e_0006">Axon Development's object-oriented programming environment, has just been released.  C4 combines the fast application development and prototyping facilities of a 4GL with the efficient packaging and reusability of object-oriented code.<P>
C4 can be used as a low-level, general-purpose language as well as a high-level, application-oriented development system.  Prebuilt building blocks make it easy to include advanced user-interface features such as mouse support, pop-up menus, dialog boxes, cut-and-paste, hypertext, file browsing, and ad hoc reporting.  C4 supports incremental development: You can quickly build working prototypes, complete with menus, file access screens, reports, and so on.  Easy development is further enhanced by the interactive programming environment, &quot;instant&quot; compiles, and flexible database features, including variable-length untyped fields and the ability to add fields at any time.<P>
The Xenix version is compatible with MS-DOS versions and costs $1295.  Reader service no. 24.<P>

<a name="007e_0007">Franklin Software is shipping RTX51, a real-time, multitasking operating system adapted to the I/O and memory characteristics of the 8051 family.  RTX51's functions include preemptive and non-preemptive task scheduling, task prioritization, intertask communication, multiple-event management, internal and external ROM and RAM management, and access to all 8051 hardware, including timers and serial I/O.<P>
RTX51 performs round-robin and preemptive task switching for up to 256 tasks and up to four scheduling priorities.  An OS Wait function suspends task processing and waits for an interrupt, time-out, or message from a task or interrupt.  Communications capabilities include a BITBUS interface available as an RTX51 task, allowing quick and easy design of microcontroller networks.<P>
RTX51 uses Franklin C51 compiler features such as register parameter passing, reentrancy, typed pointers, and mixed-memory model capabilities that reduce code size and increase execution speed.  RTX51 includes the BL51 Linker, which checks boundary conditions and creates task description tables.<P>
An abbreviated version, RTXTINY, is available to run on single-chip 8051s without xdata memory requirements.<P>
RTX51, including the BL51 Banking Linker and source code for RTXTINY, costs $1995; RTXTINY alone sells for $995.  Reader service no. 25.<P>

<a name="007e_0009">Interactive has released version 3.0 of its UNIX System V/386, Release 3.2 operating system.  The new version has a redesigned user interface, additional hardware support, performance improvements, and internationalization support and retains compliance with ANSI C, USL SVID, POSIX 1003.1, and FIPS 151-1 standards.<P>
The user interface features pull-down menus, pop-up dialog boxes and forms, and context-sensitive help.  It is consistent throughout system installation, kernel configuration, disk copying, printer configuration, application installation, and addition of users.  Furthermore, the Kernel Configuration package has been rewritten to be modular and extendable.<P>
The International Supplement allows vendors to display their applications in the appropriate language for each environment--there's no need for a separate copy of the application for each language.  The supplement contains over 30 popular UNIX system utilities so that users can, for example, sort text files using their local dictionary.  Also included is a guide with all reference information on internationalization features.<P>
The operating system has been optimized in the following manner: The High Performance Device Driver supports up to six controllers/host-board adapters and up to 32 devices connected to each controller/adapter; the Fast File System provides performance improvement when mounting and unmounting large file systems; the Very Fast File System has been added for high-speed sequential reading and writing of very large files; and a CD-ROM File System lets you read files on a CD-ROM as if they were part of the Interactive UNIX file system.<P>

X-arRAY is the new Fortran callable library for 386/486 PCs from <a name="007e_000a">Davis Associate .  With it, you can allocate, access, and manipulate up to a gigabyte of extended memory using Microsoft Fortran under MS-DOS.  X-arRAY does not require DOS extenders, 32-bit compilers, MS-Windows, or flat memory model operating systems.<P>
X-arRAY allows you to move DOS files or data in conventional memory to and from extended memory; pass data arrays between independent job steps through extended memory; obtain extended memory allocation analysis using a new external command; operate directly on data arrays in extended memory using X-arRAY primitives; and create arbitrary functions using combinations of X-arRAY primitives.<P>
X-arRAY also affords automatic selection of an appropriate extended-memory allocation method and keyboard interrupts for status reports during protected mode operation.<P>
Dr. Barton Lane of Plasma Dynamics in Belmont, Mass. told DDJ that he believes X-arRAY to be the only way to efficiently access extended memory from Microsoft Fortran.  &quot;It gives the clearest explanation of allocation methods for extended memory that I've seen,&quot; he added.<P>
X-arRAY's introductory price is $49.50; the regular price will be $99.  Reader service no. 29.<P>
