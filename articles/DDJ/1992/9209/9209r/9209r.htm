<a name="0218_0002"><a name="0218_0000">Under the heading &quot;What you get out of this column depends on what you put into it, or possibly on what is put into it by some other reader with more wit than sense and more time than you,&quot; I present the following splendid example of reader involvement above and beyond.<P>
The reader in question is Mike Morton, occasional Dr. Dobb's contributor from the state of HI, and the subject is anagrams, as in &quot;Swahili Menace&quot; or &quot;whale is anemic&quot; for &quot;Michael Swaine,&quot; &quot;Legal bits&quot; for &quot;Bill Gates,&quot; &quot;prig to peer&quot; for &quot;Tipper Gore,&quot; &quot;Scorn in joke rubs old drab Jon&quot; for &quot;Jon Erickson, Dr. Dobb's Journal,&quot; and &quot;Mr. Machine Tool&quot; for &quot;Michael Morton.&quot;<P>
Dear Swahili Menace:<P>
Your Brain Games are great; I especially enjoy the anagrams, although I'm too lazy to do them myself.  A little program I wrote found a few answers for me.  &quot;Real friend or nuts&quot; is clearly &quot;Flatus error in den,&quot; referring to the hazards of excessive Jolt consumption while working in a home office--all too common in the software biz.  But this answer had some lively competition from the following:<P>
<UL>
<li>Resentful in ardor</li>
<li>Fail not, surrender (dishonor before slight pain?)</li>
<li>Terrain flounders * No nudist referral</li>
<li>Fortran runes lied (see other religious comments in anagram below)</li>
<li>Render Lotus, infra</li>
<li>User, florid tanner</li>
<li>Error, fail--stunned</li>
<li>Error stifled a nun (kick that monochrome habit?)</li>
<li>Dental error is fun (running light without...)</li>
<li>Userland Frontier (Lord knows what this one means...)</li>
</UL>
Meanwhile, &quot;Magic land of lost tribes&quot; appears to be a reference to those who worship and continue to attempt the revival of lost programming languages: &quot;BASIC: Lost idol fragment.&quot; But some other possibilities are:<P>
<UL>
<li>Distracting bosom, fella</li>
<li>Forecasting dismal blot</li>
<li>Octal fossil abridgment (for those who don't find BASIC sufficiently atavistic)</li>
<li>Food: belittling sarcasm</li>
<li>Comforting sadist label (Intel inside--suffer!)</li>
<li>Gold-lobster fanaticism</li>
<li>Bigots craft medallions</li>
<li>Sanctified global storm (religious slant on a new world order?)</li>
<li>Oft remolding lost BASIC (see also the idol-worship reference above)</li>
<li>Relating to bold fascism</li>
<li>Bestial Microsoft gland (secretes hormones that cause animal-like marketing)</li>
<li>Microsoft: legal bandits (hmm)</li>
<li>Microsoft dating Bealls (all of them?)</li>
<li>Microsoft and Bill Gates (I'm sure this wasn't what you meant)</li>
</UL>
Yours for a new word order, Mr. Machine Tool<P>
