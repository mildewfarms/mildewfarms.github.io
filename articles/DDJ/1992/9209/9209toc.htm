<H1>September 1992 - DEBUGGING, TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES</H1>
<hr>
<h2>FEATURES</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9209a/9209a.htm">POSTMORTEM DEBUGGING</a><br>by Matt Pietrek</h3><P>
Postmortem debugging helps you isolate program problems by taking a  snapshot of the machine at the time a crash occurs.  As Matt points out, if you have the tools to support the technique, postmodern debugging is  particularly useful in protected-mode Windows.<P>
<h3><a href="9209b/9209b.htm">AN EXCEPTION HANDLER FOR WINDOWS 3</a><br>by Brett Salter</h3><P>
When writing Periscope/32 for Windows 3, Brett needed to debug the debugger  so he developed WINX.386.  This Windows exception handler is implemented  as an Enhanced Mode Windows virtual device driver that oversees what's  happening with other VxDs, normal Windows applications and drivers, and the  DOS box--including TSRs and DOS device drivers.<P>
<h3><a href="9209c/9209c.htm">YOUR OWN PROTECTED-MODE DEBUGGER</a><br>y Rick Knoblaugh</h3><P>
The 80386/486 protected-mode debugger Rick presents here makes use of the  386's debug registers as well as protected and virtual-8086 modes.  It also  enables breakpoints to be generated on code execution (including ROM code),  interrupts, data accesses, and I/O accesses and it can coexist with a  real-mode debugger such as Debug or Codeview.<P>
<h3><a href="9209d/9209d.htm">HIGH-RESOLUTION TIMING</a><br>by Thomas Roden</h3><P>
For many applications, the PC's built-in timer just isn't fast enough.   Thomas untangles the PC timer, then offers up three externally referenced  timer functions--along with a program that verifies them--that provide  high-resolution timing.<P>
<h3><a href="9209e/9209e.htm">AN IMPROVED LISP-STYLE LIBRARY FOR C</a><br>by Douglas Chubb</h3><P>
Douglas reexamines and updates Daniel Ozick's Lisp-style C library  presented in our August 1991 issue.  This improved version sports a  redesigned garbage collector that makes the system more efficient, nearly  automatic, and easy to use.<P>
<h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9209f/9209f.htm">THE UNIVERSAL DEBUGGER INTERFACE</a><br>by Daniel Mann</h3><P>
Dan examines the Universal Debugger Interface, a processor-independent  specification that promises greater debug-tool configurability.  He also  discusses how to go about integrating the UDI with existing tools, using as an example the Free Software Foundation's GDB C-Language source-level  debugger.<P>
<h3><a href="9209g/9209g.htm">DEBUGGING REAL-TIME SYSTEMS</a><br>by Gurjol Singh, Moses Joseph, and Dave Barnett</h3><P>
Modular and incremental development and debugging lead to reliable real-time systems that perform the functions they're designed to.  Our authors use  this approach when building a simulated data-acquisition system.<P>
<h2>NETWORKED SYSTEMS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9209h/9209h.htm">CRASH TRACEBACKS IN UNIX</a><br>by Alan Dunham</h3><P>
This UNIX-based VAX/VMS-like crash traceback utility reports a list of  subroutines being executed when the crash occurred, along with line  numbers, parameter values, and local symbol values.<P>
<h2>EXAMINING ROOM</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9209i/9209i.htm">WINDOWS TOOLHELP</a><br>by Mike Sax</h3><P>
ToolHelp is a DLL that lets you peek and poke into the internals of Windows  3.1.  Mike discusses ToolHelp functions, then presents a programming  utility that lets you remove DLLs and programs stuck in memory without  having to restart Windows to recompile.<P>
<h2>PROGRAMMER'S WORKBENCH</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9209j/9209j.htm"> A VIDEO COMPATIBILITY INTERFACE FOR TURBO DEBUGGER</a><br>by Danny Thorpe</h3><P>
The Video Compatibility Interface of Borland's Turbo Debugger for Windows  allows an external DLL to handle all the video-mode switching for a  particular video card or chipset.  Danny describes the services a custom  video DLL must provide.<P>
<h2>COLUMNS</h2><P>
<h3><a href="9209k/9209k.htm">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</a><br>by Michael Swaine</h3><P>
Are those visitors knocking at Michael's door using--or abusing--the  &quot;paradigm&quot; moniker?  Our editor-at-large examines some interesting  programming tools and applications, before moving on to books and  conferences.<P>
<h3><a href="9209l/9209l.htm">C PROGRAMMING</a><br>by Al Stevens</h3><P>
This month, Al discusses the four parts of the D-Flat help system: a text  help database; a compression/decompression algorithm: the hooks in the  dialog boxes, menus, and program code that make a particular text display  the current one; and the HELPBOX window class that displays the help text  and allows the user to navigate it.<P>
<h3><a href="9209m/9209m.htm">STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING</a><br>by Jeff Duntemann</h3><P>
Before putting Turbo Vision aside for awhile, Jeff uses Borland's standard  file open dialogs, a undocumented &quot;gift&quot; that comes with the Turbo Pascal  6.0, to develop the final, streamable version of HCALC, his mortgage  calculator program.<P>
<h3><a href="9209n/9209n.htm">GRAPHICS PROGRAMMING</a><br>by Michael Abrash</h3><P>
Texture mapping is the process of mapping a bitmap image onto the surface  of a polygon that's been transformed in the process of 3-D drawing.   Michael describes a quick-and-dirty texture mapping technique that starts  with a quick determination of what pixel value to draw for each pixel in  the transformed destination polygon.<P>
<h3><a href="9209o/9209o.htm">PROGRAMMER'S BOOKSHELF</a><br>by William F. Jolitz</h3><P>
Are the computer and telecommunications industries butting heads instead of  holding hands when building tomorrow's global communication networks?<P>
