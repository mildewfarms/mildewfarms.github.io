Now shipping from Softway is HSWIN, a Windows add-on module for HI-SCREEN Pro II, Softway's language-independent user-interface system.  Using HSWIN together with HI-SCREEN Pro, you can develop user interfaces directly for Windows and port DOS applications to Windows without modifying the source code.<P>
To port HI-SCREEN Pro-generated DOS apps to Windows, HSWIN automatically converts interface objects such as screens, menus, and icons into Windows resources using a built-in library generator.  You then simply recompile the existing code with a Windows-compatible compiler.<P>
HSWIN's suggested retail price is $250.00.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

AGE Logic has released XoftWare, a family of X-server software that incorporates Novell's TCP/IP networking software and lets you access applications on UNIX and VMS host systems from your PC.<P>
Installing the X server is simple: Novell's TCP/IP drivers are integrated into XoftWare, so you can install them both in one step from the XoftWare screen.  Besides the TCP/IP files, the Open Datalink Interface driver set and its IPX file are also included, allowing XoftWare to support Token Ring and ARCnet as well as Ethernet.<P>
XoftWare is available for Windows, DOS, and TIGA/DOS.  For Windows, the cost is $595.00; for DOS, $495.00; for TIGA/DOS, $595.00; without TCP/IP, subtract $100.00.  Reader service no. 22.<P>

INTRCPT is Hackensack's memory-resident interrupt trapper and debugger for DOS and Windows. It includes an integrated memory map, vector map, and user-maintained function database.  You can monitor, trap, call, and log interrupts at the interrupt, function, or sub-function level, providing over 16 million breakpoints.  Logged interrupts are written to a disk file with all register and buffer values shown at the call and return.  Function calls are identified by searching the function database, and there is a trap option that puts INTRCPT in debugger mode, allowing manipulation of the function's register and memory values.<P>
The debugger has a load and execute option that allows real-time disassembly of the executing target application, while the call option can invoke any interrupt and display the registers and memory buffer on return.<P>
INTRCPT works with Btrieve, NetWare, and NetBIOS calls and logs Windows enhanced-mode interrupts.  The cost is $99.00.  Reader service no. 23.<P>

Microsoft has released Visual Basic for DOS.  It provides the same collection of objects as VB for Windows, including forms, menus, 15 standard controls, and a compatible programming language that make it possible to develop applications for DOS and Windows simultaneously. You can compile your finished applications into native 8Ox86 standalone executables without using a runtime library.<P>
VB for DOS runs the Microsoft QuickBasic and Basic development systems and QBasic interpreter code, so new features can be added to QuickBasic-based applications without restructuring existing code.<P>
The standard edition of VB includes a form designer, a multiwindow, syntax-checking code editor, debugging tools, and a toolkit of commonly used dialog boxes.  The professional edition adds the following: 386/486 code optimization; an integrated, high-speed ISAM engine; Microsoft Overlay Environment technology; an alternate math library; charting, online help, setup, and financial-function toolkits; a custom-control development kit; and a source-code profiler.<P>
Also available from Microsoft is the Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK), which lets you develop, test, and debug drivers for a variety of peripherals.  The DDK enables development of virtual devices and supports the Windows Universal Printer Driver.<P>
The Visual Basic standard edition costs $199.00, the professional edition costs $495.00, and the DDK is $500.00.  Reader service no. 24.<P>

Three reverse-engineering tools are now available from +1 Software Engineering: Tree4c, Tree4Fortran, and Tree4Pascal.  The tools parse existing source code, displaying a program's structure chart to facilitate better understanding and maintenance of existing code.<P>
After you have reverse-engineered source code, +1's TreeSoft, a UNIX-based software-engineering environment, makes that code available through &quot;selective reuse.&quot; Selective reuse lets you reuse project data by selecting any subtree from any reverse-engineered program and then appending it to your current program.<P>
TreeSoft supports project modeling, default editing, makefile generation, graphical viewpaths, configuration management, testing, user-defined and filtered reuse libraries, problem-report management, profiling, project communications, and report generation.<P>
Tree4c, Tree4Fortran, and Tree4Pascal each cost $1500.00 and run on Sun workstations. Reader service no. 25.<P>

SoftPolish is a quality-assurance tool from Language Systems designed to detect errors in Macintosh applications.  SoftPolish performs four functions: It tests an application's dialogs, windows, and controls for compliance with Apple's Human Interface guidelines; it runs several hundred resource-validity tests and identifies potential incompatibilities with other software; it spell checks all string objects in application resources; and it automates file cleaning for master disks.  SoftPolish also automatically logs problems as they are found and fixed.<P>
SoftPolish costs $295.00 and includes an English dictionary; international dictionaries are available for $49.00 each.  Reader service no. 28.<P>

PowerCode is an extensible application generator for Windows now shipping from J Systems. Using PowerCode, you can design, generate, edit, compile, link, and execute a Windows application.  The design is prototyped via a point-and click interface, and the interface can be tested interactively without compiling.  After you complete the design, PowerCode generates all source files necessary for the target environment.<P>
PowerCode is completely extensible: A high-level scripting language controls all source-code generation, so the developer can modify script files to adapt source code to meet individual needs.  And because PowerCode is object oriented, you can extend the definition of objects used in the design process.  Thus, source code that supports custom object classes can be generated.<P>
PowerCode supports Borland C++ and OWL, Borland Turbo Pascal for Windows, Microsoft C/C++ 7.0 and MFC, and ANSI C; it can be extended to support any language or class library.  Windows programming features such as tool bars, custom controls, and MDI are also supported.  The price is $395.00.  Reader service no. 30.<P>
