New from <a name="0055_0006">Chesapeake Computing is the Process Server, a development tool with its own macro-scripted language that uses event-driven, distributed parallel processing on LANs.  The Process Server comes with over 200 ready-to-run commands and a relational database for report generation, audit trails, and network statistical analysis.  Custom programs can be scripted for routine and spawned tasks and application servers can be built.  All application servers built with the Process Server are compatible when run on the same or multiple machines.<P>
The Process Server simultaneously controls any number of tasks and machines.  A screen-mirroring feature provides a view of and remote control over all the screens of machines in the server mode and the number of machines can be increased or decreased.  Tasks can be segmented, and the segments distributed among machines.  Transaction tracking ensures that if any machine fails, another one takes over.  The Process Server starts tasks on preassigned days and times and completes all segments in a prescribed, event-driven order.  A new &quot;pinging&quot; technology analyzes network activity, searches for tasks assigned to Process Server programs and levels the workload, overcoming the slowness, bottlenecks, and contention of large LAN applications.<P>
Also available is TPS/FAXServer, an add-on module that enables multiple network users to send and receive faxes online.  It transmits volumes of documents, including graphics, to one or many individuals at preassigned dates and times.  Supports ASCII, PCX, and Epson FX-85 formats.<P>
The Process Server with a five-server license retails for $1995.  TPS/ FAXServer costs $199.  Reader service no. 24.<P>

<a name="0055_0007">Outrider Systems has released ButtonTool and EditTool, new developer aids for Visual Basic.  ButtonTool lets you place graphics symbols, captions, and VCR-like symbols (fast-forward, stop, reverse, and so on) on buttons.  Eighteen predefined symbols are included, and you can specify bitmaps, icons, or metafiles as the button's foreground. ButtonTool affords the ability to create shadows, 3-D effects, and the effect generated whenever the button is depressed; it can be used as an enhanced picture field or label.<P>
EditTool's most significant feature is that it allows you to perform input field masking, an example of which is limiting characters to alphabetic or numeric.  You can specify input fields for date, currency, social security number, phone number, and so on.  EditTool also has the ability to control shadows, borders, and colors and provides a spin control that facilitates cycling through a specific range of programmer-definable values.<P>
ButtonTool and EditTool are priced at $49.95 each, or $89.95 for both.  Both load into the Visual Basic tool palette and contain runtime versions that can be distributed without royalties.  Reader service no. 25.<P>
