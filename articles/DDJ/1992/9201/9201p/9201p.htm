<h3><a name="0057_0004">Answers:<a name="0057_0004"></h3><P>
1. J; the Frontier SDK includes sample programs, source code, and documents to aid developers in adding IAC (interapplication communication) &quot;wires&quot; to their applications, so they can communicate with other IAC-aware applications and drive Userland's Frontier system scripting product.  2. B; last year the company's sales dropped, and losses were significant; the board apparently freaked.  3. G; most observers doubt that it will happen; at roughly the same time, the company laid off five percent of its workforce.  4. F; Intel won the former and will profit from the latter no matter how it goes, in his view.  5. D; Compaq is also suing over Dell's advertising comparing the two companies' machines.  6. H; Jones parlayed a trick involving unused bandwidth on home and office phone wire into a major network products company on the Mac and is developing some credibility in the PC market.  7. I; just one product, and that uncertain: AccessPC, a PC emulator.  8. C; the PowerPC RISC chip is expected to be used in computers from $1000 high-volume machines to 500-SPECmark workstations.  9. E; the Windows version is apparently close; not so the Mac product.  10. A; the personal communicator (cellular phone, modem, and network link) is intended to be hand-size, not tablet-size as the prototype is, and is intended to be affordable to a wide audience, which the current cost of parts won't permit.<P>
