<h3><a href="9213a/9213a.htm">A CONVERSATION WITH BJARNE STROUSTRUP</a><br>by Al Stevens</h3><P>
Contributing editor Al Stevens last interviewed C++ language designer Bjarne Stroustrup in 1989.  In this issue, Al and Bjarne pick up where they left off.<P>
<h3><a href="9213b/9213b.htm">STANDARD C++: A STATUS REPORT</a><br>by Dan Saks</h3><P>
Although the ANSI C++ technical committee has been working on a formal standard for C++ for almost three years, it has yet to release a draft standard to the public.  Dan explains how the C++ language definition has changed as it evolves into a standard and looks at the prospects for a standard C++ library.<P>
<h3><a href="9213c/9213c.htm">A C++ BEAUTIFIER</a><br>by Tim Maher</h3><P>
Tim's approach to writing a C++ beautifier is based on the UNIX &quot;filter&quot; model.  This entailed his using a preprocessor to disguise C++ as C, standard C tools to effect beautification, then a post-processor to convert the disguised C++ back to its original form.<P>
<h3><a href="9213d/9213d.htm">TEMPLATES IN C++</a><br>by Nicholas Wilt</h3><P>
Templates open up a whole new world for C++ programmers by allowing compact and efficient implementation of container classes and other parameterized types.  They also allow general, efficient implementation of algorithms with a minimum of code duplication.<P>
<h3><a href="9213e/9213e.htm">TOWARD A LESS OBJECT-ORIENTED VIEW OF C++</a><br>by Harris Shiffman</h3><P>
Harris makes the argument that the modular nature of C++ makes it both a weak object language and a strong general-purpose language.  He adds that C++ is an object-oriented language a C programmer can appreciate because it is oriented first toward execution performance, then toward flexibility.<P>
<h3><a href="9213f/9213f.htm">WHY C++ WILL REPLACE FORTRAN</a><br>by Thomas Keffer</h3><P>
C++ has tremendous potential in numerics, something that has gone largely unnoticed because other OOP languages lack the efficiency required to do numerics.  Consequently, C++ may be the first serious challenger to Fortran in the world of numerical programming.<P>
<h3><a href="9213g/9213g.htm">USING MULTIPLE INHERITANCE IN C++</a><br>by Tom Cargill</h3><P>
Multiple inheritance, which permits a class to be derived from two or more base classes, is one of the most complex and misunderstood C++ features.  Tom untangles the multiple-inheritance web and describes where it can be used most effectively.<P>
<h3><a href="9213h/9213h.htm">IMPLEMENTING CURVES IN C++</a><br>by Stephen P. Johnson and Tom McReynolds</h3><P>
Steve and Tom implement a wide variety of free-form curves using C++ class hierarchies.  Among the curves presented are Hermite curves, Bezier curves, B-spline (NUB) curves, Catmull-Rom, and NURBs.<P>
