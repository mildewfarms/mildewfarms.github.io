Version 3.0 of HyBase, Answer Software's DBMS product for the Macintosh, is now available.  HyBase combines relational and object-oriented features with knowledge-based rules and a client/server architecture.  You can build classic data tables using relational techniques, then extend the tables by creating object-oriented data types.  Applications can be extended modularly, using virtual objects.  Object methods can be written in C, Pascal, or HyBase's userextensible programming language.<P>
HyBase runs under both Systems 6 and 7, and a client API, report writer, and developer's toolkit are available for C or Pascal.<P>
Single-user versions cost $450; network versions, $2000.  Reader service no. 20.<P>

Tempus Software has announced two development tools for Actor 4.0: Project Browser and the Enhanced Development Environment (EDEN).  The tools allow you to organize and manage code developed for multiple projects using a multilevel directory structure.  They separate each project's code and resources, increasing control and protection of the work.  The hierarchical organization gives all projects access to common code, eliminating the need to directly modify the original Actor files.<P>
EDEN provides access to source files in the hierarchical directory structure and the ability to distribute class source code across the different levels.  Time stamping, dependent source file tracking, notification and loading of changed files, and automatic load file generation are also included.<P>
ProjectBrowser gives you control over the entire development directory structure.  It is a stand-alone Windows application that lets you peruse and maintain project directories and source, image, and executable files.  Thus, source file editing, image creation, and resource compiling are all possible, as is the capability to search files in any combination of directories for text or methods.<P>
Actor 3.1 and 3.2 require EDEN3; 4.0 requires EDEN4. Both cost $95.  ProjectBrowser works with all versions of Actor and is included with EDEN3 and 4 in the developer's package, which costs $295.  Reader service no. 27.<P>

Version 3 of T-Base, a picture and document imaging library, is shipping from Videotex Systems.  T-Base lets you add pictures and document images to database management applications written in C, C++, and Xbase.  It supports the PCX file format.  New features include graphics commands; automatic image scaling; image scaling on-the-fly; support for 1024x768, 256-color monitors; and automatic color correction for multiple VGA images with different palettes.<P>
T-Base is hardware independent: It automatically detects your hardware configuration and adjusts itself to it.  Additional features include support for Super-VGA, VGA, EGA, CGA, and monochrome display; display of one or multiple images in any location with or without existing text; support for Laser-Jet printing; and network compatibility.<P>
T-Base comes bundled with Chroma-Tools, an advanced color manipulation and image conversion utility for converting images in a variety of file formats into a single format.<P>
T-Base costs $495.  Reader service no. 25.<P>

An embeddable version of Graph-in-the-Box Executive, New England Software's presentation graphics program, is now available.  Executive receives data from host programs and then produces graphs, charts, and text and organizational diagrams.  It can also analyze the data.<P>
There are two methods of embedding Executive: Use either the GBXINT utility or an interrupt call.  In the former, you add GBXINT to an application (with only one line of code).  When a graph function is needed, the utility exits the host program, retrieves Executive from RAM, performs the function as a DOS batch file, and returns to the program.  Alternatively, prewritten interrupt calls in C, Basic, and Pascal can be added directly to the host program, but the interrupt call must be added to the program at each point a Graph-in-the-Box function is needed (50 extra lines of code).<P>
Executive can output DIF, CGM, HPGL, EPS, and PIC files.  With the runtime version you can change the look and feel to match the host.<P>
The suggested retail price is $299.95.  Runtime version prices start at $5000.  Reader service no. 28.<P>

PSW/Power Software has released the Loose Data Binder (LDB).  The LDB is a C++ persistent container class library.  It has a stack-queue-dequeue-list-array interface and built-in sort, search, and iterate functions, giving it full container capabilities in one flat class.  An LDB can be saved on a stream for later reloading while multiple references to its elements are automatically resolved.  This allows for any type of complex network of containers an application may require.  A streamable class is provided for packaging data in a persistent wrapping.<P>
The Loose Data Binder retails for $60.  Source code is included.  Reader service no. 30.<P>

Now shipping from Microway is EZ-WIN32, a 32-bit Windows Extender.  Microway has extended its protectedmode 386 compilers for Windows, allowing you to recompile your 32-bit applications and run them using Windows' 386 enhanced mode.<P>
EZWIN32 implements character-based I/O, making it possible to create and run 32-bit, character-based apps in a window.  EZWIN32 supports features of DOS and UNIX not available in Windows, such as STDIO, batch files, and file redirection.  All are built into EZWIN32's command interpreter and are part of the NDP Windows compilers.<P>
NDP Fortran, C, C++, and Pascal compilers for Windows cost $595 each; upgrades are $395. Reader service no 29.<P>

Voyetra Technologies is shipping the Sound Factory PC Sound Developer's Kit (SDK), which lets you add digital sound and synthesized music to Windows or DOS applications using Voyetra's device-independent APIs.  The APIs require minimal code changes and provide control over MIDI, FM sound cards, digital audio, and CD audio.  The Sound Factory SDK includes utilities for playing MIDI and digital audio from the DOS command line, as well as WinDAT and DosDAT, utilities for creating digital audio files in .WAV or VOC formats in Windows and DOS, respectively.<P>
Sound Factory includes function call descriptions and program examples for Voyetra's Multimedia Player (VMP) and for its low-level APIs.  The VMP plays MIDI files that conform to the standard MIDI file format and are created using a MIDI sequencing program.  The low-level APIs provide device independence and control over the sound hardware.  Windows DLLs are also available for use with those programs that can call them.<P>
The Sound Factory SDK costs $299.95; evaluation kits are $24.95.  Reader service no. 25.<P>
