<h3>NAG C Library, Mark 8</h3>

<p>Numerical Algorithms Group has announced the Mark 8 version of the NAG C Library, a library for adding mathematical and statistical functionality to applications. The release will include over 1000 embeddable numerical routines, including an extended optimization chapter, which now incorporates enhanced sparse matrix techniques. Mark 8 will also provide a number of new modules and techniques in fields such as linear algebra and copulas. The linear regression chapter in the NAG C Library has been further enhanced with the inclusion of routines for stepwise linear regression and mixed effects regression. NAG's C Library is available for Windows, Linux, and major UNIX platforms on a wide variety of hardware, from PCs to supercomputers. Contact +44-1865-511245 (Europe), +1-630-971-2337 (North America), or http://www.nag.com/.</p>
<h3>Recursion C++  Database Toolkit</h3>

<p>Recursion Software has announced the C++ Database toolkit, an object-oriented, cross-platform C++ solution for programmatic access to a wide range of ODBC-compliant databases. The C++ Database Toolkit is an API that abstracts away low-level complexity and has built-in streaming capabilities, and reduces the need to have multiple ODBC drivers for different databases installed on client machines. Developers can download a free 30-day trial of the C++ Toolkits including the C++ Database Toolkit from our web site at http://www.recursionsw.com/evaluation.htm. Contact +1-800-727-8674.</p>
<h3>Enterprise Architect 6.0</h3>

<p>Sparx Systems has announced Version 6.0 of its Enterprise Architect UML 2.0 modeling environment. New features include a Model Discussion Forum for collaboration with peers, OCL and meta-modeling support, live code generation, jUnit and nUnit test support, sequence-diagram generation, a new model search facility, and more. Contact +61-3-53-451140 or http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/.</p>
<h3>Macrovision FLEXnet  InstallShield Collaboration</h3>

<p>Macrovision has announced FLEXnet InstallShield Collaboration, a tool to allow developers to capture, test, track, and use installation requirements as they write application code. Installation requirements today are generally gathered in an ad hoc manner through e-mails or informal conversations at the end of the development cycle. FLEXnet InstallShield Collaboration changes this process by creating a central file for installation information that the team can access throughout the development cycle. FLEXnet InstallShield Collaboration is an add-on module to the newly released FLEXnet InstallShield 11.5. Contact +1-800-809-5659 or http://www.macrovision.com/.</p>
<h3>XJTAG Chain Debugger</h3>

<p>XJTAG, a supplier of boundary scan development tools, has added a JTAG chain debugger to its XJTAG Development System for engineers designing and testing complex printed circuit boards. The JTAG chain debugger features a range of debug options that allow designers to trace signals around the board and immediately find the location of any problems within the JTAG chain. This capability means that engineers can get boards up and running quickly, rapidly diagnose faults, and speed-up the whole development process. The connection test now includes built-in testing of pull-up and pull-down resistors, along with more precise fault detection. Contact +44-0-1954-213888 or http://www.xjtag.com/.</p>
<h3>Sun Studio 11</h3>

<p>Sun Microsystems has announced its latest development tool, Sun Studio 11, and is offering the product free of charge to all developers. Integrated into a fully featured IDE, the latest enhancements made to Sun Studio 11 software include an advanced graphical debugger and a suite of performance analysis tools for C, C++, and Fortran. Contact +1-650-960-1300 or http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio11/.</p>
<h3>Green Hills Platforms</h3>

<p>Green Hills Software, a developer of Device Software Optimization (DSO) and real-time operating systems (RTOS), has  introduced a family of industry-optimized software development platforms for medical, Software Defined Radio (SDR), wireless, industrial control, automotive, and avionics devices. The new highly integrated and royalty-free Green Hills Platforms include all of the core software and documentation required to develop and deploy a targeted device, accelerating time-to-market, reducing development risk, and enabling developers to focus on application-level innovation and differentiation. Each Green Hills Platform includes an industry-specific configuration of the company's INTEGRITY RTOS, industry-specific middleware, Green Hills Software's MULTI development environment, and more. Contact +1-727-781-4909 or http://www.ghs.com/.</p>
<h3>TargetProcess:Suite 1.4</h3>

<p>TargetProcess has announced the availability of TargetProcess:Suite 1.4, the latest version of its agile project management solution. TargetProcess:Suite is an integrated web-based software solution that helps software-development teams efficiently manage agile software projects by simplifying project management and bug-tracking processes. The product is designed to support geographically distributed teams and facilitate agile software-development practices such as  Extreme Programming. The major new feature of this product release is the new TestCases module. This module helps to create, manage, and run test plans for every implemented user story. The TestCases module allows developers to create test cases, bind them to user stories and assign them to test plans; to create test plans for each build and assign them to QA engineers; to run test plans via Test Runner; and to view Iteration/Release completeness based on test cases passed. The new Import functionality allows the import of project plans from MS Project. The upgrade to TargetProcess:Suite 1.4 is available for free for all existing customers. Contact +375-29-349-7475 or http://www.targetprocess.com/.</p>
