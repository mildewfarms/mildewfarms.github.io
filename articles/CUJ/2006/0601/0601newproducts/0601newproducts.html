It replaces the IBM Rational Process Workbench with new process customization tools that will be based on open source. It provides project plan templates and new best practices for helping teams identify project goals, determine the resources needed to complete a project, and pinpoint critical project milestones. Rational Method Composer includes process guidance wizards that instruct teams how to tailor the process to achieve the goals of their individual project, and tools that automate the capture of best practices that can be used on other projects across the company. IBM Rational Method Composer includes an open, Eclipse-based platform that delivers RUP and IBM Rational SUMMIT Ascendant's library of best practices for building higher quality software and systems. IBM Rational Method Composer is $395 per user.

The product is a server-based multiplatform peer code inspection workspace. CodeCollaborator enforces peer code inspections by integrating with version control, issue tracking, reporting, and other external systems. The customizable workflow provides a variety of options based on current inspection processes. The workflow can range from formal rules-based inspections, to casual "buddy pass-arounds." CodeCollaborator's reporting tool provides managers with metrics such as: average defects per KLOC, and defects per person-hour. The program includes a side-by-side diff viewer with an "IM-style" audit trail. CodeCollaborator starts at $1,949 for a five-user pack.
