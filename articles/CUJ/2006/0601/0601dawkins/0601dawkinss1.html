The easiest way to create an instance is to send the class a new method:<pre>#include &lt;MyClass.h&gt;...MyClass *myInstance = [MyClass new];</pre><p>However, this is most likely not what you would see in Objective-C code (but for the sake of simplicity, you will see it in the example application). Instead, the correct way to instantiate objects is to send the class an <b>alloc</b> method, which returns an allocated&#151;but uninitialized&#151;instance of the class, and then send that method an appropriate initializer message. All initializer methods should return the instance itself or <b>nil</b> on failure.</p><pre>id myInstance = [[MyClass alloc] init];</pre><p>This two-phased instance construction makes the division between constructing and initializing very clear, and you will often see things like:</p><pre>id myInstance = [[MyClass alloc] initWithFoo:foo andBar:bar];</pre><p>This could hardly be any clearer. What happens if the <b>alloc</b> fails? It will return <b>nil</b>, and the <b>init:</b> message will be sent to the <b>nil</b> object, which ignores any message it receives and returns <b>nil</b> also. </p><p><b>CUJ</b></p></body></html>
