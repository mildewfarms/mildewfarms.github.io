<h3>OC Systems Releases Eclipse Plug-In for C/C++ </h3>

<p>OC Systems has released Hitchhiker for Eclipse, an Eclipse plug-in and runtime engine that provides tracing, profiling, memory leak tracking, and function coverage tools for C/C++ applications. Hitchhiker can be used throughout the application development lifecycle, from development to testing, deployment, and production. Hitchhiker collects performance and control flow data by automatically inserting machine-code instrumentation into an application. Data collection is configured using the Eclipse Workbench. The application can either be launched manually on the target machine or from the Eclipse Workbench; in either case, Hitchhiker detects and instruments the target application.</p>

<p>Hitchhiker is nonintrusive; the application can be traced and profiled at near full execution speed. Contact +1-703-359-8160 or http://www .ocsystems.com/eclipse.</p>
<h3>Red Gate Announces SQL Log Rescue </h3>

<p>Red Gate Software has released SQL Log Rescue, a tool that enables undo and redo of individual SQL Server database transactions, protecting users from lost data. SQL Log Rescue examines both backup files and live transaction logs to ensure data recovery. It lets you investigate SQL Server log files containing millions of transactions, and identify problems using filtering and searching tools. Users can view details of all transactions, including those involving text and image data, and undo and redo them with perfectly scripted SQL. If a table is accidentally dropped, for example, SQL Log Rescue will recover all the data in seconds. Contact +1-866-733-4283 or http://www.red-gate.com/.</p>
<h3>Catalyst Systems Updates Openmake</h3>

<p>Catalyst Systems has announced availability of the latest version of Openmake, its development tool for automated build management. Release 6.4 incorporates new features for project build activity scheduling and tracking, reporting tools for knowledge-base metrics analysis and added support for IBM- and Eclipse-based software development and Perl environments. Openmake supports developers by managing complex build tasks from project birth to maturity, all in a production-ready environment. Openmake is a build management tool that replaces make and Ant/XML scripts with generated Build Control Files that follow comprehensive construction rules. Scheduled, coordinated Openmake builds systematically prepare all types of build target objects. Openmake is designed to locally and remotely build components destined for a variety of deployment platforms including embedded devices, handhelds, workstations, and servers. Contact +1-800-359-8049 or http://www.openmake.com/.</p>
<h3>Recursion Software Intros Its Extended Template Library</h3>

<p>Recursion Software has introduced its ETL (short for "Extended Template Library") Toolkit. The ETL Toolkit adds enhancements to STL implementations, including: Sorted Vector Classes, which are  particularly useful in large arrays, automatically perform functions such as sorting and resizing of arrays after insertion of new items; Dynamic Array Classes, which let you perform numeric array operations such as adding two rows in an array together without loops via operator overloading; a complete Hash Table with its own iterator; a Heap implementation; and an improved List (Stack, Queue, Set) functionality that allows operations to be in constant time at both ends of the list. Using the C++ Toolkits facilitates development of multithreaded distributed applications. Contact +1-800-727-8674 or http://www.recursionsw.com/. </p>
<h3>MKS Toolkit Updated</h3>

<p>MKS has announced the release of Version 9.0 of its cross-platform tools for Windows and UNIX/Linux-based environments.  This release focuses on improving productivity on both 32- and 64-bit Windows systems and provides native support for multibyte/Unicode character sets used around the world. New features in MKS Toolkit 9.0 include: multibyte character support, Vi/Viw integrated with VisualStudio.NET, secure visual file manipulation, updated Perl support, and new utilities such as mksrv, which let you set up any standard script or program to run as a Windows service, and pwrmgr, which lets you display and manage power schemes while ShellExecute gives you the ability to launch any file as if it was an executable.

<p>Etnus has announced the general availability of TotalView 7.0, which includes support for C++ and F90-specific expression evaluation, support for Apple Mac OS X, and enhancements to the graphical interface. TotalView's enhanced expression evaluation system gives you more control for analyzing your C++ code. Etnus has also improved the debugging experience for MPI programmers. TheTotalView GUI now shows MPI processes graphically; these graphical views provide instant state information and an easy method to navigate among processes. TotalView is a 32- and 64-bit graphical debugger providing you with complete control over threaded and parallel applications written in C and C++. TotalView's memory debugging features are fully integrated into the debugger, allowing developers to shorten the development cycle by eliminating both bugs in code and memory problems such as leaks at the same time. The system also provides an on-demand, view-based approach that eliminates the need to wait for postmortem-style reports common in standalone memory tools.
