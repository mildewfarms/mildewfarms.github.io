<p>Although C++/CLI supports stack-based objects, it also supports those that reside on the heap. However, if you are interoperating with other CLI-based languages (such as C#, Visual Basic, and J#), you need to recognize that they support only heap-based objects. When working in this heap-based object environment, you are always at arms length from an object. Given two handles <b>h1</b> and <b>h2</b>, <b>*h1 = *h2 </b>only works if an assignment operator has been defined for those handles' type, and for types written in languages other than C++/CLI, which is unlikely to be the case. As such, a CLS-compliant mechanism is needed to create a copy of an object, and that mechanism is called "cloning."</p>
<h3>Using a CLI Library  Clone Function</h3>

<p>Consider <a href="0509jaeschkel1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>, which uses the library class <b>System::ArrayList</b>, a vector-like type. <a href="0509jaeschkef1.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 1</a> is the output.</p>

<p><b>ArrayList al1</b> consists of a set of four strings specifying different colors. You then make a complete copy of that object in case 3 by calling the function <b>ArrayList::Clone</b>, so the output produced by cases 2 and 4 are the same.</p>

<p>Then you modify <b>al1</b> by removing the second element, by adding a new element to the end, and by changing the first element's value. When you compare the output produced by cases 6 and 7, you see that the changes applied to <b>al1</b> have no affect on <b>al2</b>. Specifically, the internal reference inside of <b>al2</b> points to its own private copy of elements, not to the same set as <b>al1</b>. This is referred to as a "deep copy," whereas simply making both <b>ArrayLists</b>' internal reference point to the same set of values (as would be the case with the assignment<b> al2 = al1</b>) is called a "shallow copy."</p>

<p>If you wish to make copies of your own objects, you should model the copy process on the library-cloning machinery.</p>
<h3>Adding Cloning to a Type</h3>

<p>The key to cloning is to implement the standard interface <b>System::ICloneable</b>, which, in turn, requires you to define a function called <b>Clone</b> that takes no arguments and has a return type of <b>System::Object^</b>. The handle returned is to a new object that is a copy of the object on which it is called. For example, consider <a href="0509jaeschkel2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>, whose output is:</p>

<pre>
p1: (3,5)
p1: (9,11)
p2: (3,5)

</pre>

<p>In case 3, you create the copy by calling <b>Clone</b>, and because that function returns an <b>Object^ </b>(but one that you know refers to a <b>Point</b>), you must cast that to type <b>Point^ </b>before you can assign it to <b>p2</b>. (Even though <b>Point::Clone</b> is really returning a handle to a <b>Point</b>, you can't declare that function as such because that wouldn't satisfy the contract specified by the interface.)</p>

<p>Type <b>System::Object</b> defines a function called <b>MemberwiseClone</b>, as follows:</p>

<pre>
protected:
    Object^ MemberwiseClone();

</pre>

<p>This function creates and returns a copy of the object on which it is called. The general intent is that, for any handle <b>x</b>, the following expressions are true:</p>

<pre>
x-&gt;MemberwiseClone() != x
x-&gt;MemberwiseClone()-&gt;GetType()      == x-&gt;GetType()

</pre>

<p>Copying an object typically entails creating a new instance of its class, but it also may require copying of internal data structures as well. No constructors are to be called.</p>

<p><b>Object::MemberwiseClone</b> performs a specific cloning operation. It creates a new instance of the class of this object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this function performs a shallow copy of this object.</p>

<p>This implementation of <b>Point</b> uses two instance variables, both of which have the fundamental type <b>int</b>. Fundamental types are value class types, so a shallow copy of one <b>Point</b> to another is sufficient for our needs. You achieve this by calling the base class <b>Object</b>'s <b>MemberwiseClone</b>.</p>

<p>Consider class <b>Circle</b> in which a <b>Circle</b> contains a handle to a <b>Point</b> (representing the origin) and a fundamental-typed field (representing the radius); see <a href="0509jaeschkel3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>get</b> accessor for the <b>Origin</b> property of class <b>Circle</b> is implemented using <b>Point::Clone</b>. As defined, this accessor returns a <b>Point</b> that is a copy of the center <b>Point</b>.</p>

<p>In case 1, I call <b>Object::MemberwiseClone</b> to make a shallow copy of the <b>Circle</b>. This results in a new <b>Circle</b> whose radius is the same as that of the current one, but has both <b>Circle</b>s' origins referring to exactly the same <b>Point</b>. Therefore, in case 2, I call <b>Point::Clone</b> to make sure that the new <b>Circle</b>'s origin refers to a copy of the current one's center <b>Point</b>. Finally, in case 3, I return a handle to this new <b>Circle</b>. <a href="0509jaeschkel4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a> is a program that tests this class and produces the output shown.</p>
<h3>Cloning Arrays</h3>

<p>Consider <a href="0509jaeschkel5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>, in which I extend the generic class <b>Vector</b> to support cloning. Because all CLI array types derive from <b>System::Array</b>, and that class implements the interface <b>System::ICloneable</b>, you can make a copy of the array elements simply by calling <b>Clone</b> on a reference to that array, as shown. Of course, the cast must include the array notation.</p>
<h3>Cloning and Derived Classes</h3>

<p>The approach shown thus far works fine for classes that derive directly from <b>Object^</b>; however, it breaks down for classes that derive from other classes. Consider <a href="0509jaeschkel6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a>. Being derived directly from <b>System::Object</b>, this class's approach to cloning is as seen before. <b>Base</b> is used as the base class for <b>Derived</b> shown in <a href="0509jaeschkel7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a>.</p>

<p>Stating explicitly that <b>Derived</b> implements <b>ICloneable</b> is redundant; <b>Derived</b>'s base class already does that. No new requirement is added.</p>

<p>What is new in this example is the call to <b>Base::Clone</b> in <b>Clone</b>. This replaces our previous call to <b>MemberwiseClone</b> (which has been commented out). By calling <b>Base::Clone</b> (which, in turn, will call its base class's <b>Clone</b>, which, ultimately, will call <b>Object::MemberwiseClone</b>), you get a clone of the base object. <a href="0509jaeschkel8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a> is the test program.</p>

<p>Why have I made the <b>Clone</b> functions virtual? Well, when you call <b>Base::Clone</b>, you want to make sure you get the most appropriate implementation, and that is achieved via virtual function lookup.</p>
<h3>Creation Without Construction</h3>

<p>An implementation of <b>Clone</b> shouldn't call any of its own class's constructors. For most classes, this is not a problem because all their constructors simply initialize the nonstatic data members. However, if a constructor initializes any static data members or performs other operations, these actions will not be done during cloning unless <b>Clone</b> does them itself. In <a href="0509jaeschkel9.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 9</a>, class <b>Test</b> contains a static counter that tracks the number of objects of that type that have been created. Combined, cases 1 and 2 duplicate the behavior of the constructors.</p>

<p>As shown by this output, the object count is incremented when an object is constructed or cloned:</p>

<pre>
t1 using new: 0, 1
t2 using Clone: 0, 2
t3 using new: 1, 3
t4 using Clone: 1, 4

</pre>

<h3>Reader Exercises</h3>

<p>To reinforce the material presented this month, try this:</p>



<ol>
  <li>Implement a generic public class called <b>Matrix</b> that models a two-dimensional table. This type has the skeleton:</li>

<pre>
generic &lt;typename T&gt;
public ref class Matrix : ICloneable
{
     array&lt;T,2&gt;^ values;
public:
     Matrix(int row, int col);
     property T default[int, int] {
          T get(int row, int col);
          void set(int row, int col, T value);
     }
     virtual Object^ Clone() override;
     virtual String^ ToString() override
};

</pre>


  <li>	Test the <b>Clone</b> function by creating one <b>Matrix</b> and cloning it, then change one or more elements in each matrix and display the matrices showing that changes to one don't affect the other. q</li></ol>
