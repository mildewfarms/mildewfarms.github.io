<p>In the previous installment of "Agile C++" [1], I introduced the concept of unsmart pointer class templates, covering the two basic kinds of unsmart pointers&#151;deletable and undeletable. An unsmart pointer is a pointer that does not automatically delete the resource to which it refers. The deletable unsmart pointer provides a <b>Delete()</b> method for manual deletion of the referred resource, while the undeletable pointer does not. In this installment, I introduce some specialized deletable unsmart pointer class templates.</p>

<p>The <b>any_ptr</b> pointer class template can point to any copy-constructible value and clone it or delete it. The <b>base_class_ptr</b> can refer to any object derived from a class without a virtual destructor in a polymorphic manner (for example, through the base class) and ensure that the derived destructor is called. Finally, the <b>counted_ptr</b> unsmart point can help detect and prevent memory management errors such as double deletion, premature deletion, and orphaned memory blocks.</p>
<h3>Unsmart Pointers: Recap</h3>

<p>Pointers have different characteristics depending on how they are being used. For instance, a pointer might represent:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The return value of an <b>address-of</b> operation on a local variable.</li>
  <li>A position in an array.</li>
  <li>A dynamically allocated object.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first case, incrementing or decrementing the pointer would generally not be a safe thing to do, nor would calling <b>delete</b> on it. In the second case, incrementing or decrementing the pointer would be fine, but calling <b>delete</b> would not. In the third case, incrementing or decrementing would not be a safe thing to do, but calling <b>delete</b> would not only be fine, but expected. These are generalizations, and there are exceptions to these rules of thumb simply because C++ doesn't distinguish different types of pointer.</p>

<p>The purpose of unsmart pointers is to assign separate types to pointers based on their behavior. I decided to divide pointers up into two actual types&#151;pointers that allow deletion and pointers that do not allow deletion. This lets you use the type system to enforce correct and intentional usage of pointers, such as prevention of calling <b>delete</b> on undeletable pointers by preventing inappropriate casts (for example, from undeletable pointers to a deletable pointer).</p>

<p>The implementation I proposed for deletable and undeletable pointers was a single template with two specializations:<b> ptr&lt;T</b>, <b>deletable&gt;</b> and <b>ptr&lt;T, !deletable&gt;</b>. To enforce the guarantee that undeletable pointers are in fact undeletable, I presented several strict type-casting rules. <a href="0509digginsl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> shows the various legal and illegal casts. I have made some minor improvements to the implementation of the <b>ptr</b> templates; see <a href="0509digginsl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>.</p>
<h3>Referring to  [Almost] Any Object</h3>

<p>The old school method of referring to an arbitrary object is through the much maligned<b> void*</b> type. The main problem with this technique is that it gives up automatic type checking, forcing you to devise a system for keeping track of type information. Fortunately, this bookkeeping can often be handled by a library: <a href="0509digginsl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a> presents the unsmart pointer <b>any_ptr</b>, which can refer to any copy-constructible object, clone it, delete it, and get the <b>type_info</b> for the referenced type. </p>

<p>This class is similar to the <b>boost::any</b> type from the Boost library by Kevlin Henney. The difference is that <b>any_ptr</b> holds a pointer to a value, and does not make a copy of the value upon assignment. This makes <b>any_ptr</b> a complementary type to <b>boost::any</b>, and opens up some interesting possibilities for referring to collections or other objects with relatively expensive copy semantics.</p>

<p>It is an application of the technique addressed in my September 2004 <i>CUJ</i> article [2]. Conceptually, what is occurring is that at compile time, whenever an object is bound to an <b>any_ptr</b>, a function table is created containing three primary functions: <b>Clone()</b>, <b>Delete()</b>, and <b>GetType()</b>. What is stored within <b>any_ptr</b> is a <b>void</b> pointer, but the generated functions cast it to its true type, before operating on it. As a result, <b>any_ptr</b> has two pointers, one to the current object (stored as a <b>void*</b>) and the other to the statically generated function table.</p>
<h3>Deleting Types Derived From Classes Without Virtual Destructors</h3>

<p>Public inheritance has a well-known yet easily overlooked pitfall: When destroying a class derived from a base class without a virtual destructor, the behavior is undefined. In the best case, the derived destructor would simply not be called, but there are potentially greater repercussions as Pete Becker has pointed out [3]:</p>

<blockquote>
In many implementations, the effect is that the base class's destructor runs but the derived class's destructor doesn't, but that's not required. Even then, in some implementations the destructor also deletes the memory, and calling the "wrong" destructor can also mean that the wrong memory size is passed to the memory manager. And when the base is one of multiple bases, the pointer passed to the memory manager can be invalid (all but one of the bases is at some offset from the allocated memory block). <br>

</blockquote>



<p>The obvious and common solution is to make <b>~MyBaseClass() </b>virtual, but for various reasons, that is not always possible or appropriate.</p>

<p>For such situations, I have provided an implementation in <a href="0509digginsl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a> of a <b>base_class_ptr</b> unsmart pointer that lets you refer to a type polymorphically and still assure that the derived class's constructor is called. The <b>base_class_ptr</b> is implemented using virtually the same technique as described for <b>any_ptr</b>.</p>
<h3>Reference-Counted Pointers</h3>

<p>Whenever I mention reference counting, people often assume I am referring to a somewhat na&iuml;ve garbage-collection algorithm. This is, of course, not the only use for reference counting. Reference counting can also be used to detect errors, such as premature resource deletion and memory leakage at debug time, as demonstrated by the template <b>counted_ptr</b> in <a href="0509digginsl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>. By using reference counting, you can detect when a deletion is occurring prematurely by simply asserting that the reference count is precisely one. This would indicate that another <b>counted_ptr</b> still refers to the object. Whether or not that will delete the referenced object that they both share, we cannot say. However, it is a definite possibility and it tells you that you should release the other <b>counted_ptr</b> first; after all, it is just good manners.</p>

<p>You can also check for many cases of orphaned memory blocks by asserting that the reference count never reaches zero outside of an explicit deletion. This would indicate to you that no other <b>counted_ptr</b>s will exist to the object, after the current reference-counted pointer is removed. The caveat for this method is that self-referential blocks are not caught by this algorithm, so this algorithm does not provide complete safety from orphaned memory, but every little bit helps.</p>

<p>The reference-counted <b>counted_ptr</b> template in <a href="0509digginsl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a> fits into the unsmart pointer framework as a special case of a deletable pointer. It provides a <b>Delete()</b> member function and can be assigned to any undeletable pointer. It can only be assigned from a <b>new_ptr</b> or another <b>counted_ptr</b>. Note that this pointer cannot be assigned to another deletable pointer; that would invalidate all of the assertions, and would defeat the whole utility of the reference-counted error detection.</p>

<p>Be aware that the reference-counted unsmart pointer I am proposing does not provide a guarantee that it will catch all invalid usages. For instance, if you assign the reference-counted pointer to a noncounted pointer, usage of the resource after deletion is still possible. When the <b>NDEBUG</b> macro is defined, the pointer removes all reference-counting checks and provides performance nearly at par with a raw pointer.</p>
