<p>Sorting lists of values or character strings is an important aspect of many computing problems. Many list-sorting algorithms exist, varying widely in speed, ease of implementation, and utility. Several reviews, including Shene's [1], provide a comparison of list-sorting algorithms, and several authors emphasize that the relative ability of algorithms depends upon the degree of sorting that already exists within the list they are applied to. The number of different algorithms and their relative merits can lead to confusion about which is most applicable in a given situation. Knuth [2] provides a compilation of known list-sorting algorithms and places their development in a historical perspective, while Niemann [3] gives a list of common algorithms alongside source code, enabling the implementation of these algorithms. An additional useful source of information is Martin [4], who presents a detailed survey of list-sorting algorithms over a period of 20 years, giving details of 37 sorting algorithms in all. </p>

<p>However, not all of the list-sorting algorithms in use are as historic. Nyberg et al. [5] demonstrated a novel record-breaking list-sorting algorithm called "Alphasort," while discussions of improvement and fine-tuning of various algorithms to produce ever-better performance is ongoing in many Internet fora. Bentley and Sedgewick [6] demonstrated a searching and sorting algorithm using ideas dating back to the 1960s, but that had never been implemented together in one algorithm.  </p>

<p>The bench testing of list-sorting algorithms provides an important indicator of performance. The design of these bench-testing experiments has important effects on the measurements taken, as described in Alviar [7]. Various benchmark indicators exist for list-sorting algorithms, with the most common being the time taken to sort lists of specific size. A popular alternative is to measure how much sorting can be carried out in a set time period (for instance, Puschner and Burns [8]).</p>

<p>In this article, we present a novel list-sorting algorithm named "Ordersort" that is simple to implement and that sorts lists at a rate superior to both the Quicksort and Bubblesort algorithms for lists of less than a certain length, as shown by testing on lists of different lengths and with different degrees of randomization. We implement Ordersort in C++ and explain how the algorithm operates.</p>
<h3>Methods and Results</h3>

<p>The Ordersort algorithm operates in two stages:</p>



<ol>
  <li>Determining the order in which the entries should be arranged.</li>
  <li>Sorting the list according to this order.  </li>
</ol>



<p>The order in which entries are to be arranged is determined by locating, for a particular entry, the entries that come immediately before and immediately after it. The algorithm moves sequentially from one entry to the next in the unsorted list, locating the previous and next entries in the sorted list, and labelling each with the address of the entry that follows it. The location of the previous entry is determined by a two-tier looping process that first loops through the list in steps of size <i>N</i><sup>1/2</sup>, where <i>N</i> is the list length, attempting to find an entry that is only slightly lower in the list order than the entry of interest, and then loops forward in single steps from this point to find the entry immediately below the entry of interest. The pseudocode in <a href="0509aitkenheadf1.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 1</a> details the Ordersort algorithm's processes.</p>

<p>All processes were carried out using programs written in C++, running on a Windows XP/Pentium 4 machine with a 2.59-GHz processor and 512 MB of RAM. <a href="0509aitkenheadf2.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 2</a> presents the sort times using this system for three list-sorting algorithm implementations, including one <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>2</sup>) algorithm (Bubblesort), one <i>O</i>(<i>N</i>log<i>N</i>) algorithm (Quicksort), and the Ordersort algorithm, with randomized integer lists of different lengths. The values in the lists used lie between 0 and the list length.</p>

<p>In <a href="0509aitkenheadf3.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 3</a>, sorting times for the same three algorithms at different list lengths are given, with the lists being partially sorted. In this case, partially sorting of the lists is carried out by allowing the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> entry to occupy the range [<i>i-z</i>, <i>i</i>+<i>z</i>], where <i>z</i> is equal to some factor <i>w</i> multiplied by the length of the list. For <a href="0509aitkenheadf3.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 3</a>, the value of <i>w</i> is set to 0.1.</p>

<p><a href="0509aitkenheadf4.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 4</a> shows the sorting times for the same three algorithms, using lists that are very sorted (the value of the aforementioned <i>w</i> is set to 0.001). Comparison of Figures 2, 3, and 4 shows that the three list-sorting algorithms all show improvements in list-sorting speed with more sorted lists, with the Bubblesort algorithm showing the most dramatic improvement. The Ordersort algorithm is faster than Quicksort up to a list length of approximately 3000 for the unsorted and partially sorted lists, and for very sorted lists, Bubblesort is superior to the other two up to list lengths of approximately 25,000.</p>

<p>Examination of the results of list sorting and of the methodology demonstrates that the algorithm provides a stable sort method (that is, it preserves the current sort order for equal keys). Examination of the method itself indicates that the algorithm provides a sorting time of <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>3/2</sup>) for the worst-case scenario, placing it between the categories occupied by algorithms such as Bubblesort and those such as Quicksort. In practice, for a completely randomized list, the effective sort time is approximately <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>1.41</sup>). <a href="0509aitkenheadl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> is the C++ source-code listing for the Ordersort algorithm.</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>We've presented and implemented a compact, simple, and rapid method of sorting lists, which compares favorably with an implementations of common <i>O</i>(<i>N</i>log<i>N</i>) and <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>2</sup>) (Quicksort and Bubblesort) sorting algorithms using random and partially sorted lists. This method requires two arrays, each the size of the list being sorted to operate, but apart from this memory requirement, does not place any special demands computationally. It operates at comparable speeds to the Quicksort algorithm when applied to sorted and unsorted lists below a certain list-length threshold. The Ordersort algorithm has the capability of being applied to lists of strings as well as real number and integer lists, and can be used in lists where there are records with the same values whose order must be preserved. The method is not groundbreaking in its originality, and is similar to the insertion sort method with the additional use of a linked-list implemented in two arrays. However, the combination of the linked lists and the search technique used to find the insertion point for the next item does provide an original method.</p>
