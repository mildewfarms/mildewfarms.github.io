<p>This month, I examine C++/CLI issues relating to inheritance. The class hierarchy used involves three kinds of transactions at a bank: deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. The transaction type is implemented using a new form of <b>enum</b>.</p>
<h3>Enumerators</h3>

<p>Consider the type declaration in <a href="0506jaeschkel1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>, which lives in its own source file and is compiled to an assembly that contains only this type.</p>

<p>As you should expect, the enumerators <b>Deposit</b>, <b>Withdrawal</b>, and <b>Transfer</b> act like constants with the values 0, 1, and 2, respectively. (Enumerators really are literal fields.)</p>

<p>Three things set this <b>enum</b> type definition apart from a Standard C++ <b>enum</b> (that is, a "native <b>enum</b>"):</p>



<ul>
  <li><b>enum</b> class is used instead of just <b>enum</b>. This makes <b>TransactionType</b> a CLI <b>enum</b>. (<b>enum struct </b>is permitted as well, and is equivalent to <b>enum</b> class.)</li>
  <li>The type has a visibility of public, letting it be seen outside its parent assembly. (In C++/CLI, a native <b>enum</b> can also have a visibility specifier.)</li>
  <li>The <b>enum</b> has an explicit base representation specifier; in this case,<b> unsigned char</b>. (In C++/CLI, a native <b>enum</b> can also have a base.) By default, the base is <b>int</b>. The base can be <b>bool</b> or any integer type other than <b>wchar_t</b>. (If a <b>bool</b> base is specified, the enumerators must be explicitly initialized because there is no obvious sequence of default initial values.)</li>
</ul>



<p>The reason to support this new syntax is that CLI <b>enum</b>s are CLS-compliant, while native <b>enum</b>s are not.</p>

<p>The primary difference between a CLI <b>enum</b> and a native <b>enum</b> is that in the former, the name of an enumerator is scoped by its parent <b>enum</b> type. In addition, the integral promotions defined by the C++ Standard do not apply to a CLI <b>enum</b>.</p>

<p>Like a native <b>enum</b>, a CLI <b>enum</b> can also be defined inside a class. In such cases, however, a visibility specifier is not permitted because the visibility of that nested type is taken from that of the type in which it is nested.</p>
<h3>The Abstract  Transaction Base Class</h3>

<p>The transaction type hierarchy is rooted in the base class <b>Transaction</b> that, by default, is derived from <b>System::Object</b> (see <a href="0506jaeschkel2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>).</p>

<p>In case 1 of <a href="0506jaeschkel2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>, this class is marked with the <b>abstract</b> modifier, meaning that it cannot be instantiated directly. ("abstract" is not a keyword; it is merely reserved for this purpose in this context.) This modifier lets an <b>abstract</b> class be defined without having to explicitly declare one or more if its member functions to be pure virtual.</p>

<p>As you can see from the private data members, a <b>Transaction</b> contains a transaction type and a time/date stamp, both of which I access via the properties defined in cases 3a and 3b. The CLI library value class type <b>System::DateTime</b> used in case 2 allows an instant in time to be represented as a date and time of day. Note how both properties have public getters and private setters (which under the new CLI Standard, is now CLS-compliant).</p>

<p>Case 4 requires that every concrete transaction type have the public member function <b>PostTransaction</b>, with the signature shown. The abstract function modifier is equivalent to the Standard C++ syntax for declaring a pure virtual function. An abstract function must be explicitly declared virtual.</p>

<p>As the constructor should only be called from a derived class, the constructor defined in case 5 is protected. The business of this constructor is simple: It sets the new transaction's type to that passed to it, and sets the time/date stamp to the current time by calling the getter of the public property <b>DateTime::Now</b>. In the case of the transaction type passed in, being of a value class type, nullptr is not permitted, and with the strong type checking of CLI <b>enum</b> types, the compiler only allows enumerators of that type to be passed, or instances of that type, which, of course, could only have been initialized with enumerators of that type.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, the constructor would run as quickly as possible; however, to get more interesting results from our test program, rather than place a delay in that program&#151;so the time/date stamp changes for each transaction&#151;in case 6, the constructor "sleeps" for a random amount of time before initializing its data members. Every program has at least one thread of execution, and certain characteristics of that thread can be set or retrieved via members of the sealed <b>ref</b> class <b>System::Threading::Thread</b>. The function <b>Thread::Sleep</b> suspends execution of the current thread for the specified number of milliseconds.</p>

<p>To vary the suspension period, the <b>ref</b> class <b>System::Random</b> is used to generate a sequence of pseudorandom numbers. The <b>Next</b> function overload used in case 6 retrieves the next number in the sequence that is in the range "greater than or equal to 1000 and less than 2001"; that is, you want a delay of between one and two seconds.</p>
<h3>The Deposit,  Withdrawal, and Transfer Classes</h3>

<p><a href="0506jaeschkel3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a> defines the <b>Deposit</b> class. Why is the class sealed? If you haven't thought through whether it is robust enough to be used as a base class, then don't allow it to be used in that manner.</p>

<p>The CLI supports a single-inheritance model only. As such, <b>ref</b> and <b>value</b> classes can have only one direct base class, which, by default, is <b>System::Object</b>. In case 1, <b>Deposit</b> is derived directly from <b>Transaction</b>. Note the absence of the access specifier public. The CLI only supports public inheritance, so while you could have written "<b>: public Transaction</b>" instead, that would be redundant. (For native classes, inheritance is public by default when the derived type is a <b>struct</b>, and private by default when it is a class.)</p>

<p>Because the CLI library supports a type suitable for financial calculations (namely, <b>System::Decimal</b>), you use that to represent the deposit amount in case 2.</p>

<p>For convenience, two constructors are provided: one that takes an amount expressed as <b>Decimal</b>, the other expressed in double. Note how the name-scoping requirements of CLI <b>enum</b>s require that the <b>TransactionType</b> enumerator <b>Deposit</b> be fully qualified in both constructor definitions.</p>

<p>You fulfill the base class's abstract requirement by providing an implementation of <b>PostTransaction</b> in case 4. <b>DateTime</b> is a <b>value</b> type, so when an instance of it is passed, it is boxed to match the overload of <b>WriteLine</b> that expects an <b>Object^</b>. The expression <b>this</b> has type <b>Deposit^</b>, which is a type derived from <b>Object^</b>, the type in the <b>WriteLine</b> overload. In both cases, the hierarchy is walked until the corresponding <b>ToString</b> function is reached and then called.</p>

<p>You could have declared the function <b>PostTransaction</b> to be sealed, so it could not be overridden. However, given that the parent class itself is sealed, that function can never be overridden.</p>

<p>The format specifier <b>{0,10:0.00} </b>used in case 5 says to right-justify the amount in a width of 10 print positions, to round to two decimal places, and to have at least one digit prior to the decimal point.</p>

<p>The type <b>Deposit</b> relies directly on types <b>Transaction</b> and <b>TransactionType</b>, so it makes sense for the assemblies for both of these types to be made available to the compilation of <b>Deposit</b>. By doing so, however, the compiler may issue a warning to the affect that <b>TransactionType</b> has been "imported" twice, once directly and once indirectly via <b>Transaction</b>. You can safely ignore that warning.</p>

<p>The class <b>Withdrawal</b> is defined in <a href="0506jaeschkel4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>, and the class <b>Transfer</b> is defined in <a href="0506jaeschkel5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>.</p>

<p>Although all three implementations of <b>PostTransaction</b> are identical, in a real transaction processing system, that is unlikely to be the case.</p>
<h3>The Test Program</h3>

<p><a href="0506jaeschkel6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a> tests the transaction types by creating an array of concrete-typed transactions, and iterating over that array, calling each element's <b>PostTransaction</b> function. <a href="0506jaeschkef1.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 1</a> is output produced from one execution. The default date/time format used is that for the U.S.; that is, month, day, year, with a 12-hour clock.</p>
<h3>Enumerators and Inheritance</h3>

<p>A CLI <b>enum</b> type is implemented as a <b>value</b> class that implicitly inherits from <b>System::Enum</b>. As such, the static and instance members of that type, its base class <b>System::ValueType</b>, and that type's base class, <b>System::Object</b>, become available to you in the context of a CLI <b>enum</b> type or any instance of that type. <a href="0506jaeschkel7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a> produces the output in <a href="0506jaeschkef2.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 2</a>.</p>

<p>In case 1, you call <b>Enum::GetName</b> to find the name of a given enumerator in the specified <b>enum</b> type. The first argument must have type <b>System::Type</b>, and one way to get that is by calling <b>Object::GetType</b> on the variable of interest.</p>

<p>You call <b>Enum::GetNames</b> in case 2 to find the names of all enumerators in the specified <b>enum</b> type. The first argument must have type <b>System::Type</b>, and a way to get that is by calling <b>Type::GetType</b> on a string representation of the name of the type of the variable of interest.</p>

<p>You call <b>Enum::GetUnderlyingType</b> in cases 3 and 4 to find the underlying types of the two CLI <b>enum</b> types. Here I used an even easier way to find a type's <b>Type</b> object&#151;you simply use the new form of the <b>typeid</b> operator.</p>
<h3>Arrays and Inheritance</h3>

<p>Every CLI array type is derived implicitly from the abstract <b>ref</b> class type <b>System::Array</b>. In previous installments, I've shown numerous examples of array manipulation that involve a property called <b>Length</b>, which is inherited from the base type. As such, every public member of <b>Array</b> and <b>Object</b> is available when you are working with a CLI array; see <a href="0506jaeschkel8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a>. <a href="0506jaeschkef3.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 3</a> is the output produced by <a href="0506jaeschkel8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a>. The member functions of <b>Array</b> that are called here are straightforward. </p>
<h3>Overriding versus Hiding</h3>

<p>In a virtual function invocation, the runtime type of the instance for which that invocation takes place determines the actual function implementation to invoke. In a nonvirtual function invocation, the compile-time type of the instance is the determining factor.</p>

<p>As you know from Standard C++, the implementation of a virtual function can be superseded by derived classes. The process of superseding such an implementation is known as "overriding," which is achieved via the use of the override function modifier. Whereas a virtual function declaration introduces a new function, an override function declaration specializes an existing inherited virtual function by providing a new implementation of that function. An override function must be explicitly declared virtual.</p>

<p>When a class redeclares a name that it inherited, in the presence of the <b>new</b> function modifier, that class is said to hide that name.</p>

<p>Using the classes defined in <a href="0506jaeschkel9.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 9</a>, look at a series of variable definitions and their use in calling these members functions:</p>

<pre>
A^ a = gcnew A();
a-&gt;F0();   // calls A::F0
a-&gt;F1();   // calls A::F1
a-&gt;F2();   // calls A::F2

</pre>

<p><b>a-&gt;F0(). A::F0 </b>is a nonvirtual function, so the compile-time type of <b>a</b> (that is, <b>A</b>) is used, resulting in <b>A::F0</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>a-&gt;F1(). A::F1</b> is a virtual function, so the runtime type of <b>a</b> (that is, <b>A</b>) is used, resulting in <b>A::F1</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>a-&gt;F2().</b> Like <b>A::F1</b>,<b> A::F2</b> is a virtual function, so the runtime type of <b>a </b>(that is, <b>A</b>) is used, resulting in <b>A::F2</b> being called.</p>

<pre>
B^ b = gcnew B();
b-&gt;F0();   // calls B::F0
b-&gt;F1();   // calls B::F1
b-&gt;F2();   // calls B::F2

</pre>

<p><b>b-&gt;F0(). B::F0</b> is a nonvirtual function, so the compile-time type of <b>b </b>(that is,<b> B</b>) is used, resulting in <b>B::F0</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>b-&gt;F1(). B::F1 </b>overrides the virtual function <b>A::F1</b>, so the runtime type of <b>b</b> (that is, <b>B</b>) is used, resulting in <b>B::F1</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>b-&gt;F2(). B::F2</b> hides (via <b>new</b>) the virtual function <b>A::F2</b>, so the compile-time type of <b>b</b> (that is, <b>B</b>) is used, resulting in <b>B::F2</b> being called. This hiding function is also virtual, allowing classes derived from <b>B</b> to override this new function.</p>

<pre>
a = b;
a-&gt;F0();   // calls A::F0
a-&gt;F1();   // calls B::F1
a-&gt;F2();   // calls A::F2

</pre>

<p><b>a-&gt;F0(). A::F0 </b>is a nonvirtual function, so the compile-time type of <b>a</b> (that is, <b>A</b>) is used, resulting in <b>A::F0</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>a-&gt;F1(). A::F1</b> is a virtual function, so the runtime type of <b>a</b> (that is, <b>B</b>) is used, resulting in <b>B::F1</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>a-&gt;F2(). A::F2 </b>is a virtual function that is hidden by the function <b>B::F2</b>, so the compile-time type of <b>a</b> (that is, <b>A</b>) is used, resulting in <b>A::F2</b> being called. (Remember, the dynamic lookup process only works if there is a subsequent override function; in this case, there is not.)</p>

<pre>
C^ c = gcnew C();
c-&gt;F0();   // calls C::F0
c-&gt;F1();   // calls C::F1x
c-&gt;F2();   // calls C::F2x

</pre>

<p><b>c-&gt;F0(). C::F0 </b>is a nonvirtual function, so the compile-time type of <b>c </b>(that is, <b>C</b>) is used, resulting in <b>C::F0</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>c-&gt;F1(). C::F1x </b>is a virtual function, so the runtime type of <b>c</b> (that is, <b>C</b>) is used. However, in the case of <b>C::F1x</b>, a named override is used; that is, the function being overridden has a different name from the one doing the overriding. This results in <b>C::F1x</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>c-&gt;F2(). C::F2x </b>overrides the virtual function <b>B::F2</b>, so the runtime type of <b>c </b>(that is, <b>C</b>) is used, resulting in <b>C::F2x</b> being called. (As you can see, in this named override, the explicit override modifier has to be omitted.)</p>

<pre>
b = c;
b-&gt;F0();   // calls B::F0
b-&gt;F1();   // calls C::F1x
b-&gt;F2();   // calls C::F2x

</pre>

<p><b>b-&gt;F0(). B::F0 </b>is a nonvirtual function, so the compile-time type of <b>b</b> (that is, <b>B</b>) is used, resulting in <b>B::F0</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>b-&gt;F1(). B::F1 </b>overrides the virtual function <b>A::F1</b>, so the runtime type of <b>b</b> (that is, <b>C</b>) is used, resulting in <b>C::F1x</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>b-&gt;F2(). B::F2</b> is a virtual function, so the runtime type of <b>b</b> (that is,<b> C</b>) is used, resulting in <b>C::F2x</b> being called.</p>

<pre>
a = c;
a-&gt;F0();   // calls A::F0
a-&gt;F1();   // calls C::F1x
a-&gt;F2();   // calls A::F2

</pre>

<p><b>a-&gt;F0(). A::F0 </b>is a nonvirtual function, so the compile-time type of <b>a</b> (that is,<b> A</b>) is used, resulting in <b>A::F0</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>a-&gt;F1(). A::F1</b> is a virtual function, so the runtime type of <b>a</b> (that is, <b>C</b>) is used, resulting in<b> C::F1x</b> being called.</p>

<p><b>a-&gt;F2(). A::F2 </b>is a virtual function that is hidden by the function <b>B::F2</b>, so the compile-time type of <b>a</b> (that is, <b>A</b>) is used, resulting in <b>A::F2</b> being called. (Remember, the dynamic lookup process only works if there is a subsequent override function. In their case, there is not.)</p>
<h3>Access Specifiers</h3>

<p>Standard C++ supports three member access specifiers: public, protected, and private. To accommodate assemblies, C++/CLI adds another three. The complete set is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>public</b> means that access is not limited.</li>
  <li><b>protected</b> means that access is limited to the containing class and to any types derived from that containing class. </li>
  <li><b>private</b> means that access is limited to the containing type.</li>
  <li><b>internal</b> means that access is limited to the parent assembly.</li>
  <li><b>public protected</b> (or <b>protected public</b>) means that access is limited to the parent assembly and to types derived from the containing class, even if such types are outside this assembly.</li>
  <li><b>private protected </b>(or <b>protected private</b>) means that access is limited to the parent assembly and to types derived from the containing class, provided such types are defined inside this assembly.</li>
</ul>



<p>Members can be made less accessible by a more restrictive access specifier on their parent type. Don't confuse member name accessibility with type visibility (which can only be public or private).</p>
<h3>Reader Exercises</h3>

<p>Here are some things you might want to consider trying:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Using the assembly for <b>TransactionType</b>, confirm that an enumerator has the type of its parent <b>enum</b>. What is the (reserved) name of the public instance data member in each CLI <b>enum</b> that is used to hold the value of an instance of that type?</li>
  <li>Many <b>enum</b> types are defined simply to have a set of named constants with distinct values. Others are defined with enumerators whose initial values are explicitly initialized with distinct values that are a power of two (as in 1, 2, 4, 8, and so on). Define a CLI <b>enum</b> type having the latter and create an instance whose value is the bitwise-or of multiple enumerators. Display the value of that instance. Then apply the attribute<b> [Flags] </b>to that CLI <b>enum</b> type and run the program again. What is the difference? Read the documentation on the type <b>System::FlagsAttribute</b>.</li>
  <li>The name of a native <b>enum</b> can be omitted; for example, <b>enum</b><i> <b></i>Color {Red, Blue, Green}; </b>is permitted. Just by reasoning, determine if this is true for a CLI <b>enum</b>.</li>
  <li>Look at the documentation for the type <b>System::DateTime</b>.</li>
  <li>Could the properties defined in cases 3(a) and 3(b) be implemented as trivial properties, yet still have exactly the same semantics as those defined here?</li>
  <li>Look at the specification of the CLI library types <b>System::Threading::Thread</b> and <b>System::Random</b>.</li>
  <li>Look at the documentation for the type <b>System::Enum</b> and <b>System::Array</b> to see what members are available to users of CLI <b>enum</b> and array types, respectively. </li></ol>
