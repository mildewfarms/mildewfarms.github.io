<h3>OSTnet Searches Code</h3>

<p>OSTnet has developed AMS CodeCrawler and AMS FindIT to provide visibility into an organization's software development repositories. AMS CodeCrawler automatically parses existing C/C++, Java, Cobol, SQL, and other source code, breaks it down into more granular elements (classes, functions, and methods), and indexes the results for subsecond performance on any search query. Using FindIT, you can then search through millions of lines of code stored in multiple repositories for specific method signatures, class dependencies, functions that implement specific interfaces, or other search criteria. Contact +1-514-278-7678 or http://www.ostnet.com/.</p>
<h3>Sun Studio 10 Released</h3>

<p>Sun Studio 10 software is Sun's latest developer tool suite for C, C++, and Fortran application development. The new release supports AMD 64 architecture as well as the Solaris 10 operating system. Additionally, Sun Studio 10 provides a common debugger that can visually debug single and multithreaded C, C++, and Fortran code, and can handle intermixed Java and native code. All of these tools are presented within a NetBeans-based IDE. Contact +1-650-960-1300 or http://www.sun.com/.</p>
<h3>Amzi! Supports Eclipse</h3>

<p>The 7.2 release of Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server incorporates the Eclipse 3.0 IDE to provide editing, debugging, and project management for logic programs, embedded logicbases, and remote logicbases on web servers. Amzi! 7.2 adds graphical icons for breakpoints indicating the four debug ports: call, fail, redo, and exit. In conjunction with the call stack, this feature illustrates advanced logic programming. Amzi! is available on Windows, Linux, Solaris, and HP/UX. Contact +1-828-350-0350 or http://www.amzi.com/.</p>
<h3>Nucleus EDGE Supports Eclipse, Too</h3>

<p>The Nucleus EDGE software development environment now supports Eclipse 3. Multithreaded enhancements to Eclipse also allow the Nucleus EDGE UI to be more responsive, permitting users to interact with the GUI while the software is busy running a background task. Nucleus EDGE is available for the ARM7, ARM9, and XScale processor cores on Windows, and supports the ARM GNU, RedHat GNU, and ARM RealView C/C++ compilers. Contact +1-251-208-3400 or http://www.acceleratedtechnology.com/.</p>
<h3>Electric Cloud Sponsors GMSL</h3>

<p>Electric Cloud has sponsored the creation of the GNU Make Standard Library (GMSL), aimed at providing a common set of tools for all users of GNU Make. The GMSL includes list and string manipulation, integer arithmetic, associative arrays, stacks, and debugging facilities. The GMSL is released under the General Public License and is hosted on SourceForge. Electric Cloud also offers Electric Cloud 2.1, designed to reduce build times by distributing the software build in parallel across scalable clusters of servers. Contact +1-650-968-2950 or http://gmsl.sourceforge.net/.</p>
<h3>Providence Software Solutions Introduces XVT</h3>

<p>XVT from Providence Software Solutions is a cross-platform development tool for building graphical applications that can be deployed alone or over the Web by recompiling existing code. The result is a client/server application where the server executes business functionality and the client renders the presentation layer. The new app is launched from a regular browser that automatically downloads a small, thin client. XVT Web apps maintain the look, feel, and performance of the native platform. XVT 5.6 supports both C (DSC) and C++ (DSP). Contact +1-919-854-1800 or http://www.providencesoftware.com/.</p>
<h3>Express Logic Enhances ARM Debugger</h3>

<p>Express Logic's NetX TCP/IP stack for embedded applications, commonly used with the ThreadX RTOS, can now be viewed at the data structure level from the RealView debugger, much like the ThreadX RTOS kernel data structures. Developers gain visibility into the TCP/IP stack's data structures and the behavior of applications using the stack. Similar visibility is also achieved with Express Logic's FileX embedded file system: Key file system data structures are exposed for easy viewing through the RealView debugger. Contact +1-858-613-6640 or http://www.expresslogic.com/.</p>
<h3>Source Code Available for CAD/CAM Developer's Kit </h3>

<p>Building Block Software has released a source-code edition of its "CAD/CAM Developer's Kit," a series of C function libraries for developing CAD, CAM, and CNC applications. These libraries provide mathematical building blocks necessary for toolpath, boundary offset, area Boolean, and other CAD/CAM calculations. The source code license for the kits is free, but the license requires a purchase of one or more days of consulting for evaluation, training, and integration. Contact +1-978-443-6429 or http://www.buildingblock.com/.</p>
<h3>SoftIntegration Offers Ch 5.0</h3>

<p>SoftIntegration has updated Ch, its embeddable C/C++ interpreter for cross-platform scripting, 2D/3D plotting, numerical computing, shell programming, and embedded scripting. Ch and Embedded Ch 5.0 support multithreading in embedded scripting and provide Borland Builder project samples for embedded Ch. The Ch SDK is bundled with Ch 5.0 for free distribution. SoftIntegration has also announced an open-source Ch ODBC Package 4.0 for unixODBC and iODBC. Contact +1-530-297-7398 or http://www.softintegration.com/.</p>
<h3>SecurePlay Version 2.1 Announced</h3>

<p>IT GlobalSecure has updated its multiplayer state engine, SecurePlay 2.1. SecurePlay implements a suite of cryptographic protocols to stop many kinds of cheating and piracy, and offers a programming interface for multiplayer, networked game development. SecurePlay 2.1 includes integrated networking and interoperability between Java and C++ in Windows and Linux. You receive a complete copy of the documented source code in Flash, Java, J2ME, or C++, with a PS2 release forthcoming. Contact +1-202-332-5878 or http://www.secureplay.com/.</p>
