<h1>The New C++  Not-So-Standard Library</h1>
<p><i>C/C++ Users Journal</i> June, 2005</p>
<h2>TR1: Templates, classes, and functions that supplement the C++ Standard Library</h2>


<h3>By Pete Becker</h3>


<I>Pete Becker is a software developer employed by Dinkumware Ltd., where he works on standard library implementation and documentation for C, C++, and Java. He is project editor for the C++ Standard, and currently writing a book about TR1. He can be contacted at petebecker@acm.org.</I>

<hr>





<p>TR1, the <i>Technical Report on C++ Library Extensions</i>, provides a grab bag of templates, classes, and functions that supplement those currently in the C++ Standard Library. Some are more powerful or more flexible versions of existing templates, some are analogs of existing templates with various new properties, some bring the library more in line with the 1999 changes to the Standard C Library, and some provide wholly new features. The TR1 Library is not, however, part of the C++ Standard, so compilers that conform to the Standard are not required to provide it.</p>

<p>TR1 extends the Standard C++ Library with new facilities in these areas:</p>

<ul>
    <li><i>Utilities.</i> A reference-counted smart pointer; a class template, <b>tuple</b>, that generalizes the <b>std::pair</b> class template to handle various numbers of arguments.</li>
  <li><i>Function Objects.</i> More powerful and more flexible templates to provide wrappers around functions, member functions, and other function objects, allowing them to be used more easily as arguments to algorithms.</li>
  <li><i>Type Traits.</i> A set of templates that extract properties of types or modify types at compile time, simplifying template metaprogramming.</li>
  <li><i>Numerics. </i>A rich set of random number generators; advanced mathematical special functions.</li>
  <li><i>Containers. </i>Sets and maps implemented with hash tables, a fixed-size array. </li>
  <li><i>Regular Expressions. </i>Classes and functions to describe and search for patterns in text.</li>
  <li><i>C Compatibility. </i>Numeric facilities, types, functions, and macros such as those added to the C language in 1995 and 1999.</li>
</ul>

<p>This column will examine the ISO standardization process and how it applies to the C++ Standard and TR1. We'll then look at the templates and classes that make up TR1. Over the next 15 months or so, those templates and classes will be discussed in more detail.</p>
<h3>The ISO  Standardization Process</h3>

<p>ISO technical standards are written by committees of volunteers who meet regularly, typically for several years. For C++, this committee is ISO Working Group 21, which is part of Subcommittee 22 of ISO's Joint Technical Committee 1. In "standardese" that's JTC1/SC22/WG21, or WG21 for short. In addition, there's the American National Standards Institute's J11, which has become less important over the years, as the focus within the standards committee shifted from creating an American standard that would then become an international standard to directly creating an international standard [1].</p>

<p>Working Group decisions are made by consensus. That means that there must be general agreement on a technical decision; the vote of a bare majority is not sufficient. In WG21, most of the work of developing a consensus is done in subgroups. Part of the responsibility of the subgroup chairs is to make sure that there is broad agreement on matters that will be brought before the committee for a vote. Most of the time, if something is controversial, it's not ready for a decision. Further discussion has usually led to deeper technical insights, and, in turn, to resolving the controversy.</p>

<p>Work on the first C++ Standard began in 1991, and it was approved by ISO in 1998 [2]. Like most technical specifications, it had some errors&#151;some merely typographical, some where the text wasn't clear enough, and some where the text was simply wrong. Even when the text was clear and correct, there were places where we later realized that a simple change could make the language or the library more powerful, easier to use, or both. ISO has formal procedures for addressing both of these forms of problems. Errors in standards are addressed through Defect Reports (DRs); enhancements are typically addressed through a Technical Corrigendum (TC) or a revised standard.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, when someone tells the standards committee that there's a defect in the standard, the result is a Defect Report. ISO has stringent rules for tracking and responding to DRs; every DR must get a response, even if it's only the minimal NAD (that's our abbreviation for "Not A Defect"). Even then, we usually try to explain why we think it's not a problem. There are documents available on the WG21 web site that give the status of all the DRs that have been submitted to the standards committee [3].</p>

<p>In the Library Working Group, we adopted a rather narrow definition of a defect; if the words in the standard said what we meant them to say, and what they said was technically feasible, we wouldn't change the standard. That's not to say that such a change didn't have merit, just that it wasn't something we were willing to do in the form of a DR. We felt that such substantive changes should be made in a subsequent major revision of the standard.</p>

<p>In 2003, the standards committee issued a revised standard that included all of the changes made in response to DRs up to that time [4]. That's a bit unusual; the more common approach is to issue a TC that lists the changes made to the existing standard. For the C++ Standard, this list would have been quite long, and we decided it would be better to integrate the changes and issue a revised Standard.</p>

<p>Also in 2003, we started working on the next revision of the C++ Standard. That's a long-term project, with no set completion date and, as yet, no established list of new features. That's all okay, though, because ISO rules require at least five years between revisions of a standard, so there's plenty of time remaining before we're allowed to change the 2003 version of the Standard.</p>

<p>Five years may seem like a long time, especially if you've bought into the hype about working in Internet time. But we have to live in the real world, and for programming languages, that means we need to allow time for compilers to catch up with new language requirements, for libraries to be written to match the new specifications, and for users, implementors, and educators to understand the new standard. Only then can we evaluate its strengths and weaknesses, and focus properly on what needs to be changed and what needs to be added [5]. Making changes too soon runs the risk that the changes won't be right, necessitating further changes.</p>

<p>This delay doesn't mean the language has to stagnate, though. The standards committee can write Technical Reports that, among other things, indicate possible future directions for the standard. However, a TR does not change the standard. If your compiler comes with an implementation of TR1, use it. But be aware that if you change compilers, your code may no longer work; you can complain to your new compiler vendor that they don't support TR1, but you cannot, on that basis, complain that they do not conform to the C++ Standard.</p>
<h3>Utilities</h3>

<p>The class template <b>shared_ptr&lt;Ty&gt;</b> provides a nonintrusive reference-counted smart pointer to a resource of type <b>Ty</b>. When the last <b>shared_ptr</b> object that owns a given resource is destroyed, the resource will be destroyed. In some situations, this can simplify resource management. For example, programmers often want to create containers that hold pointers to resources. The containers in the Standard Library weren't designed to do that. If you create a <b>vector&lt;int*&gt;</b>, you can populate it with <b>int</b> objects allocated off the heap. However, when the container is destroyed, the memory for those objects won't be freed, and if you haven't provided some way of deleting those objects, you've got a memory leak. With a<b> vector&lt;shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; &gt;</b>, however, if you don't have any other <b>shared_ptr</b> objects that own the resources, when the container is destroyed the resources will also be destroyed. For example, <a href="0506beckerl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> produces this output:</p>

<pre>
  creating one object
   created object at: 00320A38
  calling use_vector
  creating two objects
   created object at: 00320AF8
   created object at: 00320AE8
   destroyed object at: 00320AF8
   destroyed object at: 00320AE8
  returned from use_vector
   destroyed object at: 00320A38

</pre>

<p>The <b>instrumented</b> objects created in the function <b>use_vector</b> are destroyed when the <b>vector</b> object is destroyed. The object created in <b>main</b> is not destroyed until <b>main</b> returns, even though a copy of its pointer was put into the <b>vector</b>.</p>

<p>The class template <b>tuple</b> is a generalization of the template <b>std::pair</b>. It lets you create a type with an arbitrary [6] number of contained objects of various types. As with <b>std::pair</b>, there is also a function template, <b>make_tuple</b>, that creates a <b>tuple</b> object that holds copies of the arguments passed to the function. As you can see in <a href="0506beckerl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>, the syntax for getting at the members of a <b>tuple</b> object is rather different from the syntax for getting at the members of a <b>pair</b> object. With a <b>pair</b> object, you use the member names <b>first</b> and <b>second</b>; this doesn't extend very well to arbitrary numbers of members, so with a <b>tuple</b> object, you pass the <b>tuple</b> object as an argument to the function template <b>get&lt;n&gt;</b>, where <b>n</b> designates the element that you are interested in. If it's done right, the compiler can generate the code for <b>get&lt;n&gt;</b> inline, and the resulting code is the same as the code that would be generated to access a member of a <b>struct</b> by name.</p>

<p>The class template <b>reference_wrapper</b>, as its name suggests, provides a wrapper type that acts pretty much like a reference to another object. The big difference between a <b>reference_wrapper</b> object and a reference is that <b>reference_wrapper</b> objects can be copied and assigned to. As with <b>tuple</b> and <b>pair</b>, there are functions to create <b>reference_wrapper</b> objects that refer to their argument. The function call <b>ref(x)</b> returns an object of type <b>reference_wrapper&lt;Ty&gt;</b>, where <b>Ty</b> is the type of the function argument <b>x</b>. The object acts like a reference to <b>x</b>. The function call <b>cref(x)</b> is similar, but it returns an object of type <b>reference_wrapper&lt;const Ty&gt;</b>. In <a href="0506beckerl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>, note that assigning to an ordinary reference changes the value of the object to which the reference points. Assigning to a <b>reference_wrapper</b> changes the <b>reference_wrapper</b> object to refer to the new object. If you need an actual reference to the object referred to by a <b>referece_wrapper</b>, there is a conversion operator, or you can use the member function <b>get</b>.</p>
<h3>Function Objects</h3>

<p>TR1 provides four new function objects. I've already looked at one of them; <b>reference_wrapper</b> can be called with an appropriate argument list when it holds a reference to a callable object; see <a href="0506beckerl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>.</p>

<p>The class template <b>function</b> provides a wrapper type with a function call operator specified by its template argument. Thus, <b>function&lt;float(float, float)&gt;</b> is a type with a function call operator that can be called with two arguments of type <b>float</b> and returns a <b>float</b>. In itself, that's not a big deal; the real strength of the <b>function</b> template is that it can hold any callable object that can be called with arguments of the specified types and whose return type can be converted to the specified return type; see <a href="0506beckerl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>.</p>

<p>TR1 doesn't specify the details of the types of the other two new function objects. Instead, it specifies template functions that return objects of these new types. You can't name the type in your code, so you use these as function objects that you pass to template functions.</p>

<p>The function <b>bind</b>, like <b>std::bind1st</b> and <b>std::bind2nd</b>, creates a function object that can take a different number of arguments in a different order from the callable object that it wraps. When you call <b>bind</b>, you call it with an argument list consisting of values and placeholders [7]. The function returns an object with a function call operator; when you call the function call operator, the values in the original call are passed to the wrapped object, and the placeholders are replaced by the values passed in the call to the function call operator; see <a href="0506beckerl6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a>.</p>

<p>The function <b>mem_fn</b> provides a generalized wrapper for pointers to member functions. The first argument to the resulting function object is the object that the member function should be applied to. It can be the name of an object, a reference to an object, a pointer to an object, or a smart pointer to an object. The remaining arguments are the named arguments to the member function; see <a href="0506beckerl7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a>. The other three kinds of function objects can also hold pointers to member functions and treat their argument lists the same way as <b>mem_fn</b>.</p>
<h3>Type Traits</h3>

<p>Sometimes in template programming you need to look at the properties of a type that was passed as a type argument. TR1 provides a set of "type predicates" that tell your code whether their type argument is an integral type, a floating-point type, and so on, or whether their argument has, for example, a <b>const</b> or a <b>volatile</b> qualifier. It also provides binary type predicates that tell your code whether two types are the same, whether one type is convertible to another, and whether one type is a base class of another type. You can use "type transformations" to create new types that are related to a given type by adding or removing <b>const</b> or <b>volatile</b> qualifiers, getting the type that a pointer points to, and so on. While many of the things that can be done with type traits can also be done with function overloading, type traits give you compile-time results that can often be used to simplify coding in ways that overloading can't. The trick in <a href="0506beckerl8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a> is that type predicates are derived from <b>true_type</b> when the predicate is true, or from <b>false_type</b> when the predicate is false. Thus, the function <b>copy</b> calls the version of <b>do_copy</b> that uses <b>memcpy</b> when it is called with pointers to a type that has a trivial assignment operator; otherwise, it calls the version that copies each element separately.</p>
<h3>Numerics</h3>

<p>TR1 adds 23 mathematical special functions, each with <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, and <b>long double</b> overloads, for computing irregular modified cylindrical Bessel functions, confluent hypergeometric functions, elliptical integrals of the second kind, and so on. If you don't know what these names mean, you don't need them. If you write code for scientific or engineering applications, you've probably used some or all of them.</p>

<p>If you write code that uses random number generators, TR1 will interest you. It has four class templates that define uniform random number generators. The template <b>linear_congruential</b> implements the most common form of generator, which uses the recurrence relation <b>x(i)=(A*x(i-1)+C) mod M</b>. The template <b>mersenne_twister</b> implements a more complex generator that usually provides random numbers with better distribution characteristics. The templates <b>subtract_with_carry</b> and <b>subtract_with_carry_01</b> use a simple subtraction algorithm to generate fairly good random numbers; the first generates integral values and the second generates floating-point values.</p>

<p>All of these generators produce values that are uniformly distributed; that is, the probability of getting a value in any given subrange of all the generator's possible values is the same as that of getting a value in any other subrange of the same size. Sometimes you need a different distribution. For example, if you toss a coin 30 times, you'll get roughly 15 heads and 15 tails. The actual number you get if you repeat those 30 tosses many times fits a binomial distribution. If you're writing code to simulate sets of 30 coin tosses, you can do each toss separately, or you can save time by generating random numbers in a binomial distribution. TR1 provides nine templates that implement various distributions; you can combine any of the four generators (or a generator of your own) with any of the nine distributions (or a distribution of your own); see <a href="0506beckerl9.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 9</a>.</p>
<h3>Containers</h3>

<p>TR1 adds four templates, named <b>unordered_set</b>, <b>unordered_map</b>, <b>unordered_multiset</b>, and <b>unordered_multiset</b>, that meet most of the requirements for associative containers. These are designed to use a hash table internally, providing constant-time access to elements in most cases. It also adds a template named <b>array</b> that is a fixed-size array and satisfies most of the requirements for a sequence container. Like a built-in array object, an <b>array&lt;Ty, N&gt;</b> object can be initialized with an aggregate initializer. <a href="0506beckerl9.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 9</a> uses an <b>array&lt;int, 31&gt;</b> to count the number of trials with a given number of heads.</p>
<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>Nearly a quarter of the text in TR1 is devoted to regular expressions. A "regular expression" is a sequence of characters that can match one or more target sequences of characters according to a regular expression grammar. In its simplest form, you use the class <b>regex</b> to store a regular expression, and pass the <b>regex</b> object to one of the three functions <b>regex_match</b>, <b>regex_search</b>, and <b>regex_replace</b>. These functions all take a <b>regex</b> object and a target character sequence. The function <b>regex_match</b> checks whether the regular expression stored in the <b>regex</b> object matches the entire target sequence; <b>regex_search</b> finds the leftmost, longest match in the target character sequence; and <b>regex_replace</b> replaces every matching subsequence with replacement text given by a format string. You can also create two kinds of iterators that let you step through the subsequences of the target sequence that match the regular expression; see <a href="0506beckerl10.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 10</a>.</p>
<h3>C Compatibility</h3>

<p>The C++ Standard was based on the 1990 C Standard [8]. The C Standard was amended in 1995 [9] and revised in 1999 [10]. TR1 adopts the changes that these revisions made to the library, modified somewhat to take advantage of C++ language features. It provides low-level control of floating-point operations, including things such as rounding mode and trap handling [11]. It also adds several functions that provide inverse trigonemetric functions for complex arguments and support for fixed-width integral types, including format specifiers for <b>printf</b> and <b>scanf</b>.</p>

<p>TR1 also matches the changes to the C Standard by adding function overloads that follow the Fortran argument promotion rules for most of the math functions. Currently, a call to the function <b>atan2</b> with one argument of type <b>float</b> and one argument of type <b>double</b> is ambiguous: All three of its variants, <b>atan2(float, float)</b>, <b>atan2(double, double)</b>, and <b>atan2(long double, long double)</b>,<b> </b>are equally good matches. Under the new rules, <b>atan2(double, double) </b>is the best match. Generally speaking, integral arguments are promoted to double, then all arguments are promoted to the largest floating-point type in the resulting list of argument types. This does what most people would expect without the need for casts to unify the argument types.</p>
<h3>Coming Up</h3>

<p>Next time, I'll look at the TR1 header<b> &lt;tuple&gt;</b> and the changes that TR1 makes to the standard header <b>&lt;utility&gt;</b> to make <b>std::pair</b> look more like <b>tuple</b>.</p>
