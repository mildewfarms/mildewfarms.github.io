<h2>OSCI: The Open SystemC Initiative</h2>
Anyone can register at the OSCI web site and download the free reference simulator language implementation contributed via an open-source license from the OSCI corporate members. The OSCI version of SystemC requires an OSCI-supported compiler (GNU g++, for example) and currently runs on Windows and several UNIX variants (Linux, Solaris, and HPUX).

<p>According to the OSCI web site, corporate members include ARM, Cadence Design Systems, CoWare, Forte Design Systems, Fujitsu, Mentor Graphics, NEC, and Synopsys. Associate members are Celoxica, Motorola, Panasonic, Prosilog, Summit Design, and Eklectic Ally. You can read more about OSCI and SystemC at [1]. </p>
