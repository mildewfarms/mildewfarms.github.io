<h2>Commerical SystemC Products</h2>
Although a reference implementation of SystemC is freely available from OSCI, most of the research on improving the language is coming out of industry. Commercial simulators include Cadence's NC-SystemC/Incisive [3] and CoWare's ConvergenSC System Designer [4]. NC-SystemC, for example, supports many features not available in the OSCI simulator, including mixed-language capabilities via the Incisive platform, advanced debugging facilities, a transaction/wave-form viewer and advanced data-probing methodologies, simulation of models that are 100 times faster than RTL, transaction recording, and a System Verification Library that is now a part of OSCI.
