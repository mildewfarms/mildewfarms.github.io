<p>In the previous installment of "Positive Integration," I introduced the Open-RJ library and presented a mapping to the Ch scriptable C interpreter. Open-RJ is an open-source library that implements readers of the Record-Jar structured text file format, in which the contents of a database file are interpreted as a sequence of records&#151;each of which consists of zero or more fields, each of which is a name-value pair. This month, I look at mapping Open-RJ to Python. Yes, I previously said I'd be talking about Ch and C++.NET. Alas, I had to defer C++.NET mapping for now. The developments described here are encapsulated in Open-RJ 1.1.</p>
<h3>Python</h3>

<p>Python is one of the preeminent scripting languages of our time [2]. The Python mapping of Open-RJ generally follows the Ruby mapping (see "Positive Integration," <i>CUJ</i>, July 2004), in having an object model comprised of <b>Database</b>, <b>Record</b>, and <b>Field</b> classes. However, mapping C libraries to Python is a somewhat more involved and verbose task in Python than it is in Ruby, although it's still eminently manageable.</p>
<h3>Entry Point and  Module Definition</h3>

<p>Before diving into the object model and the complexities of class definitions, it's worth examining how Python extension modules are defined. To use a module from within Python, you must import it:</p>

<pre>
import openrj

</pre>

<p>which imports all of the names from the <b>openrj</b> module into the program, or:</p>

<pre>
from openrj import open

</pre>

<p>which imports the <b>open()</b> function from the <b>openrj</b> module into the program. Whichever mechanism you elect to use for importing symbols, the Python interpreter translates the import into a search for the module and access of its symbols. There are two ways in which this can be done for Python extensions. One way is to write extensions as dynamic libraries (UNIX shared objects or Windows DLLs). That's the approach I take in this article. The other way is to compile your libraries into the Python runtime.</p>

<p>When you bundle extension code into a dynamic library, how does Python know which library to load and what entry point to use? In fact it's straightforward. If the module to import is <b>openrj</b>, Python looks for a library called "openrj.so" (on UNIX) or "openrj.dll" (on Windows). It then attempts to access the entry point <b>initopenrj()</b>, which it assumes is declared to take no arguments, and have <b>void</b> return type. For Windows, you'll want to have a .DEF file, which includes <b>initopenrj</b> in its <b>EXPORTS</b> section.</p>

<p>For the Open-RJ/Python mapping, the entry point function is defined as in <a href="0501wilsonl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>. The first thing to do is create the module object, via the <b>Py_InitModule()</b> function, passing in the name of the module and the <b>openrj_methods</b> variable. If the call to <b>Py_InitModule()</b> succeeds, then an exception object, called "openrj.error," is created and added to the module's dictionary under the name "error." (<b>DatabaseExceptionObject</b> is declared as a nonlocal static object so that functions within the Open-RJ/Python mapping can access it directly.) The two constants, <b>ORDER_FIELDS</b> and <b>ELIDE_BLANK_ RECORDS</b>, are also created (as Python integers) and added to the module's dictionary. If any of these operations have failed, then you register a fatal error; otherwise, the function returns and the module is ready for action.</p>

<p><b>openrj_methods</b> is a method table containing only a single module function, <b>openrj_open()</b>. Thus, <b>openrj_open()</b> is the effective entry point of the library. The blank record terminates the table; this is a common theme in Python's extensions architecture.</p>

<pre>
static PyMethodDef openrj_methods[] =
{
    { "open", openrj_open, METH_VARARGS
      , "Opens an Open-RJ database file, 
       and returns a corresponding 
       Database instance." }
  , { NULL, NULL, 0, NULL }
};

</pre>

<p>The four parts of the <b>PyMethodDef</b> structure are the method name, the C function pointer, flags, and a documentation string. The name is "open," which means that Python client code refers to it as <b>open() </b>(or <b>openrj.open()</b>). The flags are <b>METH_ VARARGS</b>, which indicates that the C function consists of two <b>PyObject</b> pointers, corresponding to the self (the instance for class methods, usually <b>NULL</b> for modules), and to the arguments in the form of a tuple; tuples in Python are immutable sequences of objects.</p>
<h3>Opening the Database</h3>

<p>That takes care of the module/entry-point loading infrastructure, and exposing the module functions&#151;actually just one function for Open-RJ&#151;to Python. Now I look at <b>openrj_open()</b>; see <a href="0501wilsonl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>. This is standard fare for followers of the Open-RJ or recls libraries and their mappings. The Python-related aspects are the use of <b>PyArg_ParseTuple()</b> to parse the database path and the flags arguments passed to the <b>openrj.open()</b> method, and the call to <b>PyErr_SetString()</b> used to set an error indicator to the Python runtime in the event that the call to <b>ORJ_ReadDatabaseA()</b> has failed. Client Python code might look something like this:</p>

<pre>
db = openrj.open("../../samples/pets/pets.orj",
  openrj.ELIDE_BLANK_RECORDS)

</pre>

<p>In the event that the database is opened successfully, the <b>openrj_Database_alloc()</b> function (see <a href="0501wilsonl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>) is called to create the <b>Database</b> instance. The function first creates a <b>Database</b> object by calling <b>PyObject_New()</b> and passing the type of the created instance, <b>openrj_Database</b>, and the type object, <b>openrj_Database_Type</b>. If that succeeds, then it allocates the array of records.</p>

<p>The <b>Database</b> type, <b>openrj_Database</b>, is defined as shown in <a href="0501wilsonl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>. In common with all Python types, it begins with <b>PyObject_HEAD</b>, which gives it a compatible binary layout with the generic <b>PyObject</b> type. If you were implementing the extension in C++, you might instead derive your types from <b>PyObject</b>. The remaining fields in the structure are used to represent the members of the <b>Database</b> type. The database member provides access to the underlying database structure, and the path member keeps a record of the name of the record JAR file. <b>dbh</b> is a pointer to an <b>ORJDatabase_holder</b> structure (<a href="0501wilsonl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>) that wraps a pointer to the underlying database structure.</p>

<p>The reason this is used is because Python reference counts its objects, which means that the <b>Database</b> instance could be destroyed while some of its <b>Record</b> or <b>Field</b> instances might still be alive. By sharing the underlying structure in this way, rather than always having the <b>Database</b> instance destroy it (via <b>ORJ_FreeDatabaseA()</b>), there are no problems with vanishing pointers. The remaining member, <b>records</b>, is used to hold an array of Python instances (in the form of the <b>openrj_Record</b> type) so that the Python sequence protocol&#151;whereby access is provided by <b>index</b>&#151;can be supported. </p>

<p>I chose to implement the path member as a C string (created by <b>strdup()</b> and released by <b>free()</b>) rather than as a Python string because I find it more straightforward to have a C string to play with in the <b>openrj_Database_print()</b> method. This could be wasteful if several accesses were made to the database's <b>path()</b> attribute. Still, I opted for convenience. You may choose to do it differently.</p>

<p>To understand the use of the <b>Database</b> type, look at Python's object definition mechanism. <a href="0501wilsonl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a> shows how the <b>Database</b> type is comprised. As well as the <b>openrj_Database</b> type you've already met, it shows declarations for the 12 functions. Unlike Ruby, in which all custom functions are defined and built into types in the same way, Python splits up a type's functions into those that correspond to the standard operations of objects, to those that correspond to one or more protocols, and to type-specific/custom methods. For the database type, we can see this delineation in the composition of the three structures/tables in <a href="0501wilsonl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>. Standard object operations go into the <b>PyTypeObject</b> structure <b>openrj_Database_Type</b>, including <b>openrj_Database_dealloc()</b> (the "destructor"), <b>openrj_Database_print()</b> (used to provide a human-readable representation of the <b>Database</b> instance), and <b>openrj_Database_getattr()</b>.</p>

<p>Since the <b>Database</b> type supports the Python Sequence Protocol, I also provide the sequence methods <b>openrj_Database_length()</b> ("<b>len(db)</b>"), <b>openrj_Database_item()</b> ("<b>db[0]</b>" or "<b>x</b> in <b>db</b>"), and <b>openrj_Database_slice()</b> ("<b>db[1:2]</b>"). As you can see from <a href="0501wilsonl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>, these are referenced in the definition of the <b>openrj_Database_as_sequence</b> table, which is itself then referenced in the initializer of <b>openrj_Database_Type</b>. In this way, you declare the <b>Database</b> type to support the sequence protocol, and simultaneously specify which of the sequence protocol operations it supports. How this looks to client code is that you can ask the length of the sequence:</p>

<pre>
l = len(db)

</pre>

<p>or step through all its records:</p>

<pre>
for r in db:
  print r

</pre>

<p>or take a slice of some of the records:</p>

<pre>
someRecords = db[1:len(db)]

</pre>

<p>The final set of functions are the custom functions, which correspond to the <b>Database</b> class's <b>path()</b>, <b>records()</b>, <b>numRecords()</b>, <b>numFields()</b>, and <b>numLines()</b> methods. You may be wondering how the Python runtime knows how to look up these custom functions. If you are familiar with implementing classes in Python, you know that the special Python function <b>__getattr__()</b> method is called when an attribute has not been found in the normal lookup scheme. The <b>openrj_Database_getattr()</b> function corresponds to that function for the <b>Database</b> type. It has a pretty standard implementation:</p>

<pre>
static PyObject *
  openrj_Database_getattr(openrj_Database *self
            , char const      *name)
{
  return Py_FindMethod( openrj_Database_methods
             , (PyObject*)self, (char*)name);
}

</pre>

<p>In other words, you call the Python extension API function <b>Py_FindMethod()</b>, which looks up a method from the given method table. This is where the <b>openrj_Database_methods</b> table comes into play.</p>
<h3>Record and Field Classes</h3>

<p>The <b>Record</b> type structure contains a database holder, a pointer to the Open-RJ API record to which it corresponds, and an array of field instances. It has the same set of standard and sequence methods as the <b>Database</b> type, and does not provide any custom methods.</p>

<pre>
typedef struct
{
  /* Header */
  PyObject_HEAD
  /* Record specific information */
  ORJDatabase_holder  *dbh;
  ORJRecord const     *record;
  openrj_Field        **fields;
} openrj_Record;

</pre>

<p>The <b>Field</b> type structure contains a pointer to the Open-RJ API field to which it corresponds, and a database holder pointer. The <b>Field</b> class does not support the sequence protocol, so all it defines are the same standard functions as the <b>Database</b> and <b>Record</b> types (for example, <b>_alloc()</b>, <b>_dealloc()</b>, <b>_print()</b>, <b>_getattr()</b>, and <b>_compare()</b>). It also defines the two custom methods, <b>name()</b> and <b>value()</b>, as implemented by the <b>openrj_Field_name()</b> and <b>openrj_Field_value()</b> functions:</p>

<pre>
static PyObject 
  *openrj_Field_name(openrj_Field *self)
{
  return Py_BuildValue("s#", 
   self-&gt;field-&gt;name.ptr
                   , self-&gt;field-&gt;name.len);
}
static PyObject 
  *openrj_Field_value(openrj_Field *self)
{
  return Py_BuildValue("s#", 
    self-&gt;field-&gt;value.ptr
                  , self-&gt;field-&gt;value.len);
}

</pre>
<h3>Reference Counting</h3>

<p>Again, Python objects are reference counted. As is the case with any reference-counting mechanism, when it works it's great&#151;but to make it work is a nontrivial effort. As you'd expect, each time you construct a Python object via <b>PyObject_New()</b>, the returned object has an initial reference count of 1. Further, many functions will increase the reference count on a Python object that is passed to them. However, this is not universal, so you need to check the documentation of the functions you use; <b>PyList_SetItem()</b> and <b>PyTuple_SetItem()</b> do not increase the reference count, and are said to "steal" a reference. Furthermore, when you return pointers to Python objects that you are holding, rather than ones you've just created (as with <b>openrj_Field_value()</b>, for example), you need to ensure that you increase the reference count before you return them; otherwise, you'll find out the hard way sometime later that the object you thought you owned no longer exists. Manual reference counting is effected by the Python functions (well, macros, actually) <b>Py_INCREF()</b> and <b>Py_DECREF()</b>, as in the implementation of <b>openrj_Record_item()</b> (called by the subscript and in operations):</p>

<pre>
static PyObject *openrj_Record_item(openrj_Record *self, int index)
{
  if( index &lt; 0 ||
      index &gt;= (int)self-&gt;record-&gt;numFields)
  {
    PyErr_SetString(PyExc_IndexError, "index out-of-bounds");
    return NULL;
  }
  else
  {
    openrj_Field *field = self-&gt;fields[index];
    Py_INCREF(field);
    return (PyObject*)field;
  }
}

</pre>

<p>Also worth noting are the standard <b>Py_XINCREF()</b> and <b>Py_XDECREF()</b>, which do the same thing as their X-less brethren, but are benignly inert when passed <b>NULL</b> pointers. I've not used them in the implementation, as the only two places where they'd be appropriate are better served by a more (maintainer-resistant) explicit i<b>f()</b> statement, but they're a well-used facility in general in Python extensions.</p>
<h3>A Better Approach to the Object Model</h3>

<p>The current implementation of the Open-RJ/Python mapping is such that each instance of the <b>Database</b>, <b>Record</b>, and <b>Field</b> types holds onto the underlying structures in the Open-RJ library. This is in common with other mappings of the Open-RJ library that I've done so far. However, Python requires that sequence objects be subscriptable by integer, as opposed to, say, Ruby's unindexed <b>each{}</b> construct, or STL's Forward Iterator concept. Hence, the <b>Database</b> and <b>Record</b> types in the Open-RJ/Python mapping also maintain arrays of <b>Record</b> and <b>Field</b> types. What this means is that the <b>Database</b> holds onto the underlying database structure for its <b>numFields</b>, <b>numRecords</b>, and similar attributes, but it doesn't use it for the actual records, and there's an analogous situation with <b>Record</b> instances and their fields.</p>

<p>Naturally, this is not exactly optimal (it's not even good design!), but I left it in the current implementation because I believe that the reference-counted database-holder mechanism and the arrays of Python types are worthy of discussion and study, even though in this case it's not proven to be suitable. This is, after all, a learning exercise (for you and for me). So, although it appears in Version 1.1 in this form, expect it to be trimmed down markedly in a subsequent release. </p>
<h3>Further Work</h3>

<p>Naturally, with two libraries and lots of interesting languages to choose from, there's a lot of scope for further coverage of language mappings. Furthermore, with several extant language mappings for each, there are many things to keep up to date&#151;each time I update one of the libraries, there are several languages mappings to percolate out the advances. Although Open-RJ is simple in scope and implementation, the recls library has a long way to go. I still want to incorporate recursive searching of the Win32 registry and Visual SourceSafe (and maybe other source-control systems), and I also need to provide FTP searching on UNIX. </p>

<p>Over the next two or three installments, I hope to cover the Open-RJ/C++.NET mapping, the recls/Ch and recls/Python mappings, and the enhancement of recls to other types of searching. Furthermore, Walter Bright (author of the D language) pointed out that in the recent update to recls, to include FTP searching, the code and object size doubled. Hence, there's a need for some serious refactoring.</p>

<p>Once I've tidied things up, and updated the mappings with the various wisdoms gained over recent times, I hope to get into some new languages. Dylon, Heron, Objective-C, Perl, Sather, and Tk all seem worth some investigation, but please feel free to write in if you've other interesting languages that you'd like to see discussed. And I'm still looking for some Perl extension gurus to contact me. </p>

<p>If you're wondering about the other side of language integration&#151;embedding&#151;I can tell you I certainly plan to cover it, but it'll likely not be until later in the year.</p>
