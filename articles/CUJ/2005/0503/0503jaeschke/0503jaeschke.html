<hr>

<p>In a previous installment, I wrote, "In this release of C++/CLI, objects of <b>ref</b> class type can reside only on the managed heap or on the stack." However, thus far, all examples have been heap-allocated only. And while this is the only approach available to programmers using "Managed Extensions to C++," C#, J#, and VB .NET, native C++ programmers are used to having stack-based instances of objects as well. </p>

<p>Consider the previous definition of the <b>ref</b> class <b>Point</b> and the following automatic variable definitions:</p>

<pre>
Point p1, p2(3,4);

</pre>

<p>Based on our knowledge of native C++, <b>p1</b> and <b>p2</b> appear to be stack-based instances of the <b>ref</b> class <b>Point</b>, and for all intents and purposes, they are. <b>p1</b> is initialized using the default constructor while <b>p2</b> uses the constructor taking an x- and y-coordinate pair. As implemented, <b>Point</b> is self-contained (that is, it doesn't contain any pointers or handles); however, being an instance of a <b>ref</b> class, it is still under the control of the CLI runtime. So garbage collection occurs as necessary. (Because of this, you cannot define static or global-scope instances of a <b>ref</b> class.)</p>

<p>You cannot apply <b>sizeof</b> to an expression designating an instance of a <b>ref</b> class. (Remember, <b>sizeof</b> is computed at compile time, yet the size of a <b>Point</b> object isn't known until runtime.) On the other hand, you can apply <b>sizeof</b> to a handle since its size is known at compile time.</p>

<p>You cannot define stack-based instances of a CLI array.</p>
<h3>Tracking References</h3>

<p>Native C++ allows an alias to an object via the <b>&amp;</b> punctuator. For example, for any native class <b>N</b>, you can write:</p>

<pre>
N n1;
N&amp; n2 = n1; 

</pre>

<p>A reference must be initialized when it is defined, and for its whole life, it is locked into referring to the same object; that is, its value cannot change. Just as you can find uses for references to native-typed objects, so too can you find uses for references to instances of <b>ref</b> classes. However, you cannot use the same syntax.</p>

<p>Instances of <b>ref</b> classes can move during program execution, so they require tracking. As such, native pointers and references are not sufficient for dealing with them. (Specifically, you can't apply the address-of operator <b>&amp;</b> to an instance of a <b>ref</b> class.) So C++/CLI provides handles and tracking references as their respective equivalents. For example, you can define a tracking reference <b>p3</b> that tracks the object <b>p2</b> this way:</p>

<pre>
Point% p3 = p2;

</pre>

<p>A tracking reference must have automatic storage duration. </p>

<p>Even though native objects don't move, in the case of <b>n2</b>, <b>%</b> can be used instead of <b>&amp;.</b></p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre>
Point^ hp = gcnew Point(2,5);
Point% p4 = *hp;
Point% p5 = *gcnew Point(2,5);

</pre>

<p>Here, <b>hp</b> is a handle to a <b>Point</b>, and <b>p4</b> is an alias for that <b>Point</b>. Even though a handle is not a pointer, we can dereference a handle with the unary <b>*</b> operator. (During the standardization of C++/CLI, there was a discussion of whether a unary <b>^</b> operator should be introduced and used here instead. One was not, and the ability to dereference a handle or pointer using <b>*</b> can be valuable when writing templates.) Of course, <b>p4</b> remains an alias to that same <b>Point</b> even if <b>hp</b> takes on a new value. While there is a handle or tracking reference to an object, it cannot be garbage collected.</p>

<p>In the case of <b>p5</b>, you simply dereference the handle returned by <b>gcnew</b>.</p>

<p>Although handles to almost every <b>ref</b> class type can be dereferenced, handles to two types cannot; those types are <b>System::String</b> and <b>array&lt;T&gt;</b>.</p>
<h3>The "Give Me a Handle" Operator</h3>

<p>Consider the case in which we want to write the value of <b>p1</b> to the standard output. The obvious thing to write is:</p>

<pre>
Console::WriteLine("p1 is {0}", p1);

</pre>

<p>However, that won't compile, as <b>WriteLine</b> doesn't have an overload that takes a <b>Point</b> per se. You learned in an earlier column that expressions of any value type (such as <b>int</b>, <b>long</b>, or <b>double</b>) can automatically be converted to <b>Object^</b> by a process called "boxing." And although <b>p1</b> looks like an instance of a value type, it isn't; it's an instance of a <b>ref</b> class. (I'll look at value type classes in a future installment.) What you need instead is this:</p>

<pre>
Console::WriteLine("p1 is {0}", %p1);

</pre>

<p>By using the unary <b>%</b> operator, you create a handle to the object <b>p1</b>. Since every <b>ref</b> class is (ultimately) derived from <b>System::Object</b>, and <b>WriteLine</b> has an overload that takes <b>Object^</b> as the type of its second argument, the <b>Point^</b> resulting from <b>%p1</b> is converted to <b>Object^</b>, and the value of <b>p1</b> is displayed. No boxing occurs. This operator cannot be applied to an instance of a native class.</p>
<h3>GC-Lvalues</h3>

<p>The C++ Standard defines and uses the term <b>lvalue</b>. The C++/CLI Standard adds the term <b>gc-lvalue</b>, which is "an expression that refers to an Object on the CLI heap, or to a value member contained within such an Object." A handle points to a <b>gc-lvalue</b>, applying the unary <b>*</b> operator to a handle yields a <b>gc-lvalue</b>, a tracking reference is a <b>gc-lvalue</b>, and <b>%h</b>, where <b>h</b> is a handle, yields a <b>gc-lvalue</b>. (As there is a standard conversion from <b>lvalue</b> to <b>gc-lvalue</b>, a tracking reference can bind to any <b>gc-lvalue</b> or <b>lvalue</b>.)</p>
<h3>Copy Constructor</h3>

<p>In the following example, <b>p6</b> is constructed with the given coordinates, while <b>p7</b> is initialized to be a copy of <b>p6</b>. This requires that <b>Point</b> have a copy constructor; however, the compiler does not give a <b>ref</b> class one of these by default. If one is needed, you must supply it.</p>

<pre>
Point p6(3,4), p7 = p6;

</pre>

<p>Here, then, is the copy constructor:</p>

<pre>
Point(Point% p)
{
   X = p.X;
   Y = p.Y;
}

</pre>

<p>A copy constructor for a native class <b>N</b> is typically declared as follows:</p>

<pre>
N(const N&amp; n);

</pre>

<p>However, for a <b>ref</b> class, <b>%</b> replaces <b>&amp;</b>, and <b>const</b> doesn't fit well into the CLI world.</p>
<h3>Assignment Operator</h3>

<p>The expression statement:</p>

<pre>
p7 = p6;

</pre>

<p>requires an assignment operator, but again, none is supplied automatically. Here is such an operator:</p>

<pre>
Point% operator=(Point% p)
{
  X = p.X;
  Y = p.Y;
  return *this;
}

</pre>

<p>The reason there is no default copy constructor or assignment operator has to do with the fact that all <b>ref</b> classes (except <b>System::Object</b>) have a base class, namely, <b>System::Object</b>, and that class does not have a copy constructor or assignment operator. Basically, default versions of each would invoke their base-class counterparts, but none are defined!</p>
<h3>Equality Operator</h3>

<p>By defining a copy constructor and an assignment operator for <b>Point</b>, you can deal with instances of that type as values; you can initialize them, pass them to functions, and return them from functions. However, there is one more operation you might like to have, comparison, and that operator is quite straightforward:</p>

<pre>
static bool operator==(Point% p1, Point% p2)
{
   if (p1.GetType() == p2.GetType())
   {
      return (p1.X == p2.X) &amp;&amp; (p1.Y == p2.Y);
   }
   return false;
}

</pre>

<p>Since a tracking reference cannot take on the value <b>nullptr</b>, you don't have to check for that. And because <b>p1</b> and <b>p2</b> are aliases for two <b>Point</b>s, you use the dot operator to call <b>GetType</b> and the <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> property getters.</p>
<h3>Can We Please Everyone?</h3>

<p>In one previous installment, I stated, "For a <b>ref</b> class, equality is implemented via a function called <b>Equals</b> rather than by overloading <b>operator==</b>." In another, I presented an overload for <b>operator==</b> that took handles, and pointed out the problems of using it. Let's revisit these topics.</p>

<p>When designing and implementing a <b>ref</b> class in C++/CLI, the fundamental question to ask is, "Will the users of this type be programming in C++/CLI or some other language (such as C#, J#, or VB.NET), or both?" </p>

<p>C++ programmers are used to manipulating class instances as values, so they'll expect a class to have a copy constructor and an assignment operator. And for some classes, they'll expect equality and inequality operators as well. On the other hand, C#, J#, and VB.NET programmers can only manipulate class instances through handles, so they'll be expecting cloning and <b>Equals</b> functions. (I'll discuss object cloning in a separate column.) They won't know or care much about copy constructors, or assignment and equality operators.</p>

<p>A <b>ref</b> class having an <b>Equals</b> function can be called from any language, even though a C++ programmer would likely prefer <b>operator==</b>. A <b>ref</b> class that does not have such a function will almost certainly result in unexpected behavior if <b>Equals</b> is called on an instance of that class.</p>

<p>A <b>ref</b> class having an <b>operator==</b> function that takes two tracking references will suffice for C++/CLI programmers. While an <b>operator==</b> function that takes two handles could also be supplied, it is less likely to be needed or used by either group of programmers.</p>

<p>Simply stated, you could implement a <b>ref</b> class for one or the other of these two audiences. Now while the CLI applications world could, perhaps, be neatly divided into C++/CLI and "other language" camps, things aren't always that simple. For example, although <b>System::String</b> is a <b>ref</b> class, it provides <b>operator==</b> and <b>operator!=</b> functions that take two handles, yet these compare the values of the strings, not their handles. Basically, value semantics are being used in a <b>ref</b> class, which, in general, is counterintuitive, but for a string class, could be justifiable.</p>

<p>It is clear that "one size does not fit all." To provide the most appropriate interface to users of a <b>ref</b> class, you need to think about their expectations, and that depends on the language they are using. In any event, C++/CLI programmers using <b>ref</b> classes created in other languages will have to live without copy constructors and assignment operators in those classes.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Issues</h3>

<p>Here are a number of short, but useful, topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You know that <b>const</b> is not a good fit in the CLI world, and C++/CLI does not permit <b>const-</b> (or <b>volatile-</b>) qualified member functions in <b>ref</b> classes. You also know that the keyword <b>this</b> can be used in any instance constructor and member function of such a class. But what exactly is the type of <b>this</b> in these cases? For a native type <b>N</b>, it's <b>N*</b> <b>const</b>. However, for a <b>ref</b> class <b>R</b>, it's simply <b>R^</b>. And although that handle is not <b>const</b>-qualified, its value cannot be changed.
  <p>The implementation of <b>Point::ToString</b> uses:


<pre>
   return String::Concat("(", X, ",", Y, ")");

</pre>


 <p>An alternative to this is:


<pre>
   return String::Format("({0},{1})", X, Y);

</pre>

<p>	  As its name suggests, the <b>Format</b> function lets you format the text (using leading spaces or zeros, thousands separators, and so on), not simply concatenate strings.</li>
  <li>You can see if the compiler supports C++/CLI's extensions by testing if the predefined macro <b>__cplusplus_cli</b> is defined. If it is, it should have the value 200406L.</li>
  <li>The CLI library contains a type called <b>System::Decimal</b>, which can represent values with at least 28 significant digits. This type is ideal for financial calculations that require a large number of significant digits and no round off. Unlike the floating-point types, <b>Decimal</b> fractional numbers can be represented exactly. When represented in a floating-point type, such numbers are often infinite fractions, making their representations more prone to rounding errors. 
  <p>	  <b>Decimal</b> numbers have a property called "scale," which represents the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. For example, 2.340 has a scale of 3, where trailing zeros are significant. When two decimals are added or subtracted, the scale of the result is the larger of the two scales. For example, 1.0 + 2.000 is 3.000, while 5.0-2.00 is 3.00. When two decimals are multiplied, the scale of the result is the sum of the two scales. For example, 1.0*2.000 is 2.0000. When two decimals are divided, the scale of the result is the scale of the first less the scale of the second. For example, 4.00000/2.000 is 2.00. However, a scale cannot be less than that needed to preserve the correct result. For example, 3.000/2.000, 3.00/2.000, 3.0/2.000, and 3/2 are all 1.5.
  <p>	  Here's an example of <b>Decimal</b>'s use:

<pre>
   Decimal x = Decimal::Parse("23.00");
   Decimal y = Decimal::Parse("2.000");
   Decimal result = x * y + Decimal::Parse("2.5");
   Console::WriteLine(result);

</pre>

  <p>	  The output produced is 48.50000. Note that C++/CLI does not have a literal of type <b>Decimal</b>, hence the use of the <b>Parse</b> function.</li>
  <li>Consider the case in which a class written in a language other than C++/CLI provides a public member whose name is a C++/CLI keyword. You can access that member via an intrinsic function having the form <b>__identifier(x)</b>, where <b>x</b> is an identifier, a keyword, or a string literal. (However, the string literal form is reserved for implementations.) For example, to call a static function named <b>delete</b> in a class <b>X</b>, and taking no parameters, you'd use <b>X::__identifier(delete)()</b>.</li>
  <li>A literal field is a named compile-time constant defined in a class; as such, it must contain an initializer having a constant value. Although a literal field is used like a static data member, it cannot be declared static. The compiler replaces each use of a literal field with that field's value. A literal field can have any scalar type; however, the only constant values that can be used to initialize a handle are string literals and <b>nullptr</b>. 

<pre>
      literal double PI = 3.1415926;
      literal int MinValue = -10, MaxValue = 10;
      literal int Range = MaxValue - MinValue + 1;
      enum Direction {North, South, East, West};
      literal Direction Home = North;
      literal System::String^ Title = "Annual Report";
  };

</pre></li></ul>
<h3>Reader Exercises</h3>

<p>Here are some things you might want to do:</p>



<ol>
  <li>Using <b>ildasm</b>, see if, in the Microsoft implementation, a stack-based <b>Point</b> really is allocated on the stack. Compare the code generated with that for a corresponding handle initialized using <b>gcnew</b>.</li>
  <li>Using <b>ildasm</b>, look at the metadata signature for <b>Point</b>'s copy constructor, <b>operator==</b>, and <b>operator=</b>. You'll see some strange-looking stuff involving <b>modreq</b> and the type <b>IsImplicitlyDereferenced</b>. To understand this a bit more, refer to the draft C++/CLI Standard [1] clause "CLI Libraries." Also, write a <b>ref</b> class <b>R</b> that has two overloads for a function <b>F</b>, defined as <b>void F(F^){}</b> and <b>void F(F%){}</b>. Since these are legitimate overloads, the compiler needs some way to distinguish between them behind the scenes. And that's where optional and required modifiers (<b>modopts</b> and <b>modreqs</b>, respectively) come in.</li>
  <li>Given the declarations <b>Point^ hp;</b> and <b>Point p;</b>, make sure you understand the meaning of the following expression statements:

<pre>
   hp = %p;
   p = *hp;
   hp-&gt;X = 2;
   (*hp).X = 2;
   p.X = 2;
   (%p)-&gt;X = 2;

</pre>

  <li>How can you pass a handle to a function and have that function change the location to which that handle points? (Hint: Think pointer to handle.)</li>
  <li>Look at <b>String::Format</b>'s documentation.</li>
  <li>Read the documentation for <b>System::Decimal</b>. In particular, look at the functions with names having the prefix <b>op_</b>. These map to operator functions. For example, <b>op_Addition</b> is called when two <b>Decimal</b> expressions are added using the <b>+</b> symbol.</li>
  <li>Both <b>Decimal(23.00)</b> and <b>Decimal::Parse("23.00")</b> result in <b>Decimal</b> objects; however, why are the resulting values different? What's the difference between <b>Decimal(23.00)</b> and <b>Decimal(23)</b>?</li>
</ol>
