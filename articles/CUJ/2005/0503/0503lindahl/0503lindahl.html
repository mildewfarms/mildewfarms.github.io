<p>One of the hardest problems facing embedded developers today is the limited visibility into the workings of their software. This is especially apparent when working on systems with strict real-time constraints because standard debugging techniques generally rely on altering the execution behavior of the software being debugged. For instance, with traditional debuggers, you typically halt the microprocessor to inspect the code paths taken and the state of the system. Alternatively, you may instrument your code to log values to help identify bugs in the system. Both of these debugging techniques cause problems when successful execution of your program relies on specific timing characteristics of your system. Common classes of bugs that these traditional techniques fall short in debugging include race conditions and random glitches. We've all encountered bugs that disappeared when you attached a debugger or added instrumentation because of the minor changes in system timing that occur. Additionally, systems with strict real-time requirements may have critical sections of code that cannot safely be instrumented or debugged without causing serious errors in the system. However, a technology that has been available to hardware engineers for years is helping software developers solve these problems more quickly and reliably without altering the runtime characteristics of embedded systems.</p>

<p>This debugging technology, called "hardware trace," offers essentially a history of the instructions that a microprocessor executes, sometimes including information about what data values are read and written, when context switches occur, and other information about the state of a microprocessor as it runs. A growing number of embedded processors are implementing hardware trace, which means that the benefits of trace data are becoming available to more and more embedded developers. However, the tools to analyze trace data have traditionally been limited for ordinary software engineers because they focus on the raw trace data&#151;the instructions that the processor executed&#151;rather than translating this information into the higher level concepts that software developers use to construct software. This has led to hardware trace being used primarily by hardware and very low-level firmware engineers who are used to dealing with assembly code on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Fortunately for embedded software developers, this situation is changing as the tools that analyze trace data improve and give software engineers improved visibility into the workings of their systems. One example of this is the TimeMachine suite of tools available from Green Hills Software (the company I work for), which lets users browse through the information collected from a trace port at a high level. One of the principal components of these tools is the TimeMachine debugger, which lets software engineers debug their traced program as it runs on the system. This debugger even lets you stop and run backwards to help easily track down where a program went astray or where variables were assigned invalid values. The debugger infers register and memory values from the trace data to give a nearly complete view of the system as it was when the code was actually running. This enables difficult bugs to be captured with hardware trace and analyzed later without interfering with the real-time performance characteristics of the system.</p>

<p>In this article, I explore the information that trace provides as well as some of the underlying techniques that make the TimeMachine debugger possible. These methods often involve simulating the instructions captured with trace, but there are also more advanced techniques that will be discussed. Trace is available on many CPU architectures; however, this article focuses on the ARM instruction set and the techniques that are specific to these instructions.</p>
<h3>Introduction to  Hardware Trace</h3>

<p>Microprocessors that implement hardware trace generally offer a dedicated port that outputs information about the instructions that are executing on every cycle. This information is highly compressed, but it still streams off of the microprocessor at very high speeds. For example, the trace port on an ARM microprocessor outputs between 8 and 20 bits of data per clock cycle. Thus an ARM CPU running at 200 MHz outputs trace data at up to 500 MB/s.</p>

<p>Trace data from a processor is collected by specialized hardware called a "Trace Port Analyzer" (TPA). These devices are available from several vendors, including Agilent and Green Hills Software. The compressed trace data is decompressed on a host system and is then analyzed to determine the internal state of the microprocessor as the program ran. However, the trace data from a CPU generally only includes information about the instructions that were executed by a microprocessor and potentially the memory addresses and values that were read and written. The challenge is then to infer additional information from this limited trace stream so that registers and other processor states can be reconstructed.</p>

<p>An ARM processor implements the ARM instruction set, which is a RISC, load-store architecture. The ARM CPU defines 15 general-purpose registers in addition to the PC. Some of these registers are reserved as the stack pointer, link register, and other special uses, but this is only by convention and is not enforced in the instruction set. In our example, we'll attempt to reconstruct the values of as many of these general-purpose registers as possible from a sample trace.</p>

<p>Let's examine the sample trace for a simple example program compiled for the ARM processor. The source code for this simple linear search program is in <a href="0503lindahll1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>. <a href="0503lindahll2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a> is the same source code with the ARM assembly code interleaved. I will work through this example in this article, showing how you can reconstruct the state of almost all of the registers from a program trace including execution and memory history. The example trace that I use consists of a trace run from the beginning of <b>main</b> through the first call of <b>search()</b> (see <a href="0503lindahll3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>).</p>
<h3>Register Reconstruction Techniques</h3>

<p>After collecting a trace stream from an ARM processor, which includes instructions and associated memory accesses, analysis techniques allow for additional information that is not in the trace stream to be inferred. This information usually includes register and memory values over time so that source-level variables can be known. The process of reconstructing register values starts at the beginning of the trace buffer with all values marked as unknown. Then, each instruction that was executed is examined and any additional information that can be determined is incorporated into the reconstructed register values. Some instructions will increase the number of register values known after they execute and others may actually decrease the number of known register values. Additionally, some instructions may even discover register values that were valid before that instruction was executed. <a href="0503lindahlf1.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 1</a> is a flowchart of this algorithm. Different instructions allow for different information to be inferred. I'll examine some of the implications from the different classes of instructions to illustrate how this information is generated.</p>
<h3>Loads and Stores</h3>

<p>The ARM instruction set contains several load and store instructions. The first instruction in <a href="0503lindahll3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a> (line 0) is an <b>STMDB</b> instruction, which stores the values from several registers to memory. In this case, the load instruction stores general-purpose registers <b>R4</b>, <b>R5</b>, <b>R8</b>, <b>R9</b>, and the link register to memory, shown in <a href="0503lindahll3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>. You can look at the values stored to memory and determine the value of each of these registers. For instance, since the first memory value stored is 0x0, you know that the register <b>R4</b> contains the value 0. Also, since you are storing these values into memory, you say that these values are "valid backward" because the values that you determined must have been the values prior to the execution of this instruction.</p>

<p>The same analysis can be done for load instructions, such as the <b>LDMIA</b> instruction, which loads multiple values from contiguous memory locations into multiple registers, found at line #6 of the example trace run. In this specific case, the <b>LDMIA</b> instruction loads from memory into registers <b>R2</b> and <b>R3</b>. The value from the trace buffer for these registers is 0x1 for both, so you know that after instruction #6, these registers have the value 0x1. Because you are loading into these registers, you cannot learn the value of <b>R2</b> and <b>R3</b> prior to this instruction. In general, since load instructions modify register values, no register values learned from data loads are valid backward.</p>

<p>The other register value that can be learned from load and store instructions is the base register of the memory access. The load and store multiple instructions in the ARM instruction set use a register to load from or store to. There are several different addressing modes for these instructions, which determine how the processor interprets the base register. The details of this process are complicated and specific details on the ARM instructions can be found in the documentation for the ARM core [1]. In this case, the base register is known to have the value 0x182264, as this is the value of the first memory access. Thus, after the first instruction, you know the value of the stack pointer because the stack pointer acts as the base register for this instruction. <a href="0503lindahlf2.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 2</a> shows the state of the registers after doing these analyses on the first instruction in <a href="0503lindahll3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to learning register values from load and store instructions, you also propagate memory values forward and backward so that known memory reads required by the debugger can be satisfied. For instance, you know the values at the addresses written by store instructions and read by load instructions. However, the instructions that cause memory values to be valid backward are reversed from register values. Since store instructions modify the memory location, the value at that memory location cannot be valid backward. Load instructions are just the opposite because they simply monitor a memory location without modifying it. Thus, memory values learned from a load instruction are valid backward.</p>

<p>There are also other load and store instructions in the ARM instruction set. However, I leave register and memory reconstruction for these instructions as exercises because the process is the same even though the details differ.</p>
<h3>Arithmetic Instructions</h3>

<p>Another class of instructions that can be analyzed to determine additional processor state includes arithmetic instructions. The first example of this in our example trace listing is the subtract at line 1:</p>

<pre>
SUB    SP, SP, 40

</pre>

<p>This instruction subtracts the decimal number 40 from the stack-pointer register and stores the result back to the <b>SP</b> register. Since you learned the value of the stack-pointer register on line 0, you know that its value prior to line 1 is 0x182264. Thus, after this instruction, you know that its value is 0x182264-40=0x182264- 0x28=0x18223c.</p>

<p>Another simple arithmetic instruction in <a href="0503lindahll3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a> is the <b>MOV</b> instruction, which moves one register into another. For instance, at line 2 you move <b>R0</b> into <b>R2</b>. However, you do not know the value of <b>R0</b> at this point. Thus, you must assign the value "Unknown" to register <b>R2</b>. In this example, you did not know <b>R2</b> prior to this instruction, but even if you had, after this instruction you cannot know the value of <b>R2</b>. This is an example of an instruction that causes you to know fewer register values after it executes than you did prior to its execution.</p>

<p>The <b>MOV</b> instruction at line 3 of <a href="0503lindahll3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a> moves the value 0 into register <b>R4</b>. After this instruction, you obviously know that <b>R4</b> contains 0. Finally, another instance of the <b>MOV</b> instruction is found at line 4, where the program moves the <b>SP</b> register into the <b>IP</b> register. Because you know the value of the <b>SP</b> register going into this instruction, you can set the <b>IP</b> register to this value after line 4.</p>

<p>The ARM instruction set contains many more arithmetic instructions, and the analysis techniques for these instructions is similar to those outlined here. These will also be left as exercises. The main caveat with these instructions is how to handle them if an operand register value is unknown. For instance, if you have something like:</p>

<pre>
ADD    R3, R4, R5      ; R3 = R4 + R5

</pre>

<p>and either <b>R4</b> or <b>R5</b> is unknown, then after this instruction, <b>R3</b> must be marked as unknown.</p>
<h3>Remaining Instructions</h3>

<p>There are other instructions that have not been covered here, including branches and comparison instructions. The register reconstruction algorithms must handle the side effects of these instructions, such as branches that modify the link register. The details are relatively straightforward, but must be handled correctly to maximize the number of registers known correctly.</p>

<p>Applying the entire register reconstruction algorithm to the example trace buffer gives the register values in <a href="0503lindahlf3.html" target="_BLANK">Figures 3</a> and <a href="0503lindahlf4.html" target="_BLANK">4</a> before and after the call to <b>search()</b>. See if you can figure out how to derive these register values from the trace data in <a href="0503lindahll3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>.</p>

<p>You can see that the algorithms presented here let you reconstruct the state of most registers prior to the call to <b>search()</b>. In fact, you know 12 of the 16 registers, and the four register values that are unknown are never encountered in the trace buffer. In general, these algorithms are able to reconstruct a large percentage of register and memory values, especially with large traces, which makes the TimeMachine debugger very useful for debugging software problems.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The register and memory values that are interpolated from trace data may seem like a tedious and academic task with no real-world applications. However, this knowledge allows the TimeMachine debugger to display information at the source-code level because the debugger contains a mapping of program variables to register and memory locations. It can display the values of both global and local variables as well as additional information about the state of the system as it was running. The low-level trace information is thus translated into the high-level concepts that an application-level software engineer uses to write embedded software. Therefore, an ordinary and familiar debugging interface can be used to debug race conditions and other timing-related failures without altering the runtime characteristics of the system.</p>

<p>Because of tools such as the TimeMachine debugger, hardware trace is a useful debugging tool for embedded software engineers. By increasing visibility into systems and providing debugging information without altering the runtime characteristics of the system being debugged, trace offers a unique and powerful method for debugging problems, both simple and difficult. Since debugging is such a large component of the cost of software development, tools such as these can make a huge difference in the quality and cost of embedded devices. And as trace ports and trace tools become more pervasive, it will have a larger and larger effect on embedded software development in the future.</p>
