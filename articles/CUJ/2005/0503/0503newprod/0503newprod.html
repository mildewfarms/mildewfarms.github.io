<h3>Toolbuilders Introduces "Code Improvement Environment"</h3>

<p>Sempre Developer Personal, Toolbuilders Labs' first commercial release of its "source-code improvement environment" for C, is a static analysis, code refactoring, and code comprehension suite similar to a traditional IDE. Its Visual Backtrace technology, designed to help you better comprehend call structures within a body of code, is an enhanced multipath tracing feature that builds a list detailing critical aspects of entities as they are traced. Changes to code are quickly recognized and adjustments are made to the displayed source trees and other code browsers. Reanalysis incorporates these changes quickly enough to make feasible the process of editing and auditing during code authoring.
