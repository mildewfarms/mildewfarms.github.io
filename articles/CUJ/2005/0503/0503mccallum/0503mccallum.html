<p>Be it a spoken or software language, vocabulary and syntax alone only go so far. Knowledge of idioms and other subtleties are what separate the native from the tourist.</p>

<p>One element of software language proficiency, then, is creating constructs that are more natural within the language realm. Developers frequently create functors to take advantage of C++'s STL algorithms; but what about the other side of the coin&#151;creating custom containers? Client code could use these classes to fetch and store data, and manipulate their contents with STL algorithms. </p>

<p>There are two ways to do this: Add functionality to containers to make a class more STL friendly, or create new containers and iterators from scratch to make legacy code available to STL algorithms. In this article, I examine both methods: when they are useful, and the decisions you face when designing them. What makes this endeavor interesting is that it doesn't involve traditional inheritance. I've tested the code samples under Fedora Core 1 (GCC 3.3.2) and Fedora 3 (GCC 3.4.2). The first example should build (and run) under any STL-capable compiler, whereas the second example is based on a POSIX library call. The design advice for both examples is portable.  </p>
<h3>Value-Adding an  Existing Container </h3>

<p>Consider a <b>WidgetBucket</b> class, the purpose of which is to associate some information with a group of <b>Widget</b> objects:</p>

<pre>
  private:
  std::list&lt;Widget&gt; widgets_ ;
  std::string name_ ;
  // ... etc ...
}

</pre>

<p>Say the list of <b>Widgets</b> is meant for public consumption, though understandably, you don't want to directly expose it as a public member. Both <b>friend</b> access and <b>Visitor</b> [1] would be overkill. You could provide a <b>getList()</b> member function that returns a reference to the list, then follow that with a call to the ever-familiar <b>for_each</b>:</p>

<pre>
std::list&lt;Widget&gt;&amp; lw = bucket.getList() ;
std::for_each(
   lw.begin() ,
   lw.end() ,
   SomeFunctor()
) ;

</pre>

<p>One problem with this approach is that it exposes a <b>WidgetBucket</b> implementation detail, notably that it uses a <b>list&lt;&gt;</b>. A public <b>typedef</b> to obscure the <b>list&lt;&gt;</b> would make the class only slightly less awkward to use.</p>

<p>Given that <b>WidgetBucket</b> is a value-added list, it would be more natural to access the <b>Widgets</b> as though <b>WidgetBucket</b> itself were a container:</p>

<pre>
std::for_each( bucket.begin() ,
  bucket.end() , SomeFunctor() ) ;

</pre>

<p>It's straightforward to do this: Simply expose pass-throughs to the underlying <b>list&lt;&gt;</b>'s <b>const_iterator</b> <b>typedef</b> and its iterator access functions:</p>

<pre>
class WidgetBucket {
  public:
  typedef
  std::list&lt;Widget&gt;::const_iterator
  const_iterator ;
  ...
  const_iterator begin() const {
    return( widgets_.begin() ) ;
  }
  ...
}

</pre>

<p>(The <b>end()</b> function is similar to <b>begin()</b>.)</p>

<p>Now client code can access the <b>list&lt;&gt;</b> members, pass them through STL algorithms, and so on, and no one's the wiser that they are talking to an abstraction layer. Client code refers only to <b>WidgetBucket</b> functions and <b>typedef</b>s, thereby hiding the internals.</p>

<p>Congratulations. You've just created a container class, and you didn't have to inherit from <b>list&lt;&gt;</b> to do it. Some may call this cheating&#151;it's just containment, after all&#151;but it's how STL containers work.</p>
<h3>STL Container "Inheritance," Isn't</h3>

<p>Traditional polymorphism reflects an "is-a" relationship: An object of a derived class "is a(n)" object of its base class. You can exchange a pointer or reference to a base class object with one of a derived class, and client code is none the wiser.</p>

<p>STL container classes are described in terms of "concepts" [2] rather than interfaces. Like interfaces, concepts outline function signatures and <b>typedef</b>s expected by client code. Classes that implement these functions and <b>typedef</b>s are said to conform to that concept.</p>

<p>At the top of the hierarchy is the Container concept, which has members such as <b>value_type</b>, <b>begin()</b>, and <b>size()</b>. Refinements of Container include Associative Container, for key-based element access, and Sequence Container, which represents linear storage. As with abstract bases, a class may conform to several concepts to achieve greater functionality.</p>

<p>Performance aside, code that calls members of the Sequence Container concept can transparently swap a <b>vector&lt;&gt;</b> for a <b>list&lt;&gt;</b>. The same goes for <b>map&lt;&gt;</b>, <b>set&lt;&gt;</b>, and "Associative Container." If a code block only calls Container's <b>size()</b> member function, then it is oblivious as to whether it is operating on a <b>vector&lt;&gt;</b>, or <b>map&lt;&gt;</b>, or anything else.</p>

<p>Unlike the explicit, compiler-enforced "is-a" relationship between a base and derived class, containers share an informal "acts-like-a" relationship. There's no "Container" class from which to inherit, only an idea. (Hence the name "concept"&#151;the relationship is conceptual.)</p>

<p>This lack of compiler-policed conformity gives you tremendous leeway in how container-like classes are implemented. <b>WidgetBucket</b> only provides <b>begin()</b> and <b>end()</b>, though it could also provide pass-through operations to all <b>list&lt;&gt;</b> members. (Case in point: <b>WidgetBucket</b> conspicuously lacks a means to add <b>Widgets</b>.) How do you decide which members to implement?</p>

<p>The purists may say, "all of them," per the Principle of Least Surprise. It's not unreasonable to expect a class that provides <b>push_back()</b> and <b>begin()</b> to also provide <b>empty()</b>.</p>

<p>Then again, a surprise (compiler error) can yield enlightening conversation: "I omitted <b>push_back()</b> for a reason: That's a read-only container." Sometimes you can add functionality by removing it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are reasons to create special versions of concept members in lieu of strict pass-throughs. A selective <b>WidgetBucket</b> class's <b>push_back()</b> could, say, confirm the <b>Widget</b> meets some criteria before passing it to the underlying <b>list&lt;&gt;</b>.</p>

<p>Your class must also make sense to you at a code level. For example, what purpose would <b>clear()</b> serve in pseudocollection that is prepopulated at construction, such as a wrapper around a database library's result set?</p>

<p>Clearly, there are myriad ways to do this, all of which are "right."</p>

<p>All of these points share a common theme, that of client code expectations. For a private section of code, <b>WidgetBucket</b>'s <b>begin()</b> and <b>end()</b> may be enough. A general-release library would be more strict&#151;and less surprising&#151;in its conformity to the concept.</p>
<h3>Creating New Containers</h3>

<p>The "acts-like-a" relationship of STL containers needn't be expressed in terms of containment and pass-throughs. Nor must a "container" hold true objects&#151;it can be an abstraction layer for some idea. One reason to create a new container-like class is to put an STL-friendly face on other code, such as to use a legacy library's linked list with <b>for_each()</b> or a database API's result set with <b>accumulate()</b>.</p>

<p>The theory is the same&#151;expose container-related <b>typedef</b>s and member functions&#151;but the mechanics are different. With no underlying STL container to handle pass-throughs, you must implement the member functions and iterators yourself. I'll use the POSIX <b>glob()</b> call as an example of what questions arise when a container is more of an abstraction than a pass-through.</p>

<p><b>glob()</b> expands shell wildcards, such as * and ?, into lists of filenames, and stores the results in a <b>glob_t</b> data structure. Several such expansions may be stored in a single <b>glob_t</b>. <b>glob_t.gl_pathv </b>provides access to the list of matched files. </p>

<p>This has several features befitting a Container; the <b>STLGlob</b> class (<a href="0503mccalluml1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>) is one such implementation:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Respectively, the constructor and destructor create and destroy the <b>glob_t</b> by calling <b>glob()</b> and <b>globfree()</b>.</li>
  <li><b>push_back()</b> calls <b>glob()</b> to add elements to the <b>glob_t</b>. It throws an exception if the provided pattern fails to match anything.</li>
  <li><b>size()</b> returns the value of <b>glob_t.gl_pathc</b>, which is the number of files currently matched by the expansion. </li>
</ul>



<p><b>glob_t</b> structures must have a single owner, and as such, <b>STLGlob</b>'s copy constructor and assignment operator are private and unimplemented [3]. (A more robust implementation could use reference counting.)</p>

<p><b>STLGlob</b> closely matches the general <b>Container</b> concept. While it uses <b>push_back()</b> to add elements, it lacks several other functions expected of a Back Insertion Sequence Container; for example, there's no <b>erase()</b> or <b>pop_back()</b> because <b>glob()</b> provides no way to remove elements.</p>
<h3>Custom Iterator Theory</h3>

<p>Creating a <b>glob()</b>-based container is simple enough, but element access requires that <b>STLGlob</b> have an iterator.</p>

<p>It's said that iterators abstract client code from the container type; this is true, but the container type, iterator, and client code expectations still relate to one another. If client code drives the design, that influences the iterator's implementation (and, indirectly, that of the iterator's parent container). On the other hand, if the container drives the design, then that will dictate what client code can do with the container.</p>

<p>Iterators are to containers what pointers are to arrays: They abstract a sequence's element access. Increment (<b>operator++()</b>), and in some cases decrement (<b>operator&#151;()</b>), functionality is available to position the iterator over a different element, similar to moving a database cursor through a table. The abstracted value (that is, the current sequence element) is available via dereference (<b>operator*()</b>) and member access (<b>operator-&gt;()</b>) functions. Iterators must be comparable (<b>operator==()</b>, <b>operator!=()</b>) if they are to be of any use in a loop.</p>

<p>Language semantics bind raw pointers to the type they abstract. Iterators, by comparison, describe themselves and the values they abstract through members of the <b>std::iterator_traits&lt;&gt;</b> template: <b>iterator_category</b>, <b>value_type</b>, <b>difference_type</b>, <b>pointer</b>, and <b>reference</b>. (<b>iterator_traits&lt;&gt;</b> is specialized for raw pointers, which is why those work as STL iterators.)</p>

<p><b>iterator_category</b> describes the type of iterator using tag classes: <b>std::forward_iterator_tag</b> for forward iterators, <b>std::output_iterator_tag</b> for output iterators, and so on. In lieu of traditional, compiler-enforced inheritance, client code uses the tags to determine an iterator's capabilities and react accordingly.</p>

<p>(Don't be fooled. There exists a base class <b>std::iterator&lt;&gt;</b>, but it provides no function interface.)</p>

<p><b>value_type</b> is the type of the value abstracted by the iterator. This needn't be the same as the type used internally by the container; instead, it's the data type presented to client code for iterator dereference and pointer-member access functions. For example, <b>STLGlobIterator</b> (see <a href="0503mccalluml2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>) manages C <b>char*</b> strings internally, but returns C++ <b>std::string</b>s to client code on dereference.</p>

<p><b>difference_type</b> measures the distance between two iterators. It is for use with random-access iterators, which support the <b>distance() </b>operation.</p>

<p><b>reference</b> and <b>pointer</b> define the data types returned to clients on iterator dereference and member-access, respectively. Take, for example, a basic <b>operator-&gt;()</b>:</p>

<pre>
// ... specialization of iterator_traits&lt;SomeIter&gt; ...
class SomeIter ... {
  ...
  // this could be simplified with a typedef
  std::iterator_traits&lt;SomeIter&gt;::pointer operator-&gt;() {
  ....
}

</pre>

<p>Part of the challenge of creating custom iterators is that they rely on a much more strict adherence to concepts. This is based, once again, on the notion of client code expectations: Whereas people use containers, iterators are more often passed through (preexisting black box) algorithms and are thus less forgiving of deviations from the norm.</p>
<h3>Iterators in Practice: STLGlobIterator</h3>

<p>Applying the previous section's discussion to <b>STLGlob</b> yields the aptly (an unimaginatively) named <b>STLGlobIterator</b>. The full code is available for download, and an excerpt is provided in <a href="0503mccalluml2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>.</p>

<p><b>STLGlobIterator</b> inherits from <b>std::iterator&lt;&gt;</b> (<a href="0503mccalluml3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>), a convenience class that specializes <b>std::iterator_traits&lt;&gt;</b> and reflects those traits in the derived class as shortened <b>typedef</b>s. Only the category and value type must be provided; the template provides reasonable defaults for the rest. <b>iterator&lt;&gt;</b> provides no member function declarations.</p>

<p>Client code is expected to only use <b>STLGlobIterator</b> in single-pass algorithms, so <b>forward_iterator_tag</b> is the <b>iterator_category</b> trait. Redefining the class as a reverse iterator is left as an exercise, the first point of which would be to determine why <b>STLGlobIterator</b> would need decrement and <b>distance()</b> functionality.</p>

<p><b>STLGlobIterator</b> is a lightweight wrapper around another iterator, the <b>char**</b> expansion list in the parent <b>STLGlob</b>'s <b>glob_</b> member variable. (This value is stored in <b>STLGlobIterator</b> as <b>sequence_.</b>) While not quite a straight pass-through, it's simple enough to translate iterator operations to pointer equivalents.</p>

<p><b>STLGlobIterator</b>'s default (that is, no-args) constructor initializes <b>sequence_</b> to <b>NULL</b>, indicating the past-the-end element. The constructor overload accepts a <b>char**</b>, the <b>glob_t.gl_pathv</b> member of the parent <b>STLGlob</b>'s <b>glob_ member</b> variable. This value is owned by the parent <b>STLGlob,</b> and as such, <b>STLGlobIterator</b>'s destructor does not release <b>sequence_</b>'s memory. Changes made to the parent <b>STLGlob</b> container will likely invalidate <b>STLGlobIterator</b>.</p>

<p>Dereferencing <b>sequence_</b> yields the current value. This is stored in a local <b>std::string</b> member variable, <b>current_</b>, such that <b>operator-&gt;()</b> and <b>operator*()</b> don't yield pointer ownership problems. Technically, <b>list_</b> may change outside of the iterator and, thus, <b>current_</b> will not reflect the value it copies; but that would happen only if the parent <b>STLGlob</b> container were to change, in which case the pointer would be invalid anyhow.</p>

<p>The copy constructor and assignment operator assign <b>list_</b> and <b>current_</b> to the target object. It's safe to assign the pointer because it is owned by the parent <b>STLGlob</b> object, and iterator operations do not affect its value. </p>

<p>The increment operators advance <b>sequence_</b> and update <b>current_</b> accordingly. <b>glob()</b>'s match list (and hence, <b>sequence_</b>) is <b>NULL</b> terminated. When this value is reached, <b>sequence_</b> itself is set to <b>NULL</b> to match the past-the-end iterator.</p>

<p>Other iterators require a similar end-marker, past which the iterator is invalid. At this point, you have a choice on what to do when iterator functions are called&#151;throw exceptions or dereference the (now invalid) pointer as the client code requests. (The latter should yield a segmentation fault.) This decision depends largely on your (or your team's) coding practices and stance on compensating for developer error.</p>

<p>Comparison requires special attention. Iterators don't just abstract some value, but some value at a particular position in a particular container. A value may exist in several containers or several positions in a single container. Hence, comparison is more involved than simply comparing two iterators' dereferenced values.</p>

<p><b>STLGlobIterator</b>'s comparison is greatly simplified because it can compare the memory addresses of <b>sequence_</b>'s members. <b>glob_t</b>s that contain the same expansion should point to different areas of memory. Comparison of iterators from different <b>STLGlob</b> parents should thus return <b>false</b>.</p>

<p>The sample program example_2 (see <a href="http://www.cuj.com/code/">http://www.cuj.com/code/</a>) demonstrates the use of <b>STLGlob</b> and <b>STLGlobIterator</b>. Patterns (command-line arguments) are pushed into an <b>STLGlob</b> object, then the container's contents are passed through <b>std::for_each()</b> using <b>STLGlobIterators</b>.</p>

<pre>
./example_2 '/tmp/*' '/home/*'

</pre>

<p>Note that the patterns are enclosed within single quotes, such that they are passed verbatim to the program and are not interpreted by the shell. <a href="0503mccalluml4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a> is an excerpt of example_2.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this article, I've presented a technique that makes existing code&#151;even legacy code&#151;more accessible to STL algorithms. While it can be a challenge to implement, end users of the new classes (fellow developers) will hardly notice. In a sense, that's the goal: Producing constructs that are indistinguishable from natural STL classes eases their learning curve and thus enhances their adoption.</p>

<p>By no means do I include everything you need to know on this subject. Review the Standard [4], sections 23 (containers) and 24 (iterators), or <i>The C++ Programming Language</i> [5], chapters 16 and 19, for more details. The sample code's comments are formatted for Doxygen [6].</p>
