<hr>

<p>The Microsoft MapPoint web service [1] provides methods for looking up addresses, rendering maps, calculating routes, and a number of other useful mapping functions. I was recently asked to examine the possibility of helping a client get an application up and running on a Microsoft Smartphone, a cell phone with built-in PDA-like capabilities [2] that utilizes the MapPoint web service. The client wanted the phone screen to display a map of an address that was entered. I initially thought the .NET Compact Framework would be a good place to start, but it turned out that the client had already deployed a number of Smartphone 2002 devices, which unfortunately don't support the .NET Framework. Consequently, the only way to write applications for them is using embedded Visual C++ [3].</p>

<p>In this article, I describe what's involved in building client applications for the MapPoint web service in C++. To fully implement the techniques and code I present here, you must have MapPoint developer credentials. To sign up for credentials, see the accompanying text box "Signing Up for MapPoint Web Services." </p>

<p>Mobile devices such as the Smartphone present challenges above and beyond a normal C++-based web-service client, namely:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Keeping the application as small as possible.</li>
  <li>Dealing with a sometimes-connected environment.</li>
  <li>Calling an authenticated web service (MapPoint).</li>
</ul>



<p>As an extreme programmer, I always start with a couple of spikes (experiments) to get the lay of the land. The idea is to get a thin slice of the functionality working. In this case, I wanted to create a small C++ application that calls the web service and returns some information.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, however, I considered whether a toolkit would help since a couple of years ago, I investigated several C++ toolkits for creating and using web services. In particular, I used RogueWave's LEIF (short for "Lightweight Enterprise Integration Framework") toolkit [4] to help a client connect a legacy C++ application through to newer .NET clients. At the same time, I also looked at gSOAP [5] and PocketSOAP [6]. However, the problem with toolkits is that they all carry some baggage. While small, the baggage is still there and embedded solutions demand the least-possible amount of baggage. Every kilobyte counts and any general solution adds a few more KBs. </p>

<p>Luckily, web services such as MapPoint are easy to use&#151;essentially, they're HTTP calls that send and return text files&#151;so I decided a toolkit would be overkill for this project. In the time it would take to learn to use the toolkit, I could have written most of the solution. </p>

<p>For example, the first spike I implemented was a console application that used the Win32 WinInet functions to open a connection, set up a session, and make a request. Conveniently, WinInet methods are available on the Smartphone, making life easier. <a href="0502roodynl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>, for instance, calls the <b>GetVersionInfo</b> method on the web service, thereby validating that the code is working.</p>

<p>When you run this program, you see the output in <a href="0502roodynf1.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 1</a>. The version number in the XML you have retrieved is 03.50.22.1200 and you don't need to write the code here to extract that. Again, the point of this exercise was to see how easy it is to call the authenticated MapPoint web service.</p>

<p>How do you know what the XML to build the SOAP request should look like? The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) file provides everything you need to work this out. This WSDL can be found at <a href="http://staging.mappoint.net/standard-30/mappoint.wsdl">http://staging.mappoint.net/standard-30/mappoint.wsdl</a>. The description of the <b>GetVersionInfoSoapIn</b> message defines the parameters that are expected in the body of the SOAP when the call is made to the operation. In this case, the parameters are described in the <b>GetVersionInfo</b> element (<a href="0502roodyne1.html" target="_BLANK">Example 1</a>). As you can see in the WSDL, the <b>GetVersionInfo</b> element is empty, so no parameters need to be embedded in the SOAP. Of course, this is a simple call. Sticking to the desktop console application (thereby letting you do this without a Smartphone), I'll expand this code to find the latitude and longitude of an address using the MapPoint web service.</p>

<p>First you create a <b>FindAddress</b> method that you can call with an Internet session handle and an address. In <a href="0502roodynl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>, I have extracted from the main method the functionality that opens the HTTP session, sets up the headers, and sends the request. I have also added a call to a method called <b>BuildFindAddressSoapRequest</b>. </p>

<p>The <b>BuildFindAddressSoapRequest</b> method is similar to the <b>BuildSoap</b> method. You need to work out what the SOAP body needs to contain. This time it is somewhat more complicated than the <b>GetVersionInfo</b> operation. The WSDL describes the <b>FindAddressSoapIn</b>, which takes a <b>FindAddress</b> element. The <b>FindAddress</b> element consists of a <b>FindAddressSpecification</b>. The <b>FindAddressSpecification</b> contains the <b>DataSourceName</b> (a string), an <b>Address</b> type, and <b>FindOptions</b>. </p>

<p>From this WSDL (see <a href="0502roodyne2.html" target="_BLANK">Example 2</a>) and the help available on the MSDN MapPoint web site [1], you can create the <b>BuildFindAddressSoapRequest</b> method in <a href="0502roodynl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>. In the main method, you can call the <b>FindAddress</b> method with an address, as in <a href="0502roodynl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>.</p>

<p>When you run this application, you can see that the latitude and longitude are returned in the body of the XML SOAP envelope (<a href="0502roodynf2.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 2</a>). You should probably think about extracting the latitude and longitude from the XML; see <a href="0502roodynl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>. You can then call that method from the <b>FindAddress</b> method when you have read the response (<a href="0502roodynl6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a>).</p>

<p>Granted, this is simplistic&#151;but that's the point! If you were doing this with a SOAP toolkit such as gSOAP, LEIF, or PocketSOAP, you would get structures generated for each of the custom types exposed by the web service. For example, the <b>FindAddressSpecification</b> structure might look like this:</p>

<pre>
struct FindAddressSpecification 
{
TCHAR* DataSourceName;
Address* InputAddress;
FindOptions* Options;
}

</pre>

<p>As you have this structure, you would need the <b>Address</b> and <b>FindOptions</b> structures:</p>

<pre>
struct Address 
{
TCHAR* AddressLine;
TCHAR* PrimaryCity;
TCHAR* SecondaryCity;
TCHAR* Subdivision;
TCHAR* PostalCode;
TCHAR* CountryRegion;
TCHAR* FormattedAddress;
}

</pre>

<p>These structures add to the overhead mentioned earlier, and you don't need them just to get a latitude and longitude. If you are using a small subset of what is provided by a web service, then you can write simple code that gets what you want from the web service without using a toolkit. Or when you are writing a client application that uses only a small number of calls, you can get away without the toolkit. However, the toolkits are great for when you are using a large number of methods from a web service. </p>

<p>The requirements for the client application I am presenting here is to display a map of an address. This requires two method calls&#151;one to get the latitude and longitude, and another to get the map. </p>

<p>Using the WSDL, you can work out what you need to pass in the SOAP body to get a map from a latitude and longitude. You can build this SOAP envelope in a method similar to the <b>BuildFindAddressSoapRequest</b> method (<a href="0502roodynl7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a>). This <b>BuildGetMapSoapRequest</b> can be called from a method that opens the HTTP session and sends the request. Similar to the <b>FindAddress</b> method, this new <b>GetMap</b> method calls an operation on the MapPoint web service (<a href="0502roodynl8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a>). Notice that the endpoint has changed from /Find-30/FindService.asmx to /Render-30/RenderService.asmx. </p>

<p>How did I know this was the endpoint for this operation? From the WSDL, which describes the service that supports the <b>GetMap</b> method:</p>

<pre>
&lt;wsdl:service name="RouteService"&gt;
	. . . 
 &lt;wsdl:port name="RouteServiceSoap" binding="tns:RouteServiceSoap"&gt;
  &lt;soap:address location=
   "http://routev3.staging.mappoint.net/Route-30/RouteService.asmx" /&gt; 
 &lt;/wsdl:port&gt;
&lt;/wsdl:service&gt;

</pre>

<p>You can also see that not only the endpoint has changed, but the server is also different. This means you cannot use the same Internet session for the <b>GetMap</b> call that you used for the <b>FindAddress</b> call. To call the <b>GetMap</b> method, you need to call <b>InternetConnect</b> again with the server name (<a href="0502roodynl9.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 9</a>).</p>

<p>To get the map image (see <a href="0502roodynf3.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 3</a>), you need to extract the image bits from the response you get in the <b>GetMap</b> method. For this experiment, I can save the image to a file. This <b>SaveMapBitmap</b> (<a href="0502roodynl10.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 10</a>) can be called from the <b>GetMap</b> method.</p>

<p>Porting this code from the console to the Smartphone involves two other issues:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Because the Smartphone doesn't support Digest Authentication by default, you need to either find or write a Digest Authentication library for the Smartphone. </li>
  <li>The <b>Base64Decode</b> method I used in the experiment is not available on the Smartphone platform. This is a simpler issue that can easily be resolved with a small method. </li>
</ul>
