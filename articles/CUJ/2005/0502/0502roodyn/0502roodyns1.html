<h2>Signing Up for MapPoint  Web Services</h2>
To get started using the MapPoint web service, you need developer credentials that let you log onto the web service and make method calls to retrieve the maps and map data. In the code listings presented here, you need to replace <b>&lt;username&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;password&gt;</b> with the username and password issued to you as a MapPoint developer. 

<p>The king of MapPoint blogs, Chandu Thota, has a great five-step plan to help you get your MapPoint credentials [7]. Here is what you need to do: </p>

<p></p>

<ol>
  <li>1.	If you have an MSDN Universal subscription, follow these steps to get free access to the MapPoint web service for a year: (a) Go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mappoint/msdn/msdnspec.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/mappoint/msdn/msdnspec.aspx</a>; (b) Login to the MSDN subscriber's page, fill in the information, and submit the form.</li>
  <li>2.	If you don't have an MSDN Universal subscription, you can still get access to the MapPoint web service for free for 45 days. Follow these steps: (a) Go to <a href="https://s.microsoft.com/mappoint/enterprise/webservice/seval.aspx">https://s.microsoft.com/mappoint/enterprise/webservice/seval.aspx</a>; (b) Fill in the information and submit the form.</li>
  <li>3.	You will then receive an e-mail with an account ID and password to access the MapPoint web service.</li>
  <li>4.	Along with the MapPoint web service information, you will also receive credentials to access the MapPoint extranet site (<a href="https://www.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/">https://www.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/</a>). You can think of the MapPoint extranet as a dashboard to manage your MapPoint web service settings and environment. For example, if you want to change your password, upload your own points of interest, or create your own icons, you have to use the extranet.</li>
  <li>5.	Finally, if you are in the process of developing your MapPoint web service solution, you can request the extension of your account by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:mpnet@microsoft.com">mpnet@microsoft.com</a>. </li></ol>
