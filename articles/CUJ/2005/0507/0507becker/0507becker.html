<hr>





<p>I've heard that some primitive tribes only have three numbers: one, two, and many. By that standard, C++ template programmers who use the Standard Library are somewhat primitive, because they are often limited to writing code that uses one or two things, but not more.</p>

<p>For example, writing a template function that simply returns its argument is easy:</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
    T copy(T val)
    {
    return val;
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Last value is: " 
             &lt;&lt; copy(0) &lt;&lt; '\n';

</pre>

<p>Writing a template function that takes two arguments and returns them both is a little more complicated, but still, not very hard:</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class T0, class T1&gt;
    std::pair&lt;T0, T1&gt; copy(T0 val0, T1 val1)
    {
    return std::make_pair(val0, val1);
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Last value is: " 
              &lt;&lt; copy(0, 1).second &lt;&lt; '\n';

</pre>

<p>Writing a template function that takes more than two arguments and returns all of them can be done using only the Standard Library, but the result is rather difficult to use [1]:</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class T0, class T1, class T2&gt;
    std::pair&lt;T0, std::pair&lt;T1, T2&gt; &gt;
    copy(T0 val0, T1 val1, T2 val2)
    {
    return std::make_pair(val0, 
        std::make_pair(val1, val2));
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Last value is: " 
      &lt;&lt; copy(0, 1, 2).second.second &lt;&lt; '\n';

</pre>

<p>The ISO Technical Report on C++ Library Extensions [2], better known as TR1, provides a generalization of <b>std::pair</b>, named <b>std::tr1::tuple</b>, that holds anywhere from 0 up to an implementation-defined number of values of arbitrary types. It also makes some additions to the existing header <b>&lt;utility&gt;</b> so that <b>std::pair</b> can be used in some of the same ways as the new template <b>tuple</b>. This month I look at the new TR1 header <b>&lt;tuple&gt;</b> and at the changes TR1 makes to the header <b>&lt;utility&gt;</b>.</p>
<h3>Header Contents</h3>

<p>TR1 introduces a new header named<b> &lt;tuple&gt;</b> with the following declarations:</p>

<pre>
  namespace std {
  namespace tr1 {
  template &lt;class T1, class T2, ..., class TN&gt;
    class tuple;
  template &lt;int Idx, class Tuple&gt; 
                    class tuple_element;
  template &lt;class Tuple&gt; class tuple_size;
  template &lt;int Idx, class T1, class T2, ...,
           class TN&gt;
    RI get(tuple&lt;T1, T2, ..., Tn&gt;&amp;);
  template &lt;int Idx, class T1, class T2, ...,
           class TN&gt;
    RI get(const tuple&lt;T1, T2, ..., Tn&gt;&amp;);
  template &lt;class T1, class T2, ..., class TN&gt;
    tuple&lt;V1, V2, ..., VN&gt;
      make_tuple&lt;const T1&amp;, const T2&amp;, ...,
                const TN&amp;);
  template &lt;class T1, class T2, ..., class TN&gt;
    tuple&lt;T1&amp;, T2&amp;, ..., TN&amp;&gt;
      tie(T1&amp;, T2&amp;, ..., TN&amp;);
  template &lt;class T1, class T2, ..., class TN,
    class U1, class U2, ..., class UN&gt;
      bool operator==(
        const tuple&lt;T1, T2, ..., TN&gt;&amp;,
        const tuple&lt;U1, U2, ..., UN&gt;&amp;);
  /* and, similarly, operator!=, operator&lt;, 
        operator&lt;=, operator&gt;, operator&gt;= */
  } // namespace tr1
  } // namespace std

</pre>

<p>Now, obviously, those aren't the real declarations: You can't have an ellipsis in a template argument list. This is shorthand for a family of templates that take from 0 to <b>N</b> template arguments. So, for example:</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class T1, class T2, ..., class TN&gt;
    class tuple;


</pre>

<p>means that you can write:</p>

<pre>
  tuple&lt;&gt; t0;    // tuple object 
                 // holding no objects
  tuple&lt;int&gt; t1; // tuple object 
                 // holding one object
                // of type int
  tuple&lt;int, int&gt; t2; // tuple object 
                     // holding 
                     // objects of 
                     // type int
  // and so on, up to the 
  // implementation-defined maximum 
  // number of arguments

</pre>
<h3>The Class Template tuple</h3>

<p>The full definition of the class template <b>tuple</b> looks like this:</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class T1, class T2, ..., class TN&gt;

<blockquote>
  class tuple {<br>
  public:<br>
    // constructors<br>
    tuple();<br>
    tuple(const tuple&amp;);<br>
    template &lt;class U1, class U2, ..., <br>
             class UN&gt;<br>
      tuple(const tuple&lt;U1, U2, ..., UN&gt;&amp;);<br>
    template &lt;class U1, class U2&gt;<br>
      tuple(const pair&lt;U1, U2&gt;&amp;);<br>
                              // N == 2<br>
    explicit tuple(P1, P2, ..., PN);<br>
                              // 0 &lt; N<br>
<br>
    // assignment operators<br>
    tuple&amp; operator=(const tuple&amp;);<br>
    template &lt;class U1, class U2, ..., <br>
             class UN&gt;<br>
      tuple&amp; operator=(const tuple&lt;U1, U2,<br>
                      ..., UN&gt;&amp;);<br>
    template &lt;class U1, class U2&gt;<br>
      tuple&amp; operator=(const pair&lt;U1, U2&gt;&amp;);<br>
                               // N == 2<br>
  };<br>

</pre>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is shorthand. The details of how this is done are up to the implementor.</p>

<p>Each <b>tuple</b> type has a default constructor and a copy constructor. It also has a constructor that takes a <b>tuple</b> type that holds the same number of objects. With this constructor, each contained object is constructed from the corresponding contained object in the tuple object that was passed to the constructor. If any of the contained types can't be constructed from the corresponding argument type, this constructor won't compile. A <b>tuple</b> type that holds two objects also has a constructor that takes an argument of type <b>std::pair&lt;U1, U2&gt;</b>; again, if the elements in the <b>tuple</b> being constructed can't be constructed from the corresponding elements in the argument, this constructor won't compile. And finally, a <b>tuple</b> type that holds one or more objects has a constructor that takes <b>N</b> arguments; when the contained type is a reference, the corresponding constructor argument is simply that type; otherwise the constructor argument has type<b> const T&amp;</b>, where <b>T</b> is the type of the contained object. <a href="0507beckerl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> has examples of these constructors.</p>

<p>Similarly, each <b>tuple</b> type has an assignment operator that takes a <b>tuple</b> object of the same type, and an assignment operator that takes a <b>tuple</b> object with the same number of elements. The latter won't compile if the individual elements aren't assignable. And, as with the constructors, you can assign an object of type <b>std::pair&lt;U1, U2&gt;</b> to a <b>tuple</b> that holds two objects.</p>
<h3>The Function Template get</h3>

<p>You probably noticed that, unlike <b>std::pair</b>, the <b>tuple</b> template does not give names to its stored elements. Instead, there is a pair of template functions that take an index and a <b>tuple</b> object and return a reference to the object contained in the <b>tuple</b> argument at the given index. This index is not an argument to the function; rather, it's a template argument. The declarations of these functions look something like this:</p>

<pre>
template &lt;int Idx, 
         class T1, class T2, ..., class TN&gt;
    RI get(tuple&lt;T1, T2, ..., TN&gt;&amp;);
  template &lt;int Idx, 
        class T1, class T2, ..., class TN&gt;
    RI get(const tuple&lt;T1, T2, ..., TN&gt;&amp;);

</pre>

<p>Each function returns a reference to the element at location <b>Idx</b> in the <b>tuple</b> object. Note that index values begin at 0, so the element at index 0 has type<b> T1 </b>[3]. When the type of the selected element is a reference, the return type <b>RI</b> of each of these functions is simply that type; otherwise, the first function returns a reference to the type of the selected element and the second function returns a <b>const</b> reference to that type.</p>

<p>You call this function by passing a <b>tuple</b> object. The compiler deduces the types of the stored elements from the argument itself. It can't deduce the index that you're looking for, so you have to supply it:<b> get&lt;0&gt;(tpl) </b>returns the first element of its argument, <b>get&lt;1&gt;(tpl)</b> returns the second element, and so on, as in <a href="0507beckerl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>.</p>
<h3>The Function Template make_tuple</h3>

<p>Often you'll have a set of values that you want to store in a <b>tuple</b> object; instead of writing out the template arguments, you can use the function <b>make_tuple</b> to create a <b>tuple</b> object. Each element of the resulting <b>tuple</b> has the same type as the corresponding argument to <b>make_tuple</b>, with one exception. We haven't looked at the TR1 template <b>reference_wrapper</b> yet, but, briefly, an object of type <b>reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</b> acts pretty much like a reference to <b>T</b>, except that it can be copied. When you pass an object of type <b>reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</b> to <b>make_tuple</b>, the corresponding contained object has type <b>T&amp;</b>, and refers to the object that the<b> reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</b> object referred to. Most of the time you'll use the template function <b>ref</b> to create a <b>reference_wrapper</b> object that refers to the object passed to <b>ref</b> [4]. <a href="0507beckerl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a> has examples of <b>make_tuple</b>.</p>
<h3>The Function Template tie</h3>

<p>The function template <b>tie</b> creates a <b>tuple</b> object that holds references to its arguments. You could do the same thing with <b>make_tuple</b> by wrapping each argument with a call to <b>ref</b>, but using <b>tie</b> is much more convenient. In addition, when you call <b>tie</b>, you can pass the object <b>ignore</b> in any argument position and the resulting <b>tuple</b> object will ignore assignments to that object. You'll typically use <b>tie</b> and <b>ignore</b> to extract values from a <b>tuple</b> object into individual variables, as in <a href="0507beckerl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>.</p>
<h3>Comparing  &lt;tuple&gt; Objects</h3>

<p>Naturally, there will be times when you'll need to know whether two <b>tuple</b> objects hold the same values, and sometimes you'll also need to check the relative order of two <b>tuple</b> objects. TR1 defines the usual set of six relational operators.</p>

<p>Two <b>tuple</b> objects are equal if their individual elements are equal. Two <b>tuple</b> objects are unequal if any two corresponding elements are not equal. In both cases, the implementation compares elements from left to right, applying <b>operator==</b> to the two elements. It stops comparing at the first two elements that are not equal. <a href="0507beckerl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a> shows how this works. Note that the type <b>S</b> has its own <b>operator==</b> but not an <b>operator!=</b>; the implementation of <b>operator==</b>and <b>operator!=</b> for <b>tuple</b> only uses <b>operator==</b>.</p>

<p>A <b>tuple</b> object is less than another <b>tuple</b> object if, for the first two elements that are not equal, the element from the first <b>tuple</b> object is less than the corresponding element from the second <b>tuple</b> object. In this case, unlike the equality tests that we just looked at, two elements are equal if neither one is less than the other. This means that user-defined types only have to define an <b>operator&lt; </b>to support <b>operator&lt; </b>for <b>tuple</b> objects that hold them. <a href="0507beckerl6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a> shows the use of <b>operator&lt;</b>.</p>

<p>The rest of the inequality operators for <b>tuple</b> objects are defined in terms of<b> operator&lt; </b>for those objects. That is, <b>tpl0 &gt; tpl1 </b>is defined as<b> tpl1 &lt; tpl0</b>, <b>tpl0 &lt;= tpl1 </b>is defined as <b>!(tpl1 &lt; tpl0)</b>, and<b> tpl0 &gt;= tpl1</b> is defined as <b>!(tpl0 &lt; tpl1)</b>.</p>
<h3>The Class Templates  tuple_size and tuple_element</h3>

<p>From time to time you may need to know how may elements a <b>tuple</b> type holds, or you may need to determine the type of an element held in a <b>tuple</b> type. The two template classes <b>tuple_size</b> and <b>tuple_element</b> give you this information.</p>

<p>The template <b>tuple_size&lt;Tuple&gt;</b> has a nested object <b>value</b>, which is a compile-time constant equal to the number of elements in the template argument <b>Tuple</b>. That description is pretty fuzzy, because the TR doesn't require any particular implementation; the rule is that when you use the name <b>tuple_size&lt;Tuple&gt;::value</b>, you get a compile-time constant.</p>

<p>The template <b>tuple_element</b> takes two template arguments. The first is the index of the element you want to know the type of, and the second is the <b>tuple</b> type that you're asking about. It has a nested type name named <b>type</b> that is a synonym for the type of the requested element. Just as with the template function <b>get</b>, index values begin at 0. <a href="0507beckerl7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a> shows the use of these templates.</p>
<h3>Adding a tuple-like Interface to std::pair</h3>

<p>We've been looking at the contents of the TR1 header <b>&lt;tuple&gt;</b>. TR1 also makes some changes to the Standard Library header <b>&lt;utility&gt;</b>, to make <b>std::pair</b> look a bit more like a <b>tuple</b>. You can call the template functions <b>get&lt;0&gt; </b>and <b>get&lt;1&gt;</b> with an argument that's an instance of <b>pair</b>, and you can specialize the templates <b>tuple_size</b> and <b>tuple_element</b> with a <b>pair</b> type.</p>
<h3>Template  Metaprogramming with tuple</h3>

<p>The templates <b>tuple_size</b> and <b>tuple_element</b> give you compile-time access to the details of a <b>tuple</b> type; combined with the template function <b>get</b> and some fairly simple metaprogramming you can manipulate any or all of the elements contained in a <b>tuple</b> object without having to know, when you write the code, how many elements any particular <b>tuple</b> holds. <a href="0507beckerl8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a> shows how to print out the value of every element in an arbitrary <b>tuple</b> object. It requires a bit of explanation.</p>

<p>It begins with a forward declaration of a template struct name <b>writer</b>. Using a forward declaration in this case is a matter of style. It's not necessary, but without it I'd have to write the full template before the specializations, and I prefer to write it after them.</p>

<p>Each version of the template <b>writer</b> takes a template argument whose value is one more than the index of the element that it will display. It has a template member function named <b>put</b> that takes two template arguments. The first argument is the type of the output stream that the function should write to, and the second argument is the type of the <b>tuple</b> object whose element will be written out. It takes two objects of these types, writes out the appropriate information, and returns a reference to the output stream.</p>

<p>The <b>put</b> member function of the first specialization, <b>writer&lt;0&gt;</b>, handles empty <b>tuple</b> types. It doesn't write anything out, because there is nothing to write.</p>

<p>The <b>put</b> member function of the next specialization, <b>writer&lt;1&gt;</b>, simply writes element 0 of a nonempty <b>tuple</b> object.</p>

<p>The <b>put</b> member function of the general template <b>writer&lt;N&gt;</b> writes the first <b>N</b> elements of its <b>tuple</b> argument. So <b>writer&lt;2&gt;::put</b> writes elements 0 and 1, <b>writer&lt;3&gt;::put</b> writes elements 0, 1, and 2, and so on. It does this by first calling <b>writer&lt;N-1&gt;::put</b>, writing a comma, and then writing the value of element <b>N-1</b>. Of course, <b>writer&lt;N-1&gt;::put</b> writes the value of element <b>N-2</b>, and so on down the recursion chain. Each version of <b>put</b> calls the lower version before writing its element, so the elements come out in the right order.</p>

<p>Finally, the template function <b>write_tuple</b> takes a reference to an output stream and a <b>tuple</b> object, figures out the number of elements in the <b>tuple</b> type, instantiates a <b>writer</b> type for that number of elements, and calls its <b>put</b> member function [5]. Note that the <b>writer</b> type really is necessary: You can't write a partial specialization for a template function, which means that you can't write this function so that it recurses at compile time; instead, we have to go through a template class, which can be partially specialized, allowing the sort of recursion that we need here.</p>
<h3>Coming Up</h3>

<p>Next time, I begin looking at the additions that TR1 makes to the Standard Library header <b>&lt;memory&gt;</b> to provide a reference-counted smart pointer.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
  <li>[1] Of course, if you need to do this sort of thing you can write ad hoc templates to hold various numbers of things, generalizing <b>std::pair</b> by adding <b>triple</b>, <b>quad</b>, and so on. There's nothing inherently wrong with this approach, but an application that uses multiple libraries could run into problems from conflicting definitions of such things.</li>
  <li>[2]	By the time you read this the technical report will probably have received final approval. At the April 2005 Standards Committee meeting, we got word that it had passed it's penultimate ballot unanimously. We voted at that meeting to send it out for final ballot.</li>
  <li>[3]	This is mostly a typographical convenience. It's hard to write pseudocode that uses names like <b>TN-1</b>, which would be the last template argument if their numbers started at 0, so that it doesn't look like ordinary subtraction.</li>
  <li>[4]	I examine this in detail in a later column; for now, with an object <b>obj</b> of type<b> T</b>, the template function <b>ref</b> returns an object of type <b>reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</b>, and the template function <b>cref</b> returns an object of type <b>reference_wrapper&lt;const T&gt;</b>.</li>
  <li>[5]	This function really should be a stream inserter, not a named function, but there's no portable way to name the type of an arbitrary <b>tuple</b> object, so it's not currently possible to write an overloaded inserter for <b>tuple</b> objects. If you restrict yourself to a few reasonable sizes you can write a stream inserter for each size that you're interested in, in the same way you'd write an inserter for a <b>pair</b>. That's probably the best way to handle writing the contents of <b>tuple</b> objects at present, but that doesn't make an interesting example. </li></ol>
