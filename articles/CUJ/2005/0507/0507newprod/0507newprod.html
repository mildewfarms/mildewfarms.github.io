<h3>Crossware Ships New ColdFire Development Suite</h3>

<p>Crossware has released Version 3 of its C compiler for Freescale's ColdFire microprocessors and microcontrollers. The new compiler, available as part of Crossware's ColdFire Development Suite, is able to carry out a flow analysis of a program. Additional calling conventions have been added, function parameters can be passed in registers, and function in-lining can be used to completely eliminate the function call altogether.
