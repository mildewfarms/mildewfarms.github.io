<p>[This article is, in part, an extract from Matthew's forthcoming book on STL extension, called <i>Extended STL</i>, which will be published by Addison-Wesley in 2006.]</p>



<p>adapter class templates are used to convert a class, or a related group of classes, from an existing interface to a new interface. A standard example of this is the <b>std::stack&lt;&gt;</b> template, which may be used to adapt sequence containers that do not contain stack operations&#151;<b>push()</b>, <b>pop()</b>&#151;into a stack; see <a href="0512wilsonl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>.</p>

<p>This works because all the features of an underlying container required by the <b>std::stack</b> template are implemented in terms of the public interfaces of the standard <b>std::vector</b>, <b>std::list</b>, and <b>std::deque</b> class templates, including member types <b>size_type</b> and <b>value_type</b> and methods <b>back()</b> and <b>push_back()</b>.</p>

<p>The problem I address in this article is what to do when the adapter template makes demands that a potential underlying type cannot fulfill: How do you increase the spectrum of adaptable types by adding flexibility to the adapter? To answer this question, I introduce the technique of Inferred Interface Adaptation (IIA), which is comprised of three template metaprogramming techniques: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Type Detection</li>
  <li>Type Fixing</li>
  <li>Type Selection </li>
</ul>
<h3>Adapting Interface-Incomplete  Types</h3>

<p>The Iterator pattern [1] represents enumeration over a collection of elements as a single instance of a type that provides methods for advancing the iteration point and for accessing the element representing the current iteration point. The class template <b>sequence_range</b> (<a href="0512wilsonl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>) implements Iterator for collection classes that provide STL-like iterators (via <b>begin()</b> and <b>end()</b> methods), and presents iteration and access via the <b>advance()</b> and <b>current()</b> methods. (It's actually a chopped-down version of the class template of the same name in STLSoft's implementation of RangeLib, http://rangelib.org/; see [2, 3].)</p>

<p>To support mutating and nonmutating access to the elements of the underlying collection, the <b>current()</b> method is overloaded. The mutating form returns a (non<b>const</b>) reference, the nonmutating form a <b>const_reference</b>. This supports the three call forms in <a href="0512wilsone1.html" target="_BLANK">Example 1</a>.</p>

<p>This is <b>const</b>-methods-101, and failing to facilitate this typical behavior in an adapter class would be unnecessarily restrictive. As you'll see, though, meeting such ostensibly straightforward behavioral requirements brings along quite a few complications.</p>
<h3>Adapting  Immutable Collections </h3>

<p>In the real world, not all STL-like collections provide both mutable and immutable semantics. When the underlying collection does not support mutable (non-<b>const</b>) references, there's a problem with the <b>sequence_range</b> adapter previously mentioned. Consider what happens if you use the class in <a href="0512wilsone2.html" target="_BLANK">Example 2</a>, a read-only vector.</p>

<p>If you try to adapt this class with <b>sequence_range</b>, you get compile errors in the definition of the member types of <b>sequence_range&lt;ro_vector&gt;</b>. Specifically, the compiler tells you that the adapted class has no member types <b>reference</b> and <b>iterator</b>.</p>

<p>You want the adapter to infer, at compile time, whether it's being used with a type that does not support mutable operations. If not, it defines suitable stand-in types based on the (public) interface of the adapted class. In other words, when adapting <b>ro_vector</b>, you should define <b>sequence_range</b>'s <b>reference</b> and <b>iterator</b> member types as the <b>const_reference</b> and <b>const_iterator</b> member types of <b>ro_vector</b>. This would mean the effective definition of <b>sequence_range</b> would be:</p>

<pre>
template &lt;typename C&gt;
class sequence_range
{
  ...
  const_reference current()
  {
    return *m_current;
  }
  const_reference current() const
  {
    return *m_current;
  }
  ...
private:
  const_iterator m_current;  
  const_iterator m_end;  
};

</pre>
<h3>Inferred  Interface Adaptation</h3>

<p>The IIA technique consists of three steps:</p>



<ol>
  <li>Infer the interface on the adapted type using Type Detection.</li>
  <li>Fix any incompatibilities using Type Fixing.</li>
  <li>Define the adaptor type's interface in terms of the actual or fixed types of the adapted type using Type Selection.</li>
</ol>



<p>Before examining how it works, take a look at how it's used in <a href="0512wilsone3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>. The member value, <b>C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE</b>, is a compile-time constant that indicates whether the adapted type, <b>C</b>, provides a mutable interface (Type Detection). Next comes the type-fixer template, <b>typefixer_iterator</b>, which defines the <b>putative_iterator</b> member type (Type Fixing). Finally, a type-selector template, <b>select_first_type</b>, selects either the <b>putative_iterator</b> or <b>const_iterator</b> types to define the iterator member type (Type Selection).</p>
<h3>Type Selection</h3>

<p>Type Selection, a well-established idiom in template metaprogramming, consists of a primary template and a partial specialization; see <a href="0512wilsone4.html" target="_BLANK">Example 4</a>. In the general case, where the third Boolean template parameter is nonzero, the first type is selected. In the specific case where the third parameter is <b>false</b>, the second type is selected. Thus <b>select_ first_type&lt;int</b>, <b>char</b>, <b>true&gt;::type</b> is <b>int</b>, and <b>select_first_type&lt;int</b>, <b>char</b>, <b>false&gt;::type</b> is <b>char</b>.</p>
<h3>Type Detection</h3>

<p>The next problem you must solve is arguably the most mind bending. It involves the use of the SFINAE principle (see the accompanying sidebar), to define a template that can detect member types. <a href="0512wilsone5.html" target="_BLANK">Example 5</a> is a definition of the <b>has_value_type</b> used for detecting whether a class has a <b>value_type</b> member type. </p>

<p>Although this looks like a horrible indigestible mess, it's actually reasonably straightforward once you break it down. For a type <b>T</b>, specializing to <b>has_value_type&lt;T&gt;</b> involves determining which instantiation of the <b>has_value_type_function()</b> template function for <b>T</b> best matches an argument of 0. The second template, involving <b>typename T::value_type const volatile*</b>, is more specific than the one taking any arguments, the ellipsis parameter (<b>...</b>), and can be matched to 0 (since 0 can be a pointer literal as well as an integer literal), for any <b>T</b> that has a member type <b>value_type</b>. This is the Type Detection because <b>has_value_type&lt;T&gt; ::value</b> will be 1 if <b>T</b> has a member type <b>value_type</b>, and 0 if it does not. There's a full specialization of <b>has_value_type</b> for <b>void</b>, although that's not used in the application of the technique as I describe in this article.</p>

<p>The flaw in this technique is that you have to write this code for each member type to be detected because there's not&#151;at least as far as I know&#151;a "meta-meta" mechanism for specifying the name of the member type to a general template + functions set. Hence, it's a fair amount of manual effort, but thankfully there are not that many member types in standard/common usage that must be considered. (You can use macros if you choose, just be careful with the definitions.)</p>

<p>You can now see how to determine the value for <b>C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE</b>. You choose a member type that only a mutable collection would have (say <b>iterator</b>) and detect it: </p>

<pre>
template &lt;typename C&gt;

class sequence_range
{
private:
  enum { C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE = has_iterator_type&lt;C&gt;::value };
</pre>

<p>In fact, given the imperfect nature of some standard libraries and/or some STL extensions, it's wise to err on the side of caution, and detect several mutable-only member types:</p>

<pre>
template &lt;typename C&gt;

class sequence_range
{
private:<
  enum { C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE = has_iterator&lt;C&gt;::value &amp;&amp; has_pointer&lt;C&gt;::value };
</pre>
<h3>Type Fixing</h3>

<p>You can now detect whether your collection has a mutable interface, and you know how to select a type. All that remains is to fix the types. A naive attempt at this might be <a href="0512wilsone6.html" target="_BLANK">Example 6</a>.</p>

<p>The problem here, of course, is that <b>select_first_type</b> is specialized with the types <b>C::reference</b> and <b>C::const_reference</b>. When C is a type that does not have a reference member type, the specialization of <b>select_first_type</b>, and therefore of <b>sequence_range</b> as a whole, is invalid, and compilation errors ensue.</p>

<p>Partial template specialization comes to the rescue again, this time in the form of the <b>fixer_reference</b> primary class template, and its partial specialization:</p>

<pre>
template &lt;typename T, bool HAS_MEMBER&gt;
struct fixer_reference
{
  typedef typename T::reference reference;
};
template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct fixer_reference&lt;T, false&gt;
{
  typedef void reference;
};

</pre>



<p>The first parameter, <b>T</b>, is the collection. The second parameter is used to indicate whether the collection has such a member. The primary class template defines the member type reference from the reference member type of the collection. In the partial specialization, where the second template parameter is <b>false</b> to indicate that such a member is not defined, the member type reference is <b>typedef</b>ed from <b>void</b>. This is the Type Fixing: According to the classic principle, we've added another layer of abstraction, and are now able to express ourselves in terms of the member type reference of collection types that may not define this type. Now the template expression:</p>

<pre>
typedef typename typefixer_reference&lt; C, C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE&gt;::reference putative_reference;
</pre>

<p>is eminently compilable, whether <b>C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE</b> is <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.</p>

<p>If <b>C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE</b> is <b>true</b>, then <b>typefixer_reference&lt;C, C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE&gt;::reference</b> evaluates to be <b>C::reference</b>. Thus:</p>

<pre>
select_first_type&lt;putative_reference, const_reference, C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE&gt;::type<

</pre>

<p>evaluates to:</p>

<pre>
select_first_type&lt;C::reference, C::const_reference, true&gt;::type
</pre>
<p>which evaluates to <b>C::reference</b>.</p>

<p>If <b>C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE</b> is <b>false</b>, then <b>typefixer_reference&lt;C</b>, <b>C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE&gt;::reference</b> evaluates to <b>void</b>. Thus:</p>

<pre>
select_first_type&lt;putative_reference , const_reference, C_HAS_MUTABLE_INTERFACE&gt;::type

</pre>

<p>evaluates to: </p>

<pre>
select_first_type&lt;void, C::const_reference, true&gt;::type
</pre>

<p>which evaluates to <b>C::const_reference</b>.</p>

<p>At no point have we a type that doesn't exist&#151;in its place is <b>void</b>&#151;and so it is acceptable to the compiler. (Of course, if the adapted type doesn't have <b>const_iterator</b> or doesn't have <b>const_reference</b>, then the compiler will still complain, but expecting adapters to have intelligence to cope in that case is perhaps unreasonable; we can reasonably require users of the <b>sequence_range</b> adapter to use it with types that, at least, provide <b>const_iterator</b> and <b>const_reference</b> member types, along with <b>begin()</b> and <b>end()</b> methods.)</p>
<h3>Applying  IIA to the Range</h3>

<p>Plugging all this back into the <b>sequence_range</b> class template, we have the definition as in <a href="0512wilsonl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>. Now the adapter works for types that support mutable and immutable operations and for types that support only immutable operations. There are some further complications in the actual definition of the <b>sequence_range</b> in STLSoft's RangeLib to handle parameterization of the adapter with <b>const</b> collection types, but they are also addressed by use of IIA. Feel free to download the STLSoft implementation of RangeLib (as part of the STLSoft distribution at http:// stlsoft.org/downloads.html), and check it out for yourself.</p>
