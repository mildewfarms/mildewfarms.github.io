<h3>Deskzilla 1.0</h3>

<p>ALM Works has announced the release of Deskzilla 1.0, a desktop client for the Bugzilla bug tracking system. The program lets you view a project as a hierarchical structure with nested queries. Bug counters in Deskzilla give users insight into the state of the project. You can search by entering search terms in a single box, or you can create a complex filter using the Query Builder. Deskzilla may be used to update bugs and to submit new bugs. If it detects a bug update collision, which typically comes as a result of two people changing the same bug simultaneously, Deskzilla lets you carefully review both change sets and resolve a conflict instantly or put off conflict resolution for a later time. Deskzilla 1.0 runs under Windows 98/Me/2000/ XP/Server 2003, Linux, and Mac OS X. The client is compatible with Bugzilla Version 2.14 and newer. Contact +1-733-598-5805 or http://deskzilla.com/.</p>
