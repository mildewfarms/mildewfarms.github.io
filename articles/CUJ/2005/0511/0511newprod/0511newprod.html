<p>KUKA Controls, a developer of real-time operating system solutions for Windows XP, announced today the availability of the new Real-Time Device Manager (RTDM), included with CeWin¨ v3.3 and VxWin¨ v3.1. The RTDM is a tool to analyze and isolate IRQ resources for real-time hardware. The RTDM automates the assignment of hardware to the RTOS, greatly reducing the chance for operator error. The full RTDM functionality can be easily integrated into a third-party installation using the documented libraries. VxWin and CeWin real-time extension technology enable the coexistence of two operating systems on a single computer, in part, by dividing the PC memory so that the RTOS (either VxWorks or Windows CE) and Windows XP each execute in separate, protected memory areas.
