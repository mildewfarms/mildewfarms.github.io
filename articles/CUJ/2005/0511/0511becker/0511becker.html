<p>In the previous two columns, we looked at the new TR1 template class <b>shared_ptr</b>, which implements a reference-counted smart pointer. Code that traffics in objects of type <b>shared_ptr&lt;Ty&gt;</b> can be much simpler than similar code that uses ordinary pointers because the controlled resource will be released when the last of those objects is destroyed, without any explicit bookkeeping in the application. The code is also more robust, because the resource will not be released while there are any <b>shared_ptr</b> objects in existence that own the resource. Thus, using <b>shared_ptr</b> objects correctly guarantees that a resource will be released when it is no longer needed, but not before.</p>

<p>This rigid control of the lifetime of a resource is usually just what's needed. Sometimes, however, an application needs a pointer that doesn't affect the lifetime of the resource it points to. An ordinary pointer can do this, but not safely. There's no direct way to tell whether the resource that an ordinary pointer points to still exists, so mixing ordinary pointers with <b>shared_ptr</b> objects increases the risk that the application will try to use a resource that has been released. To reduce this risk, TR1 provides a complement to <b>shared_ptr</b> in the template class <b>weak_ptr</b>.</p>

<p>Sometimes member functions return a pointer or reference to the object that they were applied to, to support chaining of operations. If that object was reached through a <b>shared_ptr</b> object, the returned pointer or reference can be left dangling when the object itself is destroyed. There's no easy way to get from the <b>this</b> pointer of a resource back to the <b>shared_ptr</b> object that controls the resource, so the TR1 library provides a template class, <b>enable_shared_from_this</b>, to make it easier for a member function to return a <b>shared_ptr</b> object rather than the <b>this</b> pointer.</p>

<p>This month, we'll look at both of those templates. <a href="0511beckerl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> provides a synopsis of the relevant parts of the TR1 header <b>&lt;memory&gt;</b>.</p>
<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>We say that a <b>shared_ptr</b> object "owns" a resource if it was constructed with a pointer to that resource, if it was constructed from a <b>shared_ptr</b> object that owns that resource, if it was constructed from a <b>weak_ptr</b> object that points to that resource, or if ownership of that resource was assigned to it, with <b>operator=</b> or by calling either of its member functions <b>reset</b> or <b>swap</b>.</p>

<p>Further, a <b>weak_ptr</b> object "points to" a resource if it was constructed from a <b>shared_ptr</b> object that owns that resource, if it was constructed from a <b>weak_ptr</b> object that points to that resource, or if that resource was assigned to it with <b>operator=</b> or with <b>swap</b> [1].</p>

<p>An "empty <b>shared_ptr</b>" object does not own any resources. An "empty <b>weak_ptr</b>" object does not point to any resources.</p>

<p>A <b>weak_ptr</b> object has "expired" if the reference count for the resource that it points to is zero. This occurs when the <b>weak_ptr</b> object is empty, or if it's not empty, when the last <b>shared_ptr</b> object that owns the resource that the <b>weak_ptr</b> object points to has been destroyed [2].</p>
<h3>The Template Class weak_ptr</h3>

<p><a href="0511beckerl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a> is a synopsis of the template class <b>weak_ptr</b>. Most of its members require very little explanation. The default constructor constructs an empty <b>weak_ptr</b> object. The other constructors construct an object that points to the resource (if any) that their argument owns or points to. After an assignment, the <b>weak_ptr</b> object points to the resource (if any) that the object on the right-hand side of the assignment operator owns or points to. After a call to the member function <b>reset</b>, the <b>weak_ptr</b> object is empty. The member function <b>use_count</b> returns the number of <b>shared_ptr</b> objects that own the resource that <b>*this</b> points to [3].</p>
<h3>Using the  Controlled Resource</h3>

<p>You probably noticed that the template class <b>weak_ptr</b> doesn't have any member functions to get to the controlled resource. Instead, you have to create a <b>shared_ptr</b> object from the <b>weak_ptr</b> object and use the <b>shared_ptr</b> object to get to the resource. That generally simplifies code that needs to get to the controlled resource, because once you have a <b>shared_ptr</b> object, you don't have to worry about whether the <b>weak_ptr</b> object has expired.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get a <b>shared_ptr</b> object from a <b>weak_ptr</b> object. You can construct the <b>shared_ptr</b> object, passing the <b>weak_ptr</b> object as the constructor's argument, or you can call the member function <b>lock</b>. The main difference between the two is how they handle an attempt to create a <b>shared_ptr</b> object from a <b>weak_ptr</b> object that has expired.</p>

<p>The template class <b>shared_ptr&lt;Ty&gt;</b> has a template constructor that takes a reference to a <b>weak_ptr&lt;Other&gt;</b>. Just as with the <b>shared_ptr</b> constructors that we looked at before, this constructor is only valid if a pointer of type <b>Other*</b> is convertible to a pointer of type <b>Ty*</b>. The constructor throws an exception object of type <b>bad_weak_ptr</b> if the <b>weak_ptr</b> argument has expired. Otherwise, it constructs an object that owns the resource that the <b>weak_ptr</b> points to.</p>

<p>The member function <b>weak_ptr&lt;Ty&gt;::lock</b> returns a <b>shared_ptr&lt;Ty&gt;</b> object that owns the resource that the <b>weak_ptr</b> object points to. If the <b>weak_ptr</b> object has expired, it returns an empty <b>shared_ptr</b>. <a href="0511beckerl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a> shows the use of the constructor and this member function.</p>
<h3>Comparing  weak_ptr Objects</h3>

<p>We saw last time that you can compare <b>shared_ptr</b> objects for relative order using <b>operator&lt;</b>. You can do the same for <b>weak_ptr</b> objects. This makes it possible to use these types of pointer objects as the key type in an associative container. For example, <a href="0511beckerl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a> shows the use of <b>weak_ptr</b> objects to associate a string object with an object of an arbitrary type [4, 5]. The typedef <b>name_list</b> is a synonym for the type <b>map&lt;weak_ptr&lt;void&gt;, string&gt;</b>. The various <b>shared_ptr</b> types created in the <b>main</b> function are all converted to <b>weak_ptr&lt;void&gt;</b> when they are stored as keys in the map and when they are passed as arguments to the function <b>map::find</b>. Note that the call to <b>sp1.reset()</b> releases the resource that <b>sp1</b> manages. If the code had used a <b>shared_ptr</b> object as the key in the map instead of a <b>weak_ptr</b>, the <b>shared_ptr</b> object in the map would still hold the managed resource. (Try it.)</p>
<h3>Using  weak_ptr Objects</h3>

<p>Use <b>weak_ptr</b> objects whenever you need access to a resource through a pointer that can outlive the resource. With ordinary pointers, you can't tell if the resource that the pointer points to has been freed; with <b>weak_ptr</b> objects you can, using either of the member functions <b>expired()</b> or <b>lock()</b>, or by attempting to construct a <b>shared_ptr</b> object. (The first two support an in-channel test for failure; the third throws an exception if it fails). Listing 5 (available at http://www.cuj.com/ code/) shows a data cache that uses <b>weak_ptr</b> objects to provide fast access to data objects that are currently in use and to fall back on slower database lookup for objects that are not. The caching code is a little tricky, so if you write code like this, you have to think very carefully about the lifetime of the various objects. In particular, the code following the comment "Look up ID that's not in cache" should not be simplified. It's tempting to rewrite it as</p>

<pre>
    w = lookup(id_num);
    return prospect(w);

</pre>

<p>but that won't work. The <b>shared_ptr</b> object returned by <b>lookup</b> will be destroyed at the end of the statement, and since there are no other <b>shared_ptr</b> objects that own the new resource, the resource will be released. As written, the auto object <b>p</b> owns the resource. It won't be destroyed until after the return statement, at which point the returned object also owns the resource, so the resource won't be released.</p>
<h3>Getting shared_ptr Objects  In Member Functions</h3>

<p>In an earlier column, we saw that code like this won't work correctly:</p>

<pre>
int *ip = new int;
shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; sp1(ip);
shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; sp2(ip);

</pre>

<p>Neither of the two <b>shared_ptr</b> objects knows about the other, so both will try to release the resource when they are destroyed. That usually leads to problems. Similarly, if a member function needs a <b>shared_ptr</b> object that owns the object that it's being called on, it can't just create an object on the fly:</p>

<pre>
struct S
{
shared_ptr&lt;S&gt; dangerous()
  {
  return shared_ptr&lt;S&gt;(this);   // don't do this!
  }
};

int main()
{
shared_ptr&lt;S&gt; sp1(new S);
shared_ptr&lt;S&gt; sp2 = sp-&gt;dangerous();
return 0;
}

</pre>

<p>This code has the same problem as the earlier example, although in a more subtle form. When it is constructed, the <b>shared_ptr</b> object <b>sp1</b> owns the newly allocated resource. The code inside the member function <b>S::dangerous</b> doesn't know about that <b>shared_ptr</b> object, so the <b>shared_ptr</b> object that it returns is distinct from <b>sp1</b>. Copying the new <b>shared_ptr</b> object to <b>sp2</b> doesn't help; when <b>sp2</b> goes out of scope, it will release the resource, and when <b>sp1</b> goes out of scope, it will release the resource again.</p>

<p>The way to avoid this problem is to use the class template <b>enable_shared_from_this</b> [6]. The template takes one template type argument, which is the name of the class that defines the managed resource. That class must, in turn, be derived publicly from the template; like this:</p>

<pre>
struct S : enable_shared_from_this&lt;S&gt;
{
shared_ptr&lt;S&gt; dangerous()
  {
  return shared_from_this();
  }
};

int main()
{
shared_ptr&lt;S&gt; sp1(new S);
shared_ptr&lt;S&gt; sp2 = sp-&gt;dangerous();    // not dangerous

return 0;
}

</pre>

<p>The member function <b>S::dangerous</b> is no longer dangerous. When you do this, keep in mind that the object you call <b>shared_from_this</b> on must be owned by a <b>shared_ptr</b> object. This won't work:</p>

<pre>
int main()
{
S *p = new S;
shared_ptr&lt;S&gt; sp2 = p-&gt;dangerous();     // don't do this
}

</pre>

<p>Listing 6 (available at http://www.cuj.com/code/) has a synopsis of the template class <b>enable_shared_from_this</b>. The protected members provide ordinary construction and copy semantics, while preventing creation of standalone <b>enable_shared_from_this</b> objects. The two public member functions return <b>shared_ptr</b> objects with appropriate <b>const</b> qualifications [7].</p>
<h3>Next Time</h3>

<p>We're finished with additions to the header <b>&lt;memory&gt;</b>. Next time, we'll start looking at additions to the header <b>&lt;functional&gt;</b>, which consists of the template classes <b>reference_wrapper</b>, <b>mem_fn</b>, <b>function</b>, and <b>bind</b>. These templates can all act as wrappers around callable types, making them more uniform and easier to use.</p>
<h3>References</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The TR1 specification uses the term "shares ownership" when a <b>shared_ptr</b> object owns a resource and when a <b>weak_ptr</b> object points to a resource. I've always felt that owning something implies the ability to destroy it, so I prefer to use two terms rather than one when talking about these relationships.</li>
  <li>Thus, a <b>weak_ptr</b> object that does not point to a valid resource is said to have expired, regardless of whether the resource was invalid from the start, as is the case with an empty object, or the resource was released through the ordinary operation of <b>shared_ptr</b> objects that own the resource.</li>
  <li>This implies that <b>use_count</b> returns 0 when a <b>weak_ptr</b> object has expired.</li>
  <li>This code is based on an example by Peter Dimov, who did quite a bit of the work on the specification of <b>shared_ptr</b> and <b>weak_ptr</b>. For more examples, see http://www.boost.org/libs/smart_ptr/index.html.</li>
  <li>If this example leads you to consider using<b> map&lt;weak_ptr&lt;void&gt;, type_info*&gt;</b> as a way of recovering type information from a heterogeneous container, you should first ask yourself why you're throwing the type information away. If you don't throw it away, you don't need a way to figure out what it used to be.</li>
  <li>That's an annoyingly long name, but you won't have to use it very often.</li>
  <li>If you're interested, the template <b>enable_shared_from_this</b> holds a <b>weak_ptr</b> object that points to the derived object. There's a chicken-and-egg problem, though, about how to initialize that <b>weak_ptr</b> object when there is no corresponding <b>shared_ptr</b> object. The implementation trick is that the constructors for <b>shared_ptr</b> know about <b>enable_shared_from_this</b>, and set the <b>weak_ptr</b> object during construction of a <b>shared_ptr</b> object that owns a resource that has <b>enable_shared_from_this</b> as a public base class. </li></ol>
