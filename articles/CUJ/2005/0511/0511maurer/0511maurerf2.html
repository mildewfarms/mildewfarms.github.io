<h4>Figure 2: Definition of the IPC system call.</h4>



<pre>
IPC(To, FromSpecifier, Timeouts) 

Arguments:                   Returns:
----------------------       -------------
ThreadId To
ThreadId FromSpecifier   -&gt;  ThreadId From 
Word	 Timeouts


Argument Semantics:
---------------------
To == nilthread 
	-&gt; IPC includes no send phase

To != nilthread 
	-&gt; Destination thread and IPC includes a send phase	

FromSpecifier == nilthread 
	-&gt; IPC includes no receive phase

FromSpecifier == anythread 
	-&gt; Incoming messages are accepted from any thread or hardware interrupts and IPC includes a receive phase

FromSpecifier == anylocalthread 
	-&gt; Incoming messages are accepted from any thread in the current address space and IPC includes a receive phase

FromSpecifier != (nilthread OR anythread OR anylocalthread)
	-&gt; Incoming messages are only accepted from the specified thread and IPC includes a receive phase

Timeouts == RcvTimeout
	-&gt; Receive phase waits until either a message transfer starts or the RcvTimeout expires. Ignored for send-only IPC.

Timeouts == SndTimeout
	-&gt; If the send timeout expires before the message transfer could start then the IPC operation fails.

Return Semantics:
------------------
From &lt;- Thread ID of the sender. The delivered thread IDs are always local unless they identify a thread running in a 			different address space.
