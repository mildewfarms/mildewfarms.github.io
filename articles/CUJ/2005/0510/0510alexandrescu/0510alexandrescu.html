<a href="0510alexandrescus1.html" TARGET="_BLANK">Memory: Not Just Any Resource</a><br>


<hr>





<p>The main topic of this installment is resource management&#151;in particular, how you should approach it, what options C++ offers, in what ways memory is different from other resources, and how all that influences the way you approach your designs. We'll provide some code, too, but ideas, fundamentals, and principles are the main gist of today's discourse. This discussion was prompted by an e-mail exchange with Bartosz Milewski, C++er, Seattleite, and chef extraordinaire (I kid you not; Bartosz cooked the best meal I've ever eaten, and I've been places). We've had some divergence of opinions, and compared to arm wrestling, dueling in Pioneer Square at noon, or harassing one another until one of us develops an eating disorder&#151;well, writing an article together seemed to be the most attractive option. But first, we'll discuss an overflowing mailcontainer, and in particular the overdue comments from readers about policy-based Observer implementations [2, 3].</p>
<h3>Mailcontainer</h3>

<p>I'm sure many pop music authors would agree that you never know what people are going to like, but I was still surprised at the sheer amount of positive e-mails following "Generic&lt;Programming&gt;'s" treatment of typesafe formatting, a subject that, let's face it, falls in the "yet another" category. There was much heartwarming praise; with care and proper rationing, that could last me a lifetime. Many thanks to all who've taken the time to write&#151;such responses, and not money, are any author's most wanted reward (don't tell this to <i>CUJ</i> accounting though, lest they cut all author honorariums and hire an odist instead).</p>

<p>At the end of my policy-based Observer treatment, I asked people to send me more ideas and designs. Here they are. A word of warning, though: If you haven't read the pertinent articles [2, 3], then you may want to skip to the end of this section, because it will otherwise read like: "Boring. Boring. Boring boring. Incredibly boring. Can't believe I didn't turn the page yet. Boring boring boring." Randy Pitz writes:</p>

<blockquote>
We use a different Observer implementation that we have designed to provide typesafe events, where each event is a unique type containing nested types for typesafe callbacks.  The subjects derive from a template base using the curiously recurring template pattern, and declare <b>typedef</b>s for each event.<br>

<pre>
// A Subject
class Foo : public Subject&lt;Foo&gt; {
public:<br>
   typedef Event1&lt;1, int&gt; Event1;<br>
   typedef Event2&lt;2, string, int&gt; <br>
     Event2;<br>
   typedef Event1&lt;3, Foo*&gt; Event3;<br>
   typedef Event0&lt;4&gt; Event4; <br>
   void SendEvents() {<br>
     sendEvent(Event1(), 5000);<br>
     sendEvent(Event2(), name_, 33);<br>
     sendEvent(Event3(), this);<br>
     sendEvent(Event4());<br>
   }<br>
};
    Observers register, deregister, and receive updates in the following way:<br>
// An Observer
class Bar {
public:<br>
  Bar(Foo* foo) : foo_(foo) {<br>
    foo-&gt;register(Foo::Event1(), <br>
      this, &amp;Bar::OnEvent1);<br>
    foo-&gt;register(Foo::Event2(), <br>
      this, &amp;Bar::OnEvent2);<br>
    foo-&gt;register(Foo::Event3(), <br>
      this, &amp;Bar::OnEvent3);<br>
    foo-&gt;register(Foo::Event4(), <br>
      this, &amp;Bar::OnEvent4);<br>
  }<br>
<br>
  ~Bar() {<br>
    foo_-&gt;unregister(Foo::Event1(), <br>
      this, &amp;Bar::OnEvent1);<br>
    foo_-&gt;unregister(Foo::Event2(), <br>
      this, &amp;Bar::OnEvent2);<br>
    foo_-&gt;unregister(Foo::Event3(), <br>
      this, &amp;Bar::OnEvent3);<br>
    foo_-&gt;unregister(Foo::Event4(), <br>
      this, &amp;Bar::OnEvent4);<br>
  }<br>
<br>
  void OnEvent1(int n) {}<br>
  void OnEvent2(string s, int n) {}<br>
  void OnEvent3(Foo* f) {}<br>
  void OnEvent4() {}<br>
private:<br>
  Foo* foo_;<br>
};
<br>
    While not being totally satisfied with the implementation, it does provide for typesafe callbacks and implements removal through an obliteration technique similar to what you mention in the article. For removal, observers are replaced with null and sets a dirty flag, then after all updates complete, the subject checks the dirty flag and then updates the data structure. <br>

</blockquote>

</pre>

<p>It turns out I'm not that happy with the implementation, either. (If it helps, I've never been totally happy with my own implementations. Who is?) Registration during construction and unregistration during destruction are two sides of the same risky business: virtual calls that aren't really virtual. If a class <b>Baz</b> inherits <b>Bar</b>, the pointer-to-member expressions formed during <b>Bar</b>'s constructor will encode <b>Bar</b>'s implementations, not the overrides that <b>Baz</b> diligently planted. Result? <b>Bar</b>'s <b>OnEvent</b> functions will always be called. </p>

The idea of the solution is to take advantage of the fact that while we are iterating through the vector of observers, any change to this list comes from another friendly member function that can cooperate and help out our iteration:<br>

<pre>
class Subject {
  vector&lt;Observer*&gt; observers_;
  int iter_; // co-op index<br>
public:<br>
  void NotifyAll() {<br>
    iter_ = 0;<br>
    for(; iter_ &lt; observers_.size(); <br>
    ++iter_)<br>
      observers_[iter_]-&gt;Update();<br>
  }<br>
  void Detach(Observer* dead) {<br>
    size_t i = 0;<br>
    while (i &lt; observers_.size())<br>
      if (observers_[i] == dead) {<br>
        if (i &lt;= iter_) <br>
          &#151;iter_;<br>
        observers_.erase(<br>
          observers_.begin()+i);<br>
      }<br>
      else <br>
        ++i;<br>
  }<br>
  void Attach(Observer* add) { <br>
    /* like normal */ <br>
  }<br>
};

</blockquote>

</pre>



<p>But yours truly wrote in a previous column: "A solution that is solid as well as efficient is to store the iterator as a member in the <b>BareboneSubject</b> class, and then make sure that the <b>Attach</b> and <b>Detach</b> functions update it properly" [2]. The code above is an incarnation of that sketch. Thanks for writing, Luke. </p>

<p>Chad Parry caused me a deep depression that lasted, like, almost a minute, by writing:</p>

<blockquote>
I am kind of unsatisfied with the hierarchal policy idea that you proposed in <i>CUJ</i>. This idea looks like it would work better where the Chain of Command design pattern is needed. For example, the <b>ObserverID</b> could be implemented as a chain of brokerage policies or observer proxies. One policy could maintain a reference count to the actual observer object. Another policy could build on top of that to accumulate return values from the event handlers. I feel like the design you proposed has a "fatal flaw"&#151;the only interesting class is <b>BareboneSubject</b>. Subjects that are built on top of that have very limited ways in which they can modify the base subject's behavior. They can't even redefine the <b>ObserverID</b> type that is stored in the private vector. And trying to add policies to <b>BaseSubject</b> to solve this only resurrects the original problem, which is that various policy decisions are unorthogonal and so the policy implementations end up being tightly coupled.<br>

</blockquote>



<p>Indeed, a policy with only one interesting implementation is a clear sign of a failed attempt at policy-based design, and that's an astute point. However, I don't think that's the case with <b>BareboneSubject</b>; for one thing, the article discussed itself [3] presents <b>ClosedNotify</b> on top of any <b>Subject</b>-compliant class, including <b>BareboneSubject</b>, thus invalidating the claim. And then, <b>BareboneSubject</b> itself uses linear search and some quite particular design decisions, which I'm sure can be improved by designing another class inheriting <b>BaseSubject</b> that can spin off an entire subhierarchy. The claim that "they can't even redefine the <b>ObserverID</b> type that is stored in the private vector" is invalid as well; this is not dynamic polymorphism. You can inherit <b>BareboneSubject</b>, use its <b>ObserverID</b> internally, and define your own <b>ObserverID</b> to export to clients as you please. Don't forget, this is template-land where things are bound at compile time. Intuitively, the last claim "various policy decisions are unorthogonal" has some merit, otherwise the design would be perfect and I'd be entirely happy with it, which I said I wasn't. But such a claim must always be substantiated by presenting a more orthogonal design, otherwise we might conclude only that the problem is wicked. In a subsequent e-mail, Chad does send an idea based on hooks inserted before and after each event notification. That allows for quite an elegant implementation:</p>

<pre>
template&lt;typename Successor&gt;
struct ClosedNotify : public Successor
{
private:
  bool closed;
protected:
  ClosedNotify() :
    closed(false) {
  }
  using Successor::DefaultAdvice::Advice;
  void Advice(NotifyExecution, Aspects::Before) {
    if (closed)
      throw std::logic_error("Notify closed");
    closed = true;
  }
  void Advice(NotifyExecution, Aspects::After) {
    closed = false;
  }
  void Advice(AttachExecution, Aspects::Before) {
    if (closed)
      throw std::logic_error("Notify closed");
  }
  void Advice(DetachExecution, Aspects::Before) {
    if (closed)
      throw std::logic_error("Notify closed");
  }
  ~ClosedNotify() { }
};

</pre>

<p>That's a nice variant I believe; it allows more power at the cost of lifting some structure, which can be good if the structure is too imposing. AOP implemented "by hand" is more like the template method, and is not too bad if only done inside the library. Otherwise, it gets boring pretty soon.</p>

<p>Richard Bowey writes:</p>

<blockquote>
Thank you for Loki and the Observer articles; they are ace. I am investigating the idea of using a <b>Functor</b> as the observer callback rather than a call to a virtual <b>Update</b> method. [...] The client gains flexibility but needs to hold an ID for each call to <b>Attach</b> in order to detach.<br>
    The possibility of using a Functor eliminates the need for the client to derive from an <b>Observer</b> base class. However, the main problem I found was that <b>Functor</b> objects are not comparable. The solution I chose was to have the client supply a <b>FunctionID</b> as well as a <b>Function</b>. It would be possible to have the client supply a pointer to a functor. In a previous attempt, I made the subject generate the <b>FunctionID</b>. It would be possible for <b>Attach</b> to return the function ID in a <b>boost::optional&lt;FunctionID&gt;</b>; this could be used as a <b>bool</b>, but additionally could be used to get the <b>FunctionID</b>.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Good ideas. If anyone has a better solution for comparing functors, please send them in. Finally, Nigel Megitt sends (while describing a larger design that, alas, is proprietary so he'd have to kill me if I shared it) an interesting example where the unrecommended active observation could be useful:</p>

<blockquote>
One feature that I think is nice, though I suspect there are people who would feel the opposite, is that the same implementation can be (and has been) used for a <b>Visitor</b> pattern: The event can have attributes that can be modified by the observers registered against it. I used this to implement a "veto" system for working out whether it's okay to close a window in a GUI: Things that have an interest in preventing or knowing about impending closure register an action that may increment a veto counter. When the <b>Subject</b> has finished the notification, it checks the state of the message it fired and can, if necessary, avoid closing the window. <br>

</blockquote>


<h3>Resource-Management Fundamentals</h3>

<p>Don't get scared by "management." Borrowed from operating systems, the term "resource management" is (for the purposes of this article) the totality of tools and techniques dedicated to handling limited resources within a program: memory, file handles, mutexes, sockets, database connections, and so on. Bartosz and I got to talk quite a bit about resource-management techniques; Bartosz is in the same situation that many LISP and Smalltalk programmers are: He is in the possession of a very useful toolset, and is amazed and frustrated at how others fail to see its obvious merits and continue doing things the stone age way. In short, Bartosz's thesis is that a lot, practically nearly all, of resource management can be done with just scoped ownership [8]. Moreover, in Bartosz's experience, when used with discipline, <b>auto_ptr</b> (and an artifact written by Bartosz, <b>auto_vector</b>) would be good enough tactics to implement scoped ownership. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. What is scoped ownership, and what other resource ownership schemata would be out there?</p>

<p>At the first level of detail, we can distinguish between automatic and manual resource management. Automatic resource management is done under the covers without any required action from the programmer; manual resource management is pretty much everything else. Garbage collection is a notorious form of automatic memory management (HASH(0x80bc9c) [6] would be another). Traditionally, automatic management doesn't work well with scarce/time-sensitive resources because it tends to impose a "lazy" release schedule.</p>

<p>Within the manual resource-management realm, we identify:</p>



<p><b>Scoped ownership:</b> In essence, scopes own resources. Ownership can never be shared. Ownership can only be passed across scopes by manipulating the corresponding scoped objects. Because of that restriction, scoped ownership cannot express all ownership patterns. The poster boy of scoped management is <b>auto_ptr</b>.</p>

<p><b>Shared ownership:</b> Several objects own one resource cooperatively. Tracking owners is done semiautomatically through a number of means, notably smart pointers with reference counting. Reference counting is fully expressive, meaning that it can model any ownership pattern. Shared ownership exacts a cost in performance, and is unable to automatically collect cycles. Also, the increased expressiveness means less structure and more opportunity to make mistakes, so scoped management is preferable if it fits the bill. The up-and-coming poster boy of shared ownership is <b>tr1::shared_ptr</b>.</p>

<p><b>"By-attention" ownership:</b> The ownership patterns are not enforced in any way; the program relies on full-bore manual tracking of resources (such as pointers and sockets) using unstructured handles. The sole guarantee of correctness is provided by the programmer's relentless, tireless, and immensely scalable attention. Prayer, voodoo, and sheer luck have reportedly helped in select cases.</p>
<h3>Scoped Resource Management</h3>

<p>Now, if you stood in New York's Grand Central Station asking random people what they thought of the following code:</p>

<pre>
Foo * p = new Foo;

</pre>

<p>what do you think they'd say? Most experienced programmers we asked agreed that such code is unacceptable. They differed, however, in the ways they proposed to fix it. Some suggested using an <b>auto_ptr</b>:</p>

<pre>
std::auto_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; p(new Foo);

</pre>

<p>Others mentioned some flavor of smart pointer:</p>

<pre>
shared_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; p(new Foo);

</pre>



<p>What are the various ways these two could be used and what are the relative merits of each? Obviously, this is not a matter of contemplating one line of code, but a pervasive issue. Two things became clear though: <b>auto_ptr</b> is underused because it is considered tricky and suspicious; <b>shared_ptr</b> is underused because of performance worries. That unfortunately leaves too many cases where neither is used, which is the worst case of all because it takes you straight to "by-attention" resource management.</p>

<p>Searching your code for occurrences of the keyword <b>delete</b> is a good way to check your program's resource-management patterns. If you need more than the fingers of one hand to count your <b>delete</b>s, that's a sign that you're relying on "by-attention" ownership too much. The foolproof way to make sure that a heap object is <b>delete</b>d is to make sure it is properly owned by a dedicated class such as a smart pointer or a smart container. Such classes are generic, hence they drastically reduce the total number of calls to <b>delete</b>. Because objects might hold all other kinds of resources and dispose of them in their destructors, looking for <b>delete</b> actually gives a good indication about the way a program manages not only memory, but resources in general.</p>

<p>As the sidebar "Memory: Not Just Any Resource" mentions, a possible path towards improving resource management is to limit expressiveness. For example, if you commit to holding the resource within a well-defined scope, simple automatic variables will work out of the box. If you want to pass ownership of a resource across scopes, such as returning a resource from a function, <b>auto_ptr</b> is there to help. Passing ownership is a possible grace to a complicated hack known as the Colvin-Gibbons trick [1]. However, that hack opens a big semantic hole, which newly proposed language changes promise to close satisfactorily. But all that deserves its own section.</p>
<h3>auto_ptr is Dead, Long Live unique_ptr?</h3>

<p>What looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and chops your leg off in one bite? A polyglot alligator in disguise, of course. A class that implements surprising semantics with familiar syntax is just as vicious. Take <b>auto_ptr</b>, for example. All objects in the C++ Standard Library (and most other libraries) that allow copying and assignment, implement them to mean, well, copy and assign. More so, of all user-defined functions ever, there is exactly <i>one</i> function that the compiler assumes what it's going to do, and that is the copy constructor. Paragraph 15 of section 12.8 of the C++ Standard says:</p>

<blockquote>
Whenever a temporary class object is copied using a copy constructor, and this object and the copy have the same cv-unqualified type, an implementation is permitted to treat the original and the copy as two different ways of referring to the same object and not perform a copy at all, even if the class copy constructor or destructor have side effects [...]<br>

</blockquote>



<p>Although <b>auto_ptr</b> follows the letter of the Standard (it supports copy elision), many people feel that it breaks its spirit. Indeed, after <b>auto_ptr</b> copy construction or assignment, the original and the copy are not identical&#151;the source is wiped away:</p>

<pre>
auto_ptr&lt;T&gt; p1(new T);
auto_ptr&lt;T&gt; p2(p1); // nullifies p1
auto_ptr&lt;T&gt; p3;     
p3 = p2;            // nullifies p2

</pre>

<p>With discipline and attention, such surprises can be avoided, although automatically generated copy constructors all too eagerly implement surprising semantics if you hold <b>auto_ptr</b> member variables. Anyway, in an ideal world, <b>auto_ptr</b>'s semantics would be to supress the dangerous sequence "move <b>p1</b> to <b>p2</b>; access <b>p1</b> and be surprised that it's null" while, at the same time, allowing the well-behaved sequence "move <b>p1</b> to <b>p2</b>; prove that <b>p1</b> is not used anymore," which is at the same time safe, efficient, and useful. The latter sequence is a must for passing around <b>auto_ptr</b> temporaries and in particular for returning <b>auto_ptr</b>s from functions. And that's an essential feature; without it, <b>auto_ptr</b> would have no advantage over straight automatic variables (other than saving stack space, which is semantically uninteresting).</p>

<p>There are two important cases of last use of a value: (1) the value is an rvalue, that is, an unnamed temporary resulting from evaluating some expression, and (2) the value is a stack-allocated lvalue that's being <b>return</b>ed or <b>throw</b>n. In both cases, the value is a "goner"&#151;in the first case, it will be destroyed at the end of the full expression, and in the second case, it will be destroyed as a consequence of execution flow exiting that value's scope. So it would be great if <b>auto_ptr</b>'s implementation could allow these cases and disallow compilation of all others. Good news&#151;this is exactly what standardization proposal N1377 [4] allows. Actually, N1377 focuses on detecting rvalues, and allows case (2) as a distinguished rule. We believe N1377 is the most speed-enhancing of all changes to the upcoming C++0x Standard because it allows user-controlled optimization of temporary objects, a long-standing sore topic for the C++ community. </p>

<p>Because changing <b>auto_ptr</b>'s semantics would break existing code, proposal N1771 [5] asks that the upcoming Standard deprecates <b>auto_ptr</b> and introduces a new class, <b>unique_ptr</b>. Here's <b>unique_ptr</b> in action:</p>

<pre>
// This code might compile in a future far, far away
unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; Fou() {
  unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; p1(new T);
  // wouldn't compile
  //unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; p2(p1); 
  unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; p3;     
  // wouldn't compile
  //p3 = p2;
  // performs an explicit move
  p3 = std::move(p1);            
  return p3;
}

</pre>

<p>(In the future, short code samples will use <b>Fou</b> and <b>Barre</b>, not <b>Foo</b> and <b>Bar</b>. French influence.) <b>unique_ptr</b> does offer the full functionality of <b>auto_ptr</b>, but this time done the right way: Unsafe ownership transfer can't be done with copy syntax and requires a call to the would-be standard function <b>std::move</b>.</p>
<h3>Resources in Containers</h3>

<p>It is pretty well known that one cannot instantiate standard containers with <b>auto_ptr</b>s, while those containers gladly accomodate <b>shared_ptr</b>s. What might be news to some is that proposal N1771 allows containers of <b>unique_ptr</b> with well-defined and useful semantics. But why wouldn't you simply use containers of <b>shared_ptr</b>s everywhere? Because a shared pointer is never as fast as <b>auto_ptr</b> (or the possibly upcoming <b>unique_ptr</b>, for that matter). Bartosz's measurements show that <b>std::sort</b> can be twice as slow due to smart pointers' overhead alone. So it does make sense to consider scoped resource management when your design allows it and when you care for efficiency.</p>

<p>Since you can't store <b>auto_ptr</b>s in standard containers and <b>unique_ptr</b> still has a few years to become ubiquitous, Bartosz designed his own container, the <b>auto_vector</b>, which accepts and dispenses resources in the form of <b>auto_ptr</b>s. Internally, <b>auto_vector</b> stores pointers inside a standard vector of pointers. When <b>auto_vector</b> is destroyed, it destroys all the pointers it owns. The <b>auto_vector&lt;T&gt;::push</b> method takes an <b>auto_ptr</b> by value and takes over the ownership of a resource from it. Interestingly, the <b>auto_vector&lt;T&gt;::pop_back</b> method returns an <b>auto_ptr</b>, too. The latter method deviates a bit from the standard style (normally, <b>pop_back</b> doesn't return anything), but it makes sense in the context of resource ownership.</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
class auto_vector {
  ...
public:
  void push_back(auto_ptr&lt;T&gt; p);
  auto_ptr&lt;T&gt; pop_back();
};

</pre>

<p>This kind of interface guarantees that the client of <b>auto_vector</b> is forced into the resource-management state of mind. For instance, you would have to prepare the argument for <b>auto_vector&lt;T&gt;::push_back</b> in the form of an <b>auto_ptr</b>, and receive the result of <b>auto_vector&lt;T&gt;::pop_back</b> into another <b>auto_ptr</b>. No chance for leaking the resource there. The best part of <b>auto_vector</b> is that it can be used with standard algorithms&#151;such as <b>std::sort</b>&#151;exactly the same way as <b>std::vector&lt;shared_ptr&lt;T&gt; &gt;</b>.</p>

<p>So why is <b>shared_ptr</b> so much slower than <b>auto_ptr</b>? The reasons are well known:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most shared pointers must allocate an extra counter on the heap when first created.</li>
  <li>Copying and swapping shared pointers involves extra operations.</li>
  <li>On today's architectures (fast processor and deep, slow memory hierarchy), larger is slower. The sheer increase in size of a shared pointer container means more pressure of the memory hierarchy, which translates into slower execution [7]. A large vector of <b>shared_ptr</b>s will reach the physical memory limit and start thrashing the disk sooner than <b>auto_vector</b>. This is something worth keeping in mind when your program is to operate on very large data sets. </li>
</ul>



<p>In many cases, however, being concerned with performance makes little sense. That's why it's fine to stick to <b>shared_ptr</b>s for common resource-management tasks. It's good to know, however, that if push comes to shove, there are options for speeding up your program. Besides, paradoxically, because <b>auto_ptr</b>, <b>unique_ptr</b>, and <b>auto_vector</b> offer a more rigid framework, they force you to better understand and enforce your application's ownership patterns. That's why we think scoped resource management is definitely here to stay. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Resource management is an important part of any application. Figuring out your program's resource ownership patterns is an important activity that gives you insight into how you can organize your design, as well as what tools you need to use to enforce those patterns. Scoped ownership is simple, rigid, and efficient. Shared ownership is fully flexible, but at a cost in efficiency. Scoped management of collections of objects can be optimized by using "auto" containers, of which <b>auto_vector</b> is an example. The future does provide hope of availing our "perfect" scoped pointers that work with all standard containers; until then, use existing resource-management techiques judiciously.
