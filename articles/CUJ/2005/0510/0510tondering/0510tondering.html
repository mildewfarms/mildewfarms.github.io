<p>Have you every wished that writing TCP client or server code could be as simple as writing to the console? Or needed multiple simultaneous I/O operations when using standard C++ I/O streams? In this article, I show how you can use C++ I/O streams to read and write TCP sockets, and how asynchronous input/output can be built on top of the I/O stream mechanism of C++. In the process, I examine DTILIB [1, 2], a platform-independent C++ library developed at the Danish Technological Institute. DTILIB also provides an I/O streams interface to compressed files, serial lines, and TCP sockets, plus a means for handling asynchronous I/O on top of C++ I/O streams.</p>

<p>In the C++ Standard Library, the I/O streams mechanism is found in the <b>std</b> namespace. I/O streams were originally designed to provide input/output to terminals and files. Most C++ programmers are familiar with the <b>cin</b> and <b>cout</b> streams that provide access to the console. Data can be read from and written to the console by applying the operators <b>&gt;&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;&lt;</b> to these streams. Thus:</p>

<pre>
int i;
std::cin &gt;&gt; i;
std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; " times 2 is "
          &lt;&lt; i*2 &lt;&lt; std::endl;

</pre>

<p>reads an integer from the console and writes the integer and two times its value back to the console. The final <b>std::endl</b> outputs a newline and forces the content of the output buffer to be written to the terminal. A similar construct can be used to read and write files.</p>

<p>The <b>stringstream</b> class moves the I/O streams mechanism beyond mere file and terminal I/O. It provides a means to read and write to a string.</p>

<p>The I/O streams mechanism provides a large collection of methods beyond the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;&lt;</b> operators. Member functions such as <b>getline</b> and <b>put</b> provide additional ways to manipulate I/O streams. Here, I focus on how the I/O streams mechanism can be applied to TCP sockets, and the addition of asynchronous I/O to the streams.</p>
<h3>A Sockets Class Library</h3>

<p>Sockets originated in the BSD version of UNIX. Today, sockets APIs are found in virtually all versions of UNIX and Linux. Under Windows, the Winsock library provides almost identical functionality. Using the sockets API, programs can establish network connections using a number of different transport protocols, including (but not limited to) TCP and UDP. </p>

<p>Sockets APIs are available in different programming languages, but the defining language has always been C. There is, however, a need for a set of C++ classes that provide an interface to the sockets mechanism. Several sockets class libraries exist, but most are thin wrappers around the underlying C library functions. In contrast, the DTILIB classes provide a considerable collection of methods. Currently, DTILIB only supports TCP sockets, but this should be adequate for most uses. The classes all reside in a <b>dti::sockets</b> namespace.</p>

<p><a href="0510tonderingl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>(a) illustrates a character-based TCP client. The <b>tcp_client_socket</b> class represents a TCP socket that is capable of establishing a connection. It is a subclass of <b>tcp_socket</b>, which provides I/O functions that operate over an already established connection. <a href="0510tonderingl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>(a) illustrates how a <b>tcp_client_socket</b> may be constructed. Its constructor has a single argument, which is an object of class <b>endpoint</b>. An <b>endpoint</b> represents an IP address and a TCP port number. The IP address may be specified as a host name. Thus, <b>endpoint("abc.def.com",123)</b> represents TCP port 123 at the host <b>abc.def.com</b>. The construction of the <b>tcp_client_socket</b> object not only creates the object, it also establishes a TCP connection to the IP address and port number specified in the constructor.</p>

<p>Having done this, the client merely copies to <b>cout</b> everything it receives over the TCP connection. The <b>recv</b> method (or, rather, one of the <b>recv</b> methods) takes a string as its argument. It then reads data from the connection and stores that data in the string. The method returns -1 when the peer closes the connection.</p>

<p>The process of establishing a connection may, of course, fail. This is indicated through an exception. However, to make the examples easier to read, I've omitted exception handling. A corresponding server and data provider can look like <a href="0510tonderingl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>(b).</p>

<p>The <b>tcp_listener</b> class represents a TCP socket that listens for an incoming connection. In <a href="0510tonderingl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>, a listener is created based simply on the TCP port number 123. Alternatively, a listener can be created based on an <b>endpoint</b> object if the server has more than one network adapter and is required to listen only on a single IP address.</p>

<p>The <b>accept</b> method applied to a <b>tcp_listener</b> accepts incoming connections and returns a <b>tcp_socket</b> object that can be used for further communication. The example code uses the <b>send</b> method to send strings to the client.</p>

<p>When people first learn about C-based sockets, they are often frustrated by the seemingly tedious set of operations that go into setting up a server: First, a socket is created, then a port is bound to the socket, next the socket is placed in the "listening" mode, and finally, incoming connections are accepted. In DTILIB, this is reduced to the simple process illustrated by the first two lines in <a href="0510tonderingl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>(b). </p>

<p>Programmers who still want to go through the phases of binding, listening, and accepting are free to do so. DTILIB does provide these functions as well.</p>

<p>To be more efficient, most server applications would, of course, start a separate thread to handle the actual input/output while the main thread reverts to listening for more incoming connections.</p>
<h3>Enter I/O Streams</h3>

<p>DTILIB includes classes that let you use the C++ I/O streams mechanism on top of the TCP sockets class library. The basic class here is the <b>tcpstream</b> object. This object is a subclass of the <b>iostream</b> class found in the Standard Library. As such, all the standard methods defined for an <b>iostream</b> are also available on a <b>tcpstream</b>.</p>

<p>One of the advantages achieved by using a <b>tcpstream</b> is that you are relieved of the burden of buffering input. A TCP connection is a bytestream, and if the application wants to read records or lines of data, it is the programmer's duty to provide appropriate buffering and record splitting on input. For a line-oriented protocol, DTILIB does all this for you.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <b>tcpstream</b> provides all the advantages of having formatted I/O. A <b>tcpstream</b> object is constructed from a <b>tcp_socket</b> object. The <b>tcp_socket</b> object can either be a <b>tcp_client_object</b> explicitly created in a client, or it can be the object returned from a call of the <b>accept</b> method on a <b>tcp_listener</b> object in a server.</p>

<p>Once a <b>tcpstream</b> object has been created, it is extremely easy to use. The server code in <a href="0510tonderingl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> becomes <a href="0510tonderingl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>(a), where the return value of the <b>accept</b> method is used as argument for the constructor of a <b>tcpstream</b> object. On the client side, you can, for example, use the <b>getline</b> method to read each line of text from the connection, as in <a href="0510tonderingl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>(b). But, of course, the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> operator can also be used.</p>

<p>Although I/O streams can be used for both binary and character-based data, they are most convenient for character-based I/O. As many TCP-based protocols, such as HTTP and SMTP, are character based, <b>tcpstream</b> objects are useful in many applications.</p>
<h3>Asynchronous I/O</h3>

<p>In serious network applications, there is almost always a need to handle several sockets simultaneously. For instance, a proxy server may need to forward all data arriving from a client to a server, and vice versa; the problem is that the proxy does not know who is going to transmit next&#151;the client or the server.</p>

<p>In standard sockets, this problem is solved through a function called <b>select</b>, which lets you monitor the state of several sockets simultaneously. You can, for example, use <b>select</b> to wait for input on one of several sockets. This is a useful mechanism, but it is not easy to apply to an I/O stream. The I/O streams of the Standard Library are inherently synchronous: The program requests input on a single stream, then sleeps until the input is available.</p>

<p>DTILIB provides a mechanism that lets an application have several simultaneous operations on I/O streams. And the syntax is similar to the well-known streams syntax. This mechanism for asynchronous I/O can be used on all C++ I/O streams, not just the TCP streams described so far. </p>

<p>The asynchronous I/O mechanism uses a class called <b>astream</b>, which represents a collection of I/O operations to be executed concurrently. For example, assume you want to simultaneously read from the file hi.txt and from the console input, <b>cin</b>. First, you create an <b>astream</b> object using <a href="0510tonderingl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>(a). The <b>astream</b> class resides in the <b>dti::async</b> namespace, and its constructor takes no arguments. Next, you add I/O operations to the object, using a syntax similar to the one used on I/O streams; see <a href="0510tonderingl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>(b). The first line opens the file hi.txt and associates the I/O stream <b>fio</b> with it. The two final lines state our intention to read two integers, <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, from the console, and an integer and a double, <b>c</b> and <b>d</b>, from the file. Compare this to the normal input operations in <a href="0510tonderingl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>(c). The similarity in syntax is obvious.</p>

<p>However, when the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> operator is applied to an <b>astream</b>, the actual input operation does not take place immediately. Instead, the <b>astream</b> merely notes which variables are to be read from which input streams.</p>

<p>The actual input operations are started when the method <b>start</b> is called on the <b>astream</b> object:</p>

<pre>
ast.start();

</pre>

<p>At this point, several threads are started, one for each input stream. One thread reads two integers from the console and stores them in <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, another thread reads an integer and a double from <b>fio</b> and stores them in <b>c</b> and <b>d</b>.</p>

<p>You can wait for one of the operations to finish by calling the <b>wait</b> method, which returns a pointer to the I/O stream whose operation was completed; see <a href="0510tonderingl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>. A call to the <b>start</b> method is frequently not required, as all pending I/O requests are started when <b>wait</b> is called.</p>

<p>The <b>&gt;&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;&lt;</b> operators are not the only ones that can be used on <b>astream</b> objects. Just as, for example, the <b>getline</b> method can be used on a normal input stream:</p>

<pre>
std::cin.getline(buf)

</pre>

<p>it can also be used on an <b>astream</b>, thusly:</p>

<pre>
ast(std::cin).getline(buf);

</pre>

<p>This queues a request to call the <b>getline</b> method on <b>std::cin</b> in parallel to operations on the other I/O streams handled by <b>ast</b>.</p>
<h3>The Innards of an astream</h3>

<p><a href="0510tonderingf1.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 1</a> is a UML class diagram showing classes related to asynchronous I/O operation. When you write, say, <b>ast(fio)</b>, where <b>ast</b> is an <b>astream</b> and <b>fio</b> is an I/O stream, the <b>()</b> operator is being applied to <b>ast</b>. This operator generates a so-called <b>io_operation</b> object, which is responsible for handling a single input or output stream. If more operations are requested on the same stream, the same <b>io_operation</b> object is reused. This may seem strange at first, but remember that although we want the streams to be serviced in parallel, each individual operation on a single stream has to be performed sequentially. If you write:</p>

<pre>
ast(fio) &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b;

</pre>

<p>we want <b>a</b> to be read before <b>b</b>. This is obvious when <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are mentioned on the same line, but, of course, you want the same thing to happen if you write this code:</p>

<pre>
ast(fio) &gt;&gt; a;
ast(fio) &gt;&gt; b;

</pre>

<p>Therefore, the second <b>ast(fio)</b> must return the same <b>io_operation</b> as the first one.</p>

<p>So, associated with each astream, you have a collection of io_operation objects, one for each underlying stream; these io_operations will be serviced in parallel. Associated with each <b>io_operation is a collection of individual I/O requests that will be serviced sequentially.</b></p>

<p>Because TCP streams are full duplex streams, it makes sense to send simultaneous input/output requests to a TCP stream. So, if <b>ts</b> is a <b>tcpstream</b> object, and you write:</p>

<pre>
ast(ts) &gt;&gt; a;
ast(ts) &lt;&lt; b;

</pre>

<p>you obviously want the two operations to be executed in parallel. You therefore need each <b>io_operation</b> object to handle not one, but two collections of pending I/O requests&#151;one for input and one for output.</p>

<p>All <b>io_operation</b> objects are subclassed from the <b>super_io_operation</b> class. This class contains a single important member:</p>

<pre>
half_io hio[2];

</pre>

<p>which contains two <b>half_io</b> objects&#151;one for input and one for output. A <b>half_io</b> object is responsible for maintaining the list of data that are to be read or written to the I/O stream. </p>

<p>Again, all <b>io_operation</b> objects are subclassed from the <b>super_io_operation</b> class. The <b>io_operation</b> class is a template class. The template parameter is the type of the underlying I/O stream; see <a href="0510tonderingl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>(a). The <b>io_operation</b> class has a number of methods, one for each "slow" operation that can be performed on an I/O stream. A "slow" operation is an operation that may potentially block because it is accessing a physical device. Examples of slow operations are the <b>get/put</b> methods and the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;&lt;</b> operators.</p>

<p>To understand what happens here, follow the flow of a <b>getline</b> method call through the system, as in <a href="0510tonderingf2.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 2</a>. In the code:</p>

<pre>
char buf[100];
ast(fio).getline(buf, sizeof buf);

</pre>

<p><b>fio</b> is an <b>fstream</b> and <b>ast</b> an <b>astream</b>. The call <b>ast(fio)</b> generates (or reuses) an <b>io_operation&lt;fstream&gt;</b> object based on <b>fio</b>. The <b>getline</b> method is then applied to this <b>io_operation</b> object. That method is defined in <a href="0510tonderingl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>(b).</p>

<p>Remember that the <b>hio</b> array represents the input and outputs half of pending I/O operations. First, the code checks that input is not already active on the stream. It will not allow the programmer to add I/O requests to a stream after <b>start</b> has been called; otherwise, you may run into serious race conditions. This is done by calling the <b>test_running</b> method, which throws an exception if the stream is currently doing input.</p>

<p>Then, the code adds the actual I/O request (that is, the request to call <b>getline</b>) to the collection of I/O requests that <b>hio[input]</b> services. This is done by creating an object of class <b>getline1_target</b> and adding it to a vector on the <b>half_io</b> object.</p>

<p>The <b>getline1_target</b> object represents the <b>getline</b> method when it is called with two arguments. There is another variant of <b>getline</b> that takes three arguments; its corresponding I/O request is an object of class <b>getline2_target</b>.<b></b></p>

<p>If instead of calling <b>getline</b>, the programmer had used the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> operator, the corresponding member function of <b>io_operation</b> would be like that in <a href="0510tonderingl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>(c). Note that the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> operator is a template function, its template parameter being the type of the right-hand side of <b>&gt;&gt;</b>. Other than that, the method is similar to the <b>getline</b> method. Here, the code creates an object of class <b>input_target</b>, which also carries the data type of the right side of <b>&gt;&gt;.</b></p>

<p>Now the <b>vec</b> vector of the input <b>half_io</b> contains a collection of I/O requests. Each of these requests (<b>getline1_target</b>, <b>input_target</b>, and so on) are subclasses of an abstract class <b>iotarget</b>, which has a single virtual method, <b>invoke</b>. The implementation of this method in each of the subclasses contains the code that performs the actual input or output. For example, the <b>invoke</b> method in <b>getline1_target</b> looks like <a href="0510tonderingl6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a>(a), where <b>str</b>, <b>cp</b>, and <b>siz</b> represent the actual I/O stream, buffer address, and buffer size, respectively. Similarly, the <b>invoke</b> method in <b>input_target</b> looks like <a href="0510tonderingl6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a>(b), where <b>str</b> and <b>d</b> represent the actual I/O stream and address of the destination variable, respectively. <a href="0510tonderingl6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a>(c) is the full definition of <b>input_target</b>. Because <b>d</b> has the type of a pointer to the data type of the right side of the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> operator as it was applied to the <b>astream</b>, the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> operator in the <b>invoke</b> method is the appropriate input operator defined for the particular destination type.</p>

<p>Eventually, the programmer calls the <b>start</b> method on the <b>astream</b>. This creates a number of execution threads, one for each underlying I/O stream and direction (input or output). Each of these streams calls the <b>invoke</b> method in the associated I/O request collections, and this, in turn, performs the actual input or output.</p>

<p>If an exception occurs during the I/O operation, the thread notes this and an <b>async_error</b> exception is thrown when the programmer calls the <b>wait</b> method on the <b>astream</b>.</p>

<p>The template mechanism gracefully handles user-defined classes. If, for example, a programmer creates a class <b>T</b> and defines how the <b>&lt;&lt;</b> operator can output <b>T</b> objects to an output stream, the <b>&lt;&lt;</b> operator is automatically able to output <b>T</b> objects to an <b>astream</b> as well. Programmers thus need not adapt their class code to asynchronous streams.</p>
<h3>Aborting Asynchronous I/O Requests</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no simple way to abort an I/O operation. Operating systems normally do not provide a simple way to cancel a pending I/O operation.</p>

<p>However, if you are writing your own I/O stream, DTILIB provides you with a mechanism for adding an abort command. (Needless to say, the TCP socket streams here support command abortion.)</p>

<p>DTILIB includes an abstract class, <b>ios_abortable</b>, with a single virtual method, <b>abort</b>. If your I/O stream inherits from this class, you call an <b>abort</b> method on your <b>astream</b>, and it tries to abort all I/O operations that have not yet completed.If a pending I/O operation is not abortable, an exception is thrown. <a href="0510tonderingl7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a> aborts an I/O operation that does not complete within five seconds (<b>ts</b> is an I/O stream). If the input operation cannot be aborted, the final lines of code report the fact. </p>

<p>The call to the <b>wait</b> method that follows the abort call is required to clean up the dynamic objects created to handle the asynchronous operation.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The C++ I/O streams mechanism is useful for many things, not just file and console I/O. While working with DTILIB, we found the mechanism to be extremely versatile; and adding an asynchronous capability produced an extremely powerful tool for I/O streams, which has proven useful not just for TCP communication, but also for slow file operations. Instead of focusing on threads and other multitasking issues, you can focus on solving the domain problems, while leaving the burden of thread-awareness to the library developer. The mechanisms described here have been successfully used to develop a speech recognition system for Windows XP.</p>
