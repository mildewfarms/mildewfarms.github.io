<h3>64-Bit Mathematica</h3>

<p>Wolfram Research has announced Mathematica 5.2, the 64-bit multicore release and the latest version of the science and technology software system Mathematica. Version 5.2 brings 64-bit technology to all supported platforms. More than 4.3 GB of memory (the 32-bit address limit) can now be addressed, and high-precision or large numbers are processed in 64-bit rather than 32-bit digit chunks for faster computation. It also supports automatically threaded numerical linear algebra on all mainstream platforms, enabling linear algebra operations to automatically run in parallel on all available processor cores whether multiple or multicore CPUs.
