<p>Last month, we began talking about the new TR1 template class <b>shared_ptr</b>. This month we'll continue that discussion, and next month we'll finish it off with an examination of the two template classes <b>weak_ptr</b> and <b>enable_shared_from_this</b>. As a reminder, <a href="0510beckerl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> provides a synopsis of the relevant parts of the header <b>&lt;memory&gt;</b>, and <a href="0510beckerl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a> provides a synopsis of the template class <b>shared_ptr</b>.</p>
<h3>Using the  Controlled Resource</h3>

<p>Once you've created a <b>shared_ptr</b> object, you use the controlled resource in pretty much the way you'd expect. Its member <b>operator-&gt;</b> returns a pointer to the controlled resource, so a <b>shared_ptr&lt;Ty&gt;</b> object acts pretty much like a pointer to <b>Ty</b>. The member function <b>get</b> also returns a pointer to the controlled resource. The member <b>operator*</b> returns a reference to the controlled resource; of course, this reference is only valid if the stored pointer is not null; see <a href="0510beckerl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>.</p>

<p>The member functions <b>unique</b> and <b>use_count</b> give you information about the number of <b>shared_ptr</b> objects that own the same resource. The function <b>unique</b> returns <b>true</b> only if the object that it was called with is the sole owner of the resource. The function <b>use_count</b> returns the number of owners. It is intended primarily for debugging.</p>

<p>You can also insert a <b>shared_ptr</b> object into a stream; when you do that, the effect is the same as inserting the pointer returned by <b>get</b>, as shown in <a href="0510beckerl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>.</p>

<p>The only mysterious-looking thing in <b>shared_ptr</b> is the <b>operator</b> <b>boolean-type</b>. That obviously illegal declaration is shorthand for an operator that returns an unspecified type that is convertible to <b>bool</b> when used in boolean contexts. The reason for this handwaving is that direct conversions to <b>bool</b> (or to any other built-in type) can cause confusion and ambiguity. So the requirement is that the returned type be convertible to <b>bool</b>, which makes code like <b>1 + ptr</b> illegal, but preserves the meaning of code like <b>if(ptr)</b>. This operator returns <b>false</b> if the <b>shared_ptr</b> object is empty; otherwise, it returns <b>true</b>; see <a href="0510beckerl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>.</p>
<h3>Pointer Types,  shared_ptr Types, and Conversions</h3>

<p>If you looked closely at the synopsis of <b>shared_ptr</b>, you may have noticed that its constructors and the <b>reset</b> member functions that take pointers are templates: They can take pointers to types that are different from the type argument of the <b>shared_ptr</b> object. Of course, that freedom isn't absolute. The rule is that the type of the pointer <b>Other* </b>that you pass as an argument has to be convertible to the type <b>Ty*</b> that the <b>shared_ptr&lt;Ty&gt;</b> holds[1]. Internally, the <b>shared_ptr</b> object keeps track of the actual type of the pointer that was passed to it, and when it's time to release the managed resource, it will treat it as an object of type <b>Other</b>, as shown in <a href="0510beckerl6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can construct a <b>shared_ptr &lt;Ty&gt;</b> object that's a copy of a <b>shared_ptr &lt;Other&gt;</b> object if <b>Other*</b> can be implicitly converted to <b>Ty*</b>. Thus, implicit conversions for <b>shared_ptr</b> types mimic the implicit conversions for pointer types. This mimicry extends to the new style casts, as well. Resist the temptation to write code like this:</p>

<pre>
// BAD CODE, DON'T DO THIS:
    shared_ptr&lt;base&gt; spb(new derived);
    shared_ptr&lt;derived&gt; spd(static_cast 	&lt;derived*&gt;(spb.get());

</pre>

<p>The problem is that you now have two independent <b>shared_ptr</b> objects trying to manage the same resource. Your program will do bad things when they both release it. Instead, use the cast functions <b>static_ pointer_cast</b>, <b>dynamic_pointer_cast</b>, and <b>const_pointer_cast</b> that are defined in <b>&lt;memory&gt;</b>, as shown in <a href="0510beckerl7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a>.</p>
<h3>Deleters</h3>

<p>The <b>shared_ptr</b> destructor deletes the stored pointer. If that's not what you need, you can provide a deleter at the time you create the original <b>shared_ptr</b> object. The deleter must be a callable object that can be called with the argument passed to the constructor. When it's time to release the resource, the deleter is called with the original object pointer, as in <a href="0510beckerl8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a>.</p>

<p><a href="0510beckerl8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a> also shows the template function <b>get_deleter</b>. You provide the template function's first type argument explicitly. If the <b>shared_ptr</b> object has a deleter of that type, the function returns a pointer to the deleter; if it doesn't have a deleter or if the deleter is a different type, it returns a null pointer.</p>
<h3>Comparing  shared_ptr Objects</h3>

<p>You can compare two <b>shared_tr&lt;Ty&gt;</b> objects for equality in the usual way. Two such objects <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are equal if <b>a.get() == b.get()</b>. <a href="0510beckerl9.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 9</a> shows comparisons for equality and inequality. You can also compare two <b>shared_ptr&lt;Ty&gt;</b> objects for relative order with <b>operator&lt;</b>. This lets you use <b>shared_ptr</b> objects as keys in associative containers, as shown in <a href="0510beckerl10.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 10</a>.</p>

<p>These comparison operators have a small quirk: Two <b>shared_ptr</b> objects that hold null pointers compare equal, but it's also possible that one is less than the other. That's because <b>a &lt; b</b> and <b>b &lt; a</b> are both required to be true only if <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> own the same resource or if they are both empty. As we saw last month, you create an empty <b>shared_ptr</b> object with the default constructor. Passing a null pointer to the constructor does not create an empty object, so one of the ordering comparisons must be false for a pair of objects constructed from null pointers. To see how this quirk arises in practice, take a look at <a href="0510beckerl11.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 11</a>.</p>
<h3>Exception Safety</h3>

<p>Under the hood, when you create the first <b>shared_ptr</b> object that manages a particular resource, the implementation allocates a control block that holds the original pointer, the reference count [2], and a copy of the deleter, if there is one. If that allocation fails, the implementation releases the resource, just as if the reference count had gone to zero, and rethrows the exception caused by the initial allocation failure. This prevents memory leaks; this is shown in <a href="0510beckerl12.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 12</a>.</p>
<h3>Next Time</h3>

<p>Next time we'll look at the template class <b>weak_ptr</b>, which holds a reference count that doesn't affect releasing of the controlled resource. That may not sound very useful, but there are good reasons for having it. We'll also look at the template class <b>enable_shared_from_this</b>, which enhances a derived type with a member function that returns a <b>shared_ptr</b> object that owns the derived object.</p>
<h3>References</h3>

<ol>
  <li>[1]	In general, this implies that the type <b>Other</b> must be complete, otherwise the compiler would not know that <b>Other*</b> is convertible to <b>Ty*</b>. However, if the type <b>Ty</b> is <b>void</b> (that is, you've created an object of type <b>shared_ptr&lt;void&gt;</b>) the conversion can be done even if <b>Other</b> is not a complete type. That's not allowed, however: TR1 requires that <b>Other</b> be a complete type if you're going to rely on this conversion.</li>
  <li>[2]	Actually, there are two reference counts: one for the <b>shared_ptr</b> objects and one for the <b>weak_ptr</b> objects; we'll look at the template <b>weak_ptr</b> next time. </li></ol>
