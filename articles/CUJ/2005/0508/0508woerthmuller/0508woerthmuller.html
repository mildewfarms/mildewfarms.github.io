<p>As every experienced C/C++ programmer knows, using printf can lead to a program crash by using "%s" and supplying an argument different from a NULL-terminated C-string (or even no argument). For example, executing:</p>

<pre>
printf("%s");
might print garbage or raise an access violation, depending on what values are on the stack. Using "%s" in general opens opportunities for exploitation when output is not limited to the size of the target buffer.

</pre>

<p>This is bad and anachronistic in times of STL, <b>std::string</b>, and typesafe programming, leading project managers to ban C strings and <b>printf</b> altogether. Then there is C++'s <b>iostream</b>s, which was meant to be <b>printf</b>'s successor on C++. However, it has drawbacks of its own [1].</p>

<p>With this in mind, I present in this article <b>StringPrintf</b>, a typesafe version of the <b>printf</b> function family. <b>StringPrintf</b> can be used with <b>std::string</b> and with C strings. In addition, it can do everything that <b>sprintf</b> does and is compatible with all standard <b>printf</b> format strings. In fact, internally, it uses <b>snprintf</b> itself. The big difference is that it checks (and mostly ignores) the type character of the format string, choosing instead the type appropriate for the argument supplied. The type character is used for legal conversions (such as supplying an <b>int</b> for a <b>%c</b>) and compatibility. If the argument is missing, the part of the format string remains unchanged in the resulting string. </p>

<p>I implemented <b>StringPrintf</b> in multiple versions that can replace <b>printf</b>, <b>sprintf</b>, <b>snprintf</b>, and <b>fprintf</b>. Using a couple of <b>#defines</b> (supplied in StringPrintf.h, available at http://www.cuj.com/code/), <b>StringPrintf</b> can replace these calls in existing code. This resolves all program faults caused by format string mismatch and the arguments passed. When compiling in debug mode, <b>StringPrintf</b> prints warning messages for type mismatching, and missing or surplus arguments. However, it cannot resolve buffer overflows of C-strings (which is technically impossible). This can only be done either by replacing the existing calls to <b>sprintf</b> by adding an argument with the buffer length (such as calling <b>snprintf</b>), or by switching to <b>std::string</b>, which is fully supported. <b>std::string-s</b> can be passed instead of C strings as input parameters (using<b> %s</b>), as well as for the output buffer.</p>

<p><b>StringPrintf</b> is implemented using techniques most current C++ compilers support:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Supply different functions for different numbers of arguments (instead of using a variable argument list <b>vararg</b>, which is one main source of problems).</li>
  <li>Use unnamed temporary objects of a helper class <b>CPrintfArg</b> as arguments (see the sidebar entitled "Unnamed Temporary C++ Objects" for a brief description). This helper class keeps track of what type was supplied. It also enables the possibility to implement conversion functions for user-defined types.</li>
  <li>Check and/or ignore the type character part of the format string.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result is a <b>printf</b>-like function that is type and error safe. For instance, writing:</p>

<pre>
std::string s1;
StringPrintf(s1, "int = %d; float = 
	       %3.1f", -12, 3572.24);

</pre>

<p>results (exactly as using <b>sprintf</b>) in <b>s1</b> containing:</p>

<pre>
"int = -12; float = 3572.2"

</pre>

<p>Unlike with <b>sprintf</b> though, supplying incorrect or too few arguments does not do any harm to the program being executed, although the resulting string might not totally have the content expected.</p>

<p>Using wrong types, as for example:</p>

<pre>
StringPrintf(s1, "int = %s; float = %3f", 
		      3572.24, -12);

</pre>

<p>results in <b>s1</b> containing:</p>

<pre>
"int = 3572.247070; float = -12"

</pre>

<p>This is due to the fact that the data type of the arguments determines the conversion done, rather than the type character of the format string. <b>StringPrintf</b> can also handle missing arguments:</p>

<pre>
StringPrintf(s1, "int = %s; float = 
        %3d, %s, %d, %s", 3572.24, -12);

</pre>

<p>results in <b>s1</b> containing:</p>

<pre>
"int = 3572.247070; float = 
                    -12, %s, %d, %s"

</pre>

<p>This is done (in contrast to <b>printf</b>) not by using a <b>vararg</b> list, but instead by using separate implementations of <b>StringPrintf</b> for any different numbers of arguments. Consequently, existing format specifications are skipped if the corresponding argument is missing. See <a href="0508woerthmullerl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> for more examples.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>The implementation of <b>StringPrintf</b> is quite straightforward. I started by creating a small helper class named <b>CPrintfArg</b>, which can hold one value of any built-in data types. For every different data type, it has a constructor that copies the value (or holds a pointer to it, whatever is less expensive). Each constructor also keeps track of the type used (see <a href="0508woerthmullerl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>). </p>

<p>Having created <b>CPrintfArg</b>, it is possible to write a number of <b>StringPrintf</b> functions&#151;one for any number of arguments:</p>

<pre>
size_t StringPrintf(std::string &amp;out, 
 const std::string &amp;fmt, const CPrintfArg&amp;);
size_t StringPrintf(std::string &amp;out, 
 const std::string &amp;fmt, 
  const CPrintfArg&amp;, const CPrintfArg&amp;);

</pre>

<p>I provided 12 functions with up to 12 arguments. (Of course, it would be easy to implement functions with any number of parameters&#151;but a construction using modern template techniques might be a way to support any number of arguments generically; see Andrei Alexandrescu's <i>Modern C++ Design.</i>)</p>

<p>Having done this, you can write:</p>

<pre>
StringPrintf(s1, "Int = %d; Float = %3.1f", -12, 3572.24);

</pre>

<p>which is expanded by the compiler to: </p>

<pre>
StringPrintf(s1, "Int = %d; 
   Float = %3.1f", CPrintfArg(-12), 
 CPrintfArg(3572.24));   

</pre>

<p>The 12 <b>StringPrintf</b> functions are only wrappers for one background function <b>xStringPrintf</b> (see Listing 3 at http://www.cuj.com/code/), which does the work for any number of arguments supplied as an array of pointers to <b>CPrintfArg</b>. <b>xStringPrintf</b> scans the string for the starting character of all <b>printf</b> format strings: <b>"%"</b>. After searching its end, it passes the format string of one single value to the function <b>CPrintfArg::Out</b> of the according argument object, which does the conversion. The result is appended to the output string.</p>

<p><b>CPrintfArg::Out</b> itself uses <b>snprintf</b>, but it always uses the appropriate type specification for the <b>printf</b> format string. It checks the type character passed in the format string and leaves it unchanged if it matches the argument data type or when conversion is legal. Otherwise, it uses the type character that matches the data type of the argument supplied. Also, buffer overflows are prevented by using <b>snprintf</b> instead of <b>printf</b>. </p>

<p>I've tested the source code (see Listings 3 and 4 at http://www.cuj.com/code/) under both Windows (Visual C++ 6.0) and Linux (gcc 3.3). When the preprocessor symbol DEBUG is defined, <b>StringPrintf</b> generates warning messages if format strings do not match the arguments supplied. This is done by calling the function: </p>

<pre>
void StringPrintfErrorMessage(const string &amp;s).

</pre>

<p>It usually calls <b>cout &lt;&lt; s</b>. Compiling under Windows with <b>_CONSOLE</b> not defined displays a dialog box by calling the Win32 function <b>MessageBox</b>: <a href="0508woerthmullerf1.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 1</a> shows a warning message that results from passing a mismatched argument type. <a href="0508woerthmullerf2.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 2</a> results from passing too few arguments to a <b>StringPrintf</b> call.</p>
<h3>Using  User-Defined Types</h3>

<p>Because all <b>StringPrintf</b> functions use the same argument type, it is easy to declare custom conversions for user-defined types. All that's needed is a function that converts a user-defined object to an object of type <b>CPrintfArg</b>. Given a user-defined type <b>myUserClass</b> that should have a certain representation as a string, all you need is a member function <b>operator</b> <b>CPrintfArg()</b> (see Listings 5 and 6 at http://www.cuj.com/code/). </p>

<p>The object <b>User1</b> is converted by the compiler to a temporary object of type <b>CPrintfArg</b> by calling the class function operator <b>CPrintfArg()</b>, which returns an object that contains a string. Because the object returned by operator <b>CPrintfArg()</b> must have a lifetime exceeding the body of the function, the object passed to <b>CPrintfArg()</b> may not be a local stack object. Therefore, the additional parameter <b>CPrintfArg::DELETE_ PARM</b> is passed to the <b>CPrintfArg</b> constructor, which tells <b>CPrintfArg</b> to delete the object passed on destruction. This, of course, is a pitfall. Omitting <b>CPrintfArg::DELETE_PARM</b> would lead to an error, as an already destructed string would be referenced.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>In this implementation, <b>CPrintfArg::Out</b> has certain limitations. For simplicity, everything is passed to <b>snprintf</b>. Therefore, static buffers are used in most cases. Also, the handling of erroneous format strings is different from <b>sprintf</b>, starting with the fact that <b>StringPrintf</b> rejects wrong type characters, up to where <b>sprintf</b> can handle (more or less) arbitrary string and format lengths that <b>StringPrintf</b> probably cannot handle. </p>

<p><b>StringPrintf</b> uses local C string buffers of <b>ARG_BUFFER_SIZE</b> bytes for every argument, which is set to 512. This is sufficient for all possible 64-bit double numbers, but not for 80-bit doubles, which might become 4000-digits long. The <b>ARG_BUFFER_SIZE</b> bytes limit (per argument) includes the leading and trailing blanks or zeros that <b>sprintf</b> might insert. All output exceeding this limit would be truncated by <b>snprintf</b>. The handling is different for strings (C strings and <b>std::string</b>) though, where <b>StringPrintf</b> always allocates a temporary buffer of the size <b>strlen(string) + ARG_BUFFER_SIZE</b>.</p>

<p>Also for simplicity, I did not include all possible built-in types&#151;only those that otherwise cannot be converted. For example, I left out all short types in <b>CPrintfArg</b>. Nevertheless, <b>StringPrintf</b> certainly works with short arguments&#151;the compiler promotes them to integer types. In addition, <b>StringPrintf</b> certainly produces some overhead when creating temporary objects and allocating memory for strings. But after all, <b>StringPrintf</b> has been used for quite a while in large applications with thousands of <b>sprintf</b> calls without any additional problems.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p><b>StringPrintf</b> shows that typesafe versions of the <b>printf</b> family can be implemented using common C++ compilers. Applying <b>StringPrintf</b> to Walter Bright's <b>printf</b> defects, most of his issues have been resolved: <b>StringPrintf</b> is typesafe, supports generic programming and user-defined types, and it cannot corrupt programs through invalid format strings. These features can be used in existing code just by including StringPrintf.h and linking the sources. <b>StringPrintf</b> can also prevent buffer overflows by switching to <b>std::string</b> while not abandoning <b>printf</b>-style formatting. </p>
