Layers of abstraction with heavy use of overview tables provide names and brief descriptions of classes, functions, and the like. DoxyS also features a wiki-like syntax for writing directory-level documentation and related documentation pages or design documents. Contact http://www.doxys.dk/.</p>

<h3>Criline Search and Replace Ships for Windows</h3>

<p>Criline Software has developed Criline Search and Replace, a search and replacement tool for Windows. The application performs a case-sensitive search for a string in multiple files and replaces it with another string. It can search for a phrase, several words, multiple lines, or regular expressions, using size, date, and attributes filters. By analyzing search results, the program may recognize text files and automatically launch predefined external editors to view them. All changes can be backed up and an HTML report may be generated in the end of the search and replacement routine. Contact +0172 2162354 or http://www.criline.com/.</p>
<h3>Pentek Announces SystemFlow API</h3>

The addition, the Model 4990 SystemFlow API and libraries, allow developers to address new applications by customizing an already functioning "starter" RTS platform.

<h3>Xamlon Releases Flash Edition</h3>

<p>The new Flash Edition of Xamlon Pro lets you write Flash applications in XAML, Microsoft's new XML-based markup language, rather than being limited to Macromedia's ActionScript. In addition to offering XAML for simplified development, Xamlon Pro, Flash Edition lets you program backend logic with any .NET language, including C++, C#, Visual Basic.NET, and JScript. Although .NET languages are used for the application logic, the .NET runtime is not required; deployed applications only require the Flash runtime on the client.
