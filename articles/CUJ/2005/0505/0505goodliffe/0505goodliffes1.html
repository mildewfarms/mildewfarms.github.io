<h2>Using volatile</h2>
This low-level purgatory is where you use C's <b>volatile</b> keyword. <b>volatile</b> signals to the compiler that a value may change under the code's feet, that you can make no assumptions about it, and that the optimizer can't cache it for repeated use.

<p>This is just the behavior you need for hardware register access. Every time you write code that accesses a register, you want it to result in a real register access. Don't forget the <b>volatile</b> qualification! </p>
