<p>Until now, all the class types I've used in this series have been <b>ref</b> classes, which means that instances of them&#151;including those declared on the stack&#151;are managed by the garbage collector. This month, I look at what is often referred to as a "lightweight" class mechanism; namely, the <b>value</b> class, instances of which are not managed by the garbage collector.</p>

<p><b>Value</b> class types are particularly useful for reasonably small data structures that have value semantics. Examples include points in a coordinate system and complex numbers. Typically, a good candidate for implementation as a <b>value</b> class will have only a few data members, will not require inheritance, and will not be expensive in terms of passing and returning by value or copying during assignment.</p>
<h3>Point As a Value Class</h3>

<p>Let's take the <b>Point</b> class from the March 2005 installment of this series, and turn it into a value class (see <a href="0505jaeschkel1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>). This is done by replacing <b>ref</b> with <b>value</b>. Like <b>ref</b> <b>class</b>, <b>value</b> <b>class</b> is a keyword containing whitespace. And as you should expect, the only difference between a <b>value</b> class and a <b>value</b> struct is that the default accessibility for the former is private, while that for the latter is public.</p>

<p>A <b>value</b> class automatically derives from <b>System::ValueType</b> (which, in turn, derives from <b>System::Object</b>); however, this cannot be declared explicitly. A <b>value</b> class is also implicitly "sealed"; that is, it cannot be used as a base class. (As a result, there is no point in giving a <b>value</b> class member an access specifier of <b>protected</b>; however, that is not prohibited.) Any <b>value</b> (or <b>ref</b>) class <b>X</b> can be declared sealed explicitly:</p>

<pre>
value class X sealed {/*...*/};

</pre>

<p>Note the absence of a default constructor, which, in the <b>ref</b> class version, sets the <b>x</b>- and <b>y</b>-coordinates to zero. For a <b>value</b> class, the CLI itself sets all fields in any instance of that class to all-bits-zero; you cannot provide your own default constructor. For our <b>Point</b> type, this means a default set of coordinates of (0,0), and that is acceptable; however, zero, <b>false</b>, and/or <b>nullptr</b> might not be appropriate default values for fields in other types, so this requirement may rule out a <b>value</b> class's being used instead of a <b>ref</b> class for certain types. (A conforming C++/CLI implementation is required to represent the values <b>false</b> and <b>nullptr</b> as all-bits-zero.)</p>

<p>Another restriction on <b>value</b> classes is that they come with a default copy constructor and assignment operator, both of which perform bitwise copies. You cannot provide your own versions of these functions.</p>

<p>Function <b>Equals</b> can be made a bit simpler than the <b>ref</b> class version, but not much. Remember, we are overriding the version defined in <b>System::Object</b>, and that takes an <b>Object^</b>. Since an argument of that type could have the value <b>nullptr</b>, I deal with it first. The step you can omit is that which checks to see if you are being asked to compare something against itself. For <b>ref</b> class implementations of <b>Equals</b>, this step is necessary, as an infinite number of handles can refer to the same object. However, in the case of a <b>value</b> class, no two instances can ever represent the same instance. Two instances can represent points having the exact same coordinates, but changing the <b>x</b>-coordinate of one <b>Point</b> does not change that in the other.</p>

<p>When an instance of a <b>Point</b> is passed to <b>Equals</b>, being of a <b>value</b> class type (which is ultimately derived from <b>System::Object</b>), boxing occurs. That is, an instance of <b>Object</b> is allocated on the garbage-collected heap, and that instance contains a copy of the <b>Point</b> passed. Because I have just created a new object, and there is only one handle to it, it can never be the same <b>Point</b> as any other <b>Point</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>operator==</b> function previously taking <b>Point</b> handles has been reduced to one line. Instead of handles, it now takes <b>Point</b> values, and the arrow member selection operators have each been replaced by a dot operator. Given that a <b>value</b> class type is sealed, the only thing compatible with a parameter of type <b>value</b> class <b>Point</b>, is a value of that exact type. As such, you can dispense with checking against <b>nullptr</b>, checking to see if you are being compared with yourself, and whether the two objects passed have exactly the same type.</p>

<p>The <b>operator==</b> function previously taking tracking references can be kept almost as is, but with the test for "same type" being removed. However, you can only keep one of these operator functions, as having more than one makes calls of the form <b>point1 == point2</b> ambiguous. (In the declaration of this function's parameters, you can use the Standard C++ reference notation <b>&amp;</b> instead of <b>%</b>, as these are interchangeable for native and <b>value</b> class types. Since instances of such types do not reside on the garbage-collected heap, their location cannot change during garbage collection, so their location need not be tracked.)</p>

<p><a href="0505jaeschkel2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a> exercises most of the <b>value</b> class's members. The most obvious aspect of this program is that it contains instances of type <b>Point</b> that have static storage duration; that cannot be done for <b>ref</b> class types. In fact, not only can't you have a static instance of a <b>ref</b> class, you can't even have a static handle to such a type!</p>

<p>In the first call to <b>Console::WriteLine</b>, I pass a <b>Point</b> by value; however, what this method is expecting is an object reference. As such, the <b>Point</b> value is automatically boxed, and the reference to the resulting object is passed instead.</p>

<p>In its definition, <b>p5</b> is initialized via the default copy constructor, while in the following statement, the default assignment operator assigns a bitwise copy of <b>p2</b> to <b>p5</b>.</p>
<h3>Assigning Unique Point IDs, Revisited</h3>

<p>In the April 2005 installment, I showed how to add a unique ID facility to <b>Point</b>, and that involved a discussion of static constructors, basic file I/O, and event handlers. I revisit that topic and look at whether changing <b>Point</b> from a <b>ref</b> class to a <b>value</b> class makes any difference. (The short answer is, "It makes a great deal of difference!")</p>

<p>Again, you cannot define a default constructor, copy constructor, or assignment operator for a <b>value</b> class. Unfortunately, these are major problems for our ID solution. While the default constructor in our <b>ref</b> class version set both coordinates to zero, the same as for a <b>value</b> class, it also got the next available ID and assigned that to the ID instance field. With the <b>value</b> class version, we're stuck with a default ID of zero for every new <b>Point</b> constructed in that manner, and that is unacceptable; you simply need every new <b>Point</b> to be automatically assigned a unique ID!</p>

<p>A similar problem results from the lack of an explicit copy constructor operator. The whole purpose of such an operator is to initialize a brand new object as it is being born, yet the bitwise copy done for <b>value</b> classes causes the new object's ID to be the same as that from which its value is being copied.</p>

<p>In the case of assignment, we're setting the value of an existing <b>Point</b>, so that <b>Point</b>'s ID must not change; that is, while either or both of its coordinates might change, it's still the same <b>Point</b> object. However, the bitwise copy done for <b>value</b> classes causes the destination <b>Point</b>'s ID to be overwritten with that of the source.</p>

<p>There is some good news, however. Like a <b>ref</b> class, a <b>value</b> class can have static and nonstatic members (including a static constructor) as well as properties and virtual and nonvirtual functions and operators.</p>

<p>Although the source of the <b>Point</b> value class with ID "support" is not shown here (available at http://www.cuj.com/code/), a simple test program shows its deficiencies; see <a href="0505jaeschkel3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>. Here is the first declaration of that program, along with the output produced for each of the four <b>Point</b>s after the first execution:</p>

<pre>
Point p1, p2(3,7), p3(9,1), p4 = p2;
p1 = [0](0,0)
p2 = [0](3,7)
p3 = [1](9,1)
p4 = [0](3,7)

</pre>

<p>Point <b>p1</b> is created using the default constructor. As such, it gets an ID of zero, which is accidentally the correct ID for the first <b>Point</b>. And the default coordinate values are also zero, as required. In the case of <b>p2</b>, the programmer-written constructor was used, which assigned the next available ID, namely, zero. You now have duplicate IDs.</p>

<p>Likewise, <b>p3</b> is given the next available ID, <b>1</b>. Then, when <b>p4</b> is given a bitwise copy of <b>p2</b>, <b>p4</b> takes on the same ID as <b>p2</b>. In the case of assignment,</p>

<pre>
p2 = p1;
p2 = [0](0,0)

</pre>

<p>the bitwise copy of <b>p1</b> to <b>p2</b> results in both <b>Point</b>s having <b>p1</b>'s ID.</p>

<p>In the second execution of the test program, the output is:</p>

<pre>
p1 = [0](0,0)
p2 = [2](3,7)
p3 = [3](9,1)
p4 = [2](3,7)
p2 = [0](0,0)

</pre>

<p>As you can see, <b>p1</b> always has ID zero.</p>

<p>Clearly, <b>ref</b> and <b>value</b> class types each have their own advantages, and not every use of one is interchangeable with the other. </p>
<h3>Fundamental Type Mapping</h3>

<p>As I've suggested in previous installments, all of the fundamental types in C++/CLI are really synonyms for value types defined in the CLI Library. </p>

<p>In the spirit of Standard C++, the mapping of fundamental types to CLI value types is almost entirely implementation defined. However, for Microsoft's Visual C++, that mapping is as listed in <a href="0505jaeschket1.html" target="_BLANK">Table 1</a>. (The only mapping required by the C++/CLI Standard is that for signed and unsigned <b>char</b>; these must be signed and unsigned 8-bit values, respectively.)</p>

<p>You've already seen another useful value type, namely <b>System::Decimal</b>; however, that has no corresponding C++/CLI type, and must be used directly by that name.</p>

<p>All public methods in a fundamental value's corresponding <b>value</b> class type are available to that fundamental value. Consider these expressions; each involves accessing a static or instance member of one of the aforementioned CLI value types:</p>

<pre>
Int32::MaxValue
Double::Parse("123.45e-1")
10.2f.ToString()
(10 + 5.9).ToString()
(100).ToString()
100 .ToString()

</pre>

<p>Using Visual C++ mapping, the type of <b>10.2f</b> is <b>float</b>, which maps to <b>System::Single</b>, whose <b>ToString</b> function is then called. Similarly, <b>(10 + 5.9)</b> has type double, so <b>System::Double</b>'s <b>ToString()</b> is called. Clearly, from a semantic point of view, the parentheses around the first <b>100</b>, and the space following the second <b>100</b>, are redundant. However, if both were omitted, the <b>100</b> followed by the period would be parsed as a double constant followed by an identifier, resulting in a syntax error.</p>
<h3>Complex Numbers</h3>

<p>A <b>Complex</b> number (that is, one that has a real and an imaginary part) is another example of a <b>value</b> class type (<a href="0505jaeschkel4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a> shows the important parts of a <b>double</b> version of such a class, although some important operator functions are missing.)</p>

<p>The CLI requires IEEE floating-point representation (more formally known as "IEC 10559"), and in that representation, zero in single and double precision is represented by all-bits-zero. As such, you can safely take the CLI-provided default constructor values.</p>

<p>Programmers trafficking in complex numbers like to use <b>i</b>, which represents the square root of <b>-1</b>. As such, a complex type would do well to provide a public read-only constant having that value. <b>Complex</b> achieves this via a combination of a public static <b>initonly</b> member and a static constructor. Because <b>Complex</b> is not a primitive type, you can't make <b>i</b> a <b>readonly</b> member. In any event, that would also require you to initialize it with a constant expression, but no such thing exists. So we do the next best thing by making <b>i</b> <b>initonly</b> and initializing it in the static constructor.</p>

<p><a href="0505jaeschkel5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a> is a test program and the output produced.</p>
<h3>Some Miscellaneous Issues</h3>

<p>A <b>value</b> class type shall not contain:</p>



<ul>
  <li>A data member whose type is a native C++ array, native class type, or bit field.</li>
  <li>A member function containing a local class.</li>
  <li>A member that is a friend. </li>
  <li>A destructor.</li>
</ul>



<p>A <b>value</b> class can be passed to, and returned from, a function by value, address, reference, or tracking reference.</p>

<p>Within an instance constructor or member function of a <b>ref</b> class <b>T</b>, the type of <b>this</b> is "handle to <b>T</b>." However, for a <b>value</b> class type, the type of this is <b>interior_ptr&lt;T&gt;</b>, an obscure type whose meaning we'll leave for some other time. For now, "It just works!"</p>

<p>While instances of simple <b>value</b> class types such as <b>Point</b> and <b>Complex</b> are completely self-contained, a <b>value</b> class need not be. For example, like any <b>ref</b> class type, a <b>value</b> class type could contain pointers into the native heap and handles to objects on the garbage-collected heap. In such cases, cleaning up is not simply a matter of freeing the memory occupied by the instance of the value class type itself; it also requires cleaning up after each of that type's data members. But I leave the topic of destruction and finalization to another time.</p>
<h3>Reader Exercises</h3>

<p>Here are some things you might want to do to reinforce what I've presented:</p>



<ol>
  <li>Take a look at the members of <b>System::ValueType</b>, the base type of all <b>value</b> classes.</li>
  <li>Why might it be a good habit to develop, to make all your <b>ref</b> classes sealed, unless you have good reason to do otherwise? (Because Standard C++ has no equivalent, C++ programmers have never had a reliable way to prohibit inheritance, in general, so they won't intuitively think of using a feature they've never had before.)</li>
  <li>Define a <b>ref</b> or <b>value</b> class with a data member of type <b>char</b>, and use <b>ildasm</b> to look at the metadata generated. Change the default signedness of a plain <b>char</b> from signed to unsigned (using Properties, C/C++, Language, Default Char Unsigned) and look at the difference in the metadata. Compare that with the metadata generated for two other members, having types <b>signed</b> <b>char</b> and <b>unsigned</b> <b>char</b>, respectively. (Remember, there are three distinct types of <b>char</b> in C++, so you can overload functions differing only on arguments of these types.)</li>
  <li><b>System::Char</b> contains a family of <b>Is*</b> functions much like those available via the C Standard Library's <b>ctype</b> header. However, do <b>Char::IsLetter</b> and <b>isalpha</b> do the same thing? To be sure, try giving characters such as <b>ñ</b>, <b>ä</b>, and <b>ê</b> to each.</li>
  <li>Take a look at the complete set of members available in the CLI Library types to which the C++/CLI types map. (Amongst those that should be familiar are <b>Equals</b>, <b>GetHashCode</b>, and <b>ToString</b>.)</li>
  <li>What are the advantages or disadvantages of implementing <b>Complex::i</b> as a public static read-only property?</li>
  <li>Can the <b>sizeof</b> operator or the <b>cstddef</b> macro <b>offsetof</b> be applied to a <b>value</b> class type?</li>
  <li>The CLI has no concept of a union, per se. However, a <b>value</b> class can be forced to have an explicit layout, and each data member can be given a specific byte offset. By giving two data members the same byte offset, those members overlap. Implement a <b>value</b> class that contains a <b>double</b>, which is overlapped exactly by two <b>int</b>s, as well as eight unsigned <b>char</b>s. Store a value in the double member and display the corresponding values in the <b>int</b>s and unsigned <b>char</b>s. Use this code as a starting point:</li>
</ol>

<pre>
using namespace System::Runtime::
  InteropServices;
   [StructLayout(LayoutKind::Explicit)]
   public value class Overlap
   {
      [FieldOffset(0)] double d;
      // ...
   };

</pre>

<ol>
  <li>	  The two constructs inside <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> are attributes, and they correspond to calls to a constructor of a CLI class type having that name suffixed with <b>Attribute</b>. For example, <b>FieldOffset(0)</b> is a call to the constructor for the CLI Standard class <b>FieldOffsetAttribute</b> that takes one argument. (In a future installment, I use attributes to pass data structures to/from native C/C++ code.) In general, attributes can be applied to pretty much any kind of program element; however, each particular attribute type can only be applied to those program element types specified in its documentation. For example, <b>StructLayout</b> can only be applied to a <b>ref</b> or <b>value</b> class, while <b>FieldOffset</b> can only be applied to a data member of a <b>ref</b> or <b>value</b> class. </li></ol>
