<h3>Stupid Tricks </h3>
<p><b> </b>After the heavy reader response to last April&#146;s forum on "Quirksort," 
  I decided this April to make a fool out of myself instead of you. You&#146;ll 
  be back in the line of fire next year. (Be ready.)
<p> I had just returned from 22 months of service work in Brazil in 1973 when 
  Richard, an engineer at Lockheed, hired me to paint houses for the summer. It 
  was a side business he had mainly for tax purposes, so he wanted to hire people 
  who needed little supervision. He assumed that Stewart, another young man (age 
  21, just like me) with similar experience, and I would work well together and 
  turn him a tidy profit.
<p> He was right about Stewart. It seems that I, on the other hand, had a flair 
  for the artistic. I took care to ensure that every line was perfect, that every 
  stroke of the brush blended with its fellows to uniformly cover its target. 
  Clients were pleased and I was in hog heaven -- for two weeks, anyway. I was 
  being paid by the hour and just wasn&#146;t fast enough, and Richard evidently 
  couldn&#146;t afford to fund works of art. He had to "let me go" (a favorite 
  euphemism). I was canned. Sacked. Fired. For painting too well.
<p> I deserved every bit of it. I&#146;m no businessman (obviously), but I know 
  enough to realize that to be profitable, a business must walk the fine line 
  that provides sufficient value while expending only a modest amount of resources. 
  Perfection is not an option. I was overindulging my inclination to "do my best" 
  and refine my personal abilities in a way that Richard&#146;s business model 
  didn&#146;t allow for.
<p> Unfortunately, too many businesses in our industry follow the same business 
  model, while at the same time it seems too few programmers lust after quality. 
  Surely there must be some common ground between the two parties that allows 
  for excellence.
<p> I once worked for a manager who believed that training should be offered only 
  on rare occasion and to a precious few as a perk for a job well done. Seems 
  sort of backwards, doesn&#146;t it? There needs to be resources allocated for 
  "sharpening the saw," to borrow Stephen Covey&#146;s term, else programmers 
  and product turn very dull indeed, yet the blind spot induced by the short-term, 
  quarterly-bottom-line mentality of today&#146;s management force keeps training, 
  mentoring, and personal development off the priority list. Stupid management 
  tricks.
<p> I have also observed programmers who, like Godot&#146;s anticipants, take 
  no initiative to expand their competence, preferring instead to be spoon-fed 
  by the next code inspection (if indeed these occur at their shop) or by some 
  training course that, because of their irresponsible attitude, goes in one ear 
  and out the other. Stupid programmer tricks.
<p> Over the years I&#146;ve learned to better balance my yearning for learning 
  with my employer&#146;s penchant for profit. Meeting in the middle has required 
  some late-night study, an occasional job change, and regularly making my share 
  of mistakes. Those mistakes, over the years, have included: copying and pasting 
  code instead of factoring it into a separate module, thus using my editor as 
  a bug replication tool; not using assertions; putting real work into assertions 
  (which of course disappear in release mode); returning a reference to a local 
  variable; providing a complex solution when a simpler one would do; and letting 
  myopic managers get under my skin. That&#146;s just the Short List, of course. 
  But hey, I&#146;m not as stupid as I used to be. That&#146;s something. (But 
  I still paint real slow.)
