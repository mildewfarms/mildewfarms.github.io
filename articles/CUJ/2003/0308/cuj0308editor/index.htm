Or is that a little too clich&eacute;? I have in front of me a half-page newspaper add entitled "Father's Day Dream Sale," sporting nothing but electronics: a home theater projector, a camcorder, flat HDTV, and a video editor box. We love our sophisticated toys.<P> This father is a programmer, and has different dreams (although I did just   acquire a DVD/VCR combo for "convenience"). Maybe your dreams are of similar   ilk. I have a dream, for example, that Linux will continue to become easier   to configure and that Windows will become more stable -- some sort of combination   of the two seems like it would be an ideal desktop environment. I have separate   boxes running Windows XP, RedHat Linux 8.0, and Max OS X networked in my home   office. Not being a Linux expert myself (although a vintage UNIX user from the   80s) I thought I could easily configure my Linux box to serve up printers and   other hardware. I thought wrong. After three weeks and scads of emails to the   local Linux user group, I gave up. (I refuse to sell my soul to interminable   hours in Configuration Hell just to brag to fellow hackers that I know every   line in every file in the <B>/etc</B> tree by heart-I really do have other things   to do.) I now have my printers and scanner connected to my Windows box and everything   works just dandy. I have a dream that software, especially operating systems,   will someday become at once reliable, well documented, and easy to use.<P> I have known programmers that wish that users would just go away so that they   could hack and tinker at will and still get paid for it. Not a realistic dream   IMO. Some hard-working programmers I know dream of a 40-hour work week. Since   this is orthodox Extreme Programming doctrine one would think this would be   more popular. Alas, not so. Other programmers I know would gladly work 60-80   hours right now if they could only find a job. Maybe you can tell me where all   the jobs have gone.<P> Having more questions than answers, I shall conclude by sharing a timely gift   from my inbox, left by the Mysterious Bard who has haunted these pages twice   in the past year. Maybe you can identify with the following, as you dream of   better days.<P> Coding In the Dark According to the C Street Band (With apologies to Bruce   Springsteen's "Dancing In the Dark," and to the many good contractors out there)<P><ul>  <font size="-1">They ask when I'll deliver, and I ain't got nothing to say<BR>  I sling code till the morning, I go to bed feeling the same way<BR>  My bug count's climbin' higher, man, it's high and the blame's on myself<BR>  So I'm lazy... but a new perk, well that might help: </font>  <P> <font size="-1">"You can't make me aspire,<BR>    Can't make me aspire without a Sparc!"<BR>    My contract won't expire<BR>    Even if I'm just coding in the dark </font>  <P><font size="-1"> OnMessage calls getting clearer, round trip's on and I'm     moving 'round my CASE<BR>    I check my work into \\mirror...
