This has turned out to be a time   saver on this project because, as mentioned in the section on "Multivalued logic",   I was able to find and use Art Walker's enum++, with some minor enhancements   (see references). <p> Another very useful class that I incorporated into my program is Maurice Fox's   Debug class (see references). It is a general purpose trace, debug, and timing   class, which allows me to view the calling tree of functions with the outputs   I specify. <p>I was able to extend it for my purposes, for example, to show  a sample hierarchical trace:<p><code><pre>* => backtraceGraph   1: vertex label== = U3:nand ...**  => discover_vertex  1: vertex label== = U3:nand ...**  => discover_vertex  1: vertex label== = U2:nand ...**  => discover_vertex  1: vertex label== = J:in ...**  => discover_vertex  1: vertex label== = K:in ...**  => discover_vertex  1: vertex label== = M:in ...* => implicateVertex  1: vertex label== = J:in ...**  => setAllVertexOutputs 1: vertex label== = J:in ...**  => discover_vertex  1: vertex label== = J:in ...**  => discover_vertex  1: vertex label== = U2:nand ...</pre></code><p> This Debug class can be compiled away with a <b>DEBUG_OFF</b> define, although   as Maurice Fox says in his article, "Usually you're just kidding yourself when   you do that, though". In fact, the performance overhead in several projects   in which I have used Debug are typically less than 1%, so I tend to agree with   Maurice and leave the class compiled in. <p>Another tool that comes in handy is Leor Zolman's STL Decryptor ( seereferences ).<p>Similarly, when you look at the code, you'll see how I managenamespaces by following Herb Sutter's "Migrating to Namespaces" ( see references )recommendations.</body></html>
