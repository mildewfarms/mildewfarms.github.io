Tanenbaum [3] describes a   method that can be used to recover from burst errors. The method is as follows:   The data to be transmitted is stored horizontally (like we would read it), but   the data is transmitted vertically (bit 1 in each row would be transmitted first,   then bit 2 in each row, and so on).<P> The receiver then reconstructs the original lines upon reception of the data.   If a burst error occurs, there will be only 1 bit wrong per line, and we have   shown that 1 error bit per line can be corrected.<p> </BODY></HTML>
