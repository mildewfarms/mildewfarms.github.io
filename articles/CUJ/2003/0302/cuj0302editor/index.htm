<h3>The C++ Experience </h3>
<p> Let me begin by welcoming Miro Samek as a new columnist. &#147;The Embedded 
  Angle&#148; will give bimonthly insight to the world of embedded programming, 
  something I personally want to know more about. If you think it&#146;s going 
  to be a look at C-only techniques (not that that would be bad), think again 
  and read this month&#146;s installment. I saw C++ techniques that were new to 
  me. (Time yourself to see how long it takes you to understand that he&#146;s 
  not doing infinite recursion in line 12 of Listing 1 &#151; and be honest!) 
<p> <a name="1_return"></a><a name="2_return"></a>Speaking of which (i.e., innovative 
  C++ stuff), last October I was favored to attend The C++ Seminar, three wild 
  and crazy days with five wild and crazy C++ experts [<a href="#2">1</a>]. I 
  continue to be amazed at what one can do with C++, and how much there is to 
  know. While some moments bordered on Too Much Information [<a href="#2">2</a>], 
  it was at once enjoyable and enlightening. Part of the fun was watching the 
  experts try to work out questions between each other in real time, or, failing 
  that, to at least call each other names. Scott Meyers boldly proclaimed that 
  reverse iterators are really not iterators after all, and it turns out he was 
  at least half right (or so it looked to me). Dan Saks revealed things about 
  friends in C++ that I believe most people have never considered. 
<p> Though I may someday forget many of the gems imparted, I doubt I will ever 
  fail to recall the Trivia Contest, moderated by the singular Bobby Schmidt (whom 
  you can always count on to bring Balance to any Force). Names were drawn at 
  random in groups of five, which nominees proceeded to the front of the room 
  to get weeded out of the running for prizes (I already have a <i>CUJ</i> t-shirt, 
  thank you). It was fun to sit in the back of the room and answer all the questions 
  under my breath, but when my name was chosen I did what most anyone would do: 
  commenced porcine perspiring. I handily eliminated the other four by being the 
  only one in the group who knew the answer to the first question: Who wrote a 
  landmark paper in the mid-1990s that raised doubts about the safety of exceptions? 
  (Tom Cargill). Sometimes it pays to be old.
<p> I then proceeded to embarrass myself &#151; something I&#146;m always wont 
  to do while sitting in the Hot Seat. I won&#146;t recount in detail what happened 
  (I don&#146;t know that I can), but please believe me: I really do understand 
  zero-initialization of PODs in C++ (have for years). I just chose that moment 
  to space it out (of course, the question was not direct enough to know that 
  was the &#147;gotcha&#148;). They say (and I have to believe them, since it 
  was all a blur to me) I answered enough questions correctly to win both a <i>CUJ</i> 
  t-shirt and a Japanese version of <i>Effective C++</i>, both of which I passed 
  on immediately to someone more interested, uh, I mean deserving. Having been 
  previously introduced to the group as the editor of <i>CUJ</i> contributed to 
  the festive outcome, I&#146;m sure. 
<p> <a name="3_return"></a>Would I attend again? In a minute. Would I put my name 
  in the hat again for public humiliation [<a href="#3">3</a>]? I&#146;ll have 
  to get back to you on that one.

  Lookup, or ADL). Believe me, you don&#146;t want to know.<br>
