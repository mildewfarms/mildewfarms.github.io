The compilers are designed for systems based on the Intel Pentium 4, Itanium 2, Xeon, and Centrino processor families. Version 8.0 also supports the forthcoming Intel processor code-named "Prescott," which includes new graphical and video instructions and other compute-intensive application characteristics, and Mobile MMX technology, which similarly provides performance capabilities for graphical, audio, and video performance on mobile phones and PDAs. The new Intel compilers also support Intel's Hyper-Threading technology and OpenMP 2.0. New tools offered with the compiler suites include the Intel Code Coverage and Intel Test Prioritization Tools.

The IAR Embedded Workbench for R8C is an integrated development environment based on IAR Systems' compiler and debugger technology. It includes the project manager, editor, C/Embedded C++ compiler, assembler, linker, library tools, and C-SPY debugger with support for the Renesas ROM monitor, letting you create embedded applications and test them on hardware from within the IAR Embedded Workbench.

SftTabs/DLL 4.5 is specifically designed for use with C and C++ applications and Visual C++/MFC. The tool offers 60 basic tab control styles, which can each be further customized. This version introduces hidden tabs to allow an application to hide tabs. Tabs can be used to host other controls by adding child windows or dialogs to the tab control, which are managed by the tab control. SftTabs/DLL 4.5 supports ANSI and UNICODE character sets on all supported platforms, Windows 95 through Windows Server 2003.

GpsTools provides access to GPS position, speed, and satellite information without requiring knowledge of low-level GPS protocols. Geographic coordinates can be converted between most coordinate systems including UTM, WGS84, NAD27, and NAD83. Raster maps can be defined and used to draw on objects such as icons, lines and rectangles. The maps can also be connected to the GPS. Samples are included in Visual Basic, C#, C++, and JavaScript. GpsTools is available for Windows and PocketPC, as ActiveX and .NET components. Contact +46-70-238-02-00 or <a href="http://franson.biz/">http://franson.biz/</a>.<h3>PathScale Compilers for Linux</h3><P>PathScale has announced a suite of high-performance compilers for the AMD Opteron processor, specifically designed for Linux-based clusters. The PathScale Compiler Suite is based on technology originally developed by SGI, and includes C, C++, and Fortran 9X compilers that support both 64-bit and 32-bit compilation, as well as native code generation for the AMD64 ABI. The compilers are compatible with the GNU/GCC tool chain and debuggers. Contact +1-408-746-9100 or <a href="http://www.pathscale.com/">http://www.pathscale.com/</a>.<h3>Compuware 64-Bit Debugging</h3><P>Compuware has released Compuware DevPartner64 1.0.1, a 64-bit debugging and automated error-detection solution for the Intel Itanium and Itanium 2, and AMD Opteron and Athlon64 processor families. In DevPartner64 1.0.1, Compuware has combined the Visual SoftICE and BoundsChecker tools, and packaged them together to give you advanced system-wide debugging and automated error detection. New features include a memory and resource viewer and a deadlock analyzer. Contact +1-313-227-7300 or <a href="http://www.compuware.com/">http://www.compuware.com/</a>.<h3>Visual Studio .NET Add-In</h3>Adienta's Browsio is an add-in for Visual Studio .NET designed to give you a complete picture of where and how a variable, function, or class is used. The Browsio Tree lists all locations where an identifier is used in the currently open C/C++ project. Clicking in the tree brings the Visual Studio .NET editor to that location. If you look up a name that is used in more than one context, these contexts are shown in different branches. Other features include hierarchies of calls and call-bys ("who calls X") for functions, and for classes, hierarchies of derived and base classes. Contact +31-(0)24-3737550 or <a href="http://www.browsio.com/">http://www.browsio.com/</a>.<h3>Altium Updates Embedded Toolset</h3><P>Altium is offering Version 10.0 of its TASKING 68K embedded software-development toolset. In the new release, the toolset has been enhanced to support ColdFire microprocessors as well as new Motorola 68K and CPU32 derivatives (including the DragonBall 68xx328 series). Other enhancements include a more intuitive Embedded Development Environment and a next-generation version of the CrossView Pro debugger. Contact +61-2-9975-7710 or <a href="http://www.altium.com/">http://www.altium.com/</a>.<h3>Electronic Signature Support from Telelogic</h3><P>Telelogic has announced support for electronic signatures in Telelogic SYNERGY/Change 4.3, its change request tracking and reporting system. Instead of creating, copying, and routing large paper files through the approval chain, SYNERGY/Change users can sign off on changes electronically within the tool. All signatures and user comments are locked into each validated, time-stamped, and unalterable record of change approvals. The electronic signature capability supports 21 CFR, Part 11, the Federal Food and Drug Administration's Electronic Records and Signature regulation.
