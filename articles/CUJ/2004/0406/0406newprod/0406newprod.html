<h3>Accelerated Technology Adds FPGA Support </h3>

<p>Accelerated Technology, the embedded systems division of Mentor Graphics, has announced support for the hard PowerPC core embedded in Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGAs with the release of the Nucleus RTOS, Microtec C and C++ compilation tools, and the XRAY Debugger. A range of Nucleus products, including the Nucleus NET TCP/IP networking suite, the Nucleus FILE file-management system, and the Nucleus WebServ embedded web server software are also available for Virtex-II Pro FPGA developers. Contact +1-251-208-3400 or http://www.acceleratedtechnology.com/.</p>
<h3>Absoft Releases Debugging Tool</h3>

<p>Absoft Corp. has released Fx2, a source-level debugging tool for Fortran (F77, F90, F95), C, C++, and assembly language. Fx2 is available for 32- and 64-bit Linux systems and is compatible with Fortran compilers from Absoft, IBM, Intel, and PGI, plus many C/C++ compilers. Supported architectures include x86/IA32/AMD32, AMD64, and PowerPC/G4/G5. The Fx2 Debugger works with command-line and graphical interfaces on single-processor desktops, multiprocessor workstations, and for customers using OpenMP or MPI, a distributed interface that easily scales from 2-1024+ processes is optional. Absoft has also released Version 9.0 of its Fortran 95 compiler for AMD Opteron or Athlon 64-bit processors running Linux. Contact +1-248-853-0050 or http://www.absoft.com/.</p>
<h3>SoftIntegration Ch 4.5 Available</h3>

<p>SoftIntegration has announced the availability of Ch 4.5, Embedded Ch 4.5, Ch SDK 4.5, Ch CGI toolkit, Ch Control System, and C++ Graphical Library for FreeBSD. Ch is a C/C++ interpreter for cross-platform scripting, 2D/3D plotting, numerical computing, shell programming, and embedded scripting. Ch supports 1999 ISO C Standard (C99) and C++ classes. Ch also supports many industry standards with over 8,000 functions including POSIX, socket/Winsock, X11/Motif, OpenGL, ODBC, C LAPACK, GTK+, Win32, and CGI. Functions in static or dynamic binary C/C++ libraries can be executed interpretively in scripting without recompilation using the Ch SDK. Contact +1-530-297-7398 or http://www.softintegration.com/.</p>
<h3>Sun Studio 8 Now Ready</h3>

<p>The Sun Studio 8 suite is the latest release of Sun's IDE for C, C++, and Fortran developers creating applications for the Solaris SPARC and x86 operating systems. New features focus on optimizing application performance, including an improved performance analyzer&#151;which helps developers identify performance obstacles in their Java technology, C, C++, or Fortran code&#151;and a debugger for applications that use both Java technology and native code. Contact +1-650-960-1300 or http://www.sun.com/.</p>
<h3>Impulse C SDK Released</h3>

<p>The Memec Group is distributing the Impulse C Co-Development kit for use with Xilinx FPGAs. The kit bundles the Impulse C CoDeveloper, Xilinx EDK, and an expandable Virtex-II-based system board supporting MicroBlaze. The kit lets you design using C (with Impulse C libraries), VHDL, Verilog, or all three; compile C processes directly to HDL, ready for hardware synthesis; debug in Visual Studio, GCC, and so on, with full application instrumentation; and partition hardware and software with minimal source code. Contact +1-858-314-8800 or http://www.memec.com/.</p>
<h3>Green Hills Unbundles velOSity</h3>

<p>The velOSity real-time microkernel, which has shipped as part of Green Hills Software's INTEGRITY RTOS, is now available independently, under a royalty-free license. The velOSity microkernel requires as little as 3 KB of RAM and uses an architecture that never disables interrupts in systems calls, ensuring fast interrupt response times. The velOSity microkernel inherits all of the INTEGRITY device drivers, BSPs, and middleware, and is tightly integrated with the MULTI IDE. Contact +1-805-965-6044 or http://www.ghs.com/.</p>
<h3>ColdFire Debugger Now Available</h3>

<p>Crossware has developed a USB BDM (background debug mode) debugger for Motorola's ColdFire family of chips. The USB debugger is driven by the new version of Crossware's source-level debugging software, which integrates with the rest of its ColdFire Development Suite. The user interface is unchanged. The USB debugger plugs directly into the target board, minimizing signal delays and ensuring that it will be compatible with the next generation of ColdFire chips running at up to 200 MHz. Contact +44-0-1763-853500 or http://www.crossware.com/.</p>
<h3>Support for Windows CE </h3>

<p>KUKA Controls' real-time extension platform, CeWin, lets Microsoft Windows CE .NET and Windows XP Embedded reside concurrently on a single CPU. CeWin 3.1 supports Windows CE .NET 4.2, and features an additional Shared Memory area for quicker and easier data exchange between the two operating systems. An event system has been added to improve synchronization, and a web server has been integrated for administration of the system. Contact +49-751-561-22-0 or http://www.kuka-controls.com/.</p>
<h3>Syware's FoneDB Upgraded</h3>

<p>SYWARE has upgraded FoneDB, its database software for Windows Mobile-powered Smartphones. New features in FoneDB 2.0 include synchronization of mobile data with desktop or server PCs, calculated fields that automatically apply mathematical operations, and filters that sort and display stored information. FoneDB can read data from any ODBC-enabled database, including Microsoft Access, Oracle, and SQL Server. And ODBC-enabled applications, such as Crystal Reports and Microsoft Excel, can read and write data in a FoneDB database. Contact +1-617-497-1300 or http://www.syware.com/.</p>
