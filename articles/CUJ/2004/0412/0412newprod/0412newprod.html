<h3>SoftIntegration Ch Updates </h3>

<p>SoftIntegration is offering Ch 4.7, Ch SDK 4.7, and Embedded Ch 4.7. Ch is an embeddable C/C++ interpreter for cross-platform scripting, 2D/3D plotting, numerical computing, shell programming, and embedded scripting. The 4.7 version features improvements for embedded scripting, and the Ch shell is now more compatible with the C shell in both command mode and shell programming. In all, 36 new APIs have been added in Ch SDK and Embedded Ch for easier interface with binary C/C++ libraries and embedded scripting. Enhancements for Ch SDK and Embedded Ch include input/output redirection, obtaining complete information about variables and functions in a Ch script, and interfacing functions with a variable number of arguments.
