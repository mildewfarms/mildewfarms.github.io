<p>A common scenario that occurs frequently in programming is that of enforcing constraints on a value type, such as to be within a valid range. This is one of those cases where, typically, programmers end up reinventing the wheel each time because a truly general-purpose and reusable solution is not well known. Policy-driven design easily provides a solution to this problem, as it does many others where customizable type behavior is desirable. In this article, I present a general-purpose constrained value type (see <a href="0412digginsl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listings 1</a> and <a href="0412digginsl2.html" target="_BLANK">2</a>) that can be easily modified with policies to adapt to your specific needs. </p>

<p>A few examples of possible candidates for a constrained value type include: days of the week, minutes, seconds, hours, days of the year, months, degrees of a circle, radians, strictly positive values, nonnegative values, probability, percentages, and so on. For example, here I define an integer value type that represents a base 60 number and throws an exception if ever assigned a value out of the range [0..59]. Using the constrained type, it is defined as:</p>

<pre>
typedef cv::constrained_value &lt; 
      cv::policies::ranged_integer_constraint
     &lt; 0, 59 &gt; &gt; Base60;
Base60 b = 10;	// no problems
b = b + 20;	// no problems
b = b + 40;	// throws exception

</pre>

<p>Having done this, you can now use <b>Base60</b> like you would an ordinary <b>int</b>, but any time it is assigned a value below 0 or above 59, an exception is thrown. Of course, throwing an exception is only one possible behavior in the case of a constraint-invalidation condition. The <b>ranged_integer_constraint</b> policy type was written to accept an optional policy on how to deal with invalid conditions. For instance, there is also a saturating range policy, which sets any out-of-range values to the nearest valid value. In this case, that means that values below 0 are set to 0, and values above 59 are set to 59.</p>

<pre>
typedef cv::constrained_value &lt; 
        cv::policies::ranged_integer &lt; 0, 59, 
        cv::policies::saturating &gt; &gt; Base60;
Base60 b = 10; // no problems
std::cout &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; std::endl; // outputs 10
b = b + 70;
std::cout &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; std::endl; // outputs 59

</pre>

<p>I have only scratched the surface of <b>constrained_value</b>. To really harness the power of <b>constrained_value</b>, you will likely want to write your own constraints policies.</p>
<h3>Writing Constraints Policies</h3>

<p>Constraints policies are easy to write. A constraints policy has to include only two components&#151;a public <b>typedef</b> for a value type named <b>value</b>, and an assign function with the signature: <b>static void assign(const value&amp; rvalue, value&amp; lvalue)</b>. Here is a common and simple constraints policy for nonnegative doubles, which throws an empty exception when the double is assigned a value below 0:</p>

<pre>
struct non_negative_double_constraints {
   typedef double value;
   static void assign(const value&amp; rvalue,
     value&amp; lvalue) {
     if (rvalue &lt; 0.0) { throw; }
     lvalue = rvalue;
   }
}
typedef cv::constrained_value 
     &lt; non_negative_double_constraint &gt; 
     non_negative_double;

</pre>

<p>This defines a new type, <b>non_negative_ double</b>, which is, for the most part, interchangeable with ordinary <b>double</b>s but throws an exception any time a negative value is assigned.</p>

<p>A more sophisticated constraints policy is one that guarantees the value stays within a valid range by applying a modulo operation. Applying this constraint to the <b>Base60</b> example would mean that values of 60 become 0, 61 becomes 1, and so on. Here is a constraints policy that achieves just that:</p>

<pre>
template &lt; int max_T &gt;
struct modulo_integer_constraints {
  typedef int value;
  static void assign(const value&amp; rvalue, 
    value&amp; lvalue) {
    lvalue = rvalue % max_T;
  }
};
typedef cv::constrained_value &lt; 
  modulo_integer_constraints 
  &lt; 60 &gt; &gt; Base60;
Base60 b = 10;
std::cout &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; std::endl; // outputs 10
b = b + 70;
std::cout &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; std::endl; // outputs 20

</pre>

<p>This new <b>Base60</b> type never throws exceptions and assures you that the value always has a value in the legal range of [0..59].</p>
<h3>Under the Hood of constrained_value</h3>

<p>The <b>constrained_value</b> type is straightforward, as it requires the <b>constraint_policy</b> parameter to do the work of performing assignments and validations according to whatever rules it desires. The <b>constrained_value</b> type defines two local types that it uses for ease of reading and typing: <b>self</b>, which is shorthand for the constrained type itself; and <b>value</b>, which is the value type that is being constrained. The <b>constrained_value</b> type is made up primarily of two initializing constructors and two assignment operators, one each for copying from <b>self</b> or copying from a <b>value</b>. All assignments are routed through to the <b>constraints_policy</b> assign method, which defines whatever particular assignment or validation that is desired. The <b>constrained_value</b> type also includes a conversion operator for <b>value</b>.</p>
<h3>Relationship of Constrained Values to DbC</h3>

<p>One application of the constrained value type is that it allows an easy counter-example to many of the case examples of literature on Design-by-Contract (DbC) techniques, such as the canonical square root problem. The square root problem is simply that any argument to a square root function must be a nonnegative real number. The DbC approach is to apply a precondition to the function, whereas using constrained values, you can simply require that <b>sqrt</b> accept arguments of type <b>non_negative_double</b>. Problem solved.</p>
