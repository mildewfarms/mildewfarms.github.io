<p>Recently, a coworker came into my office and asked for a second opinion on a core dump. "It's dumping core when it tries to allocate something on the heap, and the stack trace ends in <b>malloc()</b>. What's going on?" The stack trace showed a crash on the following line, which should not have caused a problem:</p>

<pre>
std::vector&lt;int&gt;* v = 
  new std::vector&lt;int&gt;;  
// nothing wrong here

</pre>

<p>When a core dump stack trace ends in <b>malloc()</b> or another heap-control routine, this is near-certain proof that the heap has been corrupted. As usually happens with heap corruption, the crash occurred some time after the heap was first corrupted. The crash on instantiating the <b>vector&lt;int&gt;</b> is a red herring; we have to find the real error.</p>

<p>Modern tools such as IBM's Rational Purify (http://www-306.ibm.com/software/ awdtools/purifyplus/) make it much easier to diagnose these problems. A Purify run on the executable flagged a double <b>delete</b>; i.e., the same pointer was being deleted twice, an action that causes undefined behavior. The memory in question was the <b>char*</b> payload of an automatic (on the stack, not on the heap) instance of a simple <b>string</b> class.</p>

<pre>
class SimpleStringClass {
  private:
    char* s_;
  public:
  // The usual: ctor, cctor, dtor,      // =(), etc,
  // plus an ill-advised conversion    // operator:
  operator const char*() { return s_; }
};

</pre>

<p>We were able to isolate the code that was causing the crash:</p>

<pre>
1   void foo() {
2      SimpleStringClass aString;
3      // ... intervening code
4      delete aString;  
       // first char* buffer delete          // occurs here
5   }   // second delete occurs 
        // after end of function

</pre>

<p>How did this code compile in the first place? My coworker said, "Oops. I was creating the <b>aString</b> instance on the heap, but then I put it on the stack, and I forgot to take out the <b>delete</b> at the end of the function." The variable <b>aString</b> is an instance, not a pointer, and the type system should have caught this error at compile time. An experiment showed that this similar code would not compile:</p>

<pre>
6   std::string otherString;
7   delete otherString;  
// this line won't compile

</pre>

<p>An old, unanswered question suggested itself as the reason why line 4 compiled. The ANSI C++ <b>std::string</b> is the only <b>string</b> class I have ever used that does not provide an <b>operator const char*()</b>, opting instead for an explicit <b>c_str()</b> method. I always wondered why, but had no answer until now.</p>

<p>Here's why. A <b>string</b> class with an <b>operator const char*()</b> creates a nasty little loophole in the type system. The compiler is able to find a syntactically valid interpretation of line 4 because of the user-defined <b>operator const char*()</b> conversion, which supplies the pointer needed by the <b>delete</b> operator. Line 4a, to follow, shows the compiler's interpretation of the previously mentioned line 4. You can see the conversion operator in action when you step through the code in a debugger.</p>

<pre>
4a  delete aString.operator const char*();

</pre>

<p>Once this line compiled, the code was doomed. This same problem will occur with every other <b>operator const char*()</b>-enabled <b>string </b>class. An error that should have been caught at compile time has now moved to runtime. This program has entered the realm of undefined behavior.</p>

<p>Those of you who program with the Microsoft compiler will find a different situation. Although the MFC <b>CString</b> class provides an <b>operator const char*()</b>, line 9 will not compile in Visual C++ 6.0:</p>

<pre>
8  CString c(foo);
9  delete c;     // won't compile with 		// Microsoft compiler

</pre>

<p>This is because the Microsoft 6.0 compiler will not apply the <b>delete</b> operator to a <b>const</b> pointer. However, this behavior does not conform to the C++ Standard, which says that it is not necessary to cast away <b>const</b> before applying the <b>delete</b> operator to a pointer (5.3.5.2). </p>

<p>Other classes also offer instance-to-pointer conversion operators; <b>operator const char*()</b> is not the only offender. Any user-defined conversion that converts an instance into a pointer will create the same hole in the type system. For example, this compiles:</p>

<pre>
10   delete std::cin;
10a  delete std::cin.operator void*(); 
// how the compiler interprets line 10

</pre>

<p>Some compilers, notably gcc, will warn that the <b>delete</b> operator is being applied to a <b>void*</b>, which is not a pointer-to-object type. However, the SGI, Solaris, and Microsoft compilers don't issue a warning, even at their maximum warning level.</p>

<p>It is worthwhile to look at the alternative strategies employed by some standard library classes. <b>std::string</b> requires that you use the <b>c_str()</b> member to access the underlying character array. The deceptively simple <b>std::auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;</b> class does not offer an <b>operator T*()</b>. Instead, it overrides <b>operator *()</b> and <b>operator -&gt;()</b>, and provides an explicit member function, <b>get()</b>, for access to its pointer. Even though <b>operator -&gt;()</b> returns a <b>T*</b>, that operator will be used only when an <b>explicit -&gt;</b> token is encountered. This is much different from an <b>operator T*()</b>, which will return a <b>T*</b> in any syntactically valid context. This allows you to use <b>std::auto_ptr</b> like a <b>T*</b>, but without the reduced type-safety drawbacks of an <b>operator T*()</b>.</p>

<p>Few programs are completely independent of the C character API. Any <b>string</b> class must therefore provide access to its <b>char*</b> buffer. In these situations, it is important to distinguish between what you need (access to the <b>const char*</b>) and how you are going to get it (conversion operator or member function). Sometimes, you don't have a choice. You need a particular capability and you need it to be implemented in a specific way. For example, any object that will be stored in an STL container class, such as <b>std::vector</b>, has to have an <b>operator=()</b>. The compiler will create one for you, but it's up to you to make it work the way you want. A member function called <b>assignMe() </b>is not an acceptable alternative to an <b>operator=()</b> in this situation. In contrast, we have options with the <b>string</b> class. The operator <b>const char*() </b>offers the most convenience, but that convenience comes at too high a cost, namely loss of type safety.  The type-safe solution is an explicit conversion function; this is why <b>std::string</b> makes you call its <b>c_str()</b> function to access its <b>const char*</b> payload.</p>

<p>Many traps and pitfalls lurk in a language as powerful and complex as C++. The ones we have examined here are just a few but they show how tricky user-defined conversions can be. As with type casts, conversion operators should be used only with the greatest of care. Instance-to-pointer conversions such as <b>operator const char*()</b> are especially hazardous. If you don't really need a conversion operator, prevent a potential bug and just don't write it. </p>
