<p>Dynamically adding new functionality at runtime greatly enhances the flexibility, robustness, and longevity of applications. While the usual approach to adding functionality is to introduce changes into the core source, it is often easier and more reliable to create plug-ins that fit into a predefined framework. Real-world uses include loadable network transports, protocols, formatting engines, security services, transaction services and management, and administration services.</p>

<p>To see the usefulness of plug-ins, all you have to do is look at Apache and J2EE. Apache has a well-defined plug-in framework and many plug-ins have been created for it, including mod_perl and mod_tcl. From a different platform, Java's J2EE shows the power of a fully developed runtime configuration environment. The entire implementation of J2EE Application Servers depends on the runtime loading and inspection capabilities of Java.</p>

<p>Like everything else in software, using plug-ins starts with design. You must formally define what functionality is plugged in and what functionality is built using traditional methods. The complete source code that implements this&#151;including build scripts&#151;is available at http://www.cuj .com/code/. </p>

<p>A plug-in is a compiled module you load into your program, initialize, and use at runtime. The specific plug-in can be created at any time during the application's life cycle, with or without access to the application's source code. Having an application load specific plug-ins is usually just a matter of a configuration change.</p>

<p>Physically, a plug-in is a shared object (.so) or shared library (.sl) in Linux/UNIX, or a dynamic link library (.dll) in Windows. For simplicity, I refer to these as "shared libraries." The shared library has a list of symbols that are normally method and variable names. Each of these symbols is marked as either present in the library or as required from another module (unresolved). </p>

<p>Symbols have a visibility. In UNIX, the visibility of a symbol is <b>Global</b>, <b>Local</b>, or <b>Weak</b>. </p>



<ul>
  <li><b>Global</b> symbols are unique across the process and are listed in a data structure called the "Global Symbol Table." <b>Global</b> symbols are visible to the entire program by their name.</li>
  <li><b>Local</b> symbols are only visible in a given compile unit (file) and are not visible to the rest of the process, at least not by name. </li>
  <li><b>Weak</b> symbols are functionally the same as <b>Global</b> symbols, except that if they conflict with a <b>Global</b> symbol during program link, they are suppressed in favor of the <b>Global</b> symbol. In UNIX, C-static functions and variables are <b>Local</b>, and everything else (including C++-static methods) is <b>Global</b>.</li>
  </ul>

<p>In Windows, symbols are either exported or local. Exported symbols are like <b>Global</b> symbols in UNIX, and local symbols are like their UNIX counterparts. To make a symbol exported, it has to be tagged as such. In Visual C++, this is done by marking classes and functions with <b>_declspec(dllexport)</b>.</p>

<p>When a shared library is loaded, its included <b>Global</b> symbols can be put into the process's global symbol table, allowing other modules to use those symbols by name. Once those symbols are loaded, the shared library's unresolved symbols must be resolved. The loader attempts to match these up with symbols in the process's global symbol table. If any symbols cannot be resolved, the load fails. In UNIX, the symbol resolution can either be immediate or take place on an as-needed basis (called "lazy resolution").</p>

<p>For symbol visibility, symbols can either be found or not by name. Because a function member is <b>Local</b> in a module does not mean that it cannot be executed from another module, it just means that its name is not valid in that file. If you somehow pass the address of the function to a function in another module, it can execute the <b>Local</b> function in another file with the address. For instance, signal handlers can be <b>Local</b> (C-static) but the address of the function is passed using the <b>signal()</b> function.</p>
<h3>Writing a Plug-In</h3>

<p>The only part that must be written in C is the initialization routine. You could also code that in C++, but then you have to worry about name mangling to find the routine, and name mangling is compiler dependent.</p>

<p>The keyword <b>static</b> is one of those overloaded keywords that means something different in C and C++. In C++, "static" simply means that there is no initial <b>this </b>pointer parameter in method invocations. The affect of <b>static</b> is purely for the compiler and makes little difference in the finished object file (except for the symbol name, of course). C++ static methods have a <b>Global</b> visibility, just like normal C++ methods.</p>

<p>In C, "static" has an entirely different meaning. If a method or variable is declared <b>static</b>, it is marked as a <b>Local</b> symbol within its final object file. This means that any number of files can have C static functions with exactly the same name and they will not conflict. Of course, those functions will only be visible to other functions within the same file.</p>

<p>If you are going to plug in new functionality that you do not know about in advance, how do you know what it will be named and how do you initialize it? You solve this problem using a C <b>static</b> function (and in Windows, that's the <b>_declspec(dllexport)</b> function). All initialization methods for a plug-in have the same name, which you define upfront. The method must be C-static so that the symbol is <b>Local </b>and you won't have conflicts among multiple plug-ins.</p>

<p>To load a plug-in, instruct the dynamic loader on your platform to load the library. Once it's loaded correctly, find the symbol for the initialization method. Remember that you must use a special function to find the function's address, since it will not be exported into the process's global symbol table. Once you find the function, run it.</p>

<p><a href="0407musgrovel1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> is the header for an example plug-in manager. For now, ignore everything except the <b>typedef</b> for <b>plugin_init_func()</b>. Notice that the initialization function is responsible for returning a concrete object of type <b>Plugin</b>. <a href="0407musgrovel2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a> shows the source code for the first example module. Notice that it fulfills the contract by returning a new <b>EnglishTestPlugin</b>, a specific type of <b>Plugin</b>.</p>
<h3>Loading the Plug-In</h3>

<p>Writing the plug-in is straightforward and almost completely platform independent (with the minor irritation of <b>_declspec(dllexport)</b>, which I take care of with a <b>#define</b>). Loading the plug-in is not nearly so simple because UNIX and Windows use completely different APIs for these purposes.</p>

<p>Referring to <a href="0407musgrovel3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>, SharedLibrary.h, you see the abstraction of these two different APIs into a common module. The implementations of the class <b>SharedLibrary</b> are platform specific.</p>

<p>Referring to <a href="0407musgrovel4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>, UnixSharedPlugin.cxx, you see how I implement this functionality on UNIX. To open the UNIX shared library, I use the function <b>dlopen</b>. I give <b>dlopen</b> the name of the module I would like to load; if you pass <b>NULL</b> as the name, you get a handle to the currently running global symbol object, giving the ability to process the global symbol table.</p>

<p>Notice that I pass in the flags <b>RTLD_NOW</b> and <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> to <b>dlopen</b>. <b>RTLD_NOW</b> tells the loader to resolve all internal references to external code immediately. The opposite is <b>RTLD_LAZY</b>, telling the runtime system to resolve functions on an as-needed basis. <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> tells the loader to use <b>Global</b> symbols within this module to resolve unresolved symbols within other modules that are loaded (the opposite, and the default, is <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b>).</p>

<p>For any errors that occur, <b>dlerror</b> retrieves the error text. <b>dlerror </b>can only be called once; any subsequent call without an error will return <b>NULL</b> (two calls in a row to <b>dlerror</b> always returns <b>NULL</b>). Calls to <b>dlerror</b> change its internal state, which itself depends on previous calls to other dynamic loader functions. That, by itself, makes these APIs thread-unsafe. The dynamic loading APIs are not thread-safe and proper locking must be used in a multithreaded program.</p>

<p>The destructor for <b>UnixSharedLibrary</b> calls the <b>dlclose</b> function. This closes a shared library. The shared library will not be unloaded from memory until there are no more handles held open to it and none of its symbols are used by other modules.</p>

<p><b>dlsym</b> finds symbols in the library. This function returns a pointer to a symbol given its name; it's up to the program to ensure this pointer is used properly (it's just a simple <b>void </b>pointer). If <b>dlsym</b> returns <b>NULL</b> to indicate an error, the error text can be retrieved using <b>dlerror</b>.</p>

<p>To do its work, <b>dlsym</b> requires a handle. The handle is normally one returned by <b>dlopen</b>. The special handle <b>RTLD_NEXT</b> tells the loader to look in each module loaded after the one <b>dlsym</b> is called from for the symbol. This function is not terribly useful for our purposes and is typically used by things such as memory profilers.</p>

<p><a href="0407musgrovel5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a> is my Windows implementation of the shared library loader. Like most Windows-equivalent APIs, it is a bit more complicated than UNIX. (I'll leave the debate as to whether this adds richness or unneeded complexity to those who enjoy discussing that sort of thing.)</p>

<p>In Windows, <b>LoadLibrary</b> loads a DLL into the process and handles loading-dependent libraries and resolving symbols. It returns a handle to the library. If the handle is <b>NULL</b>, that indicates an error. The error code is returned using the <b>GetLastError</b> API, which can be converted to readable text using the <b>FormatMessage</b> function (see the source for an example of doing that).</p>

<p>The Windows equivalent of our <b>dlclose</b> method is <b>FreeLibrary</b>, while the Windows equivalent of <b>dlsym</b> is <b>GetProcAddress</b>.</p>
<h3>Managing Plug-Ins </h3>

<p>The shared-library abstraction provides only the most basic way to deal with plug-ins. A plug-in manager is required to give a useful framework on top of the shared-library abstraction. That manager should return a plug-in given a name (optionally loading it if it is not resident). It should also handle initializing a plug-in when it is loaded. <a href="0407musgrovel6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a> is the source for the plug-in manager I present here.</p>

<p>The important logic is in <b>PluginManager::findPlugin</b>. The basic flow is that when a plug-in is requested, an internal table is consulted to see if the plug-in is already loaded. If it is not loaded, the plug-in manager loads the plug-in and attempts to initialize it. Assuming that all goes well, the plug-in is returned to the caller.</p>

<p>The plug-in manager must be told what plug-in to load. A naive implementation would just give the plug-in manager the physical shared-library name. It is better to have some external configuration that goes from a logical plug-in name (say, <b>_program_text</b>) to a library name (say, <b>_EnglishTextPlugin.dll</b>). When new plug-ins are written in the future, the name in the configuration just needs to be changed.</p>

<p>From Plugin.h, you see I define the class <b>PluginNameMap</b>. Its responsibility is to convert logical names to physical names. The example implementation looks up the logical name in the environment using <b>getenv</b>. It expects to find the physical name there. </p>
<h3>Putting It all Together</h3>

<p>The plug-in example is enabling a simple program to have multiple languages and load the language driver at runtime. There are, of course, much better ways to enable multiple languages, but this makes a great "Hello World" style example. You have already seen the <b>EnglishTextPlugin</b>. The <b>SpanishTextPlugin</b> is included in the complete source code.</p>

<p>The <b>Text</b> drivers are expected to be of type <b>TextPlugin</b>, which itself inherits from <b>Plugin</b>. During casting, I use C++'s <b>dynamic_cast</b> to ensure the type correctness. Without C++-style casting, other, less-reliable mechanisms must be used to ensure the loaded plug-in is a type that is expected (such as using the <b>Plugin::pluginType</b> method in conjunction with C-style casting). <a href="0407musgrovel7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a> shows the abstract class <b>TextPlugin</b>. The method that must be implemented is <b>getSayHelloString</b>.</p>

<p><a href="0407musgrovel8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a> is main.cxx, the main driver for this example. It simply loads a plug-in named <b>_language</b>. The plug-in manager resolves this logical name to a physical name using <b>getenv</b>, so the library name (either EnglishTextPlugin.dll/.so/.sl or SpanishTextPlugin.dll/.so/.sl) must be in that variable and be able to be found in the path.</p>

<p>Of course, building this example is different on almost every platform. For convenience, I have included a build script that will build this example on Windows, Linux, Solaris, and HP-UX in the complete source code as build.sh. </p>

<p>If you build and run this example and switch <b>_language</b> between Spanish and English, you'll see that things are changing at runtime depending on the environment. </p>
<h3>Security </h3>

<p>A few years ago, this article would have been written and published without a mention of security. These days, however, it is important that security be considered. With plug-ins, remember that code will be loaded into a process and then run as that process. If your program can be tricked into loading a mischievous module, the code in that module will get to do whatever that legitimate program could do.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Once you get the hang of it, you can put together applications that are extremely flexible and have a long lifespan. They will also be insulated against requirement changes impacting the core source of a system. When designing your system to load code at runtime, don't forget proper design of generic interfaces. During deployment, configuration and security are the central considerations. In the end, dynamic applications are often more useful and valuable than their static counterparts. </p>
