<p>Metaprogramming is about writing code that performs some task at compile time. You could optimize code (loop unrolling, for instance), compute a value (factorial of a number), manipulate compile-time data structures (such as type lists), or perform compile-time selection of appropriate algorithms to be executed at runtime. But no matter how useful metacode might be, there are restrictions on what can be done with it. The biggest hurdle to the endemic use of meta code is that most information needed to perform computations is only available at runtime.</p>

<p>Selection and looping have become the two key cornerstones of the Turing/von Neuman model of computation. Both these ideas can be simulated in C++ metacode using partial specialization and recursion in templates. </p>

<p>Metaloops are implemented in C++ using recursive template instantiation. Typically, implementing metaloops requires the creation of a primary template class to perform recursion and a specialization to end the recursion. This pattern is implemented each time a metaloop is needed. If you can decouple the logic of creating a loop from the computation performed within it, then you can reuse the code that implements the looping logic. </p>

<p>It is somewhat common these days to encounter a template named something like <b>If&lt;&gt;</b> or <b>IfThenElse&lt;&gt;</b> that handles compile-time selection [1]. This does not seem to be the case for metaloops, however. Metaloops are fundamentally more complex than metaselection. It is difficult to have a general-purpose looping construct that can satisfy every need effectively. Sometimes less general-purpose solutions can be more effective. In this article, I'll examine ideas around encapsulating metaloops and consider their usefulness.</p>
<h3>Taking a First Stab </h3>

<p><a href="0408naikl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> demonstrates the traditional-style metacode to perform looping. The code uses metalooping to print all numbers in an inclusive range. </p>

<p>The first class is the primary template that provides the recursion, and the second template, which is a specialization of the first, is used to terminate the recursion. The primary template does one iteration worth of work (in this case, print an integer), then moves on to the next iteration by recursively instantiating itself. The template argument <b>start</b> is incremented prior to each recursive instantiation. The recursion continues until the value of <b>start</b> is equal to the value of <b>end</b>. At this point, the specialization kicks in and ends the recursion. The template parameter <b>start</b> implements a loop counter, and <b>end</b> marks the inclusive upper limit for <b>start</b>. </p>

<p>It would simplify things if you could package this metalooping logic into some kind of library construct (let's call it <b>Loop</b>) that can be used as in <a href="0408naikl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>. Here, <b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b> repeatedly invokes the function or function object passed to it with sequential numbers in the range [1,20]. You can see in <a href="0408naikl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> that the loop's body is tightly coupled with the looping logic, but in <a href="0408naikl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a> these have been decoupled using the <b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b> template. The loop's body is implemented as a unary function (or function object) and passed to <b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b>. Assuming the compiler can inline call to <b>print</b>, the code is unrolled into 20 inline <b>cout</b> statements, in both <a href="0408naikl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listings 1</a> and <a href="0408naikl2" target="_BLANK">2</a>. Metaloops are automatically unrolled at compile time. You should be able unroll a loop as long as you can deterministically tell at compile time (within the limits of the language) exactly how many times the loop needs to be executed. In reality, this statement is a simplification and does not tell the whole story. You may have already figured out that there can be more involved with loops than simple loop counters. Consequently, <b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b> is not always going to fit your needs. </p>

<p><b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b>'s implementation (<a href="0408naikl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a>) is straightforward, and is based on the traditional metalooping technique. A more robust implementation would also include an overloaded version of the <b>eval</b> member function taking a <b>const T&amp; expr</b> parameter to allow use of <b>const</b> function objects as arguments. </p>

<p><b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b> provides basic flexibility in specifying the start and end values of the range for the "loop counter," and makes this loop counter available to each iteration. Being a sophisticated template programmer, you try to use <b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b> for all your metalooping needs and soon run into its limitations. You may like to use nested metalooping to unroll a loop that walks through your two-dimensional array and initializes each element. <a href="0408naikl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a> implements <b>Loop2&lt;&gt;</b>, which adds support for nested looping (one level only). </p>

<p>Using <b>Loop2&lt;&gt;</b> for nested loops is straightforward. <a href="0408naikl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a> initializes a two-dimensional array with random values. The ternary function <b>elem_init</b> is used to implement the loop's body. It assigns a random value to the specified element of an array. You first bind the 5&times;6 array <b>my_array</b> to the first parameter of the <b>elem_init</b> function using <b>boost::bind</b> (from the Boost library), then use the resulting binary function object as the outer loop's body. The outer loop binds a value to the first parameter and passes the resulting unary function to the inner loop. The inner loop finally executes the loop's body. To initialize a 5&times;6 array, you need an outer loop to generate array indices in the range [0-4] and an inner loop to generate array indices in [0,5]. <b>Loop2&lt;0, 4, Loop2&lt;0, 5&gt; &gt;::eval(....)</b> provides you with this nested looping infrastructure. </p>

<p>What if you need to increment the value of your loop counter by some arbitrary amount (say 2, to print every alternate number in the range)? In that case, you need to be able to customize the increment logic. What if you require more "state" than simply an integral loop counter? For instance, you may want to have typelists or some other complex compile-time data structure as part of the loop's state. This means that you need to replace the loop counter with some custom-defined state and the looping condition should be customizable, too. You should be able to implement a compile-time predicate that is aware of your custom-defined state and use this predicate to control the loop. So is <b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b> any good? If your needs are restricted to simple loop unrolling instead of sophisticated compile-time algorithms (which I feel is true more often), then <b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b>, or a custom variant of it, can be a simple, effective, and easy-to-use tool. </p>
<h3>Compile-Time Selection Techniques</h3>

<p>There are several useful techniques for performing compile-time selection. These will be required for implementing more advanced looping schemes. In <a href="0408naikl6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a>, <b>If_else&lt;&gt;</b> demonstrates a typical implementation of one compile-time selection technique. The first parameter <b>b</b> is defined as a Boolean value and the remaining two are type parameters. If <b>b</b> is <b>true</b>, then <b>If_else&lt;&gt;::result</b> is <b>typedef</b>ed to the first type; otherwise, to the second type. In <a href="0408naikl7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a>, you can see <b>If_else&lt;&gt;</b> being used. It first defines a simple predicate, <b>isSmall</b>, which verifies if a type has size less than 2. (Later on, the predicate is used along with the <b>If_else&lt;&gt;</b> to determine the type for <b>foo</b>.) </p>

<p>A common optimization to the aforementioned technique relies on C++'s rule dealing with instantiation of members of a template class. In short, the rule says that the compiler instantiates a member of a template class only when (and if) it is explicitly referenced. This is different from the rule for nontemplate classes, where all members are instantiated along with the class. The declaration of <b>foo</b> in <a href="0408naikl7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a> instantiates <b>A&lt;T1&gt;</b>, <b>A&lt;T1&gt;:: result</b>, <b>B&lt;T1&gt;, B&lt;T1&gt;:: result</b>, <b>isSmall&lt;T1&gt;, isSmall&lt;T1&gt;::result</b>, <b>If_else&lt;...&gt;</b>, and <b>If_else&lt;...&gt;::result</b>. The order of instantiation should also to be noted. <b>isSmall</b>, <b>A</b>, and <b>B</b> will be instantiated in an unspecified order prior to instantiating <b>If_else&lt;&gt;</b>. </p>

<p>In <a href="0408naikl7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a>, you don't really need to instantiate both <b>A&lt;T1&gt;::result</b> and <b>B&lt;T1&gt;::result</b>, since you will only use one or the other. For simple cases, it's a nonissue, but sometimes it can be expensive in terms of compilation time. <b>A&lt;T1&gt;::result</b> and <b>B&lt;T1&gt;::result</b> could both be another <b>If_else&lt;&gt;</b>, which, in turn, contains several more levels of selection. Or it could have been some expensive metacode dealing with long typelists. To get around redundant instantiation of template members, you need to delay any referencing of those members until it is absolutely required. <i>C++ Templates</i>, by David Vandevoorde and Nicolai Josuttis (Addison-Wesley, 2002), provides an analysis of how compile time is reduced by taking advantage of delayed template member instantiation using square root calculation as an example.</p>

<p><a href="0408naikl8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a> shows a modified version of the <b>If_else</b> template called <b>If</b>. References to <b>A&lt;T1&gt;</b> and <b>B&lt;T1&gt;</b>'s member result has been tucked inside the <b>If</b> template in <a href="0408naikl8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a>. Since the first argument to <b>If&lt;&gt;</b> is <b>false</b>, the template specialization <b>If&lt;false, T, F&gt;</b> kicks into play and references only <b>B&lt;T1&gt;::result</b>. Consequently, <b>A&lt;T1&gt;::result</b> is not referenced or instantiated. This selection technique implies that the two type parameters <b>T</b> and <b>F</b> need to provide a member type named <b>result</b>. In some cases, you may want to pass simple types such as <b>int</b> and <b>float</b> that do not have such members. This is can be solved by using a simple adapter class template that wraps the nonconformant type.</p>

<pre>
template&lt;typename T&gt;  struct wrap {  typedef T result; };
typedef If_else &lt;  false , 
                    wrap&lt;int&gt; , 
                    wrap&lt;char&gt;  &gt;::result  bar;

</pre>

<p><b>If&lt;&gt;</b> selects one of two types based on a Boolean value. You may sometimes need to select at compile time a piece of code to execute at runtime, based upon a Boolean value:</p>

<pre>
template &lt;bool b , typename T, typename F&gt;
struct If_exec
{
    static void exec() {
        T::exec();
    }
};
template &lt;typename T , typename F&gt;
struct If_exec &lt;false , T , F&gt;
{
    static void exec() {
        F::exec();
    }
};

</pre>

<p><b>If_exec&lt;&gt;::exec()</b> invokes <b>T::exec()</b> if <b>b</b> is <b>true</b>, or else <b>F::exec()</b>. Since <b>operator()</b> cannot be defined as a static member function, you require the function object to define a static member function called <b>exec</b> instead. <b>If_exec&lt;&gt;</b> turns out to be a very useful tool for unrolling loops that need to conditionally execute some code in each iteration.</p>
<h3>A Grand Looping Scheme</h3>

<p><a href="0408naikl9.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 9</a> is a solution that overcomes <b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b>'s limitations. The template class <b>For</b> models the language-provided <b>for</b> looping construct. <a href="0408naikf1.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 1</a> shows the five different aspects that make up a <b>for</b> construct in C/C++.</p>

<p>You can simplify things by performing the initialization just prior to invoking <b>For&lt;&gt;</b>. That leaves you with four aspects to deal with, instead of five, when implementing <b>For&lt;&gt;</b>. It is up to users to define each of these four aspects and pass them as template parameters to <b>For&lt;&gt;</b>. <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> takes these and orchestrates them into a metaloop resembling the runtime <b>for</b>. Contrast this with <b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b>, which defined most of these policies internally.</p>

<p><b>For&lt;&gt;</b> consists of two members. The first member is a type called <b>result</b> and the second is a function called <b>exec()</b>. Member function <b>exec()</b> is used for loop unrolling type tasks. The member type <b>result </b>is used for metaloops that produce either a constant value (such as factorial of a number) or a type (such as a typelist sorted on type size) at compile time. <b>resul</b>t and <b>exec()</b> provide two independent services and do not depend on each other.</p>

<p>Input to <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> is comprised of the looping condition (<b>condition</b>), body of loop (<b>body</b>), the increment logic (<b>increment</b>), and the preinitialized state (<b>state</b>). <b>body</b> performs one iteration of a loop. <b>For&lt;&gt;::exec()</b> requires <b>body</b> to define a static member function, also called <b>exec()</b>, that invokes zero or more (runtime) executable statements. On the other hand, <b>For&lt;&gt;::result</b> requires <b>body</b> to define a member type, called <b>result</b>, representing the output of the <b>body</b>'s actions on the loop's <b>state</b>. <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> always requires <b>body</b> to be a template that has only one type of argument (which will be the loop's <b>state</b>). Both <b>condition</b> and <b>increment</b> take <b>state</b> as an argument.</p>

<p>Here's how <b>For&lt;&gt;::result</b> does its job: <b>body</b> and <b>increment</b> are expected to operate on the <b>state</b> argument and make the new <b>state</b> output available in their <b>result</b> member. <b>condition</b>, on the other hand, only runs some checks on <b>state</b> and provides a <b>true</b>/<b>false</b> value in its <b>result</b>. <b>state</b> is an arbitrary, user-defined data type whose internals are known only to <b>condition</b>, <b>increment</b>, and <b>body</b>. <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> takes the results of their operations and orchestrates the loop.</p>

<p><b>For&lt;&gt;</b> performs the following steps (similar to <b>for</b> barring initialization). Again, <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> mimics the steps preformed by the <b>for </b>construct (barring initialization):</p>



<ol>
  <li>if (looping condition is true).    </li>
  <li>	   a.  execute body (passing in state)</li>
  <li>	   b.  execute increment (passing in the state obtained by executing         body) </li>
  <li>	   c.  continue on to next iteration    </li>
  <li>else leave state unmodified and end the loop</li>
</ol>



<p><b>For&lt;&gt;</b> employs <b>If&lt;&gt;</b> to make decisions in steps 1 and 2. For steps 1(a) and (b), it uses the <b>body</b> and <b>increment</b> parameters, respectively. And for step 1(c), a recursive reference to <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> is used. When making this recursive reference, <b>condition</b>, <b>increment</b>, and <b>body</b> are passed on without any change. <b>state</b>, on the other hand, is expected to change at the end of each iteration. The new <b>state</b> for the next iteration is <b>increment&lt; body&lt;state&gt;::result &gt;::result</b>. This essentially executes <b>body</b> first, then <b>increment</b> on <b>state</b> to obtain the new <b>state</b>. If neither <b>increment</b> nor <b>body</b> modify <b>state</b>, you could end up with infinite recursion, as <b>condition&lt;state&gt;::result</b> produces <b>true</b> ad infinitum. Next, iteration is pursued only if <b>condition&lt;state&gt;::result</b> is <b>true</b>; else, the current <b>state</b> is returned as the final result of the looping operation. Since <b>state</b> can be any arbitrary type, <b>wrap&lt;&gt;</b> adapts <b>state</b>'s interface to <b>If&lt;&gt;</b>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of interesting details to note in the implementation of <b>For&lt;&gt;</b>. First is the order of instantiation of templates. All arguments to a template are instantiated (in an unspecified order) prior to instantiating the template itself. Thus, the compiler instantiates <b>state</b>, then <b>condition&lt;state&gt;</b>, and finally <b>condition&lt;state&gt;::result</b>. Similarly, template arguments to the recursive <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> reference are instantiated prior to that <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> reference. There is no guarantee on which of three arguments to <b>If&lt;&gt;</b> is instantiated first, and <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> does not rely on their order of instantiation. But it does rely on the <b>body</b> operation being "executed" (that is, <b>body&lt;...&gt;::result</b> being instantiated) prior to the <b>increment</b> operation and making <b>body</b>'s result available to <b>increment</b>. Making <b>body&lt;state&gt;::result</b> an argument to <b>increment</b> achieves the desired behavior. </p>

<p>The second interesting detail to note is the use of <b>If&lt;&gt;</b> to delay the instantiation of <b>For&lt;&gt;::result</b>. Consider what would happen if you used <b>If_else&lt;&gt;</b> instead of <b>If&lt;&gt;</b> as follows:</p>

<pre>
If_else&lt; condition&lt;...&gt;::result , For&lt;...&gt;::result , wrap&lt;...&gt;::result &gt;, 

</pre>

<p>This would cause the compiler to instantiate <b>For&lt;...&gt;::result</b> and <b>wrap&lt;...&gt;::result</b> upfront, regardless of the value of <b>condition&lt;...&gt;::result</b>. Instantiating <b>For&lt;...&gt;::result</b> at this point means an attempt to compute the next iteration. This creates an infinite dependency chain where each iteration requires the next iteration to be computed, all along ignoring <b>condition&lt;...&gt;::result</b>'s indications to stop/continue the recursion. </p>

<p><a href="0408naikl10.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 10</a> is a metaprogram using <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> to compute square roots. The template class <b>sqroot</b> makes use of <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> to implement its metalooping. The algorithm searches for the square root of a number <b>N</b> in the range [0,<b>N</b>]. In each iteration, the range is halved and the search continues in either the first half or the second half. If the square of the midpoint of this range is greater than or equal to <b>N</b>, then the search continues in the first half; otherwise, in the second half. Four templates need to be defined to implement the various aspects of the loop. <b>sqrt_state</b> holds the number (<b>num</b>) whose square root is to be found and two variables (<b>low</b> and <b>high</b>) marking a range in which the search for the square root is to be carried out. <b>sqrt_body</b> updates this range on each iteration of the loop. <b>sqrt_cond</b> checks to see whether the <b>state::low</b> has crossed <b>state::high</b>, in which case you have found the answer. In this example, <b>sqrt_incr</b> leaves the state unmodified. You need to compare this <b>For&lt;&gt;</b>-based solution to a solution that uses hand-implemented metaloops. Comparing <a href="0408naikl10.html" target="_BLANK">Listings 10</a> and <a href="0408naikl11.html" target="_BLANK">11</a>, you can clearly see that the <b>For&lt;&gt;</b>-based solution needed more lines of code. It did the looping for me, but I ended up writing more code to define the different arguments it needed. A bit of a shock when you consider that <b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b>, which did very little, bought a lot more, where applicable, than the "wonderfully customizable" <b>For&lt;&gt;</b>. </p>
<h3>Nesting</h3>

<p>An interesting point to note about <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> is that its high degree of generality automatically supports the creation of arbitrarily deep levels of nested loops. <a href="0408naikl12.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 12</a> illustrates the general idea. Nesting is achieved by passing another <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> in the <b>body</b> argument. The inner and outer loops are required to share the same state as the outer loop passes its state to the inner loop. Each loop generally has its own unique <b>increment</b>, <b>condition</b>, and <b>body</b>. When defining the inner loop, you do not explicitly pass any <b>state</b> to the inner loop. You pass <b>state</b> only to the outer loop, which, in turn, passes <b>state</b> to the inner loop on each iteration of the outer loop. Defining the inner loop without the state requires simulating template <b>typedef</b>s (forthcoming in C++0x), which lets you take an existing template with multiple parameters and bind only some of the parameters to arguments. In <a href="0408naikl12.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 12</a>, <b>inner_loop&lt;&gt;</b> binds all parameters of the inner <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> loop except <b>state</b>. Nesting is then achieved by passing <b>inner_loop&lt;&gt;</b> to a <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> in the <b>body</b> argument. Deeply nested metaloops is one area where <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> can reduce your lines of code and at the same time improve readability.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>A general-purpose tool like <b>For&lt;&gt;</b> is difficult to implement and likely to have usability issues for simple loops. But simple tools such as <b>Loop&lt;&gt;</b>, having relatively fewer areas of application, are fairly easy to invent and use. It is likely that a small collection of such simpler classes stand a good chance of tackling most (if not all) of your metalooping needs better than a general-purpose class such as <b>For&lt;&gt;</b>. </p>

<p>Template meta code often gets very dense due to the syntactic requirements and, in some cases, the need to work around some language limitations. Classes that encapsulate compile-time selection can help in reducing code without introducing overhead. One issue to keep in mind when writing meta code that uses recursive templates is the depth of recursion. Different compilers support different depths of recursively nested template instantiations. The C++ Standard "recommends" (in Annex B) a minimum depth of 17 to be supported. Fortunately, many compilers report a clear error message once their recursion limit has been reached.</p>
