<p>Implementations of numerical methods should provide some variety of numerical schemes applied to the mathematical model of the problem. Computing the schemes at runtime can ruin the computational efficiency, which is often very important. In ideal cases, such programs must store some constants describing a particular scheme. Of course, they can be evaluated using mathematical tools such as Mathematica, but can't always give you the desired variety and flexibility. Consequently, the question that came to my mind is: Why can't C++ compilers handle formulas analytically like Mathematica, computing necessary constants at compile time? Studying template techniques such as Andrei Alexandrescu's typelists [1] led me to suspect that this is possible. Further thinking about this led me to the following: Data of a computationally intensive program can be divided into compile-time known data and runtime known data. In this way, compilers can treat and simplify the former, then build a bridge to the runtime data using expression templates.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, modeling shape functions (SF) that arise in the finite element method (FEM) as polynomials. A chosen finite element approximation corresponds to a specific set of SFs defined by elements of a computational grid. The discrete weak formulation of a partial differential equation (PDE) to be solved by the FEM includes integrals of some products of these SFs, their derivatives, or a mixture of the two. The usual FEM approach uses a mapping from a grid's element to the unit element: To the segment [0,1] in one-dimensional case (1D), to the unit triangle or unit square in 2D, and to the unit tetrahedron or unit hexahedron in 3D. Then the necessary integrals over grid elements are the same integrals over unit elements (compile-time data), multiplied by corresponding Jacobi determinants (runtime data). Therefore, the compiler can evaluate the integrals over unit elements if the dimension of a problem and order of the SFs are specified as constants.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Background</h3>

<p>The FEM numerically solves a PDE on some domain W <img src="memof14.gif">R<b><sup>d</sup></b> (<b>d</b>=1,2,3) discretized by a computational grid <b>T</b>. The solution <b>u</b> is interpolated using SFs <b>N<sub>i</sub>(x)</b>, as in <a href="0408myrnyye1.html" target="_BLANK">Example 1</a>(a), where <b>n</b> is a number of vertices in the grid <b>T</b>, and <b>u<sub>i</sub></b> are values of the solution <b>u</b> in these vertices. Therefore, the SF <b>N<sub>i</sub></b> equals 1 in the vertex <b>i</b>, and 0 in the rest of the vertices. <a href="0408myrnyyf1.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 1</a> presents examples of such functions of the first and second order on triangles.</p>

<p>For the sample model Poisson equation written in the weak form in <a href="0408myrnyye1.html" target="_BLANK">Example 1</a>(b), the weighting function <b>W</b><img src="equiv12.gif"><b>N</b> defines the most popular Galerkin FEM. Then the substitution of the solution <b>u</b> from <a href="0408myrnyye1.html" target="_BLANK">Example 1</a>(a) gives the discrete formulation of the problem in <a href="0408myrnyye1.html" target="_BLANK">Example 1</a>(c). The latter yields the <b>k</b><sup>th</sup> row of the sparse stiffness matrix. Its elements <b>a<sub>ki</sub></b> are only nonzero if the vertices <b>k</b> and <b>i</b> are adjacent. Taking into account given boundary conditions, the constructed linear algebraic system of equations has a unique solution <b>{u<sub>i</sub>}</b>. However, we are only interested in the compile-time computation of the integrals in the left side of the equation in <a href="0408myrnyye1.html" target="_BLANK">Example 1</a>(c), which are evaluated on the grid elements <b>K</b><img src="rtu.gif"><b>T</b> separately. The linear mapping <b>K</b><img src="arrow14.gif"><b>K<sub>0</sub></b> from a grid element <b>K</b> into the unit element <b>K<sub>0</sub></b> disjoins the compile-time and the runtime data; see <a href="0408myrnyye1.html" target="_BLANK">Example 1</a>(d), where <b>J</b> is a Jacobi determinant dependent on the grid.</p>

<p>The next theoretical question is an automated, recursive construction of the SFs on the unit element. <a href="0408myrnyye2.html" target="_BLANK">Example 2</a>(a) shows the general form of a second-order shape function on a triangle. In this case, there are exactly six uniformly distributed points (degrees of freedom) on a triangle to find the unknown coefficients <b>a<sub>0</sub></b>,...,<b>a<sub>5</sub></b> (<a href="0408myrnyyf2.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 2</a>). The function <b>N<sub>i</sub>(x,y)</b> equals 1 in the point <b>i</b> and is zero in other points. But it is not obvious how you calculate the coefficients. <a href="0408myrnyye2.html" target="_BLANK">Example 2</a>(b) shows a more flexible approach to defining an SF as a product of linear polynomials [3], where <b>L<sub>k</sub>=0</b> are equations of "lines" that cross all points except <b>i</b>. To write <a href="0408myrnyye2.html" target="_BLANK">Example 2</a>(a) in this form, you first need to introduce a convenient enumeration of the degrees of freedom on the unit triangle. To do this, you can use a tuple <b>{i,j}</b>, where <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> mean the number of the point along the <b>x</b>- and <b>y</b>-axis, respectively. Such a method would suit the unit triangle and unit square, and can be used as a triplet to the 3D case as well. So, the second order SF number <b>{1,0}</b> (that is, <b>x=1/2</b>, <b>y=0</b>), for instance, on the unit triangle is <a href="0408myrnyye2.html" target="_BLANK">Example 2</a>(c), where <b>x=0</b> crosses and makes the function <b>N<sub>1,0</sub></b> zero in the points <b>{0,0}</b>, <b>{0,1}</b>, and <b>{0,2}</b>, while the second term <b>x-y=1</b> crosses <b>{0,2}</b>, <b>{1,1}</b>, and <b>{2,0}</b> (see <a href="0408myrnyyf2.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 2</a>). The integer coefficient in front ensures that the SF equals 1 in the point (1/2,0). Keeping in mind the linear terms as "lines" over degrees of freedom lets you generalize and automate the SF building process. Defining the order of an SF as <b>m</b>, there are three types of the "lines" on the unit triangle:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Parallel to <b>y</b>-axis: <b>mx</b>, <b>mx-1</b>,..., <b>mx-m</b>.</li>
  <li>Parallel to <b>x</b>-axis: <b>my</b>, <b>my-1</b>,..., <b>my-m</b>.</li>
  <li>Diagonal: <b>1-mx-my</b>, <b>2-mx-my</b>,..., <b>m-mx-my</b>.</li>
</ul>



<p>The SF <b>N<sub>0,0<sup>m</sub></sup></b> consists only of the terms of the third type. The first step along the <b>x</b>-axis is to replace the first term of the third type with the first term of the first type. The second step along the <b>x</b>-axis requires two terms of the first type instead of the third type, and so on. Moving on, the <b>y</b>-axis corresponds to the second type terms in the same way. <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(a) is the general formulation. This formula remains similar in the 3D case. The diagonal terms are defined by <b>(1-mx-my-mz)</b>,...,<b>(m-mx-my-mz)</b>. The linear terms parallel to the corresponding axes <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, and <b>z</b> are the same. So, the generalization in <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(a) to the <b>d</b>-dimensional case is straightforward.</p>

<p>To automate the building of an SF for the unit square, consider the SF <b>N<sub>0,0</sub></b> in <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(b). Its groups of the linear terms are strictly separated by the coordinate. There are no mixed diagonal terms. Moving along the <b>x</b>-axis, for instance, forces you to replace the first terms in <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(b) with the terms <b>mx</b>, <b>mx-1</b>,..., <b>mx-m+1</b>, which are actually negatives of the terms in <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(b). Although tricky, the procedure preserves the correct sign of the SF. The SF coefficient is evaluated in the same way as in <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(a). The generalization of the procedure to the <b>d</b>-dimensional case is also clear.</p>

<p>The differentiation and integration of an SF would certainly be simpler in the polynomial standard form. This form appears after multiplication of the linear terms and represents a sum of the products <b>cx<sub>1<sup>p1</sub></sup></b>...<b>x<sub>d<sup>pd</sub></sup></b>. The integrals of such a product over the unit <b>d</b>-dimensional tetrahedron <b>T<sub>0</sub></b> and hexahedron <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> are shown in <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(c) and 3(d). These formulas can be proved due to the induction on <b>d</b>. They always result in the inverse of an integer number and are identical if <b>d=1</b>. These are all necessary formulas to compute an integral in the right side of <a href="0408myrnyye1.html" target="_BLANK">Example 1</a>(d) that I'll now implement using template metaprogramming.</p>
<h3>Numlist: A Compile-Time Array</h3>

<p>A numlist is like a typelist [1], where the first template parameter is an integer number.</p>

<pre>
template&lt;int Number, class T&gt;
struct Numlist
{
   enum { value = Number };
   typedef T Tail;
};

</pre>

<p><b>Numlist</b> does not define any functionality or runtime data. It holds an integer compile-time constant value and a type <b>Tail</b>, which can be either a next <b>Numlist</b> or <b>NullType</b> ending an array. For instance, the compile-time array <b>{3,-2,1}</b> would be:</p>

<pre>
Numlist&lt;3,Numlist&lt;-2,Numlist&lt;1,NullType&gt; &gt; &gt;

</pre>

<p>It isn't difficult to implement all the typelist's operations for the <b>Numlist</b> distinguishing between template parameters as integer numbers and as numlists, which are types. The <b>Append</b> operation, for instance, disaggregates into an addition of a number <b>Num</b>:</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class NList, int Num&gt;
struct Append;

</pre>

<p>and an addition of a numlist <b>List</b> to the end of <b>NList</b>.</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class NList, class List&gt;
struct AppendList;

</pre>

<p>Aside from the typelist's imported operations and linearization by a macro, <b>Numlist</b> lets you define pure numeric operations, including addition, multiplication, <b>Sum</b>, <b>Min</b>, <b>Max</b>, <b>Sort</b>, and more complicated operations as well (see Numlist.h, available at http://www .cuj.com/code/). Everything related to numlist operations&#151;including its definition&#151;is implemented in the <b>NL</b> namespace. It has also its own empty class, <b>NL::NullType</b>, to define the end of a numlist. For example, consider the template algorithms in <a href="0408myrnyyl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>, which generate a numlist of the length <b>Len</b> with the default element <b>Value</b>. This is actually a simple loop from <b>Len</b> to 0, which is always implemented in template metaprogramming using recursion. The last specialization (<b>Len=0</b>) is the loop's at-end condition. <a href="0408myrnyyl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>, on the other hand, is more complicated because it adds an integer <b>Num</b> to the element <b>i</b> (starting with 0) of the numlist <b>NList</b> and returns the new numlist. Passing nonvalid index <b>i</b> or an empty numlist leads to a compilation error. The class template <b>Numlist</b> can be a basic structure to many compile-time computations. In the next approach, it defines a polynomial term and the enumeration of the degrees of freedom.</p>
<h3>Polynomial as a Typelist of Numlists</h3>

<p>A polynomial is a sum of powers in one or more variables multiplied by coefficients [4]. The summands with coefficients are called "monomials"; for instance, <b>c</b> <b>x<sub>1<sup>p1</sub></sup>x<sub>2<sup>p2</b>...<b>x</sub>d</sup>pd</b>; without coefficient&#151;"polynomial terms." Implementing a polynomial term, the only integer powers <b>p<sub>1</sub></b>,...,<b>p<sub>d</sub></b> bear real information at compile time, since this series is ordered: The first power corresponds to <b>x<sub>1</sub></b>, the second to <b>x<sub>2</sub></b>, and so on. If the coefficients are assumed to be integer, then a numlist of the length <b>Dim+1</b> can define a monomial, where the first element is a coefficient and the others are powers. For instance, <b>NUMLIST_4(-3,2,0,1)</b> represents <b>-3x<sub>1<sup>2</sub></sup>x<sub>3</sub></b>. This simple algorithm constructs a monomial using <b>InitNumlist</b> from <a href="0408myrnyyl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>:</p>

<pre>
template&lt;unsigned short Dim,
         int Coef=0, int Power=0&gt;
struct Monomial
{
   typedef Numlist&lt;Coef,
    typename InitNumlist&lt;Dim,Power&gt;
               ::Result&gt; Result;
};

</pre>

<p>The class template <b>Monomial</b> is only a builder to obtain a default monomial of a given dimension. Since <b>Numlist</b> is a type, the simple representation of a sum of monomials can be a typelist of numlists, which has variable length ending by <b>NullType</b>. For example, the linear polynomials in <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(a) contain exactly two monomials, except for the third line where the length of the linear terms changes depending on the dimension. The template recursion from <a href="0408myrnyyl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a> constructs a typelist that represents the linear polynomial <b>-mx<sub>d</sub>-</b>...<b>-mx<sub>1</sub> (d=Dim, m=Order)</b>. The auxiliary template parameter <b>Num</b> is the number of summands and used as a counter from <b>Dim</b> to 0.</p>

<p>After a general polynomial has been defined in such a way at compile time, it must be used in a program. You have to be able to get its value in the given point <b>x</b>, which is known only at runtime. This is a good reason to apply the expression templates technique [5]. The evaluation role can be referred to an extra class template called <b>Evaluate</b>. It receives a polynomial as a template parameter in the form of a typelist and goes through the typelist and numlists recursively by defining an <b>operator()</b> as:</p>

<pre>
Typeofx operator()(Typeofx* x)
{  //call to operator() of the
   //nested Evaluate&lt;...&gt; classes
}

</pre>

<p>(See the additional source code at http://www.cuj.com/code/ for the full implementation.)</p>

<p>The most important operation on polynomials is <b>Mult</b>, which must be able to multiply two general polynomials given as typelists of numlists. Therefore, this template algorithm (<a href="0408myrnyyl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>) contains specializations to cover all possible pairs of types that appear in a typelist of numlists. The simplest specializations are commented briefly. The product of two monomials (<b>Mult&lt;Numlist,Numlist&gt;</b>) is implemented with the help of the operation <b>Add</b>, which adds two numlists and also returns <b>Numlist</b>.</p>

<p>Each specialization of <b>Mult</b> results in a typelist, which often contains some equal polynomial terms. Mathematically stated, the polynomial has to be simplified. The idea of the template algorithm <b>Simplify</b> (<a href="0408myrnyyl5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>) is not tricky. For the given <b>Term</b>, the auxiliary algorithm <b>SumAndDel</b> looks for monomials with the same term in <b>TList</b>, counts the sum of their coefficients, and erases them. The algorithm <b>Simplify</b> applies <b>SumAndDel</b> to a current <b>Numlist</b> and the following tail of the typelist modified by the previous call of <b>SumAndDel</b>. If the sum of the coefficients is zero, then the monomial must be omitted. This case is determined by the operation <b>Loki::Select&lt;T0,T1,T2&gt;</b> [1], which is just a metaimplementation of the constraint: if <b>T0</b> then <b>T1</b> else <b>T2</b>.</p>
<h3>Shape Function Construction</h3>

<p>An SF is a product of linear polynomials defined uniquely by a dimension, order, and specific number of the degree of freedom. Consequently, an SF can be obtained by a sequential application of the operation <b>Mult</b> (<a href="0408myrnyyl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>). However, if you need to evaluate a value of an SF, then the cheapest way is to use the source form as a product. Since the length of such a product is variable, <b>Typelist</b> comes in handy again. In this case, the convention proposed by Alexandrescu [2] must be overridden. In other words, a typelist can receive a typelist as the first template parameter, although the nature of <b>Typelist</b> remains unchanged. A typelist can appear at the first place only when representing a polynomial. The reason for this involves how the <b>Mult</b> operation distinguishes a typelist as a sum from a typelist as a product at its end. The solution is to supplement the Loki library [1] with the new empty type, <b>UnitType</b>. It can only appear at the end of a typelist of typelists, which defines a product of polynomials. As a consequence, the <b>Loki::TL::Append</b> operation must be completed with the specializations for <b>UnitType</b> in the same way as the specializations with <b>NullType</b>. Then the operation <b>Mult</b> obtains some additional specializations (<a href="0408myrnyyl6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a>), which transforms a product of polynomials to a polynomial in the form of a typelist of numlists ending with <b>NullType</b>. To multiply higher order SFs efficiently, the implementation can be optimized by a substitution of the algorithm <b>Simplify</b> applied to the inner operations <b>Mult</b>.</p>

<p>For brevity, I consider only the construction of an SF on the unit triangle. The construction of an SF on the unit square based on <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(b) is similar. An SF is created by two lists of linear terms. The first one&#151;from the third line in <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(b)&#151;is produced by the template <b>BasicList3</b> from <a href="0408myrnyyl7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a>, which adds a constant to the result of <b>BasicTerm</b> and repeats that process <b>Num</b> times recursively.</p>

<p>The algorithm <b>ShapeBasis</b> (<a href="0408myrnyyl8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a>) builds the second list. Its linear terms contain exactly two summands: A linear monomial <b>mx<sub>i</sub> (i=CurVar, m=Order)</b> and a constant, which varies from 0 to <b>-Num+1</b>; see the first and second lines of <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(b).</p>

<p>The construction algorithm <b>ShapeFunction3</b> (<a href="0408myrnyyl9.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 9</a>) receives a point number in the form of the numlist <b>NList</b> with the length <b>Dim</b>. There are two predefined template parameters for internal use only. The first one is a counter for the numlist (<b>N=1</b>...<b>Dim</b>). The second one computes the sum of elements in the numlist. The algorithm recurses through this numlist, taking a current number of the linear terms from <b>ShapeBasis</b> concerning variable <b>N</b>. Keeping in mind that an SF on a triangle contains exactly <b>m</b> linear terms makes the end specialization clear: The created typelist of typelists receives (<b>Order-Sum</b>) terms from the <b>BasicList3</b>. Since all coefficients in <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(b) are fractions with a unit nominator, the only denominator is calculated using the algorithm <b>Factorial</b>. The latter is the first classic example in the papers on template metaprogramming [6]. But don't forget to specialize <b>0!=1</b>; otherwise, Examples 3(a) though 3(c) fail.</p>
<h3>Differentiation and Integration</h3>

<p>Integration over a unit triangle reduces a complicated typelist of numlists to a compile-time constant using <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(c). But before starting to integrate, consider the differentiation of a polynomial required in <a href="0408myrnyye1.html" target="_BLANK">Example 1</a>(d). The corresponding algorithm (<a href="0408myrnyyl10.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 10</a>) implements the usual differentiation rule of the polynomial <b>TList</b> with respect to the variable number <b>Var (1</b>...<b>Dim)</b>. If the power <b>pow</b> of <b>Var</b> in the current monomial <b>NList</b> is zero, then the monomial does not come into <b>Result</b>, else the derivative is calculated by sequential use of <b>AddAt</b> and <b>MultAt</b> applied to the powers and the coefficient of the monomial, respectively.</p>

<p>The integration algorithm <b>Integrate3</b> (<a href="0408myrnyyl11.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 11</a>) is the first one, handling noninteger constants. This is implemented using static functions, because some compilers do not accept the compile-time calculation of static constants. <b>IntegrateTerm3</b> realizes <a href="0408myrnyye3.html" target="_BLANK">Example 3</a>(c), integrates a polynomial term, and saves the fraction as two integers&#151;numerator and denominator. <b>Integrate3</b> goes through a polynomial and sums up the fractions as real numbers.</p>

<p>The template algorithms <b>Differentiate</b> and <b>Integrate3</b> both receive a typelist of numlists. Therefore, to apply them to a single SF, its product form must be expanded to the polynomial standard form. The template <b>Expand</b> (<a href="0408myrnyyl12.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 12</a>) is actually an interface to the algorithm <b>Mult</b>. The long approach ends with an example of computing the integral in <a href="0408myrnyye1.html" target="_BLANK">Example 1</a>(d) of two sample second-order SFs over the unit triangle. There is no runtime data in this program. The whole FEM matrix assembling requires, of course, the integration of all pairs of the SFs that can be automated due to template algorithms as well.</p>

<p>How long will such programs be compiled? The template algorithms I present here have been compiled and tested using GNU GCC versions 3.3.2 and 2.96 as well Intel C++ 7.1 under Linux Fedora 1. Since the complexity of <b>Mult</b> is at least <b>O(2<sup>m</sup>)</b> and of <b>Simplify</b> is in the worst case <b>O(2<sup>2m</sup>)</b>, the order of SFs must be relatively small if you don't want to see your powerful workstation crying (for <b>m&gt;3</b> by my experience).</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>C++ class templates can be convenient tools to model mathematical objects, schemes, and formulas. In this article, I've concentrated on building shape functions as polynomials in any dimension of any order, their differentiation and integration over a unit triangle and square. That provides a variety of finite element method approximation schemes without additional runtime costs, which is a basis of an efficient scientific code.</p>
