<h3>EmINENT Microsystems Algorithm Library Released</h3>

<p>ESF Base from EmINENT Microsystems is an operating system and platform-independent data structure and algorithm library. It contains C++ classes that have hybrid architectures of base classes and template classes providing the benefits of inheritance (small code size) as well as the benefits of templates (fast code). The library is designed to complement other libraries, such as the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), while supporting the needs of embedded applications: reentrancy, no C lib dependencies, no code bloat, and advanced buffer management. Contact +1-503-238-7500 or http://www.eminentmicro.com/.</p>
<h3>XBinder XML Schema Available</h3>

<p>Objective Systems has launched XBinder, a tool that generates C or C++ source code for a given XML schema specification. Its target audience is software developers who work with XML schema and related technologies in a messaging or data management environment. XBinder generates C or C++ source code in the form of C structures or C++ classes and encoders and decoders for a given XML schema specification. It features a royalty-free C/C++ runtime distribution, works with Expat and Libxml2 XML parsers, and includes an abstraction layer for integration with other XML parsers such as Xerces or MSXML. Contact +1-484-875-9841 or http://www.obj-sys.com/.</p>
<h3>WasabiGNU Tools from Wasabi Systems </h3>

<p>Wasabi Systems has optimized its WasabiGNU Tools for Intel XScaleR microarchitecture-based processors. Wasabi's enhancements to GCC and other components of the GNU toolchain were designed to improve the performance of embedded applications using Intel XScale technology-based processors, and include scheduling enhancements specific to the pipeline architecture in Intel's latest cores. Contact +1-757-248-9601 or http://www.wasabisystems.com/.</p>
<h3>Relogix/86: Converting Assembler to C</h3>

<p>MicroAPL has developed Relogix/86, a software conversion tool that takes 80x86-family assembler source files and automatically recodes them in C. This tool follows the launch last year of Relogix/68K, which performs a similar conversion for 680x0 and ColdFire assembler code. As well as reorganizing the program flow to use Standard C flow-control constructs such as <b>if</b>, <b>for</b>, and <b>case</b> statements, Relogix also chooses sensible data types and names for the C variables that correspond to register- and stack-based data in the original assembler program. The C code that is output by Relogix follows user-specified style guidelines. Contact +44 1825 768050 or http://www.microapl.co.uk/.</p>
<h3>CINERGI Unveiled</h3>

<p>Recursion Software's CINERGI is a multilanguage application integrator designed to reduce the complexity of developing client-server applications in multiple languages. You can select functionality from existing applications written in Java, C++, .NET, CORBA, or SOAP/XML and integrate that functionality into new applications written in Java, C++, and/or .NET, without rewriting code. CINERGI supports both Standards-based SOAP/XML communications protocols and Recursion Software's binary protocol at runtime. Contact +1-972-731-8800 or http://www.recursionsw.com/.</p>
<h3>SimBionic Visual Tool Released</h3>

<p>Stottler Henke Associates has announced SimBionic 2.0, a visual programming tool designed to aid rapid development of software applications for simulation, automated training, decision support, and monitoring and control. SimBionic offers a visual editor that lets you specify application logic by drawing and configuring finite state machines and flow charts. The SimBionic engine executes behaviors by tracing through the nodes and links in the hierarchical finite state machines. It provides Java technology and C++ application programming interfaces, so software developers can embed it within apps running on a desktop or server. Contact +1-650-931-2700 or http://www.stottlerhenke.com/.</p>
<h3>Molebox Pro Packs 'Em In</h3>

<p>MoleBox Pro is a runtime exe packer for Windows applications that processes software and all of its resource files in order to create a single executable file. In doing so, the program compresses and encrypts executable files, data, media files, and DLLs, and also embeds DLLs into the executable file. The goal of MoleBox is to prevent application data from being viewed, extracted, copied, or modified. MoleBox Pro processes applications created with most common C++, Basic, and Pascal compilers, as well as games made with specialized tools such as Blitz Basic or Pure Basic. Contact http://www.molebox.com/.</p>
<h3>Ricreations Updates FLASH Memory Tool</h3>

<p>Ricreations has released Version 7 of its Universal Scan Boundary Scan Test Software, which adds FLASH memory device programming through JTAG chains without the need for special test fixtures, netlists, or test executives. Universal Scan is a JTAG board and chip debug tool used by hardware and test engineers to view and manipulate circuit card signal activity via the JTAG port in real time while the circuit is running. In the new Version 7, Universal Scan includes a utility that programs FLASH Memories from any JTAG chain: Users simply tell Universal Scan how the FLASH pins are connected to the JTAG chain, select a data file to load, and hit PROGRAM. Contact +1-678-455-7255 or http://www.ricreations.com/.</p>
<h3>Etnus Upgrades Debugger</h3>

<p>The TotalView 6.4 debugger for Linux and UNIX is now available from Etnus. The 6.4 release includes support for SuSE ES 8.2 on Linux x86, Red Hat EL 3.0 for Linux IA-64, and Red Hat Fedora Core 1, along with new compilers such as Intel's Fortran 8.0 for Linux. TotalView also now supports Sun One Studio Compiler Collection, C/C++, and Fortran Version 8.0. This release brings two GUI additions: The Expression List Window gathers and groups expressions that you want to evaluate during debugging sessions, while the Data Window lets you monitor interesting variables and structures. Contact +1-508-652-7700 or http://www.etnus.com/.</p>
