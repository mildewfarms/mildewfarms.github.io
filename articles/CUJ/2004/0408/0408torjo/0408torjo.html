<p>In the first installment of this series on win32gui, a C++ templated library for GUI development, I examined GUI RAII, event handling, loose coupling, message maps, and main loops. I continue this month by addressing advanced window creation, advanced window access, window iteration, manipulation of frames and dialogs, and other topics.</p>
<h3>Advanced  Window Creation</h3>

<p>The Windows operating system uses class names to assign a <b>WindowProc</b> when a certain window is created. For every event this window receives, its corresponding <b>WindowProc</b> is called. A class name is to its windows what a C++ class is to its instances. In particular, once a window has acquired a class name, it cannot change it. Thus, you can create mappings from Windows' class names to C++ classes&#151;or, putting it another way, once a window is created on the screen, you can decide an instance of which C++ class to create.</p>

<p>Win32gui implements GUI RAII: Once a window is created on the screen, its C++ object is automatically created. (The same goes for destruction&#151;once the on-the-screen window is destroyed, its corresponding C++ object is destroyed.) When a window gets created on the screen, win32gui decides which corresponding C++ object to create: </p>



<ul>
  <li>If it's created manually (using any of <b>create_wnd</b>/<b>create_dlg</b>/<b>create_modal_dlg</b>), the type was specified at creation. That type is preserved. This is to be expected when you manually create windows because you want full control. Moreover, when you manually create windows, you can specify some arguments to pass to the constructor of the window you're creating.</li>
  <li>If the window is created automatically (for instance, the controls on a dialog), win32gui examines its class name. Then at runtime, it looks for the mappings that are registered for this class name. The first mapping that matches creates the C++ object.</li>
</ul>



<p>Multiple mappings can exist for the same class name. Examples include the <b>button</b>/ <b>check_box</b>/<b>radio_button</b> classes; Win32 GUI aficionados know that button/checkbox and radio buttons have the same class name (<b>"BUTTON"</b>), but differ in their window style. Based on the window style they were created with, win32gui decides at runtime which C++ class to create. This eliminates another source of errors. Until now, manipulating buttons/ checkboxes/radio buttons was done through the same interface (MFC or WTL's <b>CButton</b> class) and you could, for instance, mistakenly set a push-button as checked (non-sense).</p>

<p>Multiple mappings can exist for certain class names. If classes <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are mappings for the same class name, and class <b>A</b> extends class <b>B</b>, <b>A</b> is asked if it <b>match_hwnd</b> before <b>B</b>. In the <b>button</b>/<b>check_box</b>/<b>radio_button</b> example, <b>check_box</b> and <b>radio_button </b>extend the class button. If they weren't asked if they <b>match_hwnd</b> before <b>button</b>, <b>button</b> would always return <b>true</b>, and <b>check_box</b> and <b>radio_button</b> instances would never get created.</p>

<p>Still, creating your own mappings is easy. In your window class, you simply:</p>



<ol>
  <li>Derive from <b>auto_mapping&lt;your_class&gt;</b>.</li>
  <li>Implement the static member function bool <b>matches_hwnd(HWND h</b>). </li>
  <li>Examine the handle, and return <b>true</b> if it matches your class.</li>
</ol>



<p>A C++ class that implements (automatic) mapping (that is, one that implements the static member function <b>matches_hwnd</b>) must have a default constructor; otherwise, how could the win32gui create a C++ object of its type? <a href="0408torjol1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a> is an example of such a class. Also, when you download the code, take a look at controls.hpp; all standard controls provide this behavior.</p>

<p>Finally, when you're implementing a window class and want to manually create child windows, you can use the <b>create_ child&lt;&gt;(...) </b>shortcut, which is exactly the same as <b>create_wnd&lt;&gt;(this,...)</b>.</p>
<h3>Window Casting</h3>

<p>Remember that with window access, you can always cast to the real C++ type of a window object or any of its base classes. Any function that allows access to a window (<b>child(id)</b>, for example) has a templated corresponding function, which allows casting to another type (<b>child&lt;some_other_type&gt;(id)</b>). The nontemplated function always returns a <b>wnd&lt;window_base&gt;</b> value (<b>window_base</b> being the top-most window class), while the templated complement returns a <b>wnd&lt;some_other_type&gt;</b> value or throws an exception if the cast is invalid (cannot be done).</p>

<p>You can also specifically cast a window to another window type (using <b>cast&lt;&gt;</b>) or test if it's possible (using <b>try_cast&lt;&gt;</b>); see <a href="0408torjol2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a>.</p>
<h3>Advanced Window Access</h3>

<p>Window access is one of win32gui's major features. It gives you many ways to access windows and iterate through them (&agrave; la STL).</p>

<p>The simplest window access is when you have a window object and you want to retrieve windows that are relative to it:</p>



<ul>
  <li><b>child(id)</b>. Returns the child having this ID. Useful when using dialogs access their children. (This is used in the samples that come with the library.)</li>
  <li><b>parent()</b>. Returns the window's parent.</li>
  <li><b>top_parent()</b>. Returns the window's top-most parent (the ascendant whose parent is <b>null_wnd</b>). It is useful in retrieving the window's frame.</li>
  <li><b>next_wnd()</b>, <b>prev_wnd()</b>, <b>first_wnd()</b>, <b>last_wnd()</b>. Returns the next/previous/first/last sibling of this window, respectively. </li>
</ul>



<p>You might want to cast these windows to another desired type. Every such function has a templated counterpart, which is equivalent to calling <b>cast&lt;some_type&gt;(your_func()</b>). For instance, <b>next_wnd()</b> has a corresponding <b>next_wnd&lt;some_type&gt;()</b>.</p>

<p>Each of these functions returns <b>null_wnd</b> if the window is not found (instead of throwing an exception). If I had thrown an error when a window was not found, the client code would get more complicated than it needs to be. For instance, if you wanted to retrieve the parent of a window, you would have to surround that in a <b>try</b>/<b>catch</b> body to handle the case when the window does not have a parent. Of course, the templated functions might throw an exception in case the cast fails.</p>

<p>The following functions are global:</p>



<ul>
  <li><b>find_by_hwnd(hwnd)</b>. Finds the <b>wnd&lt;&gt;</b> object from a given <b>HWND</b> handle. You should use this only when you're using win32gui on top of another framework. It has a template counterpart. </li>
  <li><b>top_wnd([idx = 0])</b>. Returns the top window of the application at the given index [1] (since you can have multiple top windows; for example, when you have multiple frames). Every modal dialog is considered a top window. Its templated counterpart is much more powerful; it walks through only the top windows of a certain type. For example, <b>top_wnd&lt;dialog&gt;(idx)</b> only enumerates the modal dialogs that exist at a given time.</li>
</ul>



<p>The most powerful access function is <b>find_wnd_range([window [,search_type]])</b> and its corresponding <b>find_wnd_range&lt;some_wnd_type&gt;([ window [,search_type]])</b>. The <b>find_wnd_range</b> returns an STL-like random iterator to all windows that:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Relate to the given window.</li>
  <li>Match the search type.</li>
  <li>Are of type "some_wnd_type" or extend it (derive from it directly or indirectly).</li>
</ul>



<p>The search type is any of: </p>



<ul>
  <li>The <b>siblings</b> of the window, or if the window is <b>null_wnd</b>, the windows that don't have a parent.</li>
  <li>The <b>ascendants</b> of the given window. They are returned in ascending order (top ascendant is last).</li>
  <li>The <b>children</b> of the given window.</li>
  <li>The <b>descendants</b> of the given window.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="0408torjol3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a> shows some samples to get you started.</p>

<p>If, for your search, you know the result consists of only one window (or you're interested only in one window), use the <b>find_wnd</b> counterpart. Think of <b>find_wnd(...)</b> as executing <b>*find_wnd_range(...).begin()</b>. (Note that <b>find_wnd</b> might cache results to be faster). <b>find_wnd</b> is useful for Singleton-like windows. In Explorer-like applications, you can use it to find the Folders View, Search View, History View, and the like. Make sure there's a window matching your criteria when calling <b>find_wnd()</b>, otherwise an exception will be thrown.</p>

<p>For <b>top_wnd</b> and <b>find_by_hwnd</b>, I've provided <b>try_top_wnd</b>/<b>try_find_ by_hwnd</b> functions. Again, <b>top_wnd</b>/<b>find_by_hwnd</b> might throw exceptions, just in case the window is not found or if the cast fails. There are cases when you want to see if a window of your desired type exists, but don't want to use a <b>try</b>/<b>catch</b> block just for that. Use the <b>try_</b> counterpart. The <b>try_</b> function returns the window if it exists and if it is of the desired type; otherwise, it returns <b>null_wnd</b>. try_cast works the same, also allowing for the assignment-as-condition idiom; see <a href="0408torjol4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, to be consistent, I've added <b>try_find_wnd</b>, the complement of <b>find_wnd</b>.</p>
<h3>The Mighty Dialog and the Rest</h3>

<p>The simplest thing you can draw on the screen is a dialog. Recall that you create a window using <b>create_wnd&lt;&gt;(...)</b>. This works fine&#151;except for dialogs. Windows treats dialogs different from the rest of the windows on the screen because a dialog can have children that are created by default when the dialog is created [2]. A dialog needs a unique ID to be created. This ID must identify a dialog resource from your .rc file. To make things more complicated, there are two types of dialogs&#151;modal and modeless.</p>

<p>When you create a modal dialog, the function used to create it returns only after the dialog is closed. In contrast, when you create a modeless dialog, the function returns exactly after the window was created on the screen (as you would expect).</p>

<p>After you create a dialog, you can still wait for signals, just like you would for windows. But because of the way modal dialogs are created/destroyed, you need to specify what signals to wait for at creation, not afterwards (as you would expect); see <a href="0408torjol5.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 5</a>. </p>

<p>When creating modeless dialogs, use <b>create_dlg</b> just as you would use <b>create_wnd</b>. When creating modal dialogs, use <b>create_modal_dlg</b> and pass the parameters in the same way you would for <b>create_wnd</b>. Since <b>create_modal_dlg</b> returns only after the dialog has been closed (and destroyed from the screen), <b>create_modal_dlg</b> needs to return two parameters&#151;a pointer to the C++ object corresponding to the dialog and the signal that was triggered. Thus, it returns an instance of <b>modal_dlg&lt;your_dialog_class&gt;</b>, and you can query the .dlg (dialog) and the .result (triggered signal). You'll need the dialog instance (.dlg) in case the dialog holds any state (data) that you might find meaningful after the dialog has been destroyed. The common scenario is to handle the OK-button-pressed event and save the dialog state into variables, which can be accessed after the dialog has been destroyed; see <a href="0408torjol6.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 6</a>.</p>

<p>To create your own dialog, just extend the <b>dialog</b> class and override the static <b>int dialog_id()</b> function (which returns the ID of the dialog you're handling). I recommend that you define the <b>dialog_id()</b> function in your source file. This way, you'll only need to include resource.h in your source file, so if you're modifying any resource (and indirectly the resource.h file), only the source file is recompiled. This is another step to faster compilation; see <a href="0408torjol7.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 7</a>.</p>
<h3>Frames</h3>

<p>The cornerstone for most applications is the frame window(s). An application's top window is the <b>Frame</b>, and other windows sit on it. You can choose to sit the menu, toolbar(s), and status bar on the frame. </p>

<p>The frame dictates the visual appearance (look-and-feel) of your application. Moreover, the frame orchestrates how commands and notifications are handled. Typically, some commands/notifications are best handled by the frame itself. Such commands include creating a new view, opening an existing view, help, and so on. Also, if the frame does not handle a command or notification, it forwards it to its active child.</p>

<p>Other than that, the frame should get out of the way. MFC/ ATL/WTL have pretty much failed at this issue. Using an MFC/ ATL/WTL wizard to create an application automatically creates a lot of classes, and you end up not knowing where to handle events&#151;is it the <b>CChildFrame</b>, <b>CMainFrame</b>, <b>CMyView</b>, or <b>CMyApp</b>? </p>

<p>Finally, you'll want easy access to your frame children, usually by some unique name. Indeed, this is what most applications' Window menu is for&#151;identifying a window (a child of the frame) by some unique name. That's why I added a novel feature to win32gui&#151;you can easily find your children by their names. How? When creating a child of your frame, give it a name and you'll find it by it later. </p>

<p>The <b>view_frame</b> class provides all of this. Here's how:</p>



<ol>
  <li><b>activate(window)</b> activates this child.</li>
  <li><b>rename(window, new_name)</b> renames this child.</li>
  <li><b>go_next_view</b>/<b>go_prev_view</b> goes to the next/previous child</li>
  <li><b>find_by_name(name [,index])</b> finds the child with this name. If there are more children with the same name, use the index to distinguish between them.</li>
  <li><b>find_by_name&lt;some_type&gt;(name [,index])</b> as aforementioned, only that it will take into consideration windows of some_type.</li>
  <li><b>try_find_by_name(...)</b>, as with <b>find_by_name</b>. However, if the window does not exist, it returns the <b>null_wnd</b> instead of throwing. </li>
</ol>



<p>Your own application frame can extend <b>view_frame</b>, but usually you'll prefer to use:</p>



<ul>
  <li><b>sdi_frame</b>, which implements the Single Document Interface (SDI) model, allowing multiple views to exist at the same time. However, only one is visible at a given time.</li>
  <li><b>mdi_frame</b>, which implements the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) model, allowing multiple views to be visible at the same time.</li>
  <li>Extend the <b>sdi_frame</b> or <b>mdi_frame</b>, and handle some events and/or commands.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="0408torjol8.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 8</a> shows you the simplest frame-based application in which children are dialogs. It lets you create new children dialogs&#151;and it compiles and works. If you've used other frameworks, you probably know the difference.</p>

<p>The <b>multiple_frames</b> example (http://www.cuj.com/code/) presents the frame-based GUI application that allows multiple frames, answers to menu commands, and lets you change the look-and-feel at runtime&#151;all this in around 200 lines of code (see <a href="0408torjof1.html" target="_BLANK">Figure 1</a>). The <b>simple_explorer</b> example presents a simple file browser written in less than 150 lines.</p>
<h3>To Be Continued...</h3>

<p>In upcoming installments, I'll examine what's involved in forwarding commands and notifications, and jump into status bars and toolbars, enabling/disabling of commands, advanced subclassing, smarter dialogs, manipulating controls, advanced event handling, and more. Until then, there are quite a few samples provided with win32gui. Check them out, and if you have suggestions for other samples, let me know.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
  <li>[1]	For Win32 aficionados, top windows are those windows that don't have the <b>WS_CHILD</b> style.</li>
  <li>[2]	The dialog has a special <b>WindowProc</b> that parses the dialog template from your .rc resource and creates the child controls. </li></ol>
