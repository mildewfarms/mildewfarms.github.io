Tessy automatically builds up a complete test driver—including stub functions—and automatically conducts reproducibility and regression tests. Tessy runs the tests either in the host environment or on the actual embedded target hardware, so Tessy supports most compilers for embedded systems. Customizable test reports can be produced in HTML, TXT, Word, or Excel format.
