<h3>OSE Makes Nice with Linux</h3>

<p>Enea Orchestra allows high-availability telecom and datacom systems to combine embedded Linux with the OSE hard real-time operating system across multiple processors and blades. Enea Orchestra bundles five integrated components: Linux, the OSE RTOS, OSE Gateway, Enea's Polyhedra database, and a range of Metrowerks development technologies including the Platform Creation Suite, CodeTEST analysis tools, a PowerTAP debug probe, and the CodeWarrior development environment. The OSE Gateway, a daemon which runs on the Linux system, maps OSE services directly into the Linux space and makes Linux processes look like OSE processes.

<h3>VelOSity, INTEGRITY 5.0 Now Available</h3>

<p>Green Hills Software has introduced Version 5.0 of its velOSity microkernel and INTEGRITY RTOS. New features include enhancements for automotive, resource-constrained, and multiprocessing applications, and support for easier porting from legacy kernels. INTEGRITY 5.0 has been certified under the "POSIX: Certified by IEEE and The Open Group" program to the 1003.1-2003 System Interfaces Product Standard. Also, several new programming interfaces have been added to ease porting from legacy operating systems to velOSity/INTEGRITY and POSIX interfaces.

<h3>Parasoft Upgrades C++Test</h3>

<p>Parasoft has updated its C++Test tool, a unit testing and coding standard analysis tool, to Version 2.3. C++Test analyzes C functions or C++ classes, then generates and executes a test harness, test cases, and stubs designed to verify the code under test. You can add and customize test cases and stubs through GUI controls, and view coverage details for all automatically generated and user-defined test cases. C++Test also checks whether code follows over 500 coding standard rules plus any number of custom rules. New features have been introduced for creating and sharing Test Configurations and Project Configurations, and team-wide sharing is managed by Parasoft Team Configuration Manager, a program (available separately) that supports centralization, administration, and team-wide sharing of test settings and files.

<h3>Portland Group Offers New Compilers</h3>

<p>The Portland Group has announced Version 5.2 of PGI Workstation, a suite of Fortran, C, and C++ compilers and development tools for scientists and engineers. The PGI compilers and tools can be used on Linux workstations, servers, and clusters based on AMD64 and IA32 processors to build high-performance computing applications for complex modeling and simulations in automotive crash testing, structural analysis, weather forecasting, geophysical processing, aerodynamic simulation, computational chemistry, and related fields.

<h3>Cambridge Consultants Develops IDE for SDKs</h3>

<p>Cambridge Consultants has launched xIDE, a generic Integrated Development Environment that can be customized for embedded system and semiconductor companies to create software-development kits for ASSP, structured ASIC, platform or SoC products. xIDE runs natively on Windows, Linux, UNIX, or Mac OS X. Its feature set can be customized for individual companies, and it can include an online help system, a multiple document text editor with syntax highlighting, a built-in scripting language (Python) to automate repetitive tasks, and support for managing embedded software development projects&#151;using either a standard look-and-feel or an OEM-branded concept.

<h3>Electric Cloud Speeds Builds</h3>

<p>Electric Cloud is shipping Electric Cloud 2.1, designed to speed software builds and improve network efficiency through peer-to-peer network communication, file compression, and support for multi-CPU machines in the build cluster. At the core of Electric Cloud 2.1 is Electric Make, which is plug-compatible with existing Make-based build infrastructures so it can be deployed with little or no change to existing tools or environments. In order to ensure that parallel builds will not break, Electric Cloud has developed a dependency management system that monitors all files accessed during a build. Electric Cloud 2.1 records and reuses build dependency information, minimizing the makefile maintenance required to achieve and maintain build performance.
