<h2>Suppressing Repeated State Generation</h2>
There appears to be interesting interaction between depth-limited search (and, by extension, iterative deepening) and the suppression of repeated state generation. If option 3 is used for suppressing repeated states, it may be necessary to set the depth limit higher than the depth of the shallowest goal in order to reach that goal. Though I have not read of this in the literature, I have observed it empirically.

<p>If the shortest path(s) to the goal <b>G</b> are at depth <b>N</b> and the depth limit is set to <b>N</b>, the following problem may occur. Suppose that on each path to <b>G</b>, some state <b>S</b> on that path at depth <b>M</b> is reached in greater than <b>M</b> steps purely because the optimal path to <b>S</b> was not the first path explored. You miss the goal because this suboptimal path through <b>S</b> is longer than the depth limit. But the real problem is that repeated state suppression prevents you from getting past <b>S</b> (and on to the goal) later when you do explore the optimal path to <b>S</b>. You are stopped at <b>S</b> because it has already been seen.</p>

<p>This problem brings to light the fundamental difference between options 2 and 3 for repeated state suppression. Option 2 only prevents cycles, whereas option 3 prevents both cycles and the exploration past <b>S</b> through two different paths (of potentially different length) leading to <b>S</b>. </p>
