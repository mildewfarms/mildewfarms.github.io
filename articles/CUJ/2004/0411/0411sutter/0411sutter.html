<h1>Adaptations</h1>
<p><i>C/C++ Users Journal</i> November, 2004</p>
<h2>Problem: You're using multiple inheritance and each of the two base classes has a virtual function with the same name. You want to provide separate overrides for each function, to be called in the context of the specific override. How do you do it?</h2>

<p>Let me give you a word of advice, pardner," Wendy's voice floated over the cubicle wall. </p>

<p>"Hey, welcome back," I called as I gophered up. "How's things in the UK office?"</p>

<p>"The usual," Wendy waved me off. "As I was saying though, my advice is: Never trust a home-built AC voltage adaptor." I cocked an eyebrow quizzically. "You know that in the UK everything runs on 230 volts, right? Well, Tom thought he'd save a bit of money and build a voltage converter for my hair dryer, rather than buying one. Only one problem&#151;he wired it up backwards, and I fried my hair dryer the instant I turned it on. Poof!"</p>

<p>"Aw, that's too bad," I commiserated. "I'm glad you're back, though. I've been wrestling with something I think you can help me with. Come on over after you're settled in."</p>

<p>A short while later, Wendy joined me in my cubicle.</p>

<p>"The problem is," I said as I called up the code I had been working on, "I'm deriving my class from two different functions, each of which has a virtual function with the same name. I've distilled it down to this."</p>

<pre>
class Base1
{
public:
  virtual void VirtFunc()
  {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Base1::VirtFunc" &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
};
class Base2
{
public:
  virtual void VirtFunc()
  {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Base2::VirtFunc" &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
};

class D : public Base1, public Base2
{
public:
  virtual void VirtFunc()
  {
    cout &lt;&lt; "D::VirtFunc" &lt;&lt; endl;
    Base1::VirtFunc();
    Base2::VirtFunc();
  }
};
void f( Base1 &amp; b );
void g( Base2 &amp; b );

</pre>

<p>"When I call <b>f</b>, I need it to call <b>Base1::VirtFunc</b>, and when I call <b>g</b>, I need it to call <b>Base2::VirtFunc</b>. But, I can't find a way to override both versions of the function."</p>

<p>"Why not rename one or both functions in the base class so they more accurately reflect what they do? You know, good naming conventions, and all..."</p>

<p>"All the <b>Base1</b> stuff is in a different library from all the <b>Base2</b> stuff. Third-party libraries. And besides, even a good name can clash&#151;like <b>Draw</b> or <b>Write</b>."</p>

<p>"Yeah, okay. Well, I think we already talked about your solution, pardner." Wendy smirked at me.</p>

<p>"We have?" I scratched my head.</p>

<p>"Sure&#151;only I hope your adaptor won't zap things like mine did," she said.</p>

<p>"Adaptor? Zap?!? Oh, I get it&#151;create an intermediate class to act as an adaptor. Are you sure?" I didn't wait for an answer, but turned back to the keyboard and started typing:</p>

<pre>
class Base1Intermediate : public Base1
{
public:
  void VirtFunc()
  {
    cout &lt;&lt; 
      "Base1Intermediate::VirtFunc"
      &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
};

class Base2Intermediate : public Base2
{
public:
  void VirtFunc()
  {
    cout &lt;&lt; 
      "Base2Intermediate::VirtFunc" 
      &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
};

</pre>

<p>"But how do I override <b>VirtFunc</b> in the main class&#151;<b>D</b>?"</p>

<p>"You don't," Wendy said as she took the keyboard from me. "Just to show the difference, I'm going to create a new class&#151;<b>D2</b>."</p>

<pre>
class D2 : 
  public Base1Intermediate, 
  public Base2Intermediate
{
};

</pre>

<p>"Notice I didn't override <b>VirtFunc</b>&#151;that's the key. When you pass the <b>D2</b> to <b>f</b>, the final overrider for it is <b>Base1Intermediate</b>'s <b>VirtFunc</b>. Same idea for <b>g</b>." She then added some more implementations:</p>

<pre>
void f( Base1 &amp; b )
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "In function f()\n";
  b.VirtFunc();
  cout &lt;&lt; "\n";
}

void g( Base2 &amp; b )
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "In function g()\n";
  b.VirtFunc();
  cout &lt;&lt; "\n";
}
int main()
{
  D d;
  cout &lt;&lt; "In main, with d\n";
  f( d );
  g( d );

  D2 d2;
  cout &lt;&lt; "In main, with d2\n";
  f( d2 );
  g( d2 );
  return 0;
}

</pre>

<p>I looked it over, and then we compiled and ran the program:</p>

<pre>
In main, with d
In function f()
D::VirtFunc
Base1::VirtFunc
Base2::VirtFunc

In function g()
D::VirtFunc
Base1::VirtFunc
Base2::VirtFunc

In main, with d2
In function f()
Base1Intermediate::VirtFunc

In function g()
Base2Intermediate::VirtFunc

</pre>

<p>"Hey, that's pretty cool," I said. "But what if we also wanted to have an override that calls both functions?" We jumped at the customary snap that I immediately recognized as the Guru's.</p>

<p>"Then decide which personality you want to present, you must," the Guru said softly. "Consider, my child, what you have already bespoken. When in the context of a <b>Base1</b>, your class must act like a <b>Base1</b>. When in the context of a <b>Base2</b>, it must act like a <b>Base2</b>. When in the context of its own, then it must find its own place by presenting its own function, which then calls the two virtual functions." She picked up a marker and wrote on the whiteboard:</p>

<pre>
void D2::NonVirtfunc()
  {
    Base1Intermediate::VirtFunc();
    Base2Intermediate::VirtFunc();
  }

</pre>

<p>"The function may, of course, be virtual if necessary."</p>

<p>"So, now that you're here," I grinned mischievously, "is there any way to avoid the intermediate classes?"</p>

<p>"Not really, my child," the Guru shook her head. "Although it has been suggested that an extension to the language could permit it thusly:"</p>

<pre>
class Fantasy : public Base1, public Base2
{
public:
  void VirtFunc1() overriding Base1::VirtFunc;
  void VirtFunc2() overriding Base2::VirtFunc;
};

</pre>

<p>"As the syntax suggests&#151;and I must emphasize, my children, that this is pure fantasy and is not, to my knowledge, being considered by the disciples on the ISO C++ Standards committee&#151;<b>VirtFunc1</b> would override <b>Base1</b>'s function, and be used in the context of <b>Base1</b>. Similarly, <b>VirtFunc2</b> would override <b>Base2</b>'s function, and be used in the context of <b>Base2</b>.</p>

<p>"Until such time as fantasy becomes reality," she said as she turned and glided away, "the intermediate adaptors are a good mechanism for achieving your goal." </p>
