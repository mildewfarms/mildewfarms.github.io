<h3>KUKA Controls Updates VxWin</h3>

<p>KUKA Controls has issued a new release of VxWin 2.2, its Windows XP extension that extends Wind River VxWorks with Windows XP Embedded and allows both to reside concurrently on a single CPU. Version 2.2 of VxWin supports the most recent version of VxWorks 5.5.1 and enhances system reliability; the new version of VxWin continues to operate if a faulty driver causes a Windows XP Embedded system exception to occur. VxWorks is notified by an event, but real-time capabilities as well as latencies remain unchanged. KUKA Controls also offers CeWin, allowing Windows CE and Windows XP Embedded to reside simultaneously on a single processor. Contact +1-248-844-0569 or http://www.kuka-controls.com/.</p>
<h3>BD Software Updates STLFilt</h3>

<p>BD Software has updated STLFilt, its STL error-message decryptor for C++, to support Whidbey C++. STLFilt simplifies and/or reformats C++ error and warning messages, with a focus on STL-related diagnostics. In addition to Whidbey C++, STLFilt supports Comeau C++, gcc 2.95.x/3.x (including DJGPP), Microsoft Visual C++ (including Dinkum Libraries), Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro 7/8, Borland C++/C++Builder, Intel C++ 7/8, EDG Front End (Generic), and Digital Mars C++. Contact +1-978-664-4178 or http://www.bdsoft.com/.</p>
<h3>The MathWorks Adds  Video Processing to Its Equation</h3>

<p>The MathWorks has announced its Video and Image Processing Blockset, a new tool for designing embedded video and image-processing systems. The Video and Image Processing Blockset lets imaging engineers in aerospace and defense, automotive, communications, consumer electronics, education, medical electronics, and other industries rapidly build models, simulate algorithms and system behavior, generate C code for deployment on programmable processors, and verify their designs, all within the Simulink environment. The blockset lets engineers use Model-Based Design for embedded systems development. The MathWorks is also updating its Embedded Target for TI C6000 DSP, which adds support for the Texas Instruments DM64x video development platform. Contact +1-508-647-7000 or http://www.mathworks.com/.</p>
<h3>Absoft Offers Compilers for Mac OS X</h3>

<p>Absoft's Pro Fortran Compiler Suite for Mac OS X includes: Fortran 95 and C/C++ compilers; an Integrated Development Environment; Fx2 debugger; and free graphics libraries. Pro Fortran is fully compatible with Panther and all Apple tools and libraries, and is optimized for the G5 processor. The Absoft IDE is a standalone tool suite that provides graphical interfaces for multiple compilers for OS X (Pro Fortran, IBM XL Fortran, IBM XL C/C++, and GCC) and select third-party tools and libraries (VAST, IMSL, 2D/3D graphics, LAPACK90). Contact +1-248-853-0050 or http://www .absoft.com/.</p>
<h3>Impulse Announces CoDeveloper</h3>

<p>Impulse Accelerated Technologies has released Impulse CoDeveloper for Virtex II Pro, which makes it possible to describe, test, and compile C language applications, partitioning them between the Virtex II Pro's embedded PowerPC processor and dedicated hardware running within the FPGA itself, without the need to write low-level VHDL or Verilog. The Impulse C libraries included with CoDeveloper allow FPGA algorithms to be developed using Microsoft Visual Studio, Metrowerks CodeWarrior, and open-source GCC-based tools. CoDeveloper's Application Monitor adds debugging visualizations for highly parallel, multiprocess applications&#151;helping identify dataflow bottlenecks and other areas for acceleration. Contact +1-425-576-4066 or http://www.impulsec.com/.</p>
<h3>Accelerated Technology  Provides Nucleus Class Driver</h3>

<p>Accelerated Technology, the embedded systems division of Mentor Graphics Corporation, has announced a new class driver for the Nucleus USB software, which provides USB support for the Nucleus RTOS. The newly supported Nucleus USB to RS232 adapter class driver uses USB to RS232 converter hardware to connect an embedded USB host to legacy RS232 peripheral devices such as a terminal or modem phone. The Nucleus USB to RS232 adapter class driver is designed so that developers can focus on adding value to their core product rather than writing the source code for the drivers themselves. Contact +1-251-208-3400 or http://www .acceleratedtechnology.com/.</p>
<h3>CodeScape Revs Up Car Infotainment Toolset</h3>

<p>CodeScape, the specialist SuperHT series embedded tools arm of Imagination Technologies, has announced support for Renesas Technology Corp's SH7780 high-performance processor for use in car infotainment systems. CodeScape's toolset is built around a source-level debugger and extends to graphical data visualization, scripting, hardware bring-up with ROM-less boot and hardware assisted debug, firmware development and OS porting, OS-aware application development, and performance analysis. The development environment includes software tools and hardware interfaces to exploit the on-chip debug capabilities of the SH7780. Contact +44-(0)113-242-9814 or http://www.codescape.com/.</p>
<h3>Acknowledgment</h3>

<p><i>"GenSerial: A Generic C++Serialization Library" (</i>CUJ<i>, September 2004)</i>. Macros have been used to aid in serialization for many years, most notably in systems that make use of MFC to serialize data. Macros were used more fully at Parametric Technology Corporation to generate serialization tables for classes in C, and the idea was extended and greatly enhanced in C++ by Paul Licameli at Revit Technology, which is where I first came across it. I am particularly indebted to Paul for interesting and informative discussions on the topic. <i>&#151;Evan Sherbrooke</i></p>
