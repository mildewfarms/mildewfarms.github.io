<p>Command-line options represent the "face" of the program, and tools for options parsing should be convenient and easy to use. For me it was always a tedious job to write the awkward <b>getopt</b> loops, especially in shell scripts. Frankly, I never understood why the <b>getopt</b> function is not designed in the manner of <b>getenv</b>. While libraries such as getopt, getopt_long, popt, and argp are powerful and rich, they don't provide utilities for parsing command options for the shell scripts.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I wrote my own getopt library, which I call "mgetopt." I was trying to implement a solution that is equally easy to use in C and shell programs. Mgetopt supports <b>short</b> (see <a href="0411surmanl1.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 1</a>), and GNU-style <b>long</b> and <b>longshort</b> options. It also a has number of convenient features, such as:</p>



<ul>
  <li>Options aliasing.</li>
  <li>Checking for numeric values.</li>
  <li>Checking for choice options.</li>
  <li>Embedded help.</li>
</ul>



<p>Mgetopt's distribution is available at http://www.cuj.com/code/ and http://www .inch.com/~esurman. Mgetopt is written in C and is available under the GNU license.</p>

<p>In general, you need only the functions <b>mgetopt_parse</b> and <b>mgetopt</b> to get the job done. And most important, you don't need to write <b>getopt</b> loops in C or shell programs anymore.</p>

<p>As you probably already guessed, I utilize a hash table to hold and retrieve options. In fact, I use a standard UNIX hsearch library, more precisely the GNU version. For nonLinux platforms, I include the file hsearch_r.c from GNU glibc to the mgetopt distribution.</p>

<p>There is a <b>mgetopt</b> utility to use in shell scripts. A <b>mgetopt</b> is simply an executable wrapper around the mgetopt library. The shell's <b>eval</b> function evaluates the output of mgetopt into the shell's variables of the following format:</p>

<pre>
$opt_&lt;name&gt;   (like:  $opt_a, $opt_d)

</pre>

<p>As <a href="0411surmanl2.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 2</a> illustrates, I use Perl's style convention for shell's option names. All you need to do is check whether an option variable exists.</p>
<h3>Mgetopt Library Functions</h3>

<p>In C, argument parsing is managed by the <b>mgetopt_parse</b> function:</p>

<pre>
int mgetopt_parse( const char* shortopts, 
                  const char* longopts,
                 const char* longshortopts, 
                   int argc, char** argv);

</pre>

<p><b>mgetopt_parse</b> returns 1 if a parse is successful. Parsing stops as soon as the first nonoption argument is encountered (POSIX style). <b>mgetopt_parse</b> prints an error message on the standard error and returns 0 when the parse fails.</p>

<p>The first parameter of <b>mgetopt_parse</b> is <b>shortopts</b>, a string of short option letters. The format of the short option string is the same as in the standard getopt. If a letter is followed by the flag "<b>:</b>", the option is expected to have an argument. I also implemented an additional flag "<b>@</b>" for the numeric arguments. If a letter is followed by "<b>@</b>", the option is expected to have an argument with <b>NUMERIC </b>value. <b>mgetopt_parse</b> prints an error message on the standard error and return 0 when the argument of the "<b>@</b>" option is not numeric.</p>

<p>An example of a short option string definition is:</p>

<pre>
mgetopt_parse( "abc:d@", 0, 0, argc, argv);

</pre>

<p>where <b>a,b</b> are short options with no arguments, <b>c:</b> is the short option with a string argument, and <b>d@</b> is the short option with a numeric argument.</p>

<p>The second <b>longopts</b> parameter is a string of long option names separated by commas, "<b>:</b>", or "<b>@</b>" characters. The flags ":" and "<b>@</b>" placed after the option name indicate the option with a string or numeric argument, respectively. Space characters are ignored.</p>

<p>An example of a long option string definition is:</p>

<pre>
mgetopt_parse( 0, "ignore-case, file: 
  delay@", 0, argc, argv);

</pre>

<p>where <b>ignore-case</b> is a long option with no argument, <b>file:</b> is a long option with a string argument, and <b>delay@</b> is a long option with a numeric argument.</p>

<p>The third <b>longshortopts</b> parameter is a string of long option names, where the first letter in each name automatically becomes a short option. Names are separated by commas, "<b>:</b>", or "<b>@</b>" characters. You may also explicitly define a short option letter by placing it into parentheses "(x)" after the long option name.</p>

<p>An example of a longshort option string definition is: </p>

<pre>
mgetopt_parse( 0, 0, "ignore-case, input-file(f):", 0, argc, argv);

</pre>

<p>where <b>ignore-case</b> is a longshort option with no argument, and <b>input-file</b> is a longshort option with a string argument.</p>

<p>After <b>mgetopt_parse</b> successfully completes, it saves all command-line options in a hash table. The option values are then accessible by the <b>mgetopt</b> function:</p>

<pre>
const char* mgetopt( const char* opt_name);

</pre>

<p>The <b>mgetopt</b> function returns a pointer to the option value if an option is found in a hash table; otherwise, it returns <b>NULL</b>.</p>

<p>There are also a number of useful, predefined option names: <b>NAME</b>, the name of the program invoked <b>(argv[0]); BAD</b>, a list of "bad" option names detected; <b>IND</b>, an index of the next nonoption argument to be processed; <b>SHIFT</b>, the number of options processed, which could be used as an argument in shell's shift command; and <b>HELP</b>, which holds a help text if it is defined.</p>

<p>My solution for help text is to embed text inside of the option string by placing it into curly braces. <b>mgetopt_parse</b> removes braces and text from option strings and saves them into the hash entry <b>HELP</b>. This approach lets me implement the help facility both for C and shell programs.</p>

<p>An example of a short option string definition with help text is:</p>

<pre>
mgetopt_parse( "a { -a print all} s { -s silent} h { -h help}",
               0, 0, argc, argv);

</pre>

<p>There are two additional, convenient functions that are available only for C programs:</p>



<ul>
  <li><b>int mgetopt_alias( const char* alias, const char* shortopts,</b></li>
  <li>                  <b> const char* longopts, const char* longshortopts);</b></li>
  <li><b>int mgetopt_choice( const char* shortopts, const char* longopts,</b></li>
  <li>                    <b>const char* longshortopts);</b></li>
</ul>



<p><a href="0411surmanl3.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 3</a> illustrates most of mgetopt's features just presented, while <a href="0411surmanl4.html" target="_BLANK">Listing 4</a> is an example of the shell script.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The mgetopt library I presented here utilizes a hash table to simplify the user interface and eliminate parsing loops. Most of mgetopt's features are available both for C and shell programs. </p>
