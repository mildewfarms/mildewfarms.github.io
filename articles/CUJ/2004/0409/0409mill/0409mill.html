<p>This column is a bit odd because it's about a nonproblem. It's a nonproblem, however, that people keep reporting to me as though it were a problem&#151;including bright and experienced people, including even multiple fellow <i>CUJ</i> columnists. So I decided to write a column about why the problem isn't real.</p>

<p>In <i>More Exceptional C++</i> [1] Items 13-16 and Appendixes A and B, I covered in some detail the key issues related to making copy-on-write (COW) strings thread-safe. This month's column presents the essence of the code in question, describes two common forms of the reported problem, which claims that the code apparently still isn't thread-safe for a subtle reason, and then explains why the problem is a phantom for an equally subtle but more basic reason.</p>

<p>Along the way, we'll recall the key division of responsibilities and related techniques for writing thread-safe code.</p>

<p>Let's dive right in.</p>
<h3>Motivating Example:  COW Strings,  Single Threaded</h3>

<p>Just to keep things interesting for the many readers for whom this background section is review, I'll gratuitously inject some new idioms into the code. For example, you'll notice that copy assignment takes its parameter by value, that <b>Swap</b> returns a reference to <b>*this</b> for the convenience of many of its callers, and that <b>EnsureUnique</b>'s implementation is restructured to flatten it out and remove nesting. I also decided to make <b>EnsureUnique</b> a <b>const</b> member function and <b>data_</b> a mutable member; even though it doesn't matter directly in the excerpted functions shown, in general <b>EnsureUnique</b> should be called at the beginning of every possibly mutating operation, and some of those can be <b>const</b> operations. (For example, <b>const char&amp; operator[]( size_t </b>) <b>const</b> yields a reference into the <b>String</b> that the user could use to change the <b>String</b>'s contents via a <b>const_cast</b>. Although such usage style might be questionable, in a complete <b>String</b> we would probably want to support it.)</p>

<p>Consider a few essential functions of a sample copy-on-write (reference-counted) <b>String</b> class. This example is based on one of the examples given in [1]:</p>

<pre>
// Example 1: Parts of a basic COW String
// (Note: NOT safe for multithreaded use)
//
class String {
public:
  String();
  String( const String&amp; );
  String&amp; operator=( String );
  ~String();
  String&amp; Swap( String&amp; other ) /* throw() */;
  void Append( char );
  // ... eliding other stuff, like copy 
  // assignment, Length, operator[], etc. ...
private:
  void EnsureUnique( size_t ) const;
  struct StringBuf {
    // ... I've elided a constructor that takes 
   // a size hint, various helper functions, 
    // and the string's representation here ...
    size_t refs;	// integral reference 				// count
  };
  mutable StringBuf* data_;
};

</pre>

<p>In a single-threaded world, implementing the Big Four special member functions is straightforward:</p>

<pre>
// Example 1, continued
//
String::String() : data_( new StringBuf ) { }

String::String( const String&amp; other ) {
  data_ = other.data_; // shallow copy; just 	          		// point at the same data_
  // update shared reference count
  ++data_-&gt;refs;		
}
String&amp; String::operator=( String temp ) {	// NB: by value
  return Swap( temp );
}
String::~String() {
  if( &#151;data_-&gt;refs &lt; 1 ) // last one out, 
    turn off the lights
    delete data_;
}
String&amp; String::Swap( String&amp; other ) 
  /* throw() */ {
  // swap our guts with others guts
  swap( data_, other.data_ ); 
  return *this;   // this return can be 			        // convenient for callers
}

</pre>

<p>That's it for the Big Four special member functions and their canonical nofail-safe <b>Swap</b> helper. (For further discussion of the nofail and other error-safety guarantees, see last month's column [2].)</p>

<p>Next is our sample mutating member function <b>Append</b>, which has to call <b>EnsureUnique</b> to force a deep copy before it modifies the string:</p>

<pre>
// Example 1, continued
//
void String::Append( char c ) {
  // perform deep copy if needed, and request  
  // room for an additional char
  EnsureUnique( data_-&gt;Length() +1 );
  // ... do the work of appending to data_ ... 
}

</pre>

<p>Finally, the <b>EnsureUnique</b> function is where all the deep copying happens. <b>EnsureUnique</b> takes a hint at what the split-off representation's minimum capacity should be, and passes that onward to a helpful <b>StringBuf</b> constructor that takes the minimum-capacity hint (not shown):</p>

<pre>
// Example 1, continued
//
void String::EnsureUnique( size_t n ) const {
  // if we're not shared, and our existing capacity
  // is already sufficient, then there's nothing to do
  if( data_-&gt;refs &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; data_-&gt;Capacity() &gt;= n )
    return;
  StringBuf* newdata = new StringBuf( *data_, n );
  if( &#151;data_-&gt;refs &lt; 1 )	// last one out, turn off the lights
    delete data_;
  data_ = newdata;
}

</pre>
<h3>Enter the Hydra:  COW Strings, Multithreaded</h3>

<p>What does it take to make this <b>String</b> safe for use in multithreaded environments? The answer, in short, is this: </p>

<p><i>"We must make <b>String</b> exactly as safe to use as it would be if it didn't use copy-on-write and do under-the-covers data sharing. It's wasteful to do more, and just plain wrong to do less."</i></p>

<p>Note: Doing more than this minimum, such as serializing all access to all member functions in an attempt to allow calling code to avoid the need to do any locking whatsoever, is technically possible but almost certainly misguided and therefore strongly discouraged. Synchronizing all member functions is not only hideously wasteful and almost always unnecessary, but it's almost always insufficient to boot. (See Appendix A of [1] for an example.) The well-intentioned authors of the Java 1.0 containers learned this lesson the hard way.</p>

<p>So <b>String</b> has to do <i>just enough</i> extra serialization work to enable calling code to work correctly as long as the calling code does its usual thing for thread-safe operation, namely to serialize access to individual visible <b>String</b> objects that the calling code knows are or can be actually shared across threads.</p>

<p>To illustrate: Say that a program has only two <b>String</b> objects, <b>s1</b>, which is shared across threads and <b>s2</b>, which is never shared. Then the calling code has to perform locking whenever it wants to manipulate <b>s1</b>, but it must not be required to do anything special when manipulating <b>s2</b>. That works fine by default with non-COW string types, but the COW <b>String</b> in Example 1 fails miserably here because the two distinct <b>String</b> objects <b>s1</b> and <b>s2</b> might share data under the covers, and thus invisibly be not fully distinct at all. Serializing all manipulations of <b>s1</b> is no longer enough for the program to ensure that it's serializing all manipulations of <b>s1</b>'s contents, because those contents can also be got at via <b>s2</b>. In fact, even if the calling code was aware of possible sharing issues, the calling code still can't lock all the right things because it has no way of knowing that (or when) two apparently distinct <b>String</b> objects aren't really fully distinct. In our example, there might not even be a single piece of code that knows about both strings <b>s1</b> and <b>s2</b>; they could easily be in modules that don't even know about each other and could still be sharing data under the covers if they both happen to start life as copies of a common third <b>String s3</b> somewhere else. (For a detailed example of how this can happen, see the error-reporting subsystem example in Appendix A of [1].)</p>

<p>So, what is the minimum responsibility that our COW <b>String</b> has to accept to buck up and behave itself? <b>String</b> must take responsibility, not for solving all possible thread-safety problems, but only for solving its share: If it uses copy-on-write, then it must do enough extra serialization work of its own to make itself as safe to use as if it wasn't sharing data under the covers.</p>

<p>Example 2 shows one of the least inefficient ways to do it. The key observation is that we only need to serialize access to the reference count itself, and this can be done most efficiently using system-specific atomic integer operations, rather than more heavyweight options such as mutexes (which would still be correct but are needlessly expensive). I'll postulate the following three atomic integer functions of interest:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>IAIncr</b> increments the integer value by 1 and returns the new value.</li>
  <li><b>IADecr</b> similarly decrements it by 1 and returns the new value.</li>
  <li><b>IAComp</b> returns -1, 0, or 1 if the integer is less than, equal to, or greater than a given value, respectively, much like <b>strcmp</b>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Most platforms have these functions under various names. (For alternative strategies and implementations other than atomic integer operations, and an analysis of relative costs and opportunities, see [1].)</p>

<p>Here's the corrected code, showing only the three functions that need to change from Example 1:</p>

<pre>
// Example 2: Changes to Example 1's COW String
// to make it safe for multi-threaded use
//
String::String( const String&amp; other ) {
  data_ = other.data_;
  IAIncr( data_-&gt;refs );
}
String::~String() {
  if( IADecr( data_-&gt;refs ) &lt; 1 )
    delete data_;
}

</pre>

<p>That's two out of the three that need to change. Finally, the only other copying code is the actual deep copy in <b>EnsureUnique</b>. <b>EnsureUnique</b> must be called by other <b>String</b> member functions before every possibly mutating operation, here <b>Append</b>. After all, we wouldn't want appending a character to one caller-visible <b>String</b> object to also append it to some other distinct <b>String</b> object, just because the two were sharing state and forgot to unshare it in time. So that's where all the actual deep-copying logic is found, and it's the only other function that needs to change:</p>

<pre>
// Example 2, continued
//
void String::EnsureUnique( size_t n ) const {
  // if we're not shared, and our existing capacity
  // is already sufficient, then there's nothing to do
  if( IAComp( data_-&gt;refs, 2 ) &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; data_-&gt;Capacity() &gt;= n )
    return;
  StringBuf* newdata = new StringBuf( *data_, n );
  if( IADecr( data_-&gt;refs ) &lt; 1 ) 	// Line A
    delete data_;
  data_ = newdata;
}
// ... all other functions are the same as in Example 1 ...

</pre>

<p>Note that the test on Line A now protects against two different kinds of conditions. First, as in Example 1, it protects against the case where we're allocating a new <b>StringBuf</b> even when the <b>String</b> isn't shared (<b>data_-&gt;refs &lt; 2</b>) because we need to grow to accommodate the new character being appended (<b>data_-&gt;Capacity() &lt; n</b>).</p>

<p>The second condition is a subtle race condition that arises only in multithreaded use: What if two <b>String</b> objects <b>s1</b> and <b>s2</b> are sharing this representation (that is, the reference count is 2), and one thread calls <b>Append</b> on <b>s1</b> at about the same time as another thread calls <b>Append </b>on <b>s2</b>? It could be that both threads get to Line A at the same time. Of course, both threads can't perform the <b>IADecr</b> simultaneously; that's the whole reason <b>IADecr</b> exists after all. But suppose that thread 1 performs its <b>IADecr</b> and then is immediately interrupted, thread 2 performs its <b>IADecr</b> and runs to the end of the function, and then thread 1 resumes: Even though the reference count was 2 at the beginning of the function, it's 0 now that this thread is letting go. That means that after its call to <b>IADecr</b>, thread 1 discovers that it has got two copies of the <b>StringBuf</b> buffer, both of which it now owns uniquely. What the threads have done is to each take their own copy of the <b>StringBuf</b>, only to discover that they're going to throw away the original <b>StringBuf</b>. Maybe, in a sense, one of the deep copies was useless because if thread 1 had somehow known this race condition would happen, it could have avoided taking its copy only to throw away the original <b>StringBuf</b>; but, since there's no way it could know, we accept that in such rare cases, we might incur a bit of needless deep copying work. <i>Eh bien, c'est la vi</i>e.</p>

<p>That's it; we're done. The other functions in Example 1 are fine as written.</p>
<h3>Segue: What About Swap?</h3>

<p>Did you notice that we didn't have to change <b>Swap</b>? That might bear some explanation, and it's a useful segue into our ultimate discussion of the (alleged) bugs.</p>

<p>It might be tempting to reason that, as currently written, <b>Swap</b> only performs a pointer swap, but even that can't be assumed to be an atomic operation. Fortunately that doesn't matter because, as it turns out, <b>Swap</b> doesn't need additional protection within <b>String</b> even if it were to become considerably more complex than it is in Example 1. Why not? Consider the two main scenarios where <b>Swap</b> is used: Either calling code calls it directly, as in:</p>

<pre>
a.Swap( b );

</pre>

<p>or else it calls it indirectly via the copy assignment operator, as in:</p>

<pre>
a = b;

</pre>



<p>where <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are distinct, visible <b>String</b> objects in both cases. But clearly such code knows that two <b>String</b> objects are involved, and therefore the calling code is required to serialize each of the two above statements with respect to all other uses of <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, and so there is no problem. (Even if there are other <b>String</b> objects sharing representations with either <b>a</b> or <b>b</b>, that doesn't matter; we're not affecting reference counts or anything here.)</p>
<h3>(Alleged) Bug #1:  Copy Construction</h3>

<p>The foregoing discussion about Swap leads nicely into the discussion about the nonbugs in Example 2 because it turns out that all of the so-called "bugs" stem from confusion about who is responsible for what part of thread-safety.</p>

<p>To see the first alleged bug, recall the copy constructor from Example 2:</p>

<pre>
// Repeated from Example 2
//
String::String( const String&amp; other ) {
  data_ = other.data_;
  IAIncr( data_-&gt;refs );
}

</pre>

<p>The objection is that the above code is not safe for multithreaded use and that the <b>IAIncr</b> should be performed first. "After all, say <b>other</b>'s reference count is originally 1," the reasoning goes. "Then what if thread 1 executes this code and successfully assigns <b>data_ = other.data_</b>; but is immediately interrupted before setting the reference count to 2, then another thread 2 destroys the other object, which will drop <b>other.data_-&gt;refs</b> to 0 and therefore delete <b>other.data_</b>, and then thread 1 resumes and tries to increment <b>data_-&gt;refs</b> where <b>data_</b> is now pointing to freed memory?" If that could happen, it certainly would be a problem. Fortunately, it can't happen&#151;not if everyone is playing by the rules.</p>

<p>The fallacy in this argument is that the problem scenario can't happen if the calling code is meeting its required and normal responsibility for thread-safety. Remember, calling code that knows an object is shared across threads is responsible for serializing all access to it. In this case, calling code is responsible for serializing access to all visible <b>String</b> objects that are shared across threads. If it does so, then the above problem scenario can't happen. Why not? Because the problem scenario assumes that thread 1 is executing the copy constructor to take a copy of a <b>String</b> object <b>s</b>&#151;while thread 2 is simultaneously destroying that same visible object <b>s</b>! It is the calling code, and not <b>String</b>, that is thread-unsafe if such a scenario can really happen. Calling code is required to prevent such simultaneous access to the same <b>String</b> object.</p>

<p>The bottom line: A COW <b>String</b> doesn't have to solve all thread-safety issues. It only has to make itself as safe for multithreaded use as it would have been if it wasn't using COW.</p>
<h3>(Alleged) Bug #2:  Append While Copying</h3>

<p>Now consider a similar alleged bug in the <b>EnsureUnique</b> deep-copying function:</p>

<pre>
// Repeated from Example 2
//
void String::EnsureUnique( size_t n ) const {
  // if we're not shared, and our 
  // existing capacity is already
  // sufficient, then there's nothing to do
  if( IAComp( data_-&gt;refs, 2 ) 
    &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; data_-&gt;Capacity() &gt;= n )
    return;
  StringBuf* newdata = new 
     StringBuf( *data_, n );
  if( IADecr( data_-&gt;refs ) &lt; 1 ) // Line A
    delete data_;
  data_ = newdata;
}

</pre>

<p>Here, the objection is similar: "Say the reference count is originally 1," the reasoning goes. "Then what if thread 1 is executing this code on a <b>String</b> object <b>s</b> and successfully calls <b>IADecr</b> in Line A to drop <b>refs</b> to 0 but then is immediately interrupted, then thread 2 takes a copy of the same string (for example, with code like <b>String s2 = s;</b>), which increments the reference count again to bring it back to 1, and then thread 1 resumes and deletes <b>data_</b>, which leaves thread 2's copy of the string with a <b>data_</b> that points to freed memory?" Again, if that could happen, it certainly would be a problem.</p>

<p>By now, the fallacy is probably obvious: This scenario presumes that thread 1 is executing some possibly mutating function on a <b>String</b> object <b>s</b> (for example, with code like <b>s.Append('a');</b>) while thread 2 is simultaneously taking a copy of that same visible object <b>s</b> (for example, with code like <b>String s2 = s;</b>)! This scenario can only occur if the calling code fails to correctly serialize access to the visible <b>String</b> object <b>s</b>, because <b>s</b> is used by multiple threads and therefore the code that's using <b>s</b> is responsible for making sure that <b>s</b> is never used simultaneously on different threads. It should definitely not be appending to <b>s</b> on one thread while taking a copy of <b>s</b> on another.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The issues described in this column apply not only to copy-on-write techniques for strings, but to techniques in any class that cause shared data under the covers between two different observable objects that appear distinct but really aren't deeply distinct.</p>

<p>In the presence of such implementation sharing, such a class must take responsibility, not for solving all possible thread-safety problems, but only for solving its share: If it uses copy-on-write, then it must do enough extra serialization work of its own to make itself as safe to use as if it wasn't sharing data under the covers.</p>

<p>Code that uses an object is responsible for knowing whether the object is shared across threads and, if so, for serializing access to the object. This is the normal duty of care required for thread-safe coding in general, and it applies to any shared object, no matter whether it is some kind of string object, or an STL container like a <b>vector</b>, or an object of some newfangled type that was authored yesterday by your team lead's great-aunt's youngest second cousin once removed. Specifically, it applies regardless of whether the object is covertly sharing state with other objects under the covers; if the shared object is doing such things, then it is responsible for guaranteeing that the sharing shenanigans don't matter.</p>

<p>The shared object isn't responsible for all possible thread-safety or for solving world hunger. It's only responsible for restoring "just enough" thread safety to make it possible for calling code to correctly fulfill its usual duty of care by serializing access to shared visible objects. And this is one of the rare cases in software development where "good enough" really is good enough.</p>
