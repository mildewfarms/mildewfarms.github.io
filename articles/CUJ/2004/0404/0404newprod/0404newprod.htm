This implementation of a C++ SOAP engine provides a stable platform for developing web services using C/C++ as well as a client-side library for developing C/C++ client applications. This release includes: a SOAP engine with client and server support; partial support for both SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2; WSDD-based deployment with dynamic deployment tools; support for all basic types, complex types, and arrays; and more. Both binary and source are available at Apache mirror sites.

You can also build the iJen engine into existing software using the SKFi motion detection-based visualization plug-in for Nullsoft's Winamp MP3 player. The new version of the library is faster, and improvements in TinyCam (SYFi's camera manager) code allow initialization and use of more types of webcams.

The new single-threaded eXtremeDB is designed with the same data management capabilities (including ACID-compliant transactions, and a high-level data definition language) as the multithreaded version, at a lower price. The single-threaded eXtremeDB, which is available in object code only, can also be upgraded to obtain database source code. Windows and Linux are supported.
