<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">TurboPower Announces Memory Sleuth 2</FONT></H3>

<p>TurboPower Software Company has shipped Memory Sleuth 2, a debugging tool for Windows programmers. Memory Sleuth 2 works by watching a Windows application while it runs and reporting errors wherever memory and other resources were allocated but never freed. It requires no changes to a program&#146;s source code. Instead, a Memory Sleuth 2 user compiles the project with the compiler&#146;s debugging information turned on. When Memory Sleuth 2 finds an error, it shows the programmer exactly where the error starts.</p>
<p>Memory Sleuth 2 costs $199 for a single-user license. Upgrades from version 1.5 cost $99. Prices include shipping and handling.</p>
<p>For more information, contact TurboPower Software Company, 800.333.4160; fax +1.719.260.7151; &lt;www.turbopower.com&gt;.</p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">The Kernel Group Introduces AutoTrace</FONT></H3>

<p>The Kernel Group has introduced AutoTrace, a cross-platform software analysis tool designed to work in very complex multi-threaded and distributed applications that cannot be traced with traditional debugging tools. Through its patent-pending technology, AutoTrace automatically embeds &#147;trace points&#148; in a company&#146;s software. These &#147;trace points&#148; continually record activity information. In the event of a software failure, collecting the trace data allows companies to see exactly what transpired in the seconds leading to a software failure and resolve the problem.</p>
<p>AutoTrace allows the level of tracing to be adjusted at any time while a company&#146;s program is running. For example, data points can be turned on or off to provide more or less debugging data, with no impact on the running software.</p>
<p>Pricing for AutoTrace starts at $5,000 per developer, with site and distribution licensing available.</p>
