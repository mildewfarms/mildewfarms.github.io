<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Cytron Research Releases Visual VCL Help v1.0</FONT></H3>
<p>Cytron Research Ltd. has released Visual VCL Help v1.0 for Delphi and C++Builder, a program that lets VCL component authors generate help files using a point-and-click visual interface. Visual VCL Help v1.0 employs a single project to simultaneously generate both C++Builder and Delphi VCL help files, reducing the effort required to produce VCL components for the Delphi and C++Builder environments.</p>
<p>Designed to simplify construction of help files for different versions of Delphi and C++Builder, Visual VCL Help v1.0 builds an internal dictionary of elements obtained during the parsing of the relevant source files and of those elements manually added as references to third-party help files. This dictionary is then employed to generate all the relevant topic pages, pop-up windows, browse groups, and hyperlinks. The dictionary holds classes, class methods, class properties and events, type descriptors, standalone procedures and functions, and examples and general help topics.</p>
<p>Visual VCL Help v1.0 costs $57 for a single-user license. An evaluation copy is available from the company&#146;s website.</p>

<p>General Software, Inc. has introduced Firmbase, a patented operating environment that runs portable executables at the system firmware layer. Firmbase is a binary executable resource loaded by Embedded BIOS 2000 during Power-On Self Test (POST). Once loaded, Firmbase loads pre-built EXE and DLL images stored in the BIOS boot ROM as binary resources. Effectively serving as the Hardware Abstraction Layer for Firmbase, Embedded BIOS 2000 abstracts the programming of the SMM chipset hardware and delivers regular 1-15ms SMIs as well as other interrupts, such as I/O requests to legacy 8042 ports and to the Firmbase kernel. The Firmbase kernel, in turn, exposes an API providing threads, timers, mutex, and event semaphors; deferred procedure calls; virtual interrupts; power failure and restart notification; exception handling; multiprocessor spinlocks; memory management; and an I/O system with device and file objects.</p>
