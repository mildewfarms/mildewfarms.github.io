<p>Somebody let Stan off the plane in New Orleans, ostensibly to cover a Unix conference. Here is his report, complete with a bit of (ahem) cultural commentary.</p>

<p>I&#146;m freshly back from the 14th USENIX Systems Administration Conference (LISA 2000) wearing yet another red-badge of conferential courage on my Basque beret. My new znatchtki says SAGE, which modestly reflects my old-fart &#147;knowing&#148; status in the Unix &#147;community&#148; <a href="#1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, the acronym SAGE (System Administrators Guild) should, in my case-use, be known as SAG, indicating how soon we lag behind the &#147;cutting edge.&#148;</p>
<p>LISA 2000 had the mixed blessing of being held in New Orleans, LA. Occasionally distracted by (i) pronouncing it Noo&#146;awleens, (ii) checking the claim that Pat O&#146;Briens is the world&#146;s largest pub <a href="#2">[2]</a>, (iii) socio-musico-linguistic explorations of the Cajun/Zydeko experience, and (4) packed sessions at Preservation Hall where Jelly-Roll&#146;s &#147;jass&#148; started &#151; nevertheless, I managed to visit the <B>www.sarcheck.com</B> booth &#151; and have the daft propeller hat to convince the IRS.</p>
<p>The main Lisa 2000 agendum/agenda was/were the agony/agonies of network monitoring and security.</p>
<p>You can read all about it in the published USENIX/SAGE proceedings (browse <B>www.usenix.org</B>).</p>
<p>My favorite offbeat paper from Tufts University is &#147;Peep (The Network Auralizer): Monitoring Your Network With Sound,&#148; Michael Gilfix/Alva Couch (check <B>http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/peep/</B>). The sublime notion is that while things go good, the &#147;auralized&#148; SysAdmin hears gentle, non-distracting &#147;green&#148; background sounds &#151; bird-love songs and friendly frogs burping from Waldon pond. As soon as an anomaly is detected (some cracker has grabbed root), you are alerted by an appropriate MP3 burst of Fats Waller&#146;s &#147;Hate You, &#146;Cos Yer Feet&#146;s Too Big.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="1"></a>[1]  Not quite the &#147;Balkan community,&#148; but getting close with conflicting Linux IPOs.</p>
<p><a name="2"></a>[2]  They serve a secret formula called &#147;Swampwater.&#148; My guess is 50 percent Coors, 50 percent alligator piss.</p>
