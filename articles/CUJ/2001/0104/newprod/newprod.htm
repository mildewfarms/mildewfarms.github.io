<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Intel Announces Compilers for Pentium 4 and Itanium</FONT></H3>
<p>Intel Corporation has announced Intel C++ Compiler for Windows v5.0 and Intel Fortran Compiler for Windows v5.0. The new compilers take advantage of the performance features available in the upcoming 32-bit Pentium 4 microprocessor and also include a pre-release version for the upcoming 64-bit Itanium processor. These compilers can also be used on systems based on Intel 32-bit Pentium processors to create 64-bit executables. Developers can use the new compiler to start producing applications for the Itanium processor using the Intel-based systems they already have.</p>
<p>Intel has enhanced each compiler to support new, performance-oriented features such as autovectorization and OpenMP. Intel has also enhanced optimization features introduced in earlier compiler releases, including interprocedural optimization, vectorization, and profile-guided optimization. The 32-bit compilers also feature enhanced intrinsics and class libraries that add the Pentium 4 processor to the list of supported processors. The intrinsics and class library eliminate the need to program directly in assembly language, making it easier to get &#147;close to the hardware&#148; to improve application performance.</p>
<p>Intel&#146;s C++ and Fortran compilers continue to plug into Microsoft&#146;s VisualStudio development environment. The 32-bit Intel C++ Compiler v5.0 also carries forward its source- and object-code compatibility with Microsoft Visual C++. This allows application modules generated with either compiler to be linked together in larger application executables.</p>
<p>The Intel C/C++ Compiler v5.0 for Windows costs $399 (electronic fulfillment) and $449 for the CD-ROM. The Intel Fortran Compiler v5.0 for Windows costs $449 (electronic fulfillment) and $599 for the CD-ROM. The compilers can be ordered from the website at http://developer.intel.com/vtune.</p>
