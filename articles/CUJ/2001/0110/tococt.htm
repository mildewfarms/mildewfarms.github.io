<p>In this new, web-only component of <I>CUJ</I>, we continue publication of the columns that were popular in the former <I>C++ Report</I> magazine. The following articles are featured on the <I>CUJ</I> website this month:<P>

<H4><A HREF="../cexp1910/alexandr/alexandr.htm">&#147;Generic &lt;Programming&gt;: Typed Buffers (II)&#148;</A></H4>
<p><b>by Andrei Alexandrescu</b><br>
<I>The foray into the undergrounds of typed buffers continues, but this time it&#146;s not about structure; it&#146;s about algorithms. If, as the saying goes, an expert is one who talks much about little, this installment does deserve to be in the &#147;Experts&#148; forum. We only muse about copying and filling memory. Old hat? Take a look; you&#146;ll be surprised.</I></p>

<H4><A HREF="../cexp1910/austern/austern.htm">&#147;The Standard Librarian: Containers of Pointers&#148;</A></H4>
<p><b>by Matt Austern</b><br>
<i>Containers of pointers are common and important. Unfortunately, they are also widely misunderstood. This column explains how containers of pointers behave, when containers of pointers are useful, and what techniques you can use to manage them.</i></p>

<H4><A HREF="../cexp1910/hyslop/hyslop.htm">&#147;Conversations: Al-Go-Rithms&#148;</A></H4>
<p><b>by Jim Hyslop and Herb Sutter</b><br>
<i>The Standard C library contains some functions that are still useful in C++. Sometimes, though, you need to find your own &#146;rithm &#151; algorithm, that is.</i></p>

<H4><A HREF="../cexp1910/vinoski/vinoski.htm">&#147;Object Interconnections: CORBA and XML &#151; Part 3: SOAP and Web Services&#148;</A></H4>
<p><b>by Douglas C. Schmidt and Steve Vinoski</b><br>
<i>Doug and Steve complete their series of columns on CORBA and XML with an extensive exploration of SOAP and web services. Both SOAP and web services are currently garnering a lot of industry attention, with some comparing CORBA and SOAP, or CORBA and web services, as if they were competitors. Doug and Steve first compare SOAP and IIOP and then argue that web services and CORBA are not rivals, but instead are complementary. They see web services serving as business process integration technology capable of combining existing middleware technologies into Internet-accessible service-oriented business processes.</i></p>
