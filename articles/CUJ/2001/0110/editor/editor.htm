<p>The prologue to Bobby Schmidt&#146;s column this month reminds me of the seemingly countless times I&#146;ve received email requests from all over the world like the following:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>&#147;I need your help in completing the following assignment: &lt;there follows some fairly trivial programming task, like writing some records to file and reading them back again, or creating and traversing a linked list, etc.&gt; I need it by Friday, if possible, and please don&#146;t use any fancy programming techniques, since the teacher will know it wasn&#146;t me. Waiting to hear from you...&#148;</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Such people do hear from me. I politely tell them that I don&#146;t have time to do their homework for them, and that if they would talk to the teacher or perhaps someone else in the class, I&#146;m sure they would get the help they need to get started. What they don&#146;t hear is how foolish I think their request is (for reasons obvious to anyone reading this forum, I&#146;m sure). And of course I don&#146;t hear from them again.</p>
<p>Twice in the last five years things have turned out differently, however. I received the following from a college student (evidently not a C.S. major) last March:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>&#147;Hi there Chuck, my name is ******. I am in my first year of programming, and man is it ever hard. I don&#146;t know if it isn&#146;t sinking in or what. I am having problems understanding when you use ELSE, DO WHILE, IF, and including a file into the program. It is so hard and I really can&#146;t afford to fail this course. The programs are getting longer and more complex. If there is any advice you can give to me, I would really appreciate it &#151; even to explain it for programming for dummies would be helpful. Thanks.&#148;</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In this case, she was asking for advice, not for me to do her work. I gave my usual polite response along with some additional suggestions and received the following in return:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>&#147;I am just happy that you responded to the email, and yes I agree with you. The teacher is very programmer oriented. Explains everything in language that I don&#146;t understand. But I will look that stuff up. Thanks again for the help, and good luck with your future.&#148;</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Would that more of these folks were of this ilk.</p>
<p>The other occurrence moved me to actually do some work. A woman with a home-based business needed some help converting time fields in a database into a readable format. The numbers in question were <B>time_t</B> values from a popular C/C++ compiler. It took all of 15 minutes to code and test a less than 10-line program to do the job. I mailed her an executable, and she countered with this mail:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>&#147;Words cannot say how happy and grateful I am! Even though for you, &#145;the routine [was] so trivial to write,&#146; for me this kindness makes all the difference in the world. For the first time since I started using the CallAudit program in 1994, I will be able to import its records ... into other programs, which will allow me to use the information in a much more meaningful way (like preparing bills). Your program will spare me from continuing to divert hundreds of hours (conservatively) for the purpose of reentering the data.&#148;</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>But let me repeat that these cases were the exception. Most of the time the writers are looking for someone to do what they can and should do for themselves.</p>
<p>I believe it was Benjamin Franklin who said, &#147;Experience is a dear [i.e., expensive] school, and only fools learn therein.&#148; I further believe that he was extolling the virtue of learning from the experience of others, since no one has time to experience everything, but certainly he wasn&#146;t suggesting that we have no experience whatsoever. The simple, even trite, truth is that one learns to program by programming (substitute your favorite verb for &#147;program&#148; at will). The experts who grace the pages of <I>CUJ</I> are here ultimately both because of their experience, and because they are willing to learn from others. I find that the most adept among us freely honor their mentors, but above all, they do their own homework. Take a lesson.</p>
