<p>In this rather anecdotal section, I describe how a complete application was developed with wxWindows. I am not using this application as a sample of what you can do with wxWindows, or as a tutorial on the rest of the features that I didn&#146;t discuss in this article (which are countless). Rather, I offer this application as proof of how easy to learn and use wxWindows is.</p>
<p>This application was developed by a group of ten of my students in the context of a &#147;Team Project&#148; course. After a three-week C++ course, I was in charge of a two-week team project, in which the students had the responsibility to develop a relatively large and complex application using C++. I decided to have the entire group develop an image display utility for Linux, using wxWindows. The goal was to develop an open source application of enough quality to be published and good enough to be actually useful. And I think they did achieve that goal, completing the design of an application that we named Wx-View.</p>
<p>wxWindows&#146; ease of use becomes obvious when you consider that ten students with zero actual programming experience learned wxWindows and completed an application that uses lots of advanced features. All that in only two weeks, and without much prior training in wxWindows. (I just introduced it the last day of the C++ course, and gave them an extra day to practice, read the online documentation and samples, etc.)</p>
<p>You can find more about the Wx-View project (and download it and use it) from my web site, at <B>http://www.mochima.com/wx-view</B>, or from the wxWindows web site, following the link to Contributions.</p></blockquote></body></html>
