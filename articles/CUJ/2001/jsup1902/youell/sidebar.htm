<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>A Java Server Page is a text file that looks like a regular HTML web page with embedded JSP code. This file is compiled into a Java servlet (similar to a CGI program) which runs on a web server.</p>
<p>JSP defines several tags or delimiters that are relevant to the JSP compiler:</p>

<UL><LI>   The delimiter set <B>&lt;%@ ... %&gt;</B> indicates a JSP server directive, such as a Java <B>import</B> directive to import class libraries.</LI>
<LI>   The delimiter set <B>&lt;%-- ... --%&gt;</B> indicates a JSP comment.</LI>
<LI>   The delimiter set <B>&lt;%! ... %&gt;</B> indicates a Java definition, such as a variable initialization or a method definition.</LI>
<LI>   The delimiter set <B>&lt;% ... %&gt;</B> indicates Java code that is to be executed.</LI>
<LI>   The delimiter set <B>&lt;%= ... %&gt;</B> indicates Java code that will ultimately emit a Java <B>String</B>. This code might name a <B>String</B> object, or a method that returns a <B>String</B>. Note that all objects in Java have a <B>toString</B> method that is called when a string is expected. So writing the JSP code <B>&lt;%Foo%&gt;</B> ultimately results in a call to <B>Foo.toString</B>, where <B>Foo</B> is the name of a Java object.</LI></UL>

<p>When the JSP page is compiled, the data in the server page is inserted into a skeleton <B>Servlet</B> class. Any functions defined in the server page become methods of the resulting class. HTML content is converted into a set of Java <B>String</B> literals. The servlet will send these HTML strings back to the client&#146;s browser, interspersed with the output of the <B>toString</B> methods discussed above.</p>
<p>When following the logic of a JSP page, you can think of the order of execution as being from top to bottom. For example, when a browser requests the page shown in Listing 1, the servlet corresponding to this page is activated. The servlet first constructs a <B>String</B> object named <B>Hello</B>. Then the servlet outputs the HTML code shown. When it gets to the delimiter set <B>&lt;%=Hello%&gt;</B>, it outputs the contents of the <B>String</B> object named <B>Hello</B>. Thus, the HTML sent to the browser looks like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;FONT COLOR=&#148;Red&#148;&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>
