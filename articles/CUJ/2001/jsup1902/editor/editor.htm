<p>In this issue of <I>Java Solutions,</I> we welcome Chuck Allison back as a regular contributor. On the surface it may appear we&#146;re justing moving Chuck&#146;s &quot;import java.*&quot; column from <I>CUJ</I> to <I>Java Solutions.</I> Behind the scenes we&#146;re preparing the way for Chuck to have an expanded role with <I>Java Solutions:</I> he will be serving as Technical Editor, which among other things will mean reviewing manuscripts, editing, and shaping the content of future <I>Java Solutions</I> supplements.</p>
<p>Some readers may not be aware of the long involvement Chuck has had with <I>CUJ,</I> not to mention the C family of languages. His &quot;Code Capsules&quot; column ran in <I>CUJ</I> from October 1992 through May 1995. After that he was a Consulting Editor for a number of years, helping to bring important authors to the pages of <I>CUJ.</I> He began writing his &quot;import java.*&quot; column for <I>CUJ</I> in January 1999. He has been a frequent speaker at Software Development conferences and an independent trainer in C, C++, and Java. And did I mention that Chuck has a book out? Check out <I>C &amp; C++ Code Capsules: A Guide for Practitioners.</I></p>
<p>Hard to keep up with &#151; that&#146;s how I characterize Chuck; and he definitely has the writing bug. I feel fortunate that he has chosen to exercise it with <I>CUJ</I> over the years, and now with <I>Java Solutions.</I> I am sure that readers will feel the same.</p>
