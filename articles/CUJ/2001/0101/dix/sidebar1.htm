<p>XML, the Extensible Markup Language, is a simple method of structuring text data. There are many different pieces of information that can be contained in an XML document, including processing instructions, comments, and <B>CDATA</B> sections, but the two key concepts used to structure information in an XML document are elements and attributes.</p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Elements</FONT></H3>

<p>The element is the basic unit of data in XML. Elements can contain most of the other components of XML, as well as other elements, as content. Each document has a single element at the root known as the document element. Elements are defined by a pair of tags, the element name (which is case-sensitive) is enclosed by the angle brackets. The start tag appears as <B>&lt;name&gt;</B>, and the end tag as <B>&lt;/name&gt;</B>. If an element has no content, it can also be represented by an empty element tag, <B>&lt;name/&gt;</B>. Here are some example elements:</p>

<pre>
&lt;Wife&gt;Jen&lt;/Wife&gt;
&lt;Kids&gt;
   &lt;Son&gt;Alexander&lt;/Son&gt;
   &lt;Son&gt;Calvin&lt;/Son&gt;
&lt;/Kids&gt;
&lt;Pet/&gt;
</pre>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Attributes</FONT></H3>

<p>Attributes are named values that appear within the start tag (or empty element tag) of an element. The value of an attribute is a string literal delimited by either single or double quotes. For a given element, each instance of attribute name must be unique. Attributes are used to show properties of a piece of data that might not fit the container relationship a child element suggests. Here are some examples of elements that contain attributes:</p>

<pre>
&lt;Dog breed='mutt' color='brown'&gt;Rogue&lt;/Dog&gt;
&lt;Champion sport='football'/&gt;
&lt;Hero type='gamma'&gt;Hulk&lt;/Hero&gt;
</pre>

<p>One use for the attribute is to declare namespaces. Namespaces, and how they can be used to prevent name collisions in SOAP messages, are discussed in this article.</p>
