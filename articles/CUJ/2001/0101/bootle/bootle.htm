<p>Having discredited doomsayers of the past, Stan makes a few of his own predictions to chill the hearts of his favorite editors.</p>

<p>I&#146;ve just been re-reading Nevil Shute&#146;s <I>On The Beach</I>. Written in 1957, it records what you might call a calm, scientific eschatalogy. The whole human race is erased following some vaguely hinted-at global cobalt-bomb war, yet compared with the familiar sci-fi apocalypticals, Shute&#146;s quiet narrative is more convincing and devasting. His world ends not with a bang, nor with a whimper, but with Australians (the last to succumb to the south-creeping radiation-cholera) buying and racing Ferrari bargains left behind by dead Europeans. The world&#146;s final Grand Prix sets crazy fatal lap records. As Thomas Hood might have said, &#147;No holds were barred on either side &#151; there were no bars to hold.&#148;</p>
<p>To the very closing seconds of extinction, people are brewing nice cups of tea (the Imperial panacea) or rushing to buy lawnmowers and garden benches. One purchaser asks &#147;Will you take a cheque?&#148; The jaded salesperson answers, &#147;We&#146;re about to close, I&#146;ll take orange peel.&#148;</p>
<p>Poignant Shute end-lights: being a heavy-drinker or a sober rabbit could extend your life-span by a fortnight. And certain Antarctic troglobites might even survive to re-spawn terra firma sapienta after who-knows how many half-shelf lives <a href="#1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Ah well, as with Orwell&#146;s 1984, we, the now living, can justifiably condemn the false prophets (Revelation 16:13). The Bomb Threat, has, so far, since 1945, limited our calamities to a sequence of minor non-atomic, local, low-tech genocides.</p>
<p>The moral, patient reader, confirms Oscar Wilde&#146;s reluctance to predict, especially about the future. However, using the proven Nostrildamus methodology (my patented snotomancy involves plucking and measuring <I>your</I> nose hair), I can warn you that some magazine re-names are afoot. <I>JJOOP</I> (<I>Journal of Java Object- Oriented Programming</I>) will become <I>JMOOP</I> (<I>Journal of Microsoft Object-Oriented Programming</I>), and our esteemed organ&#146;s title will be extended to <I>C/C++/C# Users Journal</I> <a href="#2">[2]</a> [Only in your dreams, Stan &#151; mb].</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in real time, I&#146;ve received in the paper-flesh, <I>Accelerated C++ &#151; Practical Programming by Example</I> (Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-70353-X). Visit <B>www.awl.com/cseng/</B> for blurbs, pricing, and order info. Together with Bjarne Stroustrup&#146;s C++ &#147;bibles&#148; (also from Addison-Wesley) and the ISO standard, you now have a simple route to C++ mastery! Hey, it&#146;s Chrizzy &#151; if you have any struggling C++ pals on your under $40 Prezzie List, seek no more. No typos yet detected in Koenig/Moo, but I prefer to repeat the optional <B>virtual</B> in derived function definitions (page 237).</p>

<p><a name="1"></a>[1]  Nevil Shute (1899-1960) has been enjoying a much-deserved &#147;revival&#148; lately including birth-centennial celebrations in, of all places, Sante Fe, New Mexico. The movies &#147;A Town Called Alice&#148; and &#147;On The Beach,&#148; though box-office hits, never quite captured his genius. Of the rare crop of contemporary novelists who share his combination of scientific and literary talents, note Clive Barker. In his weird <I>Galilee</I> (1998), one character threatened with oblivion replies &#147;Well, it&#146;s not the end of the world.&#148;</p>
<p><a name="2"></a>[2]  Intriguing article (Octothorp Standard) by Wendy M. Grossman in <I>Scientific American</I>, October, 2000, page 37. She sums up the bizarre quirks of fate: Sun&#146;s withdrawal from an &#147;open&#148; Java standard, and Microsoft&#146;s rush to an ISO C#. Apart from how to say C# (C sharp is the preferred modest musical &#147;post semitone increment&#148; interpretation), Grossman ponders the cruel fact that many search engines fail to recognize or misinterpret the character &#147;#&#148;.</p>
