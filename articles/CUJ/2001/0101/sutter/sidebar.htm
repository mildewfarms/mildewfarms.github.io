<p><I>Breaking news at press time:</I> On Friday, October 27, 2000 at the conclusion of the Toronto meeting, the C++ standards committee approved two important milestones:</p>
<p>1. <I>Approved the contents of the C++ Standard&#146;s first TC (Technical Corrigendum).</I> The vote passed unanimously, and this material will become the first official update to the ISO/ANSI C++ Standard pending only a few more months of grinding through the routine publication mechanics and paperwork that the standards bodies require.</p>
<p>One of the interesting changes in the TC is that the Standard will now guarantee that <B>vector</B> storage is contiguous (except of course for the specialization <B>vector&lt;bool&gt;</B>), where &quot;contiguous&quot; means to be stored in the same way as a C-style array; see Figure 2. One reason it is important that <B>vector</B> be stored contiguously is so that it can be used easily as a complete drop-in replacement for C-style arrays, even when calling legacy facilities designed to operate on plain arrays; for more details, see my July/August 1999 column in <I>C++ Report</I> [5]. If you&#146;re wondering why <B>vector&lt;bool&gt;</B> would get a seemingly surprising exception from this rule, see also my May 1999 column in <I>C++ Report</I> [6] for the scoop on that juicy little eccentricity.</p>
<p>2. <I>Approved initiation of work toward a Library Extensions Technical Report.</I> The LWG (Library Working Group) and the full committee agree that it&#146;s time we start considering extensions to the standard library; of course, any such extensions won&#146;t appear in an official standard for probably at least three years yet, if not more, but the point is that there are things that the community wants/needs and that we ought to start working into the standard library. Commonly requested items include things like hash-based containers, regular expressions, smart pointers, and expression templates, among other facilities.</p>
<p>Between now and the next meeting (Copenhagen, April 29 - May 4, 2001) we will be drafting an official ISO request for a New Work Item, which essentially translates to &quot;a request for ISO&#146;s blessing/authorization to do this work.&quot; I fully expect this request to be drafted and approved by/at the Copenhagen meeting; and after a few more months&#146; worth of bureaucratic machinery we should be officially in business by summer. Of course, some people have already been starting to work on such facilities in anticipation of this approval; if you haven&#146;t checked out Boost yet, be sure to do so at <B>www.boost.org</B>.</p></blockquote></body></html>
