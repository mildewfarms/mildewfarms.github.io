<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">PolySpace Presents PolySpace C Verifier</FONT></H3>
<p>PolySpace Technologies has announced PolySpace C Verifier, a software verification and validation tool that protects against run-time errors. PolySpace C Verifier employs a technology called abstract interpretation that checks the dynamic properties of an application without actually running it. Instead of iteratively verifying software states like a case generator, PolySpace C Verifier works on an abstraction of the analyzed software.</p>
<p>PolySpace C Verifier detects: an attempt to read a non-initialized variable, access conflicts for unprotected shared data, referencing through null or out-of-bounds pointers, out-of-bound array access, buffer overflow, division by zero, invalid arithmetic operations such as square root of a negative number, overflow and underflow of arithmetic operations for integers and floating-point numbers, unreachable code, and illegal type conversion.</p>
<p>PolySpace C Verifier pricing starts at $6,000. Upper limits depend on customer needs, but price depends on number of developers, size of project, and duration. PolySpace C Verifier may also be acquired on the basis of an annual rental fee.</p>
