<p>Whom do you trust (apologies to Johnny Carson)? Bill Gates? Groucho Marx? English language "experts"? One thing is certain: you can trust Stan to get you thinking about most anything, including matters of trust.</p>

<p>That&#146;s a firm command rather than a weasel C/C++ volatile-register-type do-the-best-you-can compiler request. I insist. Indeed, I assert. You can run [sic], but you can&#146;t hide. No exceptions. Trust me. Read my LISP! I have (((spoken)))!</p>
<p>In many CS language cultures, &#147;trust&#148; is brutally enforced by an army of high-paid lawyers versed in the ancient arcana of &#147;contract.&#148;</p>
<p>True, there are diverse meta-legal methodologies. My heart belongs to the Anglo-Viking pragmatic, Beowulf, Seamus Heaney tradition espoused by Saint Bjarne Stroustrup&#146;s C++ approach. He, bless his iron-mail cotton socks, prefers the lack of in-built dogma. You are free to decide the pros/cons of, say, ultimate type-safety and garbage collection.</p>
<p>My French-Polish Iwonka (damn her randy hide) prefers Bertrand Meyer&#146;s Eiffel Diktat. She rates Napoleon just a shake above Marat and Elvis. Chop! Your heads will roll! We know best. Sorry!</p>

<p>The in-joke of English 19th century Contract Law exams typically explores the failure of Supplier A to timely [sic] supply X tons of coal to Vendor B.</p>
<p>Phatic phrases such as &#147;best efforts&#148; spring to mind.</p>
<p>Then, there were endless case-pattern litigations when A&#146;s horse kicked B&#146;s head.</p>
<p>No <B>malloc</B> exceptions in those days. But many devious epistemological disputes arose at $200 per billable hour: What was in the minds of A and B? In particular, can we blame A&#146;s horse for behaving horse-like, <I>de deux maux</I>? And surely B was at fault for exposing his head to predictable hooves?</p>
<p>As Groucho once said, &#147;I got my legs in his teeth, and I wouldn&#146;t let go.&#148;</p>

<p>There is a CS &#147;trust&#148; spin to all this.</p>
<p>I have, as Neville Chamberlain declared in 1938/9, a &#147;piece of paper&#148; signed by Mister Hitler assuring World Peace.</p>
<p>Who said a written agreement is not worth the paper it&#146;s written on?</p>
<p>I also have an impressive letter addressed to MOI. And signed by Bill Gates, no less.</p>
<p>Bill seems to be offering a new .NET Trust-Me World Order based on Open XML-SOAP.</p>
<p>There&#146;s a new irresistible language called C# combining the best/worst of C++, Eiffel, and Java. Can&#146;t be all bad?</p>
<p>George Jansen reminds me that C# can be pronounced musically as C sharp or maybe D flat?</p>
<p>Or, taking the &#147;#&#148; as one of the popular ASCII literals, we could say &#147;C hash,&#148; whence by Microsoft elision, &#147;Cash.&#148;</p>
<p>Thus, who can blame my old Borland hero Andjers for &#147;crossing the park?&#148;</p>
<p>Yet, in the effort to maintain C#/C++ co-existence, we must accept ever more semantic/syntactic wrappers.</p>
<p>Mon dieu! CLR is no longer our God-given acronym.</p>
<p>And we must tag our code as &#147;managed C++&#148; by default?</p>
<p>Else, who knows, endless years of mismanagement?</p>
<p>Trust Bill. He can outbid youse all.</p>

<p>A beee-lated welcome to our new Senior Editor, Chuck Allison. And, likewise, an overdue farewell and thanks to Marc Briand. The highlight of many previous SD (Software Development) Conferences has been a dinner (known by the IRS as &#147;working&#148;) hosted by Marc for his contributors, whereby &#147;mere&#148; names on the masthead became real flesh &#146;n blood friends. That is not to say we all agreed on every &#147;dark corner&#148; of the C++ Standard, nor on the best C++ pedagogical methodologies. Try saying <I>that</I> after a generous coup de rouge. (&#147;Le jour de boire est arriv&eacute;?&#148;)</p>
<p>However, these meetings built an esprit that helped <I>CUJ</I> survive, nay thrive, through the many transitions that magazines are heir to.</p>
<p>Chuck Allison&#146;s August 2001 editorial &#147;The Name Game&#148; is a timely reminder of the sneaky nature of natural language, the only means, alas, for discussing the C++ Standard and the sneaky nature of natural language!</p>
<p>Apart from the shifting semantics of function, functional, and functor, the marketing branch of our fair trade persists in claiming, e.g., &#147;increased functionality.&#148; This &#147;functionality&#148; lacks a decent metric and has generated much definitional bewilderment. I have (passim) dubbed it the F-word.</p>
<p>In the realms of &#147;pure&#148; mathematics, you&#146;ll find the term <I>cleavage</I> used without a snigger. It&#146;s a sort of Dedekind Cut only remotely connected with Jane Russell. (Bertie is more involved.)</p>
<p>But here&#146;s the ultimate semantic tease. Plato distinguished <I>arithmetike</I> from <I>logistike</I> (where&#146;s a decent Greek font when you need it?). Seems straightforward until you check his definitions: <I>arithmetike</I> was what we would now call the logical foundations of mathematics, while <I>logistike</I> referred to nuts &#146;n bolts calculation, a domain we now call &#147;arithmetic.&#148;</p>

<p><i><B>Stan Kelly-Bootle</B> has been computing on and off since 1953 when he graduated from Cambridge University in Pure Mathematics and hacked on EDSAC I (the first true stored-program computer). He is a contributing editor for </I>Linux Journal<I> and a Jolt Judge for </I>Software Development<I> Magazine. With the demise of </I>UNIX Review/Performance Computing<I>, his 16-year-old Devil&#146;s Advocate column has moved online to &lt;www.sarcheck.com&gt;.
