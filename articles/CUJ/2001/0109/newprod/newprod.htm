<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">TASKING Launches Multicore Debug System</FONT></H3>

<p>TASKING has launched the MDS (Multicore Debug System), debugging technology that synchronizes the behavior of debuggers of individual processors in a multiprocessor system to reflect how the processors interact with each other. It provides a platform that facilitates complete simulation of the multicore behavior.</p>
<p>To initiate an environment where multiple debugger clients can communicate with multiple targets, TASKING extends the generic interface used by the CrossView Pro debugger to enable target systems to interact with both proprietary and open-standard platforms. Within this open framework, the object-oriented nature of the MDS creates an environment in which discrete microprocessors and processing cores are all treated as &#147;processing units.&#148;</p>
