<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>When you write a class, you'll probably want to define operations to read and write objects of that class.  The usual technique in C is to define functions with names like <B>read_X</B> and <B>write_X</B>, but in C++ we have a better way.  I/O functions in C, like <B>printf</B> and <B>scanf</B>, involve format strings that describe a fixed set of types like <B>int</B>, <B>double</B>, and <B>char*</B>: you write <B>printf("x = %d", x)</B> if <B>x</B> is an <B>int</B>, <B>printf("x = %g", x)</B> if <B>x</B> is a <B>double</B>, and so on.  The C I/O library is not extensible, so we use one mechanism, <B>printf</B>, for built-in types, and another mechanism, functions like <B>write_X</B>, for user-defined types.</P>
<P>The C++ I/O library is extensible.  It relies on overloading, not on format strings: you write <B>cout &lt;&lt; "x = " &lt;&lt; x</B> whether <B>x</B> is an <B>int</B>, a <B>double</B>, or any other type.  To make this mechanism work with your own type, all you have to do is define a function with the signature</P>

<pre>
std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp;, const my_type&amp;)
</pre>

<P>Built-in types and user-defined types appear on an equal footing; in both cases, the appropriate function is selected by ordinary overload resolution.  It's even possible to write generic I/O components parameterized by type, such as <b>ostream_iterator</b>.</P>
<P>This is all straightforward, and it's covered in every introductory C++ book <a href="#1">[1]</a>. There's just one annoying complication: what do you do if there's more than one good choice for the class's printed representation?</P>
<P>This is hardly a rare occurrence.  If you're writing a class to store IPv6 addresses, for example, you can print an address as 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:8190:3426, ::FFFF:129.144.52.38, or in several other ways.  If you're writing a class to represent physical quantities, should you print a length as 0.5m, 50cm, or 20in?  If you're writing a date and time class, do you print &quot;June 16, 1904&quot;, &quot;16/6/04&quot;, or any of a dozen other possibilities?  (The <B>time_put</B> and <B>time_get</B> locale facets give some limited guidance on these issues, but they're mostly a low-level framework.)  We even have this problem with a humble complex number class: should we write a complex number as (5, 3), 5 + 3i, 5 + 3j, or perhaps 5.8*exp(0.54i)?  </P>
<P>In all but the most trivial cases, there's more than one sensible way to print an object.  If you're writing a class that's only intended for a single use in a specific project, maybe it's acceptable to hard-wire a specific policy.  If you're writing a class for reuse, however, you don't have that luxury.  It's the class's user, not the class's designer, who knows which choice is appropriate in a given context.</P>
<P>An obvious bad idea would be to give your class a static member variable that specifies formatting options.  It's obvious because it gives the user a choice, and it's a bad idea because the choice is global.  The usual objections to global data apply: a formatting style that's appropriate in one part of a large program may not be appropriate in another part.  Global data means that everything in your program potentially depends on everything else. </P>
<P>If we were writing a <B>print_X</B> function, there would be a very easy way to solve this problem: we would just give it an extra argument where the caller could provide format flags.  (You've probably written functions like that.)  We can't do that here because <B>operator&lt;&lt;</B> only takes two arguments, the stream and the object to be printed; there's no obvious place to put format flags.  Where should they go?</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">What Would int Do?</FONT></H3>

<P>Scott Meyers's rule of thumb for user-defined classes <a href="#2">[2]</a> applies here: &quot;When in doubt, do as the <B>int</B>s do.&quot;  Let's look at how the C++ Standard library solves the problem of format flags for built-in types like <B>int</B>.</P>
<P>You have a great many formatting choices when you write an <B>int</B>!  Here's an incomplete list:</P>

<UL>
<LI>What base to display it in; the choices are decimal, octal, and hexadecimal.</LI>
<LI>Whether to put in a distinguishing prefix that shows what base it's displayed in.</LI>
<LI>Whether to put in a + sign when the number is positive.</LI>
<LI>The minimum field width.  If you're printing an integer with fewer digits than the width, the library will add padding.</LI>
<LI>Whether the padding goes on the left, on the right, or in between the sign and the rest of the number.</LI></UL>

<P>These options are stored in the <B>ios_base</B> class, which <B>istream</B> and <B>ostream</B> inherit from.   Of the options listed above, the width is an integer (accessed by the <B>width</B> member function), and the others are bits within a single format flag word (accessed by the <B>flags</B> and <B>setf</B> member functions).  So, for example, the following snippet will print an integer in hexadecimal, padding it to 10 characters so that the number appears on the right-hand side of the field:</P>

<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main() {
  std::cout.setf(std::ios_base::hex,
                 std::ios_base::basefield);
  std::cout.setf(std::ios::right, 
                 std::ios_base::adjustfield);
  std::cout.width(10);
  std::cout &lt;&lt; 42 &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}</pre>

<P>Or, as an abbreviation, you can use manipulators instead:</P>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
int main() {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::hex &lt;&lt; std::right &lt;&lt; std::setw(10)
  std::cout &lt;&lt; 42 &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</pre>

<P>There's nothing magic about manipulators; they're just another example of an overloaded <B>operator&lt;&lt;</B>, and, in the end, they just invoke member functions like <B>setf</B> and <B>width</B>.  Whether we use manipulators or call <B>setf</B> and <B>width</B> directly, all we're doing in this code sample is changing the state of a specific <B>ostream</B> object, <B>cout</B>.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Adding Your Own Format Flags</FONT></H3>

<P>It might seem that we have backed ourselves into a corner.  If we want our own class to behave the same way as <B>int</B>, then we should examine and set format flags in <B>ios_base</B>.  But the only reason the library can do that for <B>int</B> is that flags like <B>hex</B> and <B>right</B> were built in to <B>ios_base</B> from the beginning.  We can't add new flags to an existing class.  Or can we?</P>
<P>We can't add new member variables to <B>ios_base</B>, but we can do something that's just as good.  Every <B>ios_base</B> object contains an array of user data, accessed through the <B>iword</B> member function; <B>os.iword(n)</B> returns a reference to a <B>long</B>.  There is no upper limit on <B>n</B>: the array is automatically extended whenever you give <B>iword</B> a larger argument than it has seen before.   (The Standard guarantees that the newly created element is initialized to zero.)  So if you choose some fixed integer <B>my_index</B>, you can treat <B>os.iword(my_index)</B> as your own private format flag.  The syntax is slightly different from that of <B>setf</B>, but you'll probably want to hide such low-level details behind a manipulator anyway.</P>
<P>The only problem that's left is how to choose <B>my_index</B>; we don't want to have a clash when two different classes decide they want to store their format flags in the same place.  There's a simple solution: <B>ios_base</B> has a static member function called <B>xalloc</B>, which returns a different number each time it's called.    The intention is that you get an index from <B>xalloc</B> and then use that index whenever you access your format flag.  If everyone uses the <B>xalloc</B> protocol, there will be no clash. Or, putting these words into code:</P>

<pre>
long&amp; my_format_flag(std::ios_base&amp; s) {
  static int my_index = std::ios_base::xalloc();
  return s.iword(my_index);
}

long get_my_flag(std::ios_base&amp; s) {
  return my_format_flag(s);
}

void set_my_flag(std::ios_base&amp; s, long n) {
  my_format_flag(s) = n;
}</pre>

<P>The static variable <B>my_index</B> will be initialized the first time <b>my_format_flag</b> gets called. </P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Putting It All Together</FONT></H3>

<P>Let's look at a simple example of a class where we might want to define our own format flags: a class to store a name.  This class isn't nearly complicated enough to accommodate all of the cultural variation in personal names, but it suffices as an illustration:</P>

<pre>
struct name {
public:
  name(const std::string&amp; g, const std::string&amp; f)
    : given(g), family(f)
    { }
  std::string given;
  std::string family;
};</pre>

<P>In the US, there are two customary ways of printing a person's name; in some contexts we write a name as &quot;Leopold Bloom&quot; and  in others as &quot;Bloom, Leopold.&quot;  We'll define an output operator that accommodates both formats.  </P>
<P>First we'll add a little bit of formatting machinery to the <B>name</B> class, defining an <B>enum</B> to make the code clearer.</P>

<pre>struct name {
   ...
public:
  enum order { given_first = 0, family_first = 1 };

  static void set_order(std::ios_base&amp; s, order o)
    { flag(s) = o; }
  static order get_order(std::ios_base&amp; s)
    { return (order) flag(s); }

private:
  static long&amp; flag(std::ios_base&amp; s) {
    static int n = std::ios_base::xalloc();
    return s.iword(n);
  }
};</pre>

<P>By defining <B>given_first</B> to have the value <B>0</B>, we're choosing it as the default.</P>
<P>Second, we'll define some manipulators.  This is purely syntactic sugar, but it's nice to let users write code like</P>

<pre>
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Your name is &quot; &lt;&lt; given_first &lt;&lt; your_name;
</pre>

<P>instead of forcing them to write</P>

<pre>
name::set_order(std::cout, name::given_first);
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Your name is &quot; &lt;&lt; your_name;
</pre>

<P>Fortunately, defining manipulators is very easy:</P>

<pre>std::ostream&amp; given_first(std::ostream&amp; os) {
  name::set_order(os, name::given_first);
  return os;
}

std::ostream&amp; family_first(std::ostream&amp; os) {
  name::set_order(os, name::family_first);
  return os;
}</pre>

<P>These functions may not look like manipulators, but they are.  The C++ Standard library contains an overload for <B>operator&lt;&lt;</B> where the first argument is an <B>ostream&amp;</B> and the second is a pointer to a function that has a single argument of type <B>ostream&amp;</B> -- like one of these functions.  If you write <B>cout &lt;&lt; given_first</B>, this overload will be selected and <B>operator&lt;&lt;</B> will in turn invoke <B>given_first(cout)</B>.  (Defining a manipulator that takes an argument, as <B>setw</B> does, is a bit more complicated.)</P>
<P>Finally, we'll put all of the formatting information together in an output operator.  It isn't very complicated, but, as usual with I/O, there are a lot of different cases to consider.  We examine our new format flag, using <B>name::get_order</B>, to find which component comes first.  Then we pad the name with blanks, if necessary, to bring its length up to <B>os.width</B>.  We'll respect the user's choice of where to put the padding: on the left, on the right, or internally, between the two parts of the name.</P>

<pre>
std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const name&amp; n)
{
  // Determine order of components.
  std::string first, last, sep;
  if (name::get_order(os) == name::given_first) {
    first = n.given;
    sep = " ";
    last = n.family;
  }
  else {
    first = n.family;
    sep= ", ";
    last = n.given;
  }

  // Compute how much padding to add.
  const std::streamsize len =
    first.size() + sep.size() + last.size();
  const std::streamsize npad =
    os.width() &#151; std::min(os.width(), len);

  // Find out where to add padding.
  switch(os.flags() &amp; std::ios_base::adjustfield) {
  case std::ios::left:
    last.append(npad, ' ');
    break;
  case std::ios_base::right:
    first.insert(first.begin(), npad, ' ');
    break;
  case std::ios_base::internal:
    sep.append(npad, ' ');
    break;
  }

  // Write the name.
  os &lt;&lt; first + sep + last;
  return os;
}</pre>

<P>The only slight subtlety is that we turn the name into a single string that we write all at once, rather than writing each part separately.  This matters for two reasons.  First, it means we don't have to write our own error handling code: we can let <B>string</B>'s ordinary output operator take care of all that.   Second, it's the easiest way to make sure that the width gets handled properly.  We want to make sure that the name as a whole gets padded, not just the first field.</P>
<P>Letting the user choose between <B>given_first</B> and <B>family_first</B> makes the code more complicated, but not much more.  Using <B>xalloc</B> and <B>iword</B>, it's easy to add this kind of flexibility.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">An Advanced Feature: pword</FONT></H3>

<P>You might occasionally find that you want even more flexibility than this.  You can use <B>iword</B> to store an integer, a character, or a few boolean flags, but what if, for some reason, you need to store more information than that?  What if, instead of a boolean flag, you need to store a string?  You certainly can't fit a variable-length string into a <B>long</B>!</P>
<P>What you can do instead is store a pointer to a string: <B>ios_base</B> has another member function, <B>pword</B>, that's just like <B>iword</B> except that it refers to an array of <B>void*</B> instead of an array of <B>long</B>.  You can store a string by writing</P>

<pre>
os.pword(my_index) = new std::string(my_string);
</pre>

<P>and you can retrieve it by writing</P>

<pre>
std::string* p = (std::string*) os.pword(my_index);
</pre>

<P>As usual, you get <B>my_index</B> from <B>xalloc</B>.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, this raises as many questions as it answers.  We're using dynamic memory allocation; it's the only reasonable option.  (We can't very well store a pointer to a local variable -- that would be an invitation to dangling pointer bugs.)  But if you're allocating memory, you also have to delete it.  The I/O library won't do it for you; it can't.  As far as the I/O library is concerned, you're just storing some random <B>void*</B>.  It doesn't know that you're going to interpret that <B>void*</B> as a pointer to a <B>string</B>.  </P>
<P>You have to delete the string when you store another string into the same slot, when the <B>ios_base</B> object itself gets destroyed, or when you're copying the format flags from another <B>ios_base</B>.  Similarly, to prevent having the string get deleted twice, you need to make sure, when copying format flags to another <B>ios_base</B>, that you end up with two strings instead of two pointers to the same string.</P>
<P>Deleting an old string when you store a new one into the same slot is easy; you can write a single function to perform both operations so that you don't forget.  The other cases are more complicated, since you're responding to an external event: you need to use a callback function.  The standard library does provide hooks for such callback functions, since <B>pword</B> would be useless without them.  <a href="list1.htm">Listing 1</a> shows how to use <B>pword</B> to store a string in an <B>ios_base</B> object.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Advice</FONT></H3>

<P>I described <B>pword</B> for completeness.  You shouldn't use it: it's one of the very most obscure and complicated corners of the C++ I/O library.  It's hard to understand code that uses such features and easy to get it wrong, and with a little bit of thought, you can almost certainly come up with an alternative design that sidesteps the whole mess.  None of the built-in I/O operators in the C++ Standard library use <B>pword</B> or anything like it. I haven't shown an example where <B>pword</B> is necessary, because most of the examples that I've seen seem a bit artificial.</P>
<P>There's no reason, however, for you to be afraid of using <B>iword</B>.  There's nothing complicated about it.  With a few lines of boilerplate code, you can add your own customized format flags to <B>ios_base</B>, and you can use those format flags in just the same way as the standard library uses its built-in flags.  Just as the standard library gives users many choices about how to display <B>int</B>s, you should give such choices to the users of your classes.  </P>
<P>The C++ Standard library makes it possible to treat built-in types and user-defined types on an equal footing, and user-defined format flags are one of the essential features that allows this.  </P>
