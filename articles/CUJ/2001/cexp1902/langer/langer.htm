<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">The Difference between for_each and transform</FONT></H3>

<P>The algorithms <B>for_each</B> and <B>transform</B> are often understood as very similar in that they apply an operation (supplied as a function object) to each element in an input range. The difference is that <B>for_each</B> discards the operation's return value, while <B>transform</B> copies the return value to an element in the output range.  This kind of understanding is a fairly common oversimplification.  According to the Standard, however, the difference between both algorithms is more fundamental. Our goal in this installment of our column is to explain the conceptual difference between the algorithms and to point out the potential portability trap that the na&iuml;ve understanding of the algorithms opens.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Reading the Standard</FONT></H3>

<P>Before we enter the actual discussion, let us first see what the Standard says <a href="#1">[1]</a>.</P>
<P><B>FOR_EACH</B>.  The <B>for_each</B> algorithm is specified in the Standard in the section of non-modifying sequence operations.</P>

<pre>template&lt;class InputIterator, class Function&gt;
Function for_each(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, Function f);</pre>

<UL>
<LI><P>Effects: Applies <B>f</B> to the result of dereferencing every iterator in the range <B>[first, last)</B>, starting from <B>first</B> and proceeding to <B>last - 1</B>.</LI> 
<LI>Returns: <B>f</B></LI>
<LI>Complexity: Applies <B>f</B> exactly <B>last - first</B> times. </LI>
<LI>Notes:If <B>f</B> returns a result, the result is ignored.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>TRANSFORM</B>. The <B>transform</B> algorithm is specified in the Standard in the section of mutating sequence operations. It comes in two flavors, one version (unary transform) works on one input sequence, the other version (binary transform) takes two input sequences.  Since we want to compare <B>for_each</B> and <B>transform</B>, we only consider the unary <b>transform</b>.</P>

<pre>
template&lt;class InputIterator, class OutputIterator, class UnaryOperation&gt;
OutputIterator transform(InputIterator first, InputIterator last,
                         OutputIterator result, UnaryOperation op);
</pre>

<UL>
<LI>Effects: Assigns through every iterator <B>i</B> in the range <B>[result, result + (last - first))</B> a new corresponding value equal to <B>op(*(first + (i - result))</B>.</LI>
<LI>Requires: <B>op</B> shall not have any side effects <a href="#2">[2]</a>.</LI>
<LI>Returns: <B>result + (last - first)</B> </LI>
<LI>Complexity: Exactly <B>last - first</B> applications of <B>op</B>.</LI>
<LI>Notes: <B>result</B> may be equal to <B>first</B>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Indeed, the unary <B>transform</B> algorithm and the <B>for_each</B> algorithm both apply a unary operation to every element in a range of input iterators exactly once. Other than that they have little in common. The differences include:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>for_each</B> is a non-modifying algorithm; <B>transform</B> is a mutating algorithm.</LI>
<LI><B>for_each</B> ignores the operation's return value; <B>transform</B> assigns the return  value to successive elements in the output range.</LI>
<LI><B>for_each</B> returns a copy of the function object; <B>transform</B> returns an iterator to the end of the output range.</LI>
<LI><B>for_each</B> applies the operation in a definite order, namely starting at the beginning and proceeding to the end of the input range; no such guarantee is given for <B>transform</B>.</LI>
<LI>The operation supplied to <B>transform</B> must not have any side effects; no such restriction is imposed on the operation supplied to <B>for_each</B>.</LI></UL>

<P>Let us see what these differences mean and why they exist. </P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">The Intent</FONT></H3>

<P>When we use an algorithm, we expect that the application of the algorithm has an effect; otherwise the invocation would be pointless.  Typical effects include production of a return value and modification of sequence elements.  </P>
<P><B>RETURN VALUES</B>. Typical return values produced by algorithms are a Boolean value (see <B>includes</B>), a count (see <B>count_if</B>), an iterator pointing to a particular element in the input sequence (see <B>find_if</B>), an iterator pointing to the end of a produced output sequence (see <B>copy</B>), or a pair of iterators denoting an iterator range (see <B>equal_range</B>). Most algorithms produce a return value, only a few do not (i.e., <B>fill</B>, <B>replace</B>, <B>sort</B>, and <B>swap</B>).</P>
<P>Regarding modification of sequence elements, the Standard distinguishes between mutating (or modifying) and inspecting (or non-modifying) algorithms. </P>
<P><B>MUTATORS. </B>Algorithms such as <B>remove</B>, <B>replace</B>, <B>copy</B>, or <B>sort</B> actively produce side effects, namely modification of elements in a sequence. Typically they do so by assigning values through dereferenced iterators. <B>copy</B>, for instance, assigns elements from the input range to elements in the output range. If the modified sequence is the input sequence, then the Standard talks of an <I>in-place algorithm</I>; if the modification affects the output range, then it talks of a <I>copy algorithm</I>.  For instance, <B>replace_if</B> is an in-place algorithm, while <B>replace_copy_if</B> is a copy algorithm.</P>
<P><b>INSPECTORS.</b> The non-modifying algorithms, in contrast, do not assign to any sequence elements. Examples of non-modifying algorithms are <b>find_if</b>, <b>count_if</b>, and <b>search</b>. The actual purpose of an inspecting algorithm is not modification of any sequence element, but production of a return value.</P>
<P>In this sense, <b>transform</b> is a modifying copy algorithm since it modifies sequence elements by assigning the result of the function object to an element in the output range, whereas <b>for_each</b> is a non-modifying algorithm because it does not assign to any sequence elements.</p>
<p>As stated before, the sole purpose of a non-modifying algorithm is production of a return value. <b>for_each</b> is a non-modifying algorithm, and it returns the function object  that was supplied to it. One might wonder: what is the point in applying <b>for_each</b> to a sequence of elements if it does not modify any elements and returns what it received? Does <b>for_each</b> have an effect at all? Indeed, <b>for_each</b> does not actively produce any side effect at all. The actual purpose of invoking <b>for_each</b> lies in the effects that the function object that is supplied to <b>for_each</b> produces when it is invoked for each element in the input sequence. More precisely: the function object may produce an effect by modifying the input sequence, and it can produce a useful result by mutating itself in the course of its invocations. </P>
<P>For this reason, the operation supplied to <b>for_each</b> is not restricted regarding side effects; invocation of <b>for_each</b> with a side-effect-free function object is utterly pointless. This is radically different for the operation supplied to <b>transform</b>, which according to the Standard must not have any side effects at all. And here we see the fundamental difference between <b>for_each</b> and <b>transform</b>. <b>for_each</b> depends on the side effect produced by the function object, while <b>transform</b> produces effects by itself and prohibits any side effects that the function object might produce.</P>
<P>In this sense, <B>transform</B> is a modifying copy algorithm since it modifies sequence elements by assigning the result of the function object to an element in the output range, and <B>for_each</B> is a non-modifying algorithm because it does not assign to any sequence elements.  </P>
<P>The sole purpose of a non-modifying algorithm is production of a return value. <B>for_each</B> returns the function object that was supplied to it. Strictly speaking, <B>for_each</B> does not actively produce any side effect at all. The point of invoking <B>for_each</B> is the effects produced by the function object supplied to <B>for_each</B>. The function object may produce an effect by modify the input sequence, and it can produce a result by mutating itself in the course of its invocations.</P>
<P>For this reason, the operation supplied to <B>for_each</B> is not restricted regarding side effects; this is different from the operation supplied to <B>transform</B>, which according to the Standard must not have any side effects at all. This is the a fundamental difference between <B>for_each</B> and <B>transform</B>. <B>for_each</B> depends on the side effect produced by the function object, while <B>transform</B> produces effects by itself and prohibits any side effects that the function object might produce.</P>
<P>This difference explains why <B>for_each</B> gives a guarantee regarding order and number of invocations of the function object. When an operation produces side effects, we need to know how often and in which order the operation is invoked, because it might be sensitive to the number or order of invocations. <B>transform</B>, on the other hand, forbids any side effects of its function object and only guarantees the number of invocations as a sort of a complexity guarantee, but does not say anything about the order of invocation.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">The Consequences</FONT></H3>

<P>Let us consider the consequences of the specification of <B>for_each</B> and <B>transform</B> given by the Standard. It turns out that the simple notion of &quot;very similar algorithms that only differ in the use of the return value of the function object they invoke&quot; is misleading in many cases.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Side Effects</FONT></H3>

<P>A function object with side effects can be supplied to <B>for_each</B>, but it cannot be supplied to <B>transform</B>. The intent of the Standard is that <B>for_each</B> is pointless without a side-effect producing function object, while <B>transform</B> does not need any side effects from the function object other than its return value.  According to the Standard, the function object supplied to <B>for_each</B> can have any side effect, and the function object supplied to <B>transform</B> must  not have any. Both lead to surprises in practice.</P>
<P>Side effects of a function object can be as harmless as writing output to a stream for debugging purposes or modifying its own data members, none of which would interfere with the side effects that the algorithm produces itself. Still, such a function object must not be supplied to <B>transform</B> because it violates the standard requirements. </P>
<P>On the other hand, it is common sense that a function object is not free to have any kind of side effect whatsoever. The side effects produced by a function object must not interfere with the activities performed by the algorithm. For instance, invalidating the iterators or the sequences that the algorithm works with is disastrous in any case. Even the function object supplied to <B>for_each</B> must obey this common-sense rule, even if the Standard does not say so. </P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Order of Invocation</FONT></H3>

<P>A function object that is sensitive to the order of invocation can be supplied to <B>for_each</B>, but it is not reasonable to supply it to <B>transform</B>. The Standard does not say anything about the order in which the <B>transform</B> algorithm invokes the function object. For this reason, the result of supplying an order-sensitive operation to <B>transform</B> is unpredictable, while the result is well-defined when supplied to <B>for_each</B>. </P>
<P>Why would this matter in practice? Well, let's study an example.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">A Concrete Example</FONT></H3>

<P>Say we have the following situation: we have a directory, which contains names and associated information, implemented using a <b>map</b> container. In addition, we have a file that contains a list of names. All entries for the names contained in this file must be removed from the directory. How do we solve such a problem? </P>
<P>The first idea might be to use the algorithms <b>remove_if</b> and <b>remove_copy_if</b>: remove an entry from the <b>map</b> if its name is contained in the file (and copy the entry to another <b>map</b>). This of course does not work because <b>remove_if</b> and <b>remove_copy_if</b> are mutating algorithms, which try to assign values to elements in the input sequence through dereferenced iterators. The <b>map</b> container, however, does not allow assignment to its contained elements; its elements are pairs of a <b>const</b> key and an associated value, and the <b>const</b> key cannot be changed.  For this reason, an attempted application of <b>remove_if</b> or <b>remove_copy_if</b> to the <b>map</b> container would not compile. 
<P>Instead of using <b>remove_if</b> and <b>remove_copy_if</b>, elements in a <b>map</b> are better removed via the <b>map</b>'s <b>erase</b> member function.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Using for_each</FONT></H3>

<P>Let us take another approach using <B>for_each</B>: for each name in the file, apply a function that erases the respective entry from the map. The function object could look like this:</P>

<pre>
template &lt;class MapT&gt;
class eraseFct {
public:
  eraseFct(MapT* m) : theMap(m) {}
  void operator() (string nam)
  { typename MapT::iterator iter = theMap-&gt;find(nam);
    if (iter == theMap-&gt;end()) 
        throw invalid_argument(nam);
    theMap-&gt;erase(iter);
  }
private:
  MapT* theMap;
};

template &lt;class MapT&gt;
eraseFct&lt;MapT&gt; eraser(MapT* m) 
{ return eraseFct&lt;MapT&gt;(m); }
</pre>

<P>The function object would be used like this:</P>

<pre>
map&lt;string,info&gt; directory_1;
// ... populate directory_1 ...
ifstream infile("toBeErased.txt");
for_each(istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(infile),istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(),
         eraser(&directory_1));
</pre>

<P>The use of the function object with <B>for_each</B> is fine and has the desired effect. The function object's side effect is modification of the map that the function object's data member <B>theMap</B> points to. Note that the side effect is not order-sensitive, so a guarantee regarding the order of invocation of the function object is not needed. In addition, the side effects do not interfere with the activities of the algorithms because the function object does not attempt modification of the input or the output iterators or sequences.  </P>
<P>So far, so good.  Now, imagine the situation changes slightly:  instead of removing entries from the directory, we must now split the directory; that is, we must move the entries corresponding to the names in the file from the existing directory into a separate directory.  How do we solve the new problem? </P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Using transform</FONT></H3>

<P>An intuitive first idea is to use the <B>transform</B> algorithm with a function very similar to the one that we had used with <B>for_each</B>: for each name in the file apply a function that erases the respective entry from the map and returns the entry that can then be stored in another map. </P>
<P>We slightly modify the original function object so that we can use it with <B>transform</B>. The main difference compared to the original function object is that the modified function object returns the value of the removed sequence element so that <B>transform</B> can store the value in the output sequence. All necessary modifications are marked in the implementation shown below:</P>

<pre>
template &lt;class MapT&gt;
class eraseFct {
public:
  eraseFct(MapT* m) : theMap(m) {}
  <strong>typename MapT::value_type</strong> operator() (string nam)
  { typename MapT::iterator iter = theMap-&gt;find(nam);
    if (iter == theMap-&gt;end()) 
        throw invalid_argument(nam);
    <strong>typename MapT::value_type res = *iter;</strong>
    theMap-&gt;erase(iter);
    <strong>return res;</strong>
  }
private:
  MapT* theMap;
};

template &lt;class MapT&gt;
eraseFct&lt;MapT&gt; eraser(MapT* m) 
{ return eraseFct&lt;MapT&gt;(m); }
</pre>

<P>The function object would be used like this in conjunction with <B>transform</B> for splitting the directory:</P>


<pre>
map&lt;string,info&gt; directory_2;
transform(istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(infile),istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(), 
          inserter(directory_2,directory_2.end()),
          eraser(&amp;directory_1));
</pre>

<P>We could also use it in lieu of the original function object with <B>for_each</B> to solve the initial problem, namely removing the entries:</P>

<pre>
map&lt;string,info&gt; directory_1;
// ... populate directory_1 ...
ifstream infile("toBeErased.txt");
for_each(istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(infile),istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(),
         eraser(&directory_1));
</pre>

<P>The use of the modified function object with <B>for_each</B> is fine and solves our initial problem as nicely as the original function object did. <B>for_each</B> simply ignores the function object's return value, and the effect is the same as before with the original function object.</P>
<P>The situation is surprisingly different with <B>transform</B>. The effect of supplying the modified function object to <B>transform</B> is neither predictable nor portable, because the Standard only allows side-effect-free function objects in conjunction with <B>transform</B>, and our function object <I>has</I> a side effect, namely removal of an element from the map that its data member points to.</P>
<P>Here we see the fundamental difference between <B>for_each</B> and <B>transform</B>. It's misleading to describe the two algorithms as very similar with the sole difference being that <B>for_each</B> ignores the return value of the function object while <B>transform </B>does not.  Instead, the two algorithms work with entirely different categories of function objects: one is side-effect-producing; the other is side-effect-free.</P>

<H3>Theory vs. Practice</H3>

<P>The Standard prohibits use of a side-effect-producing function object in conjunction with the <b>transform</b> algorithm.  The reason for this is that the Standard wants to give library implementations  the latitude for potential optimizations.  The requirement that a transformator must not have any side effect whatsoever is a very strong requirement.  There is not a lot that a transformator is allowed to do.  It cannot modify its own data members; it cannot modify temporaries; it cannot invoke any function that has side effects (for instance writing to a stream); it cannot even retrieve the value of a volatile variable. All it can do is inspect its function argument and other constant, non-volatile fields, calling side-effect-free functions and producing a return value.  Under these restrictions a library implementation can safely apply optimizations. </P>
<P>One conceivable optimization would be execution of the transformation in parallel threads. A function object that is side-effect free is in particular thread-safe; since it cannot cause any change in the so-called execution environment, there cannot be any potential conflict if the function object is invoked from several threads in parallel. Such an optimized implementation of the <b>transform</b> algorithm would clearly break the code in our example. </P>
<P>The transformator in our example might erase an  element from a map, which is not an atomic operation.  One thread might be in the process of erasing an element while the other checks for the end of the map, which an instant later will be invalidated by the first thread, and as a result the second thread will crash.  This is the prototypical race condition, and it stems from the fact that our transformator violates the requirement that it must not have side effects. </P>
<P>In practice, you will find that supplying a function object with side effects to the <b>transform</b> algorithm works just fine and yields predictable and reliable results with most implementations of the standard library. In fact, no library implementation that we know of takes advantage of the latitude that the Standard gives them for optimizing the algorithm. Still, keep in mind: strictly speaking it is not portable to use side-effect-producing transformators. </P>
<P>So, what can we do in a portable program instead of using <b>transform</b>? Off-hand we see two potential solutions: implement a relaxed version of <b>transform</b> and use that instead of the standard <b>transform</b> algorithm, or use <b>for_each</b> instead of <b>transform</b>. </P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Implement Your Own Version of transform</FONT></H3>

<P>We can implement our own version of the <B>transform</B> algorithm that invokes the function object starting at the beginning and proceeding to the end and allows function objects with arbitrary side effects, except side effects that invalidate the input or output iterators or sequences. Here is a conceivable implementation:</P>

<pre>
template &lt;class InputIterator, class OutputIterator, class Transformator&gt;
OutputIterator relaxed_transform(InputIterator first, InputIterator last,
                         OutputIterator result, Transformator trans) {
  for ( ; first != last; ++first, ++result)
    *result = trans(*first);
  return result;
}
</pre>

<P>This is the implementation that you find in most implementations of the standard library anyway, but it is safer to use your own version, since it's a portable solution. The algorithm above can be specified as: </P>

<pre>
template&lt;class InputIterator, class OutputIterator, class Transformator &gt;
OutputIterator relaxed_transform(InputIterator first, InputIterator last,
                                 OutputIterator result, Transformator trans);
</pre>

<UL>
<LI>Effects: Applies <B>trans</B> to the result of dereferencing every iterator in the range <B>[first, last)</B> starting from <B>first</B> and proceeding to <B>last - 1</B> and assigns through every iterator <B>i</B> in the range <B>[result, result + (last - first))</B> the return value of <B>trans(*(first + (i - result))</B>.</LI>
<LI>Requires: <B>trans</B> shall not have any side effects that invalidate any iterator in the range <B>[first, last) </B>and <B>[result, result + (last - first))</B>.</LI>
<LI>Returns: <B>result + (last - first)</B> </LI>
<LI>Complexity: Exactly <B>last - first</B> applications of <B>trans</B> and exactly <B>last - fir</B>st assignments. </LI>
<LI>Notes: <B>result</B> may be equal to <B>first</B>. </LI>
</UL>

<P>In the case that <B>result</B> equals <B>first</B>, that is, input and output sequence are the same, the <B>transform</B> algorithm is used as an in-place transformation. In this case, the user must keep in mind that any modification of the input element performed via the function object will be overwritten by the subsequent assignment to the same element. This introduces a minor pitfall, but a user who supplies a function object that modifies the input elements will probably not use this function object in an in-place transformation anyway.</P>
<P>The purpose and benefit of the user-defined <B>relaxed_transform</B> algorithm is that it eases implementation of portable applications. The downside is that potential performance optimizations that a library implementation might provide for the standard <B>transform</B> algorithm taking advantage of the requirements imposed on the function object of <B>transform</B> are not available in this relaxed, user-defined version of the algorithm.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Use for_each in Case of Doubt</FONT></H3>

<P>Another alternative is to use the <B>for_each</B> algorithm whenever a side effect must be produced. We could re-implement the function object so that it produces all desired side effects including the one that <B>transform</B> had produced; that is, it removes entries from one directory and inserts them into another directory. Here is a conceivable re-write of the function object:</P>

<pre>
template &lt;class MapT&gt;
class moveFct {
public:
  moveFct (MapT* m1, MapT* m2) : theMap1(m1), theMap2(m2) {}
  void operator() (string nam)
  { typename MapT::iterator iter = theMap1-&gt;find(nam);
    if (iter == theMap1-&gt;end()) 
        throw invalid_argument(nam);
    theMap2-&gt;insert(*iter);
    theMap1-&gt;erase(iter);
  }
private:
  MapT* theMap1;
  MapT* theMap2;
};

template &lt;class MapT&gt;
moveFct&lt;MapT&gt; mover(MapT* m1,MapT* m2) 
{ return moveFct&lt;MapT&gt;(m1,m2); }
</pre>

<P>The function object would be used like this:</P>

<pre>
map&lt;string,info&gt; directory_1;
// ... populate directory_1 ...
ifstream infile("toBeErased.txt");
for_each(istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(infile),istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(),
         eraser(&directory_1));
</pre>

<P>This solution culminates in the recommendation that we should in general use <B>for_each</B> instead of <B>transform</B> for all transformations that are order-sensitive or have side effects.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Summary</FONT></H3>

<P>It is a common misconception that the only difference between the algorithms <B>for_each</B> and <B>transform</B> is the fact that <B>for_each</B> discards the operation's return value, while <B>transform</B> copies the return value to an element in the output range.  A more fundamental difference between the two algorithms is that <B>transform</B> is restricted to side-effect-free function objects, while <B>for_each</B> is more relaxed regarding the requirements it imposes on its function object.</P>
<P>In fact, <B>for_each</B> is an exception among the algorithms in the standard library: it is the only algorithm that gives exact guarantees regarding order and number of invocations of the function object <I>and</I> permits side effects including modification of elements from the input sequence. In detail: </P>

<UL>
<LI><B>for_each</B> is the one of the few algorithms in the standard library that gives a guarantee regarding the order in which it invokes the function object <a href="#3">[3]</a>. This allows application of order-sensitive functionality through a function object. Supplying order-sensitive function objects to any other algorithm is downright nonsensical since the result is unpredictable.</LI>
<LI><B>for_each</B> is the only algorithm that returns the function object. This allows application of function objects that accumulate in their data members' information, which can be retrieved after execution of the algorithm. Supplying such a function object to any other algorithm requires instantiation of those algorithms for a reference to the function object, which is kind of inconvenient since it involves explicit function argument specification, plus you will by struggling with library deficiencies <a href="#4">[4]</a>.</LI>
<LI><B>for_each</B> is one of the few algorithms that does not restrict the function object regarding side effects <a href="#5">[5]</a>.This gives users an enormous amount of flexibility regarding the implementation of function objects. All other algorithms impose requirements of varying degrees of severity on the function objects they use.</LI>
</UL>

<P>In the next installment of this column, we will discuss unary predicates, which are another category of function objects used in the standard library. We will see which side effects these function objects must or must not have.</P>
