<p>In this new, web-only component of <I>CUJ</I>, we continue publication of the columns that were popular in the former <I>C++ Report</I> magazine. The following articles are featured on the <I>CUJ</I> website this month:</p>

<H4><A HREF="../cexp1911/reeves/reeves.htm">&#147;The (B)Leading Edge: Using the XDR_Stream Class, Part II&#148;</A></H4>
<p><b>by Jack W. Reeves</b><br>
<i>This month, Jack continues to expand his <B>XDR_Stream</B> library. First, he looks at some porting problems and the changes they require. Then he turns his attention to expanding the <B>XDR_Stream</B> interface to provide support for the easy encoding/decoding of objects accessed via pointers where there may be multiple references to the same object. Finally, he looks at what it takes to encode/decode polymorphic objects.</i></p>

<H4><A HREF="../cexp1911/henney/henney.htm">&#147;From Mechanism to Method: Generic Decoupling&#148;</A></H4>
<p><b>by Kevlin Henney</b><br>
<i>Is it possible to be too well connected? Is it possible to be too eager to please? If we are talking about code, the answer is &#147;yes.&#148; Low coupling and high cohesion are useful and practical properties of code, not just abstract academic concepts. In practice code that is clear in its purpose and low in its dependencies is generally easier to work with than code that attempts to include everything and please everyone. This month&#146;s column explores four core approaches to decoupling a C++ system, with a particular focus on the perhaps surprising role that templates can play.</i></p>

<H4><A HREF="../cexp1911/hyslop/hyslop.htm">&#147;Conversations: Hungarian wartHogs&#148;</A></H4>

<p><b>by Jim Hyslop and Herb Sutter</b><br>
<I>&#147;What&#146;s in a name? Plenty, if you use Hungarian notation. Too much, if you use Hungarian notation.&#148;</I></p>
