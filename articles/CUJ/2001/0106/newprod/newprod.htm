<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Gepsoft.com Announces GEP Symbolic Regression</FONT></H3>

<p>Gepsoft.com has released GEP Symbolic Regression (GEP-SR), an AI component based on gene expression programming (GEP). GEP is a new learning algorithm that outperforms Genetic Programming in 2-4 orders of magnitude. GEP-SR is a COM component developed with the ATL framework. No prior knowledge of evolutionary computation is assumed and the complexity is hidden behind a programmer friendly interface. The sample code and application by themselves are enough to start using GEP-SR without any coding. The documentation includes a detailed description of the source code and the techniques used.</p>
<p>GEP-SR can be purchased at the Component Source, &lt;http://www.componentsource.com/&gt;. The standard edition personal license costs $669 and the standard edition commercial license costs $4,899. The advanced edition personal license costs $1,219 and the advanced edition commercial license costs $7,359.</p>
