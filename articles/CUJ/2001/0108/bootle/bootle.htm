<p>While there exists code that should never have been written, certainly YOU didn&#146;t write it. So why are you reading this column rather than coding?</p>

<p>There&#146;s been no end of angst-ridden polemic on why would-be writers suddenly fail to write. They face blank screens and pages seeking the ideal string sequences. Often there&#146;s an insistent editor saying &#147;Forget le mot juste, we want le mot Tuesday.&#148; Such deadlines are counterproductive. Would you believe that many university &#147;creative writing&#148; degrees devote the odd seminar to avoiding the &#147;writer block&#148;?</p>
<p>Elitists such as Gore Vidal and John Updike, highly paid for conducting such courses, simply say &#147;True writers are by definition never blocked. You have chosen the wrong profession.&#148;</p>
<p>Indeed, Vidal once challenged his audience: &#147;Why are you here rather than writing <I>the</I> American Novel?&#148;</p>
<p>Modest computer-columnists face a different challenge. No block for us. A daily input of inter-nettoyage can fill our word count. We can list several URLs, some longer than the implied content!</p>
<p>As a last resort, we can do a book review or report on a recent conference.</p>
<p>Let me say that James A. Highsmith&#146;s <I>Adaptive Software Development</I> (Dorset House, ISBN 0-932633-404-4) is one of few SD books that has kept me awake.</p>
<p>On the more personal front: Bobby Schmidt oft boasts of his baseball afflictions. I flew to Cardiff, Wales, to see the Liverpool 2, Arsenal 1 FA Soccer Cup Final. I was wearing my <I>CUJ</I> shirt. Up comes Anthony Moss among the 74K fans. Small world. He&#146;s moving from C to C++ with Brit Aerospace.</p>
<p>The sports trivia (sez who?) expands into programming non-trivia. Anthony is amazed that I <I>know</I> Bjarne Stroustrup. Of course, this is all part of the show-biz name-dropping syndrome.</p>
<p>I tell Anthony that he must buy the Koenig/Moo <I>Accelerated C++</I> (Addison-Wesley).</p>

<p><i><B>Stan Kelly-Bootle</B> has been computing on and off since 1953 when he graduated from Cambridge University in Pure Mathematics and hacked on EDSAC I (the first true stored-program computer). He is a contributing editor for <I>Linux Journal</I> and a Jolt Judge for <I>Software Development</I> Magazine. With the demise of <I>UNIX Review/Performance Computing,</I> his 16-year-old Devil&#146;s Advocate column has moved online to &lt;www.sarcheck.com&gt;. His many books include <I>680x0 Programming by Example, Mastering Turbo C, Lern Yerself Scouse, The Devil&#146;s DP Dictionary, The Computer Contradictory,</I> and <I>Unix Complete.</I> Under his nom-de-folk, Stan Kelly, his songs have been recorded by Cilla Black, Judy Collins, the Dubliners, and himself. Stan welcomes email via <B>skb@atmail.net</B> and his website &lt;http://www.feniks.com/skb/&gt;. Stan&#146;s ramblings can also be found at &lt;www.unixreview.com&gt;.</i></p>
