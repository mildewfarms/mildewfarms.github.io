<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Codemesh Releases Codemesh JunC++ion 1.2</FONT></H3>

<p>Codemesh has released JunC++ion 1.2, which allows programmers to use Java classes in C++ programs as if they were other C++ classes and to use C++ in Java through native method implementations. JunC++ion 1.2 completes all the other work to make C++ interoperable with Java. JunC++ion 1.2 does the low-level interface work and provides integration code.</p>
<p>Version 1.2 includes a new command-line utility for configuring the run-time environment. New methods and a utility class have been added to the C++ string proxy class to make working with characters easier. Several software defects in the Code Generator were corrected, which have improved usability and reliability of generated code. Defects were also corrected in the JunC++ion runtime library, which remains 100 percent compatible with JunC++ion-enabled applications created with JunC++ion 1.1.</p>
<p>JunC++ion 1.2 is available for a 30-day evaluation from the company&#146;s website.</p>
