<p>In last November&#146;s issue of <I>CUJ</I>, we celebrated the magazine&#146;s twentieth anniversary by inviting past notables to reminisce with us. Perhaps we didn&#146;t direct enough fanfare to the compiler that gave birth to our publication, or to its humble author...</p>

<UL><p><B>	The Compiler</B>: BDS C<br>
<B>	The Author</B>: Leor Zolman<br>
<B>	The Community</B>: The BDS C Users Group, later known as the C Users Group</p></UL>

<p>For those whose yearnings tend root-ward, you may find of interest that Leor has released the code for the BDS (Brain Damage Software) C compiler and its 8080 linker into the public domain. (Does anyone use CP/M anymore?) I learned C in the 1980s on a two-floppy (sans hard drive) Sanyo MBC-550, with the luxury of 128 KB of RAM. Leor&#146;s compiler ran in 32 KB on a single floppy system! Visit &lt;www.bdsoft.com/resources.html#bdsc&gt; for more details.</p>
<p>Speaking of roots, pointers have long been known as a source of both power and grief to the C/C++ developer. Well, the Phantom Poet has struck again, musing about what havoc errant pointers wreak on precious memory. I dare you to read his latest offering without hearing music in your head!</p>

<p><b>Memory</b><br>
<b>According To T(ype) S(afe) Eliot (with apologies to T.S. Eliot)</b></p>
<p>Midnight, not a sound from the servers,<br>
Has the <B>\\moon</B> lost her memory? Disks are spinning alone.<br>
In the lamplight the whisp&#146;ring air vents murmur at me,<br>
And I wince, begin to moan.</p>

<p>Memory, leaks all over the <B>\\moon</B> site,<br>
I can smile at the old days, Fortran worked better then.<br>
I remember a time I knew what happiness was;<br>
Let my memory live again!</p>

<UL>
<p>All my C apps seem to beat<br>
A fatalistic warning<br>
A core dump stutters, the server gutters<br>
And pointers fry this morning</p>
</UL>

<p>Daylight, I must wait for the Sun rise &#151;<br>
I could C++ <B>new</B> code, but I just couldn&#146;t use <B>cin</B>.<br>
When the VM comes it just asks me for more memory too...<br>
I guess new hardware will come in.</p>

<UL><p>Burnt out ends of smoky cigs,<br>
The stale, cold smell of coffee;<br>
The debugger dies, another night is over,<br>
Can&#146;t get this C thing off me...</p></UL>

<p>Touch me, it&#146;s so easy to leave me<br>
All alone with the memory of my days in the Sun<br>
If you touch me you&#146;ll understand what happiness is<br>
Look! my code&#146;s begun to run.<p>
