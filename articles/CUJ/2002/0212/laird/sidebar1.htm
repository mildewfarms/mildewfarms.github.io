<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The body of the article suggests writing two different scripts for wrapping ping under Unix and Windows, respectively. This is a mild hack to help make the explanation clear to those new to Tcl. In practice, I&#146;d always consolidate such code into such a unified script as:</p>

<pre>
  ...
switch $::tcl_platform(platform) {
    unix {
       set repeat_flag -c
    }
    windows {
       set repeat_flag -n
    }
}
set fp [open "|ping $repeat_flag 5 tcl-tk.net"]
  ...
</pre>

<p>In fact, one of Tcl&#146;s great virtues is its remarkable portability. This is import for C programmers in at least a couple of different ways. First, it&#146;s common to use Tcl to &#147;mollify&#148; command-line programs with difficult interfaces. In this case, <B>ping</B> is generally available under both Windows and Unix, but with different options and displays. Tcl makes it easy to wrap up such variants so that end users need learn only a single interface, and probably a point-and-click one.</p>
<p>Also, Tcl makes a fine portable general-purpose application library. With Tcl&#146;s powerful networking code, for instance, it takes only a dozen lines to write a capable TCP/IP server that works identically across MacOS, Unix, Windows, OpenVMS, and other operating systems. If you need project-specific low-level C code, combined with a general-purpose network service, Tcl provides a convenient solution.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other examples of such cooperation between Tcl and other languages, on a variety of different operating systems. Poorly-standardized C libraries often require us to stumble around with obscurely-defined #<B>ifdef</B>s. For Tcl, though, the standard documentation explicitly assures programmers they can use <B>tcl_platform</B> at run time to compensate for any operating system differences.</p>
