<p><B>Item 1: </B>It was a joke. The volume of mail I received in response to my April 2002 forum (about Quirksort) bears witness of two important things: 1) people care about algorithms, and 2) people read my forums! I had just finished reading two books about Fermat&#146;s Last Theorem (<I>The Parrot&#146;s Theorem</I>, by Denis Guedj, and <I>Fermat&#146;s Enigma</I>, by Simon Singh) when the deadline for April&#146;s forum drew near, so what better way for a little April Fool&#146;s Fun than to state something controversial and cite lack of space for my lack of explanation? For the record, it is a well-known mathematical that sorting algorithms based on simple comparisons alone cannot be faster than <B>O(n logn)</B>. Radix Sort, a common algorithm that breaks that barrier, makes assumptions about the data &#151; it doesn&#146;t use just simple comparisons. Was it fun for you?</p>
<p><B>Item 2: </B>Okay, I give up. I might as well expect the Nile to stop flowing by my holding up a sign that reads, &#147;Please Stop,&#148; than to expect people to use the term &#147;function object&#148; instead of &#147;functor.&#148; Scott Meyers uses it in his STL book, and Thomas Becker uses it (with a polite disclaimer) in his article in this issue. You win. I acquiesce. I&#146;ll stop complaining. But I won&#146;t use the term myself :-).</p>
<p><B>Item 3: </B>&#147;Hello&#148;: Hurray! We have a new Editor-in-Chief and we couldn&#146;t be happier. Welcome to Joe Casad, who has long been associated with our sister publications. We have already noticed a great change for the better behind the scenes, and the effect of his contribution is fast becoming visible on the printed page. Boy, are we happy!</p>
<p><B>Item 4: </B>&#147;Goodbye&#148;: Boy, are we sad. It&#146;s one of those things, but we must bid farewell to Stan Kelly-Bootle, guru, commentator, and wordsmith extraordinaire. I have been enjoying his perorations for oh-so-many-years and have always emerged from the experience at once enlightened and entertained. I leave the rest of this page for his personal note. Adieu.</p>

<p>Alas, dear, dear fans, my April 2002 &#147;Postmortem Debunker&#148; column is the last of my regular <I>CUJ</I> contributions. As they sing in and about the Ould Sod: &#147;Indeed yer dancing days are done; Stan, we hardly knew yer?&#148; It&#146;s been fun rambling away in almost every Miller Freeman Inc. (a.k.a. MaFIa) magazine since 1984. A parting glass to all the friends I made en route.</p>
