<P>In 1997, shortly before the C++ Standard was completed, the standardization committee received a query: Is it possible to create standard containers with incomplete types? It took a while for the committee to understand the question. What would such a thing even mean, and why on earth would you ever want to do it? The committee eventually worked it out and came up with an answer to the question. (Just so you don't have to skip ahead to the end, the answer is "no.") But the question is much more interesting than the answer: it points to a useful, and insufficiently discussed, programming technique. The standard library doesn't directly support that technique, but the two can be made to coexist.</P>

<H3><FONT color=#000080>Incomplete Types</FONT></H3>

<P>We're all used to incomplete types, in the familiar form of forward declarations <a href="#1">[1]</a>. If you declare a class <B>T</B>, you can use it in limited ways even before it is defined. (That is, before its definition is finished: a class is incomplete within its definition.) You can work with pointers and references of type <B>T*</B> and <B>T&amp;</B>; you can write functions that have such pointers and references as part of their signature; you can even declare an <B>extern</B> object of type <B>T</B>. Some of what you can't do: you can't use pointer arithmetic, you can't define variables of type <B>T</B>, you can't write <B>new T</B>, you can't inherit from <B>T</B>, and you can't use <B>sizeof</B>.</P>
<P>This isn't a random list. All of these things follow from the fact that, as the Standard points out in a footnote, "The size and layout of an incompletely-defined object type is unknown." If a type is incomplete, you can't do anything that would require knowing its size or layout. How can you create an object of type <B>T</B> without knowing how large that object has to be? The declaration:</P>

<PRE>
class T;
</PRE>

<P>tells the compiler that <B>T </B>is a class or struct. (As opposed to, say, a built-in type or an alias for some other class.) That's enough for the compiler to know how to deal with pointers or references to <B>T</B>, but not enough to create a <B>T</B> object: how much memory would the compiler allocate for such an object, and how would it lay out the fields? Similarly, pointer arithmetic makes no sense because an expression like <B>p += 1</B> requires the compiler to know the size of the object that <B>p</B> points to.</P>
<P>Why would you want to have a pointer to a type when all you've got is a forward declaration? The classic example is what Kernighan and Ritchie <a href="#2">[2]</a> call "self-referential structures": a class that contains a pointer to itself, like a list node or a tree node. For example:</P>

<PRE>
struct int_list_node {
 int value;
 int_list_node* next;
};
</PRE>

<P>Within the class definition, <B>int_list_node</B> is itself an incomplete type: it isn't complete until the compiler has seen the full class definition. It would be illegal for <B>next</B> to be of type <B>int_list_node</B> (how could a class contain an instance of itself?), but a pointer or reference to <B>int_list_node</B> is fine. </P>
<P>Naturally, self-referential structures aren't the only place where incomplete types come in handy. They're necessary if your design involves classes that point to instances of each other, or even if it involves tightly coupled classes that are friends of each other:</P>

<PRE>
class int_list;
struct int_list_node;

class int_list {
 friend class int_list_node;
 ...
};

struct int_list_node {
 friend class int_list;
 ...
};</PRE>

<P>This example illustrates an important aspect of incomplete types: a type that is incomplete at one point in a file can be completed later on. Here, <B>int_list</B> is an incomplete type after its forward declaration appears, but a complete type after its full class definition.</P>
<P>Finally, forward declarations can be used as a technique for data hiding, for decoupling an interface from its implementation <a href="#3">[3]</a>. You can provide a forward declaration of an "opaque type" <B>my_class</B> in a header file and then declare a functional interface that provides whatever operations are required. (You might choose to expose the full class definition elsewhere, or perhaps not at all.) Naturally, there are some limitations on what the functions in that header file might look like. You could write:</P>

<PRE>
my_class&amp; clone(const my_class&amp;);
</PRE>

<P>but you couldn't write:</P>

<PRE>
int illegal_function(my_class);
</PRE>

<P>or:</P>

<PRE>
my_class illegal_function();
</PRE>

<P>You can't pass or return incomplete types by value, for the same reason that you can't define variables of an incomplete type. And, of course, the restriction applies to member functions just as it applies to stand-alone functions. Just as you can't write <B>illegal_function</B> above, so you can't write:</P>

<PRE>
struct illegal_class {
 my_class f();
};
</PRE>

<H3><FONT color=#000080>Incomplete Types and Templates</FONT></H3>

<P>A good starting point for understanding how incomplete types work for templates is the usual rule of thumb: when you see a class template <B>X&lt;T&gt;</B>, imagine that it's just a normal class, and that every time you see <B>T</B> in the class definition, it's replaced with some specific type. If you replace <B>T</B> with an incomplete type and you get a legal class, then you're on pretty solid ground in assuming that <B>X&lt;T&gt;</B> can be instantiated with an incomplete type. So, for example, you can write a templatized version of the list node class that we saw above:</P>

<PRE>
template &lt;class T&gt;
struct list_node {
 T value;
 list_node&lt;T&gt;* next;
};
</PRE>

<P>The incomplete type is <B>list_node&lt;T&gt;</B>, not <B>T</B> itself. Can you define an incomplete type as the argument to a template? Certainly! The C++ Standard <a href="#4">[4]</a> even says so explicitly. You can't instantiate <B>list_node</B> with an incomplete type (that would be illegal; we've got a member variable of type <B>T</B>), but that's because of the specifics of <B>list_node</B>, not because of any special restrictions on templates. There's nothing wrong with this:</P>

<PRE>
template &lt;class T&gt;
struct ptr_list_node {
 T* ptr_value;
 ptr_list_node&lt;T&gt;* next;
};

class my_class;

ptr_list_node&lt;my_class&gt; p;
</PRE>

<P>It's legal to instantiate <B>ptr_list_node</B> with class <B>my_class</B>, even though all we have for <B>my_class</B> is a forward declaration; it's even legal to have a variable of type <B>ptr_list_node&lt;my_class&gt;</B>. In this respect, there's no real difference between a class template like <B>list_node</B> or <B>ptr_list_node</B>, and an ordinary class like <B>int_list_node</B>.</P>
<P>Combining forward declarations with templates does, however, introduce a few new wrinkles that you don't see with non-template classes. </P>

<P>Consider, for example, this class:</P>

<PRE>
template &lt;class T&gt;
struct X {
 T f() { 
    T tmp;
    return tmp;
 }
};
</PRE>

<P>This looks a lot like the <B>illegal_class</B> example that we saw above. We have a member function, <B>f</B>, that returns <B>T</B> by value, and we've got a local variable of type <B>T</B>. Obviously these are things you can't do when <B>T</B> is an incomplete type, so you might think that writing <B>X&lt;my_class&gt;</B> is illegal if all we have of <B>my_class </B>is a forward declaration. In fact, however, there's nothing wrong with it. Why?</P>
<P>The point is technical, but simple: a function template isn't checked for errors unless it's instantiated (except for trivial syntactic errors), and a member function isn't instantiated unless it's used. It would be illegal to call <B>X&lt;my_class&gt;().f() </B>(you'd be using <B>my_class</B> in a way that's illegal for an incomplete type), but merely writing <B>X&lt;my_class&gt;</B> is fine; it doesn't trigger the instantiation of anything that would be a problem.</P>
<P>This isn't a very interesting example, of course: <B>X&lt;my_class&gt;</B> has nothing but one unusable member function. It does, however, serve as a reminder that we should pay attention to exactly where things are instantiated. When we're mixing templates and incomplete types, there are two important points in the program: the point at which the incomplete type is completed (that is, the point when we see a class definition instead of just a forward declaration), and the point of instantiation. Between those two points, interesting things can happen. You might, for example, instantiate <B>X&lt;my_class&gt;</B>, then define <B>my_class</B>, and only then instantiate <B>X&lt;my_class&gt;::f</B>.</P>

<PRE>
template &lt;class T&gt;
struct X {
 T f() { 
    T tmp;
    return tmp;
 }
};

class my_class;

X&lt;my_class&gt; x;

class my_class {
 ...
};
</PRE>

<P>Why would you ever want a delicate chain of definitions like this? There's one important reason: it lets you use <B>X&lt;my_class&gt;</B> in the definition of <B>my_class</B> itself. You can have a member variable of type <B>X&lt;my_class&gt;</B>, and you can even inherit from <B>X&lt;my_class&gt;</B>. This may seem circular, and it may seem almost as if <B>my_class</B> is inheriting from itself, but it's no more circular than a class like <B>int_list_node</B> that contains a pointer to itself. Each step in the chain is legal: <B>X</B> is written in such a way so that it can be instantiated with an incomplete type, and we're certainly free to define the complete type later.</P>
<P>We've now almost arrived at something realistic. In practice, of course, you probably wouldn't bother with the forward declaration: you would just define <B>my_class</B> right away and use <B>X&lt;my_class&gt;</B> within it. (Within a class definition, the compiler always acts as if it has seen a forward declaration of the class that's being defined.) Barton and Nackman <a href="#5">[5]</a> showed how to use this technique for base classes that govern structure and policy, as in:</P>

<PRE>
class ComplexFloat :
 public FieldCategory&lt;ComplexFloat&gt;
{
 ...
};
</PRE>

<P>The base class encapsulates that which is common to all types that model the mathematical definition of a field. The base and derived classes are mutually dependent: <B>FieldCategory</B> requires functions like <B>operator*=</B> from <B>ComplexFloat</B>, and, in turn, it provides functions like <B>pow</B> and <B>repeat</B> to <B>ComplexFloat</B>.</P>

<H3><FONT color=#000080>Standard Containers</FONT></H3>

<P>We've come pretty far from the original question. We've talked about incomplete types and about templates, but we haven't yet mentioned the standard containers. The Standard doesn't define them in terms of the "curiously recurring template pattern," as this technique has come to be known <a href="#6">[6]</a>. So where do containers of incomplete types come in?</P>
<P>We've seen several kinds of near-circularity that are enabled by forward declarations, but there's another kind we haven't yet seen. A class like <B>int_list_node</B> contains a pointer to another <B>int_list_node</B>, but that's not very flexible. First, we may want to have a node that refers to <I>N</I> other nodes, not just one. (Lots of applications involve tree structures where a node may have an arbitrary number of children &#151; consider XML, for example.) Second, pointer semantics might just not be very convenient <a href="#7">[7]</a>. Obviously, we can't define a class <B>X</B> that contains an array of <B>X</B> objects &#151; and even if we could, arrays aren't variable sized. But might we be able to do something like this instead?</P>

<PRE>
struct tree_node {
 int value;
 std::vector&lt;tree_node&gt; children;
};
</PRE>

<P>To all external appearances, it looks like a class where each object contains <I>N</I> other instances of the same object. That's by design: STL containers like <B>vector</B> closely resemble built-in arrays. A node's <B>i</B><SUP>th</SUP> child is just <B>n.children[i]</B>, and, because the children are <B>tree_node</B> objects rather than mere pointers, we can copy an entire subtree with the single line:</P>

<PRE>
tree_node n2 = n1;
</PRE>

<P>without needing to worry about memory protocols or explicit deep copies. It looks circular, but the appearance of circularity doesn't necessarily make it illegal; as we've seen, not everything that looks circular really is. All that's necessary is that it's possible to define a <B>vector&lt;T&gt;</B> where <B>T</B> is an incomplete type.</P>
<P>When the standardization committee first realized that this was an open question, the <B>tree_node</B> example was the first test I tried. I didn't know what to expect; I certainly knew that the person who implemented that particular version of <B>std::vector</B> (me) hadn't ever thought of such a possibility. To my amazement, it worked! Soon we started thinking of more possible applications &#151; Greg Colvin, for example, had a use for a finite-state machine where each <B>state</B> object contained an <B>std::map&lt;int, state&gt;</B>:</P>

<PRE>
struct state {
 int value;
 std::map&lt;int, state&gt; next;
};
</PRE>

<P>Alas, the state machine was our first sign that this wasn't so simple as we had hoped. The state machine failed to compile, and, after a moment's thought, we realized that we shouldn't have bothered to try &#151; it should have been obvious that nothing like that could have worked. Then we discovered, with more testing, that even the <B>tree_node</B> example didn't work with every STL implementation. In the end, it all seemed too murky and too poorly understood; the standardization committee didn't think there was any choice except to say that STL containers aren't supposed to work with incomplete types. For good measure, we applied that prohibition to the rest of the standard library too. Would it make sense to have an <B>std::complex&lt;T&gt;</B>, or an <B>std::basic_istream&lt;Char&gt;</B>, where <B>T</B> or <B>Char</B> hasn't been defined yet? Almost certainly not.</P>
<P>The C++ Standard <a href="#8">[8]</a> says that you're not allowed to instantiate a standard library template with an incomplete type: "the effects are undefined ... if an incomplete type is used as a template argument when instantiating a template component." Some implementations do permit it in some circumstances, but that's just an accident. (Remember, "undefined behavior" covers absolutely anything &#151; including things working as you might expect them to!)</P>
<P>In retrospect, now that the technology is better understood, that decision still seems basically right. Yes, in some cases it's possible to implement some of the standard containers so that they can be instantiated with incomplete types &#151; but it's also clear that in other cases it would be difficult or impossible. It was mostly chance that the first test we tried, using <B>std::vector</B>, happened to be one of the easy cases.</P>
<P>It's easy to see that defining an <B>std::map&lt;K, V&gt;</B>, where <B>K</B> or <B>V</B> is an incomplete type, is quite hopeless. The value type of an <B>std::map&lt;K, V&gt;</B>, after all (that is, the kind of object that's stored in the container) is <B>std::pair&lt;const K, V&gt;</B>. In turn, <B>pair&lt;T1, T2&gt;</B> has a member variable of type <B>T1</B> and another one of type <B>T2</B>. You can't have member variables of an incomplete type, and that's what this would mean: instantiating <B>map&lt;K, V&gt;</B> necessarily requires instantiating <B>pair&lt;const K, V&gt;</B>.</P>
<P>What about the other standard containers, like <B>list</B> or <B>set</B>? Here we get into implementation details; it's hard to come up with a firm proof that instantiating <B>std::list&lt;T&gt;</B> or <B>std::set&lt;T&gt;</B> is impossible. But it's easy to see why it won't work with current implementations of those containers, and why an implementation that allowed it to work would be anything but straightforward. These containers are usually implemented in terms of nodes; a <B>set</B>'s node, for example, might look something like this:</P>

<PRE>
template &lt;class V&gt;
struct rb_tree_node {
 V value;
 rb_tree_node *parent, *left, *right;
 bool color;
};
</PRE>

<P>The problem, of course, is the <B>value</B> member variable: it means that we can't instantiate <B>rb_tree_node</B> with an incomplete type, which, in turn, means that (if <B>set</B> is implemented this way) we can't instantiate <B>set</B> with an incomplete type. Is it possible to implement <B>set</B> in a way that gets around this restriction? Probably. But, as far as I know, nobody has ever tried &#151; and probably nobody will, because the obvious ways of getting around it would make <B>set</B> larger or slower or both.</P>
<P>With <B>vector</B>, it's the other way around. The C++ Standard doesn't say how <B>vector&lt;T&gt;</B> is supposed to be implemented, but in this case the obvious implementation is one that allows <B>T</B> to be an incomplete type. The straightforward way to write <B>std::vector</B> is something like this:</P>

<PRE>
template &lt;class T, class Allocator&gt;
class vector {
 ...
private:
 Allocator a;
 T* buffer;
 typename Allocator::size_type buffer_size;
 typename Allocator::size_type buffer_capacity;
};
</PRE>

<P>Nothing in this requires <B>T</B> to be a complete type; a forward declaration is quite good enough. And none of the obvious variations (inheriting from <B>Allocator</B>, using three pointers instead of a pointer and two integers, and so on) affect this. Indeed, when I reran my <B>tree_node</B> test for this column, it passed on the first three compilers I tried <a href="#9">[9]</A>.</P>

<H3><FONT color=#000080>Conclusion</FONT></H3>

<P>Where does that leave us? A design like the recursive <B>tree_node</B> is very nice for some purposes, but, as we've seen, we can't have it: it's expressly forbidden by the C++ Standard. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the standard library is useless for this sort of design. The important idea is the seemingly circular design where a class <B>X</B> contains, as a member variable, a container whose value type is <B>X</B>: it's the next best thing to a class that contains itself. The C++ Standard says you aren't allowed to use any of the standard container classes, but the standard containers aren't the only options. The C++ Standard defines a container interface, not just a set of unrelated classes, and any container class conforming to that interface fits into the library framework just as well as the predefined classes like <B>list</B> and <B>set</B>.</P>
<P>In a future revision of C++, it might make sense to relax the restriction on instantiating standard library templates with incomplete types. Clearly, the general prohibition should stay in place &#151; instantiating templates with incomplete types is a delicate business, and there are too many classes in the standard library where it would make no sense. But perhaps it should be relaxed on a case-by-case basis, and <B>vector</B> looks like a good candidate for such special-case treatment: it's the one standard container class where there are good reasons to instantiate it with an incomplete type and where Standard Library implementors want to make it work. As of today, in fact, implementors would have to go out of their way to prohibit it!</P>

<H3><FONT color=#000080>Notes</FONT></H3>

<P><A name=1></A>[1] Actually, there are two other kinds of incomplete types: arrays whose size is unknown, and <B>void</B>, which behaves like an incomplete type that can't ever be completed. See §3.9, paragraph 6, of the C++ Standard. However, the most important kind of incomplete type is a class that has been declared but not yet defined; it's the only kind that I'll discuss. </P>
