<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>In order to run code before <B>main</B>, the <B>PARAM_BEGIN_REG</B>/<B>PARAM_END_REG</B> macros set up code that looks approximately like this:</p>

<pre>
class GlobalCode {
public:
  GlobalCode(void) {
// insert code to be executed here.
  }
} global_code;
</pre>

<p>This creates a global object and therefore runs its constructor where the code to be executed is placed.</p>
<p>In order to avoid conflicts with other registration blocks in this file and others, the entire code is placed inside an anonymous namespace and then inside a namespace containing the line number.</p>
<p>The actual XParam code also guards against exceptions.</p></blockquote></body></html>
