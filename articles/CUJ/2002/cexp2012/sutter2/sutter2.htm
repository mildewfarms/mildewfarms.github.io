<p>The Greek philosopher Socrates taught by asking his students questions &#151; questions designed to guide them and help them draw conclusions from what they already knew, and to show them how the things they were learning related to each other and to their existing knowledge. This method has become so famous that we now call it the &quot;Socratic method.&quot; From our point of view as students, Socrates' approach involves us, makes us think, and helps us relate and apply what we already know to new information. <i>More Exceptional C++</i> <a href="#1">[1]</a> uses a Socratic problem-solution format to teach how to make effective use of Standard C++ and its standard library with a particular focus on sound software engineering in modern C++.</p>
<p>In this excerpt from More Exceptional C++ (Items 20 and 21, drawn from the section on &quot;Exception Safety Issues and Techniques&quot;), our focus is on a subtle issue related to parameter evaluation, why just using a smart pointer like <b>auto_ptr</b> doesn't entirely solve it, and what to do about it. The issue is subtle, but the analysis and ultimate solution are intriguing and simple, respectively, and something working C++ developers should know about.</p>

<p>1. In each of the following statements, what can you say about the order of evaluation of the functions <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>h</b> and the expressions <b>expr1</b> and <b>expr2</b>? Assume that <b>expr1</b> and <b>expr2</b> do not contain more function calls.</p>

// Example 1-1(a)
//
f( expr1, expr2 );

// Example 1-1(b)

<p><b>1. In each of the following statements, what can you say about the order of evaluation of the functions f, g, and h and the expressions expr1 and expr2? Assume that expr1 and expr2 do not contain more function calls.</b></p>

<p>Ignoring threads, which are not mentioned in the C++ Standard, the answer to the first question hinges on the following basic rules:</p>

<OL>
<LI>All of a function's arguments must be fully evaluated before the function is called. This includes the completion of any side effects of expressions used as function arguments.</LI>
<LI>Once the execution of a function begins, no expressions from the calling function begin or continue to be evaluated until execution of the called function has completed. Function executions never interleave with each other.</LI>
<LI>Expressions used as function arguments may generally be evaluated in any order, including interleaved, except as otherwise restricted by the other rules.</LI>
</OL>

<p>Given those rules, let's see what happens in our opening examples:</p>

<pre>
// Example 1-1(a)
//
f( expr1, expr2 );
</pre>

<p>In Example 1-1(a), all we can say is that both <b>expr1</b> and <b>expr2</b> must be evaluated before <b>f()</b> is called.</p>
<p>That's it. The compiler may choose to perform the evaluation of <b>expr1</b> before, after, <i>or interleaved with</i> the evaluation of <b>expr2</b>. There are enough people who find this surprising that it comes up as a regular question on the newsgroups, but it's just a direct result of the C and C++ rules about sequence points.</p>

<pre>
// Example 1-1(b)
//
f( g( expr1 ), h( expr2 ) );
</pre>

<p>In Example 1-1(b), the functions and expressions may be evaluated in any order that respects the following rules:</p>

<UL><LI><b>expr1</b> must be evaluated before <b>g()</b> is called.</LI>
<LI><b>expr2</b> must be evaluated before <b>h()</b> is called.</LI>
<LI>Both <b>g()</b> and <b>h()</b> must complete before <b>f()</b> is called.</LI>
<LI>The evaluations of <b>expr1</b> and <b>expr2</b> may be interleaved with each other, but nothing may be interleaved with any of the function calls. For example, no part of the evaluation of <b>expr2</b> nor the execution of <b>h()</b> may occur from the time <b>g()</b> begins until it ends.</LI></UL>

<p>That's it. For example, this means that any one or more of the following are possible:</p>

<UL><LI>Either <b>g()</b> or <b>h()</b> could be called first.</LI>
<LI>Evaluation of <b>expr1</b> could begin, then be interrupted by <b>h()</b> being called, and then complete. (Likewise for <b>expr2</b> and <b>g()</b>.)</LI>
</UL>

<p><b>2. In your travels through the dusty corners of your company's code archives, you find the following code fragment:</b></b></p>

<pre>
// Example 1-2
//

// In some header file:
void f( T1*, T2* );

// In some implementation file:
f( new T1, new T2 );
</pre>

<p><b>Does this code have any potential exception-safety problems? Explain.</b></p>
<p>Yes, there are several potential exception safety problems.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Brief recap: an expression such as <b>new T1</b> is called, simply enough, a new-expression. Recall what a new-expression really does (ignoring in-place and array forms for simplicity, because they're not very relevant here):</p>

<UL>
<LI>It allocates memory.</LI>
<LI>It constructs a new object in that memory.</LI>
<LI>If the construction fails because of an exception, the allocated memory is freed.</LI></UL>

<p>So each new-expression is essentially a series of two function calls: one call to <b>operator new()</b> (either the global one, or one provided by the type of the object being created), and then a call to the constructor.</p>
<p>For Example 1-2, consider what happens if the compiler decides to generate code as follows:</p>

<OL><LI>Allocate memory for the <b>T1</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>T1</b>.</LI>
<LI>Allocate memory for the <b>T2</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>T2</b>.</LI>
<LI>Call <b>f()</b>.</LI></OL>

<p>The problem is this: if either step 3 or step 4 fails because of an exception, the C++ Standard does not require that the <b>T1</b> object be destroyed and its memory deallocated. This is a classic memory leak, and clearly Not a Good Thing.</p> 
<p>Another possible sequence of events is the following:</p>

<OL><LI>Allocate memory for the <b>T1</b>.</LI>
<LI>Allocate memory for the <b>T2</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>T1</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>T2</b>.</LI>
<LI>Call <b>f()</b>.</LI>
</OL>

<p>This sequence has, not one, but two exception-safety problems with different effects:</p>

<UL><p>a) If step 3 fails because of an exception, then the memory allocated for the <b>T1</b> object is automatically deallocated (step 1 is undone), but the Standard does not require that the memory allocated for the <b>T2</b> object be deallocated. The memory is leaked.</p>
<p>b) If step 4 fails because of an exception, then the <b>T1</b> object has been allocated and fully constructed, but the Standard does not require that it be destroyed and its memory deallocated. The <b>T1</b> object is leaked.</p>
</UL>

<p>&quot;Hmm,&quot; you might wonder, &quot;then why does this exception-safety loophole exist at all? Why doesn't the Standard just prevent the problem by requiring compilers to Do the Right Thing when it comes to cleanup?&quot;</p>
<p>Following the spirit of C in the matter of efficiency, the C++ Standard allows the compiler some latitude with the order of evaluation of expressions, because this allows the compiler to perform optimizations that might not otherwise be possible. To permit this, the expression evaluation rules are specified in a way that is not exception-safe, so if you want to write exception-safe code you need to know about, and avoid, these cases. Fortunately, you can do just that and prevent this problem. Perhaps a managed pointer like <b>auto_ptr</b> could help? We'll see the answer in the following part.</p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Problem 2: What About auto_ptr</FONT></H3>

<OL><LI>As you continue to root through the archives, you see that someone must not have liked Example 1-2 because later versions of the files in question were changed as follows:</LI>

<pre>
// Example 2-1
//

// In some header file:
void f( auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt;, auto_ptr&lt;T2&gt; );

// In some implementation file:

</pre>

<p><b>What improvements does this version offer over Example 1-2, if any? Do any exception-safety problems remain? Explain.</b></p>

<p>This code attempts to &quot;throw <a href="#2">[2]</a> <b>auto_ptr</b> at the problem.&quot; Many people believe that a smart pointer like <b>auto_ptr</b> is an exception-safety panacea, a touchstone or amulet that by its mere presence somewhere nearby can help ward off compiler indigestion.</p>
<p>It is not. Nothing has changed. Example 2-1 is still not exception-safe, for exactly the same reasons as before.</p>
<p>Specifically, the problem is that the resources are safe only if they really make it into a managing <b>auto_ptr</b>, but the same problems already noted can still occur before either <b>auto_ptr</b> constructor is ever reached. This is because both of the two problematic execution orders mentioned earlier are still possible, but now with the <b>auto_ptr</b> constructors tacked onto the end before <b>f()</b>. For one example:</p> 

<OL><LI>Allocate memory for the <b>T1</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>T1</b>.</LI>
<LI>Allocate memory for the <b>T2</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>T2</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt;</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>auto_ptr&lt;T2&gt;</b>.</LI>
<LI>Call <b>f()</b>.</LI>
</OL>

<p>In the above case, the same problems are still present if either of steps 3 or 4 throws. Similarly:</p>

<OL><LI>Allocate memory for the <b>T1</b>.</LI>
<LI>Allocate memory for the <b>T2</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>T1</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>T2</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt;</b>.</LI>
<LI>Construct the <b>auto_ptr&lt;T2&gt;</b>.</LI>
<LI>Call <b>f()</b>.</LI></OL>

<p>Again, the same problems are present if either of steps 3 or 4 throws.</p>
<p>Fortunately, though, this is not a problem with <b>auto_ptr</b>; <b>auto_ptr</b> is being used the wrong way, that's all. In a moment, we'll see several ways to use it better.
<H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Aside: A Non-Solution</FONT></H4>

<p>Note that the following is not a solution:</p>

<pre>
// In some header file:
void f( auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt; = auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt;( new T1 ),
        auto_ptr&lt;T2&gt; = auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt;( new T2 ) );

// In some implementation file:
f();
</pre>

<p>Why is this code not a solution? Because it's identical to Example 2-1 in terms of expression evaluation. Default arguments are considered to be created in the function call expression, even though they're written somewhere else entirely (in the function declaration).</p>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">A Limited Solution</FONT></H4>

<p><b>2. Demonstrate how to write an auto_ptr_new facility that solves the safety problems in Question 1 and can be invoked as follows:</b></p>

<pre>
// Example 2-2
//

// In some header file:
void f( auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt;, auto_ptr&lt;T2&gt; );

// In some implementation file:
f( auto_ptr_new&lt;T1&gt;(), auto_ptr_new&lt;T2&gt;() );
</pre>

<p>The simplest solution is to provide a function template like the following:</p>

<pre>
// Example 2-2(a): Partial solution
//
template&lt;typename T&gt;
auto_ptr&lt;T&gt; auto_ptr_new()
{
  return auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;( new T );
}
</pre>

<p>This solves the exception-safety problems. No sequence of generated code can cause resources to be leaked, because now all we have is two functions, and we know that one must be executed entirely before the other. Consider the following evaluation order:</p>

<OL><LI>Call <b>auto_ptr_new&lt;T1&gt;()</b>.</LI>
<LI>Call <b>auto_ptr_new&lt;T2&gt;()</b>.</LI></OL>

<p>If step 1 throws, there are no leaks because the <b>auto_ptr_new()</b> template is itself strongly exception-safe.</p>
<p>If step 2 throws, then is the temporary <b>auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt;</b> created by step 1 guaranteed to be cleaned up? Yes, it is. One might wonder: isn't this pretty much the same as the <b>new T1</b> object created in the corresponding case in Example 1-2, which isn't correctly cleaned up? No, this time it's not quite the same, because here the <b>auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt;</b> is actually a temporary object, and cleanup of temporary objects is correctly specified in the Standard. From the Standard, in 12.2/3:</p> 

<UL><p>Temporary objects are destroyed as the last step in evaluating the full-expression that (lexically) contains the point where they were created. This is true even if that evaluation ends in throwing an exception.</p></UL>

<p>But Example 2-2(a) is a limited solution: it only works with a default constructor, which breaks if a given type <b>T</b> doesn't have a default constructor, or if you don't want to use it. A more general solution is still needed.</p> 

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Generalizing the auto_ptr_new() Solution</FONT></H4>

<p>As pointed out by Dave Abrahams, we can extend the solution to support non-default constructors by providing a family of overloaded function templates:</p>

<pre>
// Example 2-2(b): Improved solution
//
template&lt;typename T&gt;
auto_ptr&lt;T&gt; auto_ptr_new()
{
  return auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;( new T );
}

template&lt;typename T, typename Arg1&gt;
auto_ptr&lt;T&gt; auto_ptr_new( const Arg1&amp; arg1 )
{
  return auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;( new T( arg1 ) );
}

template&lt;typename T, typename Arg1, typename Arg2&gt;
auto_ptr&lt;T&gt; auto_ptr_new( const Arg1&amp; arg1,
                          const Arg2&amp; arg2 )
{
  return auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;( new T( arg1, arg2 ) );
}

// etc.
</pre>

<p>Now <b>auto_ptr_new</b> fully and naturally supports non-default construction.</p>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">A Better Solution</FONT></H4>

<p>Although <b>auto_ptr_new()</b> is nice, is there any way we could have avoided all the exception-safety problems without writing such helper functions? Could we have avoided the problems with better coding standards? Yes, and here is one possible standard that would have eliminated the problem: <i>Never allocate resources (for example, via <b>new</b>) in the same expression as any other code that could throw an exception. This applies even if the <b>new</b>'d resource will immediately be managed (for example, passed to an <b>auto_ptr</b> constructor) in the same expression.</i></p>
<p>In the Example 2-1 code, the way to satisfy this guideline is to move one of the temporary <b>auto_ptr</b>s into a separate named variable:</p>

<pre>
// Example 2-1(a): A solution
//

// In some header file:
void f( auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt;, auto_ptr&lt;T2&gt; );

// In some implementation file:
{
  auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt; t1( new T1 );
  f( t1, auto_ptr&lt;T2&gt;( new T2 ) );
}
</pre>

<p>This satisfies guideline #1 because, although we are still allocating a resource, it can't be leaked because of an exception, because it's not created in the same expression as any other code that could throw <a href="#3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Here is another possible coding standard, which is even simpler and easier to get right (and easier to catch in code reviews): <i>perform every explicit resource allocation (for example, <b>new</b>) in its own code statement, which immediately gives the <b>new</b>'d resource to a manager object (for example, <b>auto_ptr</b>).</i></p> 
<p>In Example 2-1, the way to satisfy the second alternative guideline is to move both of the temporary <b>auto_ptr</b>s into separate named variables:</p>

<pre>
// Example 2-1(b): A simpler solution
//

// In some header file:
void f( auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt;, auto_ptr&lt;T2&gt; );

// In some implementation file:
{
  auto_ptr&lt;T1&gt; t1( new T1 );
  auto_ptr&lt;T2&gt; t2( new T2 );
  f( t1, t2 );
}
</pre>

<p>This satisfies guideline #2, and it required a lot less thought to get it right. Each new resource is created in its own expression and is immediately given to a managing object.</p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Summary</FONT></H3>

<p>My recommendation is:</p>

<UL><p><b>Guideline</b>: Perform every explicit resource allocation (for example, <b>new</b>) in its own code statement, which immediately gives the <b>new</b>'d resource to a manager object (for example, <b>auto_ptr</b>).</b></p>
</UL> 

<p>This guideline is easy to understand and remember; it neatly avoids all the exception-safety problems in the original problem; and by mandating the use of manager objects, it helps to avoid many other exception-safety problems as well. This guideline is a good candidate for inclusion in your team's coding standards.</p>
