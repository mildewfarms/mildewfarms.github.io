<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Bravo Systems Releases Str Library v2.0</FONT></H3>

<p>Bravo Systems Inc. has released Str Library v2.0, a set of classes for C++ developers that provides high-performance string manipulation for client- and server-side applications. Projects that require high-performance string manipulation without being tied to a particular platform can use Str Library as a plug-in replacement for MFC <B>CString</B> or STL <B>std::string</B> to achieve vendor independence and gain speed of execution, especially in SMP environments. Str Library uses a semi-automatic technology for sharing strings between threads that eliminates heavy CPU bus penalties associated with other implementations. The library also uses the instance sharing (copy-on-write) technology for data instances to achieve the best possible speed for common operations such as returning string data from class methods, assigning and concatenating strings, and passing data by value.</p>
<p>Str Library is licensed on a per-developer basis and includes full source code and support. No run-time royalties apply. An evaluation version is available from the company&#146;s website.</p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Prosentia Debuts ProCrypt</FONT></H3>

<p>Prosentia has released ProCrypt, a software-licensing tool. ProCrypt offers control over the number of machines on which a customer installs your software. Licensing is done via the Internet with public/private key cryptography to store the licensing information on the customer&#146;s computer in a form that cannot be tampered with. The software consists of two parts: an ActiveX control, which embeds in your application and handles tasks such as verifying the license or getting one from the server if needed; and a set of Active Server Pages, which run on your Web server and handle customer license requests and purchases.</p>
<p>ProCrypt runs on Windows 95/98/ME/XP/NT4/2000 and requires that the application can contain ActiveX controls. The server scripts use Internet Information Server and Microsoft Access. These scripts can serve as examples to create the equivalents for other servers. ProCrypt costs $500 per application for protection. There is no fee per copy of your applications.</p>
