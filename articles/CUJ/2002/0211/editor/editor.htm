<p>Where do you go to find out what&#146;s &#147;hot&#148;? What is your source for the latest buzzwords or faux silver bullet? When a new technology, promising or not, snags its share of the limelight, how does that light make its way to your door? If you&#146;re like me, you tire easily of hype machines that cry wolf about this or that whiz-bang tool.</p>
<p>If you&#146;re like just about everyone, you get a large volume of uninvited electronic mail. That&#146;s what happens when one fills out registration forms or makes purchases online. Even the mail I&#146;ve intentionally signed up for gets a little noisy. I ignore much of it. What works will pass the ever-reliable &#147;test of time,&#148; regardless of hype. Such is the stuff of everyday programming.</p>
<p>Just as what makes news isn&#146;t always newsworthy, what fades from the headlines isn&#146;t always just yesterday&#146;s news either. Do you remember when STL was big news in 1994? After Hewlett-Packard turned over the source code into the public domain, the media couldn&#146;t say enough about it. STL isn&#146;t &#147;sexy&#148; these days &#151; not because nobody is using it, but rather because everyone is using it. It&#146;s not news because it&#146;s proven itself over time. It&#146;s part of the landscape.</p>
<p>That goes double for the language that hosts STL. I can&#146;t think of a single category of software applications where C++ does not excel. How about graphics? Ask Adobe or Mentor Graphics. Large-scale online commerce? Try Amazon. Telecommunications? Ever heard of AT&amp;T or Ericsson or Nokia? Web applications? Next time you search on Google, you&#146;ll be using a system developed in C++. Sun uses C++ to build the Hotspot Java Virtual Machine. In this issue, we&#146;re excited to present POOMA, a groundbreaking, open-source mathematical template library from Los Alamos Labs that is sure to remove those socks of yours in Internet time.</p>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, has begun compiling a list of major applications built in C++ at &lt;www.research.att.com/~bs/applications.html&gt;, about which he remarked, &#147;I couldn&#146;t list a 1,000th of all major C++ programs if I tried, and this list holds maybe 1,000th of the ones I have heard of.&#148; Most of us in the C++ community believe the language is entrenched far beyond what is presented in the media. If you have an item or two to add to Bjarne&#146;s list of C++ applications, we have been authorized to invite you to please send the details to him at <B>bs@research.att.com</B>; it would be most cool to fill in the other 999 thousandths.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <I>CUJ</I> will stand firm in its mission to be the first (and last) place(s) C/C++ developers look for day-to-day advice on building good software. We&#146;re confident we&#146;ll be working on this part of the landscape for a long time to come. </p>
