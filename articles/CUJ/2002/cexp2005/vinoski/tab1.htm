  <td><b>Real-time CORBA Feature</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Configuring custom protocols to obtain adequate end-to-end network-level QoS.</td>
  <td>TCP/IP is inadequate to provide end-to-end <i>real-time</i> response, so   communication between application objects must use a different protocol. </td>
  <td>Use the Real-time CORBA <b>ClientProtocol</b> and <b>ServerProtocol</b> policies to select and/or configure the necessary network protocols.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Controlling network and end system resources to minimize priority inversion.</td>
  <td>High-priority operations, such as <b>edge_alarm</b> or <b>stop</b>, must not be queued behind low-priority operations, such as <b>query_state</b>.</td>
  <td>Use the Real-time CORBA <b>PriorityBandedConnectionPolicy</b> to associate different connections with different thread priority ranges.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Avoiding dynamic connections since the jitter is detrimental to time-critical operations.</td>
  <td>Connections must be established explicitly between the base station and the drones to avoid unacceptable jitter.</td>
  <td>Pre-allocate one or more connections via the <b>Object::_validate_connection</b> operation.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Minimizing priority inversions by ensuring applications don't share a connection between threads running at different priorities.</td>
  <td>High-priority operations, such as <b>edge_alarm</b> or <b>stop</b>, need to use exclusive, pre-allocated connections to avoid   &quot;head-of-line&quot; blocking.</td>
  <td>Use the Real-time CORBA <b>PrivateConnectionPolicy </b>to ensure the use of non-multiplexed connections.</td>
