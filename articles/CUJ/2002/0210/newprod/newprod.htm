<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Cypress Releases Linux USB 2.0</FONT></H3>
<p>Cypress Semiconductor Corporation has announced Linux USB 2.0, its host driver supporting the SL811HS embedded host/peripheral controller.

<p>Enhancements to version 2.0 include: a structured API; a new &#147;MDLC&#148; in-place user interface for direct control of lens parameters; additional classes supplied for OpenGL rendering to facilitate texture mapping capabilities on an adaptive PDT mesh that accurately describes PDT lenses; a complete rendering toolkit in the image warper component of the SDK for non-OpenGL; raster-viewing applications; improved in-place editing capabilities with the addition of the reversible undisplace transformation to the mesh class; new Qt-specific classes; and support for handheld applications under WinCE and embedded Linux.</p>
<p>PDT supports Microsoft Windows and Unix variants, such as IRIX and Linux. The PDT SDK was written in ANSI C++ to ensure compatibility with a wide range of C++ compilers. The PDT SDK is available to OEM&#146;s and System Integrators that are interested in implementing PDT as a customer solution within their leading applications.
