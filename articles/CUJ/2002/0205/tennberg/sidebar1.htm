<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Java has no explicit support for TLS, but you can provide the same functionality by deriving a new class from <B>Thread</B> that contains a static hash map. You can then derive your thread classes from this hash-map container and use <B>Thread.currentThread</B> to store and retrieve local storage data through the hash map.</p>
<p>Most platforms support POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface based on uniX). POSIX [4] provides the same functionality as static TLS (see sidebar, <a href="sidebar2.htm">&#147;Static vs. Dynamic TLS&#148;</a>) under Windows through the <B>pthread_key</B> set of functions.</p>
