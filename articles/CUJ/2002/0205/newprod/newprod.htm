<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">AutomatedQA Announces AQtime .NET Edition</FONT></H3>

<p>AutomatedQA Corporation has debuted AQtime .NET Edition, a performance optimization tool set for Microsoft&#146;s .NET framework and the Visual Studio .NET development environment.</p>
<p>AQtime .NET Edition has three static profilers that analyze the MSIL executable and provide detailed statistics on it. The .NET Static Analysis Profiler reports which routines exist in the application, from where they are called in source, and what they call in turn. The .NET Static Analysis Profiler does not tell if and when the calls will execute, but it does give a full report of routine interdependence in the source. The .NET Static Class Analysis Profiler extracts class relationships (server-client) from method-call information. The .NET Sequence Diagram Link Profiler creates a UML-style diagram that graphically represents the sequence of method calls. Classes are shown as entities, and source-code calls between methods of different classes are shown as messages.</p>
<p>AQtime .NET Edition costs $349 for a single-user license. Volume discounts are available.</p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">AidAim Software Presents EasyCompression Library</FONT></H3>

<p>AidAim Software has released EasyCompression Library, a high-performance compression and encryption library for Delphi/C++Builder developers. Based on AidAim&#146;s original One Stream technology, EasyCompression Library uses the same stream for both data compression and decompression. This universal stream class allows a developer to use all the properties and methods of the normal TStream (i.e., read data, write data, seek in any direction, get/set data size) and at the same time some additional functions, such as get the compressed data size, compression ratio, and progress indication.</p>
<p>This universal stream class is compatible with TStream and ensures transparent compression/decompression. For example, the programmer works each class as well as with the normal TStream without regard to data size, compression algorithm, or compression ratio, although these parameters are also available.</p>
<p>EasyCompression Library costs $95 for a single-user license without source code and $195 for a single-user license with source code. Licenses for teams, sites, and enterprises are available.</p>
