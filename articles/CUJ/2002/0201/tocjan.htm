<p><b>Cristian Georgescu</b><br>
<i>XML is indisputably the long-awaited lingua franca for defining and transmitting structured data. With a little help from XSL, it can also generate C++ code for you.</i></p>

<H4><A HREF="meyers/meyers.htm">The New C: Variable Length Arrays, Part 3: Pointers and Parameters</A></H4>
<p><b>Randy Meyers</b><br>
<i>Randy shows that pointers to VLAs are as convenient as pointers to normal arrays. The question is: how many programmers understand pointers to arrays in the first place? Look here to see if you're one of them.</i></p>


<H4><A HREF="sutter/sutter.htm">Sutter&#146;s Mill: Toward a Standard C++0x Library, Part 1</A></H4>

<p><b>Bobby Schmidt</b><br>
<i>Have you ever wondered why no one ever tells Language Lawyer jokes? It may be because we need them so badly. The mighty Barrister shows his stuff again this month.</i></p>

<p>In this new, web-only component of <I>CUJ</I>, we continue publication of the columns that were popular in the former <I>C++ Report</I> magazine. The following articles are featured on the <I>CUJ</I> website this month:</p>

<H4><A HREF="../cexp2001/hyslop/hyslop.htm">&#147;Conversations: New Bases, Part 1&#148;</A></H4>
<p><b>by Herb Sutter and Jim Hyslop</b><br>
<i>Converting a text-represented number from one base to another is pretty simple. But how extensible and reusable can the solution be to solve more than one problem, when there are also additional requirements?</i></p>

<H4><A HREF="../cexp2001/reeves/reeves.htm">&#147;The (B)Leading Edge: XDR_Stream Class, Part IV&#148;</A></H4>
<p><b>by Jack W. Reeves</b><br>
<i>This month Jack finishes up his </I><B>XDR_Stream</B><i> class by cleaning up its error handling. With this installment, Jack now feels like he has something that is production quality.</i></p>

<H4><A HREF="../cexp2001/vinoski/vinoski.htm">&#147;Object Interconnections: Real-time CORBA, Part 2: Applications and Priorities&#148;</A></h4>
<p><b>by Douglas C. Schmidt and Steve Vinoski</b><br>
<i>The Real-time CORBA specification enhances regular CORBA by adding capabilities that control process, communication, and memory resources. These capabilities enable standard COTS middleware to improve the determinism of DRE applications by bounding their priority inversions and managing their system resources more predictably end-to-end. This column shows how to program the Real-time CORBA features that provide portable priority mapping and end-to-end priority preservation.</i></p>
