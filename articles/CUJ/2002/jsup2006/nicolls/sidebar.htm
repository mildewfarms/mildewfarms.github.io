<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Let&#146;s say the document you want to build has characters (such as French braces) that are open or close delimiters. That is not a problem.</p>
<p>When <B>DocumentBuilder</B> finds an open and close delimiter, it grabs the value between the delimiters and passes it to the <B>getValue</B> method. If the <B>getValue</B> method returns <B>null</B>, then <B>DocumentBuilder</B> leaves that portion of the document template alone.</p>
<p>That means that you can have delimiters as part of your document, without any problems.</p>
<p>If, however, your document contains a large number of non-used delimiters, you might consider changing the delimiters. For example, if your delimiters are &#147;&lt;&#148; and &#147;&gt;&#148;, and you are building an XML document, performance may slow as <B>DocumentBuilder</B> must parse through all of them unnecessarily.</p>
