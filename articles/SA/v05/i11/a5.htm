The explosion of companies rushing to connect to the
Internet in recent
years has encouraged information sharing like never
before. In haste,
some companies have neglected to consider the implications
of exposing
their businesses to potentially millions of outsiders.
Some of these
visitors will have less than honest intentions. Studies
of computer
crime show an ever-increasing growth in unauthorized
penetrations (see
Figure 1), resulting in a projected financial loss of
billions of
dollars per year (see Figure 2). How is it that these
individuals are
able to compromise the security of these sites? Computer
security has
been called a trade-off in convenience. The stronger
the security
measures, the more inconvenient it can be to use the
system. However
with the increasing industry focus on security, some
managers are
beginning to tighten up. This article examines high-level
concerns to
help you tighten security in your environment. <P>

Many information systems managers and system administrators
cut their
teeth in a different era. In those days, security meant
locking the door
to the data center. The network consisted of a mainframe
with some
serial terminals and printers all contained nicely in
one room. You
could literally guard the door and maintain effective
security. Today's
business networks of LANs and WANs can span the globe,
calling for more
sophisticated measures. Some administrators simply haven't
caught up. If
they have not experienced a major security-related loss,
it may not be a
high priority. Before a loss occurs, smart companies
will take steps to
strengthen their enterprise.<P>

In the old westerns, bad guys always wore black hats.
Today, it's not
that simple. The bad guy could be an industrial spy,
a disgruntled or
bored employee, or a teenager down the street. Each
of these individuals
has a different motivation for potentially c
