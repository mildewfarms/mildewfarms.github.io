<B>The Kernel Group Upgrades SCTrace</B><P>

The Kernel Group, Inc. has upgraded SCTrace, its call
tracing tool for
AIX. SCTrace lets systems administrators and developers
look inside a
running program and see what is going on. SCTrace generates
a report of
the calls made by the target program, and gives enough
detail to show
exactly what each one was meant to do and what it actually
did. SCTrace
displays system calls with arguments and return values;
regular function
calls, including stripped binaries; and timing information
for
performance analysis. SCTrace follows fork operation,
stores the trace
data for later viewing, and can restrict traces to specific
functions or
system calls. It also attaches to programs already running,
requires no
super-user privileges, and provides flexible configuration
options with
defaults.<P>

SCTrace v2.0 includes a profiling facility that records
how much real
time is spent in each system and function call. Also
with SCTrace v2.0,
recompiling is not necessary. It allows administrators
to pinpoint
bottlenecks in complex client/server systems or in I/O
intensive
situations.<P>

SCTrace v2.0 operates on any AIX executable, regardless
of source
language, compiler, use of shared libraries, or optimization
level. No
compiling or relinking is necessary. SCTrace v2.0 for
AIX supports all
versions of AIX on RS 6000 and the Motorola PowerStack
platforms, and is
priced at $495 for one node-locked license. A one-year
maintenance
contract is priced at $75. A free 30 day trail version
of SCTrace v2.0
is available: at http://www.tkg.com/sctrace. For more
information,
contact The Kernel Group, Austin, TX; (512) 433-3322.<P>

<B>Clarity Upgrades Compatibility Server</B><P>

Clarity Software, Inc. has upgraded Clarity Compatibility
Server, its
universal file format translator that bridges the differences
in
platforms, email systems, applications, and Web-based
packages. Clarity
Compatibility Server Version 1.4 lets users attach fully
formatted
documents, spreadsheets, and images to their email for
cross-platform
distribution of files that arrive ready to review, edit,
and print.
Other features of Clarity Compatibility Server Version
1.4 include
support for bi-directional conversion of FrameMaker
5 and Word for
Windows Version 7 files, and profile management capabilities.<P>

Clarity Compatibility Server Version 1.4 provides HTML
and PDF support
so that documents from the Web, or destined for the
Web, can maintain
the formatting of the original image. The Clarity Compatibility
Server
Version 1.4 is mounted with an SMTP gateway where email
messages and
attachments are automatically intercepted. The messages
and attachments
are transformed according to the recipient's user profile,
which is
maintained in the system's Address Book. Then, when
the recipient opens
the document or image, it appears as though it was produced
on his or
her system, regardless of whether the sender used a
PC, Mac, or UNIX
workstation.<P>

Additionally, Clarity Compatibility Server Version 1.4
lets users add,
change, and delete password protected Address Book profiles,
including
individual home page URLs from the Web. A UNIX-based
SMTP mail hub is
required for operation. Clarity Compatibility Server
Version 1.4
supports the following UNIX systems: HP-UX, SunOS 4.1.3,
and Solaris
2.x. It also supports PC, UNIX, and Macintosh mail client
products.<P>

Clarity Compatibility Server Version 1.4 is priced at
$4,000 per 25
users. The system includes all required documentation
and bi-directional
converters for UNIX, PC, and Macintosh text, spreadsheet,
and graphic
formats. A remote demo is available on Clarity's Web
site at

<B>Cygnus Announces Kerb*Net</B><P>

Cygnus Support has announced Kerb*Net, a security system
for open
networked computing environments. Kerb*Net is the IETF
standard for
network security (RFC 1510) amd offers robust user authentication.
Features of Kerb*Net include customization, applicaion
integation, and
compatibility with Kerberos V4. The Kerb*Net core technology
is built on
MIT's Kerberos V5, an enterprise-wide client/server
security system
developed as part of Project Athena. There are two APIs
that can be used
to access Kerb*Net, the standard Kerberos API and the
IETF's Generic
Security Server API (GSSAPI) based on RFCs 1508, 1509,
and 1964.
Kerb*Net can be used to secure other standards-based
client/server
solutions.<P>

Kerb*Net comes with complete sourcecode and guarantees
that unauthorized
users are who they say they are without requiring the
user to type
multiple passwords. Each user and application server
has a unique
encryption key that it shares with the Kerb*Net server.
These secret
keys are based on the password of the user or applicaion
server.
Kerb*Net never sends passwords across the network. Passwords
serve as
private keys with which the data sent over the Net is
locked.<P>

Kerb*Net is available on UNIX, Macintosh, Windows 3.1,
95 and NT. For
pricing and other information about Kerb*Net, contact
Cygnus Support,
1937 Landings Dr., Mountain View, CA 94043; (800) 294-6871

data from any
continuously operating network and translates the data
into information
operators can use. With BOS, users can graphically configure
the
network, view the results, and post alarms to alert
staff to system
problems.<P>

Features of BOS 6.5 include an alarm inhibit feature
that lets the user
define and inhibit alarms for a period of time; a remote
backup
capability; BOSapl version 2, the BOS scripting language;
