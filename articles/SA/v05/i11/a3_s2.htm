<H1>Sidebar: System Default Database File Format</H1><p>
<P>
The global configuration file for Enhanced Security
on DU is
/etc/auth/system/default and defines values for users
at a system-wide
level. An administrator planning to implement Enhanced
Security must be
familiar with the values specified in this file in order
to configure
Enhanced Security appropriately for his or her system.
The following is
a default file I will use as an example of a relaxed
security
configuration. To avoid frustration in the initial implementation,
I
recommend that Enhanced Security be enabled with most
options either
loose or disabled altogether. Once you are more familiar
with Enhanced
Security, tighten down the option that makes the most
sense for your
environment.<P>
<PRE>
default:\
:d_name=default:\
:d_secclass=c2:\
:d_boot_authenticate@:\
:d_pw_expire_warning#864000:\
:d_pw_site_callout=/tcb/bin/pwpolicy:\

<p>
The default file consists of options in a single, continuous
entry that
can be broken into multiple lines with a backslash (\).
Each option is
preceded and followed by a colon (:). If the entry is
broken into
multiple lines, a colon and a backslash are required
at the end of each
line, and each continuation line must begin with a colon
and
continuation lines are indented by a tab. Options can
have numeric,
Boolean, or string values.<P>

Numeric options have the format &quot;name#num.&quot;
Boolean options have the
format &quot;name&quot; or &quot;name@,&quot; in which
the first form indicates the option
is True, and the second form indicates the option is
False. String
options have the format &quot;name=string,&quot; in
which string is zero or more
characters.<P>

At the end of the entry is the chkent field, which indicates
that the
entry is complete. This field is used as an integrity
check on the entry
by the programs that read the file.<P>

The example options have the following meanings:<P>

default: This first option is simply the header that
specifies the name
of file for this security database and is required.<P>

d_name: This option specifies the name of this security
database and
should not be changed from the string &quot;default.&quot;<P>

d_secclass: This is an informational identifier of the
security classes
supported by the system and should be be set to &quot;c2.&quot;<P>

d_boot_authenticate: This option is not currently used
by Enhanced
Security.<P>

d_pw_expire_warning: This option, in seconds, is used
to determine
whether a password expiration warning is given at login
time. If the
password expiration for a user falls within this time
interval, a
warning is given.<P>

d_pw_site_callout: This is the fullpath name of the
script to call for
site-specific security policy conformance decisions.
The
/tcb/bin/pwpolicy by default does nothing but exit with
a positive
return code. See the &quot;DEC OSF/1 Security&quot;
manual for more information on
this option.<P>

u_minchg#0: This is the minimum time between password
changes in
seconds. If the value assigned is zero (0), there is
no minimum time
enforced.<P>

u_minlen#8: This is the minimum password length.<P>

u_maxlen#12: This is the maximum password length.<P>

u_exp#0: This is the number of seconds after a successful
password
change that the account password will expire. If the
values specified is
zero (0), passwords will not expire.<P>

u_life#0: This is the lifetime of a password in seconds.
If this time
interval is reached, the account is locked and can only
be unlocked by
the superuser. Specifying zero (0) indicates an unlimited
password
lifetime.<P>

u_pickpw: This Boolean option specifies whether a user
can pick his own
password (True) or will have a password generated by
the system (False).<P>

u_genpwd@: This Boolean option is the reverse of u_pickpw;
that is, a
True value indicates that the system will generate passwords
for a user,
and a False value specifies that a user can select his
own password.<P>

u_restrict: This Boolean option specifies whether password
triviality
checks are performed on a user-selected password. A
u_restrict entry
indicates that triviality checks are preformed, including
verification
that the password is not a login or group name, a palindrome,
or a
dictionary word; a u_restrict@ entry indicates that
these checks are not
performed.<P>

u_pwdepth#0: This is the number of old encrypted passwords
to save to
prevent reuse. A value of zero (0) indicates that old
passwords can be
reused.<P>

u_nullpw@: This Boolean option controls the ability
of a user to choose
a null password. A u_nullpw entry indicates a null password
can be
chosen; a u_nullpw@ indicates that it cannot.<P>

u_genchars@: This Boolean option controls the ability
of a user to
generate random characters for a password. A u_genchars
entry indicates
that the user can generate passwords made up of random
characters, and a
u_genchars@ entry indicates that she cannot.<P>

u_genletters@: This Boolean option controls the ability
of a user to
generate random letters for a password. A u_genletters
entry indicates
that the user can generate passwords made up of random
letters, and a
u_genletters@ entry indicates that he cannot.<P>

u_maxtries#0: This is the maximum number of consecutive
unsuccessful
login attempts to an account before the account is locked.
Setting this
option to zero (0) disables the locking of accounts
due to unsuccessful
login attempts.<P>

u_lock@: This Boolean option is used to administratively
lock an
account. A u_lock entry indicates that the account is
locked; a u_lock@
entry indicates that it is not. The presence of the
u_lock@ entry in the
Default Database File is to globally indicate that all
accounts are
unlocked unless locked in the individual Protected Password
Database
Files.<P>

t_logdelay#2: This is the number of seconds between
unsuccessful login
attempts. This field is designed to slow the rate at
which login
attempts on a terminal device can occur.<P>

t_maxtries#10: This field specifies the maximum number
of consecutive
unsuccessful login attempts permitted using the terminal
before the
terminal is locked. Once the terminal is locked, it
must be unlocked by
an authorized administrator. For additional information,
see the manpage
for default(4).<P>
