<H1>Retrieving Information via Email</H1><p>
<P>
Gilbert Held<P>

<I>This article is an excerpt from Gilbert Held's forthcoming
book</I>
Mastering Internet Tools: A Survival Guide for Business
Users <I>to be
published by R&amp;D Books in April, 1996. Held provides
a concise,
no-nonsense guide to using the internet for acquiring
and providing
information. He maps out the options for network access
and explains the
search tools from Archie to Lycos to Webcrawler. He
also details the
alternatives for providing information, from ftp servers
to telnet to
web sites, and explains how to locate and use registration
services.</I><P>

There are two primary reasons why you may wish to use
email as your
information retrieval method. First, if your only access
to the Internet
is via email, you may have to use email to retrieve
files or locate
information. An email-only connection does not prevent
you from locating
and retrieving information on the Internet. A second
reason for finding
information via email is that many servers are highly
used during the
day, making it difficult, if not impossible, to initiate
Archie, Gopher,
and Veronica queries during primetime. Instead of continuously
initiating search commands, you can use email. In fact,
if you use the
facilities of an Internet access provider that bills
based upon connect
time, you may be able to significantly reduce your connect
time charges
by sending search queries via email. If you are willing
to wait an hour
or a day for a response, an email query could result
in a significant
reduction in connect time charges.<P>

I will describe how to use email to initiate searches
using several
different search tools.<P>

<B>Archie by Email</B><P>


To use Archie by email, simply send an email message
to an the
appropriate Archie server using the general address
shown below:<P>
<PRE>
archie@server-address</pre><p>
<p>
The server address would be one of the addresses listed
in Table 1.
Thus, to use the Archie server at the University of
Nebraska at Lincoln
you would send the email message to:<P>
<PRE>
archie@archie.unl.edu</pre><p>
<p>
If you place the word help in the subject of your message,
the Archie
server will send you an email message with detailed
information on using
Archie by email. When sending a search command via email,
leave the
subject field blank and place the search command on
the first line of
the body of the message. Thus, to search for anonymous
ftp servers that
have directory or file names that include the word clinton,
insert
either of the following lines in your email message:<P>
<PRE>
find clinton
prog clinton</pre><p>
<p>
<B>Subject Field Considerations</B><P>

Some email systems, such as CompuServe, require an entry
in the subject
field or the message will not be sent. If you are using
one of these
email systems, when the Archie instructions indicate
that the subject
field is to be blank, repeat the first command in the
body of the
message in the subject field.<P>

<B>Search Criteria Considerations</B><P>

Some Archie servers use default substitute search criteria.
Thus, if you
have instructions from one server, those instructions
may not be fully
applicable when accessing another server. For example,
if you want to
locate directories and files that contain clinton anywhere
in their
names, you would first use the set command to set the
search method to
substitute. To do so, enter the following command in
the body of your
email message:<P>
<PRE>
set search sub</pre><p>
<p>
Then, use either the find or the prog command for the
search. Thus, the
body of your email message would become:<P>
<PRE>
set search sub
find clinton</pre><p>
<p>
<B>Limiting Queries</B><P>


Depending upon your Internet access provider, you may
be billed for
email based upon the number of characters in each message
sent or
received. If this is the case, you may wish to consider
limiting the
results of Archie queries. To do so, enter the command
set maxhits n,
replacing n with a numeric value under 100, since the
default setting of
Archie is to limit output to 100 matches. For example,
to limit the
number of matches to 10, you would enter the following
command in the
body of your email message:<P>
<PRE>
set maxhits 10</pre><p>
<p>
If your query is successful, the Archie server will
send you the names
and IP addresses of sites where the desired file is
located as well as
the directory structure where the file resides. Unfortunately,
you
cannot send email directly to the newly-found ftp site
to retrieve the
desired file. Instead, you must invoke the services
of an ftp by mail
server.<P>

<B>ftp by Mail Server</B><P>

An ftp by mail server is an Internet server that converts
email file
transfer requests to ftp connection requests. Thus,
an ftp by mail
server will use the commands you send within an email
message to
establish an ftp session with the anonymous ftp site
from which you want
to retrieve a file. Once the connection is opened, the
server will use
the commands following the open command (used to establish
the
connection) to perform the ftp operations you specify.<P>

Table 2 lists 11 common ftp commands you can incorporate
within an email
message to perform file transfer via email. You must
address your
message to one of the handful of ftp by mail sites.
Five of the more
common ftp by mail server addresses are listed in Table
3.<P>

<B>Operation</B><P>

Assume you have discovered through an Archie search
that the file
inhale.dmb is located under the directory political
on the anonymous
file server whose address is ftp.washington-jokes.edu.
(This anonymous
ftp location exists only in the imagination of the author.)
To retrieve
the desired file, send an email message to one of the
five sites listed
in Table 3. In the body of the message, include the
following lines:<P>
<PRE>
open washington-jokes.edu
cd political
get inhale.dmb
quit</pre><p>
<p>
The preceding example assumes that the file inhale.dmb
is an ASCII file.
If you want to retrieve a binary file, such as an executable
program or
a compressed file, you must insert the binary command
in your message
prior to the get command.<P>

<B>Exploring ftp Sites</B><P>

There are several way to explore ftp sites via email.
First, you can
send a query to an Archie server using the sites command.
This will
result in the server returning a complete list of the
sites it has
tracked. Then, if the name of a particular anonymous
ftp  site strikes
your fancy, you can send a series of email messages
to explore the
contents of the site. For example, you might wish to
obtain a list of
files and subdirectories under the root directory of
a particular
anonymous ftp  site. To do so, you would include the
following three
commands in the body of your email message:<P>
<PRE>
open &lt;sitename&gt;
dir
quit</pre><p>
<p>
Depending on the response, you can then construct additional
email
messages to either view the contents of specific subdirectories
or
retrieve one or more files.<P>

An alternative method you can use to obtain a list of
ftp sites is to
send an email message to mail-server@rftm.mit.edu. The
body of the
message should include up to eight lines, each line
with the following
format (with n varying from 1 to 8):<P>
<PRE>
send usenet/news.answers/ ftp-list/sitelist/part n</pre><p>
<p>

As a result of this message you will receive eight files
by email.
Collectively, those eight files comprise the anonymous
ftp  site list,
which you can print out or store for future reference.<P>

Occasionally, when requesting files via an ftp by mail
server, you may
obtain a file whose contents include one line with the
word begin
followed by a number and filename, followed by subsequent
lines of 61
characters that appear to be gibberish. This is a file
that was
uuencoded by the sender. To successfully decode this
file, you must
obtain a copy of the uudecode program for the operating
system of the
computer you are using.<P>

<B>Gopher and Veronica by Email</B><P>

You can use email to perform most Gopher and Veronica
queries, although
you will not have the full range of capabilities available
through a
Gopher client or telnet. Not all Gopher sites accept
queries by email.
Table 4 lists two Gopher sites accessible via electronic
mail.<P>

<B>Initiating a Gopher Search</B><P>

To initiate a Gopher search by mail, leave the subject
field blank and
place help in the body of the message, sending the message
to one of the
sites listed in Table 4. The Gopher site will respond
to your email
message by sending you its root menu, similar to the
menu in Figure 1.
You would then use a word processor or the text editor
of your email

reader to select an item in the Gopher menu by placing
an x to the left
of the item you wish to examine. Next, you would send
the entire text of
the received message back to the appropriate server
via a second
electronic mail message. This action would result in
the Gopher server
sending you the next level of its menu by email. Some
menus items result
in other menus, and other items result in telnet sessions,
text files,
image files, or searches of GopherSpace.<P>

You cannot initiate a telnet session via electronic
mail, but you can
retrieve a file or initiate a search by placing an x
next to the
appropriate menu item and sending the message back to
the server via
email. If you select a search, the server will send
you a response
prompting you to supply the search keyword(s) in the
Subject field of
your next reply. Your search entry can consist of a
single word or words
linked with boolean operators such as AND, OR, and NOT.
The results of
your search will be returned to you as another Gopher
menu, requiring
you to return that menu and any routing information
following it each
time you respond to the Gopher mail server, again marking
your selection
with an x and specifying search words, if appropriate,
in the subject
field of the email message.<P>

Although the process I have just described can appear,
and indeed will
be, tedious for your initial search, once you have worked
your way to a
relevant Gopher menu, you can reuse any previously transmitted
mail
message, simply changing your selection to satisfy a
different
requirement. This applies to all Gopher by mail searches,
including
Veronica keyword searches as well as wide area information
service
(WAIS) searches.<P>

<B>Initiating a Veronica Search</B><P>

A Veronica search by mail begins with accessing Gopher
by mail. That is,
you would first retrieve the root menu from gopher.unm.edu
or
gopher@earn.net as previously described. You would then
select the item
&quot;Other Gopher and Information Servers,&quot; which
would result in the server
returning an email message containing a list of Veronica
servers. You
would then select a Veronica server and enter the search
keyword(s) in
the Subject field of your reply.<P>

Although a Veronica search via email may require you
to exchange a
series of electronic mail messages with a Gopher server,
an email
Veronica query is quite often quicker than a Veronica
query via a Gopher
client. Veronica servers are some of the most heavily
accessed locations
on the Internet. If you are accessing Veronica through
a Gopher client,
you may encounter the message &quot;server busy  try
again later&quot; repeatedly
throughout the day. Since the Gopher email facility
is often
underutilized, an email Veronica query may save you
time. A successful
Veronica by mail query results in a list of site locations
where the
information you seek resides. You can then use telnet,
ftp, or another
Internet application to access the desired information.<P>

<B>WAIS by Email</B><P>

A WAIS search via email is similar to a Veronica search.
The menu entry
&quot;Other Gopher and Information Servers&quot; will
return a menu with the entry
&quot;WAIS Based Information&quot; (see Figure 2). Selecting
that entry and
returning it via email to the mother Gopher will result
in the return of
a new menu. The new menu will enable you to select a
list of all WAIS
databases sorted either by letter or by subject. As
in other Gopher by
mail searches, you can reuse any previously received
or sent email
message, either as is or by selecting a new item. Thus,
if your access
to Gopher is via email, you may wish to consider developing
a library of
standard Gopher by email responses that you can use
for future queries.<P>

<B>Conclusion</B><P>

An email-only connection does not preclude you from
using the Internet's
important retrieval and search tools. You can search
for information
with Archie, Gopher, and Veronica and retrieve files
via ftp through
email. In some cases, even if you have a full Internet
connection, you
may find that you can save time and money accessing
Internet
applications by mail.<P>
