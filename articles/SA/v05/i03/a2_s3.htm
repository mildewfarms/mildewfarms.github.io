<H1>Sidebar: SNA and OSI Compared</H1><p>
<P>
A basic concept underlying any network design is the
division of network
functions into specific functional layers. Together
these layers form
what is known as a &quot;network stack&quot; and comprise
a model by which all
network functions operate. The Open Systems Interconnect
(OSI) model is
just such a model and contains definitions for interconnecting
what
might otherwise be incompatible systems. Systems Network
Architecture
(SNA), on the other hand, is a proprietary network model
designed to
allow IBM to optimize their hardware (controllers, printers,
terminals,
etc.) for large transaction-oriented networks. Although
SNA is less
concerned about multivendor interconnectivity than OSI,
it still
partitions the network functionality into multiple layers
and protocols.
Figure 1 shows both network stacks in a side by side
comparison.<P>

In an abstract sense, the layers in these two network
models are quite
similar -- even though in a practical sense they are
totally
incompatible. The following discusses the similarities
between layers
from an SNA point of view.<P>

Layer 1, the physical layer, actually connects the device
to the network
cable, or medium (see the sidebar &quot;The Physical
Layer  OSI vs. SNA&quot; for
more details). The physical layer has no explicit counterpart
in the SNA
model. It is assumed to be defined &quot;outside the
model.&quot;<P>

Layer 2, the data link layer, exists in both OSI and
SNA and is
responsible for providing reliable transmission of data.
<P>

Layer 3, the network layer, exists in both but is referred
to as path
control in SNA. This layer refers to the &quot;virtual
connection&quot; that
exists between two machines. The actual connection between
two machines
may be through many physical connections but the bottom
line is one
&quot;virtual connection,&quot; from point A or point
B. On the OSI side, parts of
this layer are typically implemented using the IP (or
Internet
Protocol).  Layer 4, the transport layer, is referred
to as transmission
control in SNA. In this layer, SNA monitors the service
quality of the
lower three layers. This is very similar to the functions
in the OSI
model for this layer. On the OSI side, this layer is
often implemented
using TCP (or Transmission Control Protocol). <P>

Layer 5, the session layer, is referred to as data flow
control in SNA
and has primarily the same purpose: overall data flow
integrity.<P>

Layer 6, the presentation layer, and Layer 7, the application
layer, are
actually combined into what is called function management
in SNA. 
Except for UNIX network applications, which use a display
manager such
as X for presentation services, the functions in these
two layers will
be the application's responsibility. <P>
