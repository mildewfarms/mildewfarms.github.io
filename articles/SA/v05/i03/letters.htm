Subject: comment on Jul/Aug issue<br>
Date: Fri Jul 15 20:56:51 1994<P>

Emmett Dulaney's &quot;When Inodes Go Bad&quot; did
a good job of covering typical
filesystem problems, but I fear it may cause needless
worry by not
qualifying the very first fsck message: &quot;POSSIBLE
FILE SIZE ERROR.&quot; I
get one of these every time I boot my machine, but have
learned to
ignore it. Sometimes this message can safely be ignored,
because
&quot;POSSIBLE&quot; is there for a reason.<P>

Some databases -- including some created by UNIX system
administration
utilities -- create big files with &quot;holes&quot;
in them. If more than 1 block
of a file is never initialized, it need not have a disk
block assigned
to it. Then the number of blocks assigned to the file
can be less --
often much less! -- than the length of the file that's
declared in its
inode. This is perhaps the commonest cause of this apparently
alarming
message.<P>

The proper course of action is to use ncheck -i to identify
the file. If
it's one of those likely to contain holes, don't worry;
the filesystem
is really OK. For further details, see the discussion
on pp.187-188 of
Thomas &amp; Farrow's UNIX Administration Guide for
System V.<P>

<I>Thanks for the reference. I'm not certain this should
put anyone at
ease, but I don't think I've ever identified a &quot;real&quot;
problem related to
&quot;POSSIBLE FILE SIZE ERROR.&quot; I do, however,
remember being very concerned
about these messages when we first started using UNIX.<P>

Maybe your letter can bring a little peace of mind to
other beginning
admins who are encountering this message<P>

Subject: Article in Sys Admin<P>

Just read your article in SysAdmin (Using Linux as a
Router, Jan.,
1996), and I was wondering which ISDN TA you were using,
as it wasn't
mentioned in the article.<P>

BTW, thanks for writing the article, as that and the
other one on Linux
were what convinced me to buy this issue.<P>

Looking forward to hearing from you,<br>

We used an ADTRAN ISU 2x64 terminal adaptor.  I have
also used a
Motorola  BitSurfr in a PPP application, which has also
worked out well.<P>

Cheers!<br>

Thanks for the timely article on using Linux as a router!
I was just 
wondering if you could take the time to answer a couple
of questions 
about the software you used. <P>

1) What version of the Linux kernel are you using? 2)
Where did you get
gated? As far as I can tell it is not included  with
Slackware 2.3. I
have found the source at Merit but was  wondering if
you had located a
precompiled version for Linux. TIA!<P>

<I>Andrew,<br>

We're using Linux 1.2.0.  The &quot;latest and greatest&quot;
version at this 
writing is 1.2.8, and is achievable by patching your
source code.  I 
haven't done this to our kernel, because I don't know
of a reason to do
so.<P>

An &quot;as-is&quot; version of the gated executable
&amp; config files is available
in:</I><P>
<PRE>
ftp://moria.co.chatham.ga.us/pub/gated.bin.tar.z</pre><p>
<p>
<I>If you want source obtained from Cornell, get it from
Cornell, or:</I><P>
<PRE>
ftp://moria.co.chatham.ga.us/pub/gated.R3_0_3.tar.Z</pre><p>
<p>
<I>Be warned that the most recent versions of gated (which
the above is
not)  will require IP Multicasting to be enabled in
your kernel.<P>

Cheers,<br>

Jonathan</I><P>
