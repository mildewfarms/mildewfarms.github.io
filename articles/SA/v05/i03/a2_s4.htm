<H1>Sidebar: The Physical Layer -- OSI vs. SNA</H1><p>
<P>
The first layer in the OSI model is the physical layer,
which
encompasses a transmission medium, a signaling method
or transmission
technique, a topology, and the interface hardware. This
layer is
responsible for the actual transmission of data bits
across some
transmission medium.  The transmission medium is the
physical resource
responsible for carrying the electrical (or other physical)
signal and
could consist of copper, fiber optics, or a radio signal.<P>

The transmission technique refers to the electrical
signals themselves.
If the electrical signals are purely digital, that is,
1s and 0s, the
transmission technique is said to be baseband. If the
electrical signals
are modulated onto some other carrier signal, such as
when using a
modem, the transmission technique is said to be broadband.<P>

The topology describes the physical layout, or pattern,
of the cable in
the building or facility. This could be a star, ring,
or linear pattern.<P>

The final component in the physical layer, the network
interface
circuitry, connects the network station to the network
media. Typically
this circuitry is packed onto a single card called the
network interface
card (NIC). In a typical UNIX or open systems network,
the transmission
would be copper wire, probably in the form of ThinNet
coaxial cable.
ThinNet networks use a baseband transmission technique
over a linear
topology. The typical NIC would be an Ethernet card,
such as a 3Com
3C509 card.<P>

Although both architectures have a physical layer component
(it's
defined below the stack in SNA, but it still exists),
this component is
quite different. IBM mainframes use channel cables to
connect each SNA
device onto the network. These channel cables are actually
a parallel
(multiwire) interconnection consisting of bus and tag
lines. Simply put,
the tag line controls the data that flows on the bus
line. Signaling on
these cables is not compatible with the signaling used
in Ethernet.
Devices are connected in a star pattern, and each point
on the star can
contain daisy-chained devices.<P>

To physically connect an IBM mainframe to Ethernet cabling,
a special
box is required that accepts both types of cabling.
This box then
provides the necessary datastream conversions to couple
the two systems.<P>
