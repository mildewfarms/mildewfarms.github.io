<H1>Editor's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
If you read my last editorial, you know that I'm presently
winding my
way across the western half of the United States in
a less-than-new
motor home. I reached my main goal  the Usenix Technical
Conference in
San Diego -- last week with no major difficulties. I
went primarily for
the tutorials, and as always, Usenix put together an
excellent
educational program.<P>

As I write this (in a Phoenix Wal-Mart parking lot),
I'm about two days
travel out of San Diego. Of course, the Arizona weather
is great (at
least compared to what I hear Kansas is experiencing),
but telecommuting
from a motor home hasn't really caught up with mainstream
practice --
possibly because there's no real demand. I don't think
very many motor
home travelers bother to telecommute -- from what I've
seen on this trip,
they're mostly retired!<P>

My most frustrating days, however, weren't in the motor
home, but in a
San Diego hotel. I took a room for the conference, but
wasn't able to
get a connection through the room phone, despite the
fact it had a
clearly labeled &quot;modem&quot; port. After four days
of trying (and two
different modems), I finally had the hotel replace the
phone in my room.
With the new phone, I managed three or four successful,
but s..l..o..w
sessions. I'll probably have to beg at some truck stop
to use a local
phone to submit this editorial. If nothing else, I can
always resort to
dictating over the phone -- even at a pay phone, you
can still use that
technology.<P>

So...do I really believe the IBM commercial where a
woman uses her
notebook to pull down a map in the middle of the rain
forest? What do
you think?<P>

With this issue, we welcome Amber Ankerholz as Sys Admin's
managing
editor. Amber comes to us by way of a local scientific
publisher. With
my communications as unreliable as they have been, I've
appreciated her
unflappability. If you're thinking about writing for
us, give Amber a
call. I think you'll find her pleasant to work with.<P>

This issue also marks the introduction of a new Career
Opportunities
section. If you are considering changing jobs or are
looking for new
talent, check out this new section, beginning on page
72.<P>

Finally, I want to thank Martha Masinton for all her
work on Sys Admin.
I know Martha (who is also a department manager and
managing editor of
another of our magazines) is glad to hand off some of
her workload to
Amber, but I also know that Sys Admin has been special
to her and that
she'll miss working with it. Martha shepherded Sys Admin
during the days
when I was consumed with CEO responsibilities, and I
think she did an
excellent job. Amber and I will have to get serious
if we're to do as
well.<P>

Thank you, Martha. I and your other Sys Admin friends
will just have to
find some other excuse to talk to you.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Robert Ward<P>
