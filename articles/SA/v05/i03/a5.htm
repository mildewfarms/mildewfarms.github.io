<B>A New Salary Survey for System Administrators</B><P>

The results of the second SANS Annual System Administration
Salary
Survey will be published at the conference. However,
I have obtained a
preview and can give you some of the highlights.<P>

During the past 18 months, the value of effective system
administration
has become better understood, as corporations have started
to run their
entire businesses on UNIX platforms and develop important
marketing
programs based on the World Wide Web. UNIX's growing
popularity, both as
an alternative to proprietary systems such as IBM mainframes
and Digital
VAX computers, and as the operating system of choice
for the Web, has
led to unprecedented demand for system administrators.
Average salaries
have jumped more than 9 percent in the past 12 months
alone.<P>

The survey includes data from 746 system administrators.
These
administrators work in the government, in universities,
and in large and
small industrial organizations throughout all parts
of the United States
and around the world. They are supervisors as well as
staff members,
with different levels of experience, from a few months
to two decades,
and they support large and small user bases.<P>

Some of the highlights of the survey are:<P>

<li>Salaries for system administrators and security professionals
climbed 9
percent from 1994 to 1995. The average salary reported
by system
administrators was $50,127 in 1995 and $46,009 in 1994.<P>

<li>System administrators in the $60,000 to $90,000 salary
range received
raises that were higher (on both a percentage and a
dollar basis) than
the raises received by lower paid system administrators
and security
personnel.<P>

<li>Commercial organizations paid salaries that were higher
than those paid
by government and research organizations, and much
higher than those paid in universities.<P>

<li>In the first five years of employment, system administrators
and
security professionals gain increases of approximately
$3,000 per year.
Later, the increases drop to an average of $2,000 per
year.<P>

<li>Californians and New Yorkers again led the salary race,
and the
southwestern United States moved up in the rankings.
Europe, Canada,
Australia, and the Mideast lagged in salary ratings.<P>

<li>Eighty-six percent of system administrators manage more
than one
type of UNIX system, and there is a substantial pay
benefit for those
who manage more types.<P>

<li>System administrators who manage AIX, SGI, Sun-OS, Solaris,
and HP-UX
systems reported earning higher salaries than those
who manage AT&amp;T CIS,
SCO, Univel, Data General, OSF-1, or Ultrix systems.<P>

<li>There is a gender pay gap. It is smallest in universities
and for
administrators with bachelors' degrees, and is highest
in commercial and
research and development organizations.<P>

<li>There is very little pay difference between administrators
with only a
high school degree, those with some college education,
and those with a
college degree. In fact, those with only a high school
education are
paid more, on average, than the other two categories.
Somewhat
surprisingly, system administrators with PhDs don't
get paid, on
average, as much as those with no college education
at all.<P>

<B>Summary Tables</B><P>

1. How much are system administrators and security professionals
paid
(see Table 1)?<P>

The majority (almost 70 percent) of all system administrators
earn
between $30,000 and $60,000. The top quarter are paid
an average of more
than $71,000. When the results of this survey are compared
with surveys
of other information systems professionals, system administrators
earn
more than telecommunications specialists, LAN managers,
network
administrators, technical support specialists, help
desk managers, and
system programmers.<P>

2. How rapidly are salaries increasing from year to
year (see Table 2)?<P>

Salaries for the surveyed population increased by 9.8
percent, on
average, from 1994 to 1995. This is a big jump from
the 5.5 percent
average increase reported by the surveyed population
for 1993 to 1994.
It reflects the growing awareness of the value of system
administration,
especially in banks and financial companies. The highest
rates of
increase, which far exceed the average increase, are
in the higher
income brackets. In my opinion, employers -- especially
commercial
employers -- seem willing to offer substantial increases
to retain their
senior system administrators, because they recognize
how difficult and
expensive it will be to replace senior people.<P>

The details of this survey will be presented at the
SANS conference in
May, but in the meantime, you may be able to put this
data to good use.<P>

<B>New Release of bind</B><P>

Paul Vixie has released the final version of the bind
name server after
completion of more than a year of intensive beta testing.
This version
of bind has many improvements for performance, reliability,
and
security. If you are running an older version of the
bind name server,
you might want to check this one out:<P>
<PRE>

or<P>

<p>

<B>Tool of the Month</B><P>

This month's tool is tcpdump, a program that provides
the system
administrator with information about traffic on the
network. It is a
fantastic tool when you want to see what kind of packets
move across
your network. It has been useful to me, in diagnosing
network problems,
such as a network card that could receive but not send,
or a bad routing
table that resulted in packets to certain networks being
sent out on the
wrong interface in a multihomed machine.<P>

tcpdump prints out the headers of packets on a network
interface (but
not the packet content). The program has filtering capabilities,
making
it possible to look only for the type of packets you
are interested in
at any given time. Some examples of such commands:<P>

To print all packets arriving at or departing from heimdal:<P>
<PRE>
tcpdump host heimdal</pre><p>
<p>
To print traffic between heimdal and either baldr or
thor:<P>
<PRE>
tcpdump host heimdal and
\( baldr or thor \)</pre><p>
<p>
To print all IP packets between baldr and any host except
heimdal:<P>
<PRE>
tcpdump ip host baldr and not baldr</pre><p>
<p>
tcpdump uses the pcap library, a system-independent
interface for
user-level packet capture. Before building tcpdump,
you must first
retrieve and build libpcap.<P>

tcpdump and libpcap have been built and tested under
SGI Irix 4.x and
5.2, SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.3, BSD/OS, DEC/OSF v1.3 v2.0,
and Ultrix 4.x,
and may still work for SunOS 3.5, and 4.3BSD Reno/Tahoe
(although the
authors of the program no longer support these old operating
systems).<P>

The program is loosely based on SMI's &quot;etherfind,&quot;
although none of the
etherfind code remains. It was originally written by
Van Jacobson as
part of an ongoing research project to investigate and
improve TCP and
Internet gateway performance. The parts of the program
originally taken
from Sun's etherfind were later rewritten by Steven
McCanne of LBL. To
ensure that there would be no vestige of proprietary
code in tcpdump,
Steve wrote these pieces from the specification given
by the manual
entry, with no access to the source of tcpdump or etherfind.<P>

The source for libpcap is available from:<P>
<PRE>
ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.*</pre><p>
<p>
or<P>
<PRE>
ftp://ftp.sysadmin.com/pub/admin/tools/networking/libpcap</pre><p>
<p>
The source for tcpdump is available from:<P>
<PRE>
ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump.*</pre><p>
<p>
or<P>
<PRE>
ftp://ftp.sysadmin.com/pub/admin/tools/networking/tcpdump</pre><p>
<p>
Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, etc.
should be sent
to tcpdump@ee.lbl.gov.<P>

And now to this month's question:<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I was wondering if you have heard of RCS (Revision
Control System). I'm
looking for an ftp site that has a copy of it. Currently
we are using
SCCS, but SCCS has a problem with checking a file in
the library that
includes a long line, such as a long select statement
in an SQL report file. 
If you know of such a site, please
let me know ...
or what would you recommend?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 RCS is certainly a better choice than SCCS (Source
Code Control
System), as it is a much more modern implementation.
Aside from the
problem that you mentioned, SCCS is a much older system
and uses a less
efficient way of storing the differences (they are stored
as a sequence
of edit commands, called deltas) than what is implemented
in RCS (for
details, see Walter F. Tichy's paper &quot;RCS-A System
for Version Control,&quot;
which is included in the source for RCS).<P>

You can get RCS from:<P>
<PRE>
ftp://ftp.cs.purdue.edu/pub/RCS</pre><p>
<p>
or <P>

<PRE>
ftp://ftp.sysadmin/pub/admin/tools/hosts/rcs</pre><p>
<p>
There is also a front-end available for RCS, called
CVS (Concurrent
Version System), which extends the notion of revision
control from a
collection of files in a single directory to a hierarchical
collection
of directories consisting of revision controlled files.
CVS has a number
of advantages over RCS. For example, programmers are
able to check out
what they need from the master repository and independently
make changes
to the files before checking them back in. If two or
more people check
out the same file, CVS can, in most cases, resolve the
differences
between the various versions of the file, ensuring that
all changes are
checked in correctly. If CVS cannot resolve the changes
correctly, it
will prompt for assistance from the person checking
in the changes.
Note, however, that CVS requires RCS.<P>

You can get CVS from:<P>
