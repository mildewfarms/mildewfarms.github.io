<H1>Sidebar: HTML</H1><p>
<P>
World Wide Web pages are written in a special language
called  HTML.
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is intended
for the
formatting (marking up) of text on an output device.
In the case of the
WWW, this output  device is your favorite web browser.<P>

The HTML language is based on special &quot;tags,&quot;
which are mixed with
normal text. These  tags are commands to the output
device to format the
tagged text in a special way. For  instance, the tagged
text may be
printed in bold, or converted into a list of items.
HTML is very similar
to its ancestor, SGML, but, HTML also has Hypertext
capabilities. This
means that the text  may contain references (links)
to other HTML
documents (web pages) or other parts of  the current
document. By mixing
these links with normal text, a web page gets its &quot;webby&quot;
features, that
is, being linked to other pages which themselves are
also linked, and so
forth (thus the name &quot;web&quot;).<P>

HTML has been standardized so that different browsers
are still able to
process  the different web pages. In good Internet tradition,
this
standard has been recorded in a draft and can be freely
obtained from a
number of sources on the Net. The home base for this
information is the
WWW consortium, which you can reach at the following
address (just point
your browser and follow the links):<P>
<PRE>
http://www.w3.org</pre><p>
<p>
When you visit this site, you will notice that a number
of versions of
the HTML standard are available. The most widespread
is version 2.0, but
the newest version, 3.0, is emerging quickly. The main
difference
between the versions lies in the number of tags  supported
and the way
in which you can construct a page.<P>

Netscape deserves some special attention in this respect.
Due to its
market share, Netscape (sometimes referred to as &quot;Mozilla&quot;)
was able to
set its own standard based on HTML 2.0. However, the
Netscape
implementation has some extras, such as table-formatting
tags. Most of
these extras have now been incorporated in the new HTML
standard,
version 3.0.<P>
