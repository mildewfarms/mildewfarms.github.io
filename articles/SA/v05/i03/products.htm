<B>Innosoft's PMDF Provides Email Integration for UNIX</B><P>

Innosoft International, Inc. has announced two UNIX
versions of its
&quot;Internet-style&quot; email solution: PMDF for
Digital UNIX and PMDF e-Mail
Interconnect for Solaris. PMDF replaces Solaris' sendmail
transfer agent
(MTA) with a commercially supported, SMTP/MIME-based
or Internet-style
MTA. PMDF for Solaris will serve as the integration
engine that drives a
comprehensive, modular email software system capable
of interconnecting
multiple, disparate email systems. With PMDF, sites
can integrate with a
range of other email systems, including cc:Mail, Microsoft
Mail, Novell
GroupWise, any Novell-based MHS-based mailer, X.400
networks,
alphanumeric pagers, and more. PMDF also provides users
with POP and
IMAP servers, a Pine user agent, and support for other
user agents and
applications that work with sendmail.<P>

PMDF provides support for both PC and Macintosh users,
thanks to the
Pine user agent that is included as part of PMDF-MTA
(the core of the
PMDF system that can function as the backbone of a messaging
implementation). Every customer implementation of the
PMDF e-Mail
Interconnect product set is centered on PMDF-MTA, the
core electronic
mail system, available for OpenVMS or Digital UNIX,
with Solaris
available early in 1996. Each site runs at least one
PMDF-MTA system to
serve as the email integration engine -- a backbone,
store-and-forward,
distribution and routing system, capable of interconnecting
with a wide
range of networks, protocols, and messaging environments.
The core
product comes with directory coordination tools that
can be used to
update addresses in multiple directories including LAN-based
mail
systems, Digital's DDS, or a centralized X.500 directory.
PMDF-MTA also
includes MIME-compliant user agents. There are two on
OpenVMS: PMDF
MAIL, an extension of VMS Mail but with MIME support;
and PMDF Pine, a
menu-driven user agent based upon a popular UNIX and
DOS application.
PMDF Pine is also available as part of PMDF-MTA for
Digital UNIX. PMDF
Access extends the functionality of PMDF-MTA by making
its services
available to systems clustered or networked with a machine
running
PMDF-MTA. PMDF-LAN supports direct channels to Lotus
cc:Mail, Microsoft
Mail, Novell's GroupWise, and Novell MHS-based mailers.<P>

<B>Morning Star's SecureConnect Software Addresses Internet Security</B><P>

Morning Star Technologies, Inc. has announced SecureConnect
for UNIX,
providing protection for UNIX system users connecting
to wide area
networks. SecureConnect for UNIX combines Morning Star's
Internet
standard point-to-point (PPP) software with its advanced
dynamic
firewall packet filtering and virtual private networking
technology.
Morning Star's advanced dynamic firewall packet filtering
technology
adapts its structure during execution to open, time,
and lock the port
needed for a given transaction. With dynamic packet
filtering, the
firewall is only open to the applications and services
specified by a
security policy; other access is prohibited. SecureConnect
for UNIX's
encryption feature enables organizations to safely use
the Internet and
allows users to create a virtual private network (VPN).
Encrypting data
with Data Encryption Standard (DES), SecureConnect's
VPN uses
destination specific keys to hide the content and true
source/destination of sensitive data.<P>

SecureConnect maintains local logs and remote redundant
logs protected
by encryption. These logs provide 24-hour monitoring
for access
attempts, probes, and spoofs. Morning Star also provides
a GUI for
administering and building security policies and for
configuring
firewalls. SecureConnect for UNIX is being shipped and
expands Morning
Star's SecureConnect product line of firewall routers,
authentication
servers, and encryption capabilities.<P>
