<H1>Sidebar: Tradeoffs</H1><p>
<P>
I have tried several other variations of this setup,
including the one I
would prefer, that of /bin/passwd doing all the prompting
and the
/etc/passwdd program being utterly unprivileged.<P>

In my opinion, that would be the right way. Alas, it
would require the
/etc/passwdd program to set itself to the proper uid
and gid of the
user, something which should be universally possible,
but isn't. So, I
traded simplicity for greater portability.<P>

There is also a definite tradeoff in having /bin/passwd
run as root with
the username passed to it as a parameter. In some vendor's
systems, this
enables a &quot;special deal&quot; intended for the
root user: the checks against
using a bad password are turned off. Needless to say,
this is bad.
However, one of the common UNIX conventions is never
to do more than you
have to. (See The UNIX Programming Environment by B.
W. Kernighan and R.
Pike, Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1984 for this and other bits
of UNIX
folklore.) As /etc/passwdd executes whatever is found
at /bin/passwd,
you can install a better /bin/passwd to enforce whatever
policy you
prefer, without any effect on the rest of the programs.<P>

The last requirement is that your system will allow
rlogin to
unpassworded accounts, something that has been disabled
in a few
versions of UNIX. I haven't made any tradeoffs here:
I simply don't use
those machines as password servers; they're fine as
clients.<P>
