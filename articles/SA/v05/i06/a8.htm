and necessary
as I did. <P>

<B><I>The Internet &amp; World Wide Web 
The Rough Guide </I><br>
by Angus J. Kennedy <br>
Rough Guides Ltd. <br>
Distributed by Penguin Books <br>
ISBN 1-85828-198-9 <br>
$8.00 </B><P>

This little book (4&quot; x 5 1/2&quot;) is easily dwarfed
by the larger
introductory Internet guides. However, its content demonstrates
a
diverse  assortment of topics. Kennedy separates the
text into four
sections: Basics, The Guide, Contexts, and Directories.
Basics
introduces the  reader to the topic of cyberspace and
how to access the
Internet, whether through a provider or online services.
Here the author
explains  electronic mail, mailing lists, file transfer
protocol (FTP),
Usenet, the World Wide Web, and Internet Relay Chat
(IRC). He also
addresses  some unexpected, but appreciated topics:
TCP/IP, Trumpet
Winsock, Building Your Own Home Page, and file types
and extensions. The
second section, The Guide, displays representative
directories for the
World Wide Web (WWW), Usenet newsgroups, and software
files  available
on the Internet. Contexts includes a brief Internet
history, Net
Language, a Glossary, and Further Reading. The final
section, 
Directories, lists various Cybercafe locations and Internet
Service
Providers. <P>

This is a remarkable book that addresses every important
aspect of the
Internet to some degree. Kennedy's approach to the various
topics is
logical, readable, and precise. He furnishes the reader
with more than
the minimum amount of information regarding the subject,
but does not
overwhelm his audience. It is an excellent quick reference
and handy
pocket guide to the Internet. <P>

<B><I>The Downloader's Companion for Windows 95 </I>
by Scott Meyers, Catherine Pinch, and Chris Sells <br>
Prentice Hall <br>
ISBN 0-13-520024-5 <br>
$21.95 <br>
Diskettes included </B><P>

The first edition of this book (The Downloader's Companion
for Windows
by Scott Meyers and Catherine Pinch; Prentice  Hall;
ISBN 0-13-342254-2,
$19.95) featured a novel idea: explain downloading and
compression to
the casual computer user.  Additionally, the authors
included popular
shareware and freeware products and demonstrated how
to install,
register, and use them. The  book (a portable 8&quot;
x 4 1/2&quot;) carefully
described downloading, compression, encoding, decoding,
and multimedia
files. With the changes  in Windows 95, these procedures
were also
modified. Therefore, the revised edition addresses the
previous
guidelines and specifically  updates them for Windows
95 users. As a
result, the newer edition is a few pages longer, provides
two diskettes
in place of one, and was  written by three authors,
not two. Readers of
the original book will recognize the words of Meyers
and Pinch; Chris
Sells and the Windows  95 additions enhance the already
excellent text.
The second diskette contains sample files for the reader
to use with the
programs on the  first disk. In this way, the reader
can try to decode,
uncompress, or unzip a file without searching for files
that are already
uuencoded,  compressed, or zipped. <P>

The Downloader's Companion for Windows 95 remains a
superb reference for
any online user. Meyers, Pinch, and Sells  not only
discuss the varied
file formats available, but also provide utilities,
sample files, and
extension listings and their respective  meanings. Every
user will
appreciate this outstanding resource. <P>

<B><I>Finding It on the Internet </I><br>
Second Edition <br>
by Paul Gilster <br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. <br>
ISBN 0-471-12695-0 <br>
$24.95 </B><P>

Several basic types of Internet books currently fill
the computer
sections of bookstores: directories, technical how-to
books (how to 
install servers, create home pages, etc.), elementary
Internet books,
and more advanced Internet resource books. Gilster's
Finding It  on the
Internet describes both simple and complex ideas in
an intelligent
style. The author does not attempt to list service providers
or assist
the reader in selecting the best type of connection.
He begins with the
premise that the reader has access to some type of
connection and
demonstrates the most productive way to use it. The
second edition
slightly rearranged the topics (the World Wide Web
had been covered in
Chapter 6, but has moved to Chapter 2 and archie logically
follows
gopher and veronica). Gilster also  expanded the first
edition to
reflect the changes in the Internet itself. <P>

Finding It on the Internet is a specialized book concerning
a single
topic: searching. Gilster discusses the various tools
available and how
to use them. The author provides a search methodology
for the user.
Using the tools detailed, the user can determine  how
each utility
performs and create a process utilizing the separate
tools, depending on
the particular need or time limit. Gilster reminds
the reader that one
resource is not enough. Certain tasks require a variety
of references.
The combination of search utilities produces the  most
effective
results. <P>

Gilster addresses each topic logically and precisely.
His writing style
displays an in-depth approach, demonstrating how the
reader may  best
use the features his or her connection offers. The second
edition, like
the original, is an excellent book by an outstanding
author. Its 
modifications only increase its value. <P>

<B><I>The Underground Guide to UNIX: 
Slightly Askew Advice from a UNIX Guru </I><br>
by John Montgomery <br>
Series Editor Woody Leonhard <br>
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company <br>
ISBN 0-201-40653-5 <br>
$24.95 </B><P>

Introductory UNIX books usually follow similar outlines.
They include
fundamental concepts, followed by two or three advanced
segments and
one or two optional subjects. The basic topics are essential;
the
author's choice of advanced and optional topics determine
how valuable
the book will become. The additional topics can either
discuss
procedures for the beginner or for the more advanced
UNIX  programmer or
administrator. The Underground Guide to UNIX belongs
in the latter
category. Although Montgomery &quot;assumes  that you
already know something
about UNIX&quot; [page xi], he also presents the fundamental
concepts in
Chapter 1. This introductory  chapter provides a brief
history (don't
skip this history of UNIX  it's entertaining!) and the
concepts of
different versions and shells.  Montgomery demonstrates
how to discover
which version and shell the reader uses, and why this
information is
important. Other issues in  this section feature paths
and filenames,
multi-everything (a look at multitasking), simple system
administration
(the shutdown procedure),  sadistics (system activity
statistics),
editors, where to find help, and scripts. <P>

The second chapter, This Old Shell, (the author had
just purchased a
house) details some of the differences among the three
types of  shell
accounts (the C, Bourne, and Korn shells) and some of
the ways to
customize an account. The following chapter, Your Wish:
Issuing 
Commands, not only demonstrates command line usage,
but also introduces
redirection and presents some editing shortcuts. Montgomery
next
examines files: their security, permissions, how to
manage and
manipulate them, searching and sorting methods, and
devices.  Although
UNIX editing is never automatic, some editors are friendlier
than
others. Montgomery classifes vi and emacs as pretty
editors  and ex,
sed, and awk as ugly editors. In the chapter Shell Programming,
the
author dissects an example, explaining the function
of each  part. He
then presents a shell script procedure followed by more
specific aspects
of shell programming, including redirection and  constructs.
He also
includes brief descriptions of make and perl. The concluding
chapters,
Email and Networking and The Internet,  demonstrate
how these familiar
subjects work from a UNIX system. Montgomery furnishes
five appendices:
Most Useful Commands, Common Problems and Fixes, Editor
Summary, Useful
Perl Scripts, and Security. <P>

The Underground Guide To UNIX is an enlightening book;
it illustrates
UNIX fundamentals as well as lifting the reader's  spirit.
(I defy
anyone to read this book without smiling!) Montgomery
addresses the
concepts of the UNIX system directly; he provides  tips,
shortcuts, and
bugs. He also thoughtfully includes notes in the margins,
so the reader
can concentrate solely on the text.  Montgomery's expertise
is easily
recognized as he details the abundant examples throughout
the book.
Every UNIX user will learn  something and find enjoyment
in the process
with this book. <P>

<B><I>Bandits on the Information Superhighway </I><br>
by Daniel J. Barrett <br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc. <br>
ISBN 1-56592-156-9 <br>
$17.95 <br>
Poster included </B><P>

The Internet can provide business and social contacts,
a vast source of
information, and even a marketplace for buying or selling
goods. 
However, as the media has been quick to report, it can
also promote
scams and fraud. Bandits on the Information  Superhighway
not only warns
the reader of potentially risk-laden situations, but
also describes how
to avoid them and includes real  experiences from users.
The Internet
reflects the everyday world. Although we access it from
the safety of
our own homes or offices, it is important to exercise
some caution.
Barrett discusses the different ploys and risks on the
Internet, and how
to avoid them. <P>

In Welcome to the Internet, Barrett investigates the
most popular online
use  electronic mail  and briefly discusses how each
of the  Internet
features has its own associated risk. In the following
chapter,
Protecting Your Privacy, the author defines the difference
between 
hackers and crackers, situations to avoid, and precautions
to take. Get
Rich Quick Schemes recounts the various methods thinly
disguised  as
legitimate opportunities: advertising by fax, sales,
shareware sales,
lotteries, t-shirts, and telephone code numbers. In
Appearances Can  Be
Deceiving, some apparent (and some not so obvious) deceptions
are
revealed (i.e., students seeking homework solutions,
talent  searches,
and coupon books). Free Information...For A Price details
some of the
ways scammers try to profit: selling free information,
personal credit
reports, government auctions, and wholesaler lists.
Barrett also
discusses Buying and Selling On The Net and Pranks,
Spams, and Time
Wasters. The latter chapter includes how a posting is
spammed (published
in several places simultaneously) and the  infamous
Good Times virus,
which is a hoax. (The author uses past tense referring
to this, but
since I still get warnings about this  periodically,
it is still
current.) Other topics that Barrett examines include
Strangers, Friends,
and Lovers; Parents and the Internet; Your  Rights On
The Net; What To
Do if You Are Ripped Off; and What Will the Future Bring?
The book also
contains Understanding Internet  Addresses and a detachable
poster
highlighting &quot;Fifteen Ways To Spot An Internet
Bandit.&quot; <P>

This is a valuable book for the warnings it provides,
the possible
solutions, and the numbers and addresses of regulatory
groups. Barrett 
has written an excellent resource for the online user;
he separates fact
from fiction and provides solutions whenever possible.
The inclusion  of
interviews from Internet users detailing true experiences
furnishes an
interesting dimension to the chapters. His writing style
is clear, 
readable, and precise. Any nontechnical casual user
can understand it,
and experienced users will readily identify with it.
Every online user 
should read this book and keep the 9&quot; x 13&quot;
poster near the computer.
This is a superbly done and necessary book for everyone.
I urge all 
users to read it. <P>

<B><I>AIX for Breakfast 
A Guide for Programmers &amp; System Administrators </I><br>
by Philip Houtz <br>
Prentice Hall <br>
ISBN 0-13-399684-0 <br>
$45.00 <br>
Diskette Included </B><P>

AIX (Advanced Interactive eXecutive, more commonly known
as IBM's UNIX)
is becoming more popular. Using RISC (Reduced Instruction
Set Computer)
architecture, many new computers utilize the AIX operating
system. The
AIX operating system is neither completely AT&amp;T
System  V Release 3
(SVR3) nor BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) 4.3;
it is a combination
of both, with a little POSIX and Open Software Foundation
(OSF) added.
To clarify the way AIX functions for the administrator,
Houtz has
divided the text into three sections: End User Customization,
General
System Configuration, and Multiple Versions of AIX.
A fourth section,
Hands-On Learning, is on the accompanying diskette and
contains sample
customizations, sample scripts, and performance monitoring
software. <P>

Houtz begins with an introduction to the AIX operating
system and its
history. He then analyzes End User Configuration, describing
the  AIX
Shells (identifying the default shells versus the shells
that are
available for the user), Login and User Customization,
X Window 
Customization, Motif Window Manager, X Desktop and Icons,
and
InfoExplorer, a hypertext set of system manuals. InfoExplorer
supports 
the traditional man pages familiar to UNIX users, both
simple and
compound searches, and a Topic and Task Index that can
run either in 
graphical or ASCII mode. The General System Configuration
utilizes the
System Management Interface Tool (SMIT), which can be
used  for AIX
installation, Device Installation and Maintenance, and
Complex Printer
Setup (Chapters 9, 10, and 11, respectively.) The Logical
Volume
Manager (LVM) and file management is discussed in Chapter
12, detailing
logical and physical volumes and partitions, file  systems,
and
allocation policies. SMIT is also used for System and
Data Backup,
Creating Users and Passwords, Communications  (TCP/IP),
Errors and
Diagnostics, and Performance Tuning. The third section
describes the
differences between AIX version 3.2 and AIX  version
4.1. <P>

Houtz clearly demonstrates the customization and configuration
of the
AIX operating system. He discusses the different procedures
through 
menus, screen setups, and screen outputs. He also illustrates
what the
administrators will see as they step through the different
tasks,
whether for end- user customization or general system
configuration. The
author carefully explains how the AIX processes differ
both from
traditional UNIX and  from the guidelines with which
administrators may
be more familiar. This is a well-written and knowledgeable
description
of AIX system  administration management. No AIX administrator
should be
without it.<P>
