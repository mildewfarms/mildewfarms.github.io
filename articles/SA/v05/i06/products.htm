<B>APCON Releases POWERSWITCH for UNIX</B><P>

APCON, Inc. has released POWERSWITCH for UNIX. POWERSWITCH
for UNIX is
dual server software that automatically switches application
services to
a standby server in the event of a primary server failure.
POWERSWITCH
for UNIX can be configured to protect either the primary
or standby
server from failure allowing applications running on
a failed server to
be redirected to the operating server. After a system
failure,
POWERSWITCH also switches external storage devices between
primary and
standby servers.<P>

POWERSWITCH for UNIX monitors primary server, standby
server, and
network operation. If either a primary or standby server
failure is
detected, POWERSWITCH checks and verifies the operational
server and
network integrity before switching application disks
to the operational
server. Failover services are automatic.<P>

With POWERSWITCH's dual server design, systems can be
configured to
support multiple servers in a number of dynamic high-availability
configurations. Primary and standby servers can be different
types of
computers. Administrators can also perform maintenance
and trouble
shooting without affecting mission critical applications
or users.<P>

The POWERSWITCH for UNIX supports SunOS, Solaris 2.x,
SCO UNIX, HP-UX,
IBM AIX, DEC OSF/1, UNIXWare, and other UNIX platforms.
The base price
for POWERSWITCH for UNIX is $995. For more information
contact APCON,
Inc., Wilsonville, OR; (503) 685-9300; Fax: (503) 685-9099.<P>

status reporting
system for large customers; Web-based report writers;
an in-house
manufacturing application, where project status and
current data will be
available graphically; and a portfolio management package,
allowing
customers to view their account information via the
Web, seeing their
fund performance as a chart rather than just tables
of numbers.<P>

GRAFSMAN/WWW is shipping now on NT and will be available
for Sun, HP,
and RS/6000 systems in the future, with other platforms
to follow.
GRAFSMAN with the WWW tools is priced at $395 for NT
and $1,995 for a
