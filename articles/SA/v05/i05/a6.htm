<H1>Questions and Answers</H1><p>
<P>
Bjorn Satdeva<P>

It has finally happened. On March 5, 1996, CERT published
the first CERT
Advisory regarding a security flaw in the Netscape Navigator
2.0 Java
implementation and in Release 1.0 of the Java Developer's
Kit from Sun
Microsystems, Inc. I don't think that this came as a
surprise to
anybody in the security community, as concerns and unofficial
bug
reports about Java have been circulating for several
months. In fact, it
may be just the first of many security flaws in the
Java design and
implementation.<P>

If you have been following the security discussions
in the Java NetNews
newsgroup, you will know that most of discussion has
not been about the
various security flaws in Java, but rather how the little
security that
has been included does not allow various types of implementation.
The
few people who do point out the security weaknesses
and problems often
get flamed for their effort.<P>

What makes all this very, very scary, is that most people
are completely
unaware of the many security risks that already exist
on the World Wide
Web. In my opinion, the efforts that are in progress
are hopelessly
inadequate from an overall security perspective. Implementation
of SSL
or S-HTML will only be able to address part of the problem.
Unfortunately, the only way this mess will ever be cleaned
up, is if the
current generation of Web browsers and servers, together
with HTML, is
thrown out and a replacement is created that will allow
the Web to
operate securely. This will of course will not happen
until after Hell
has frozen over.<P>

We can therefore expect an outbreak of security incidents
related to the
World Wide Web. From a system administrator or security
personnel
standpoint, unfortunately, there is not much that can
be done. Unlike
with other threats coming from the Internet, there is
currently no
firewall technology available that can protect a site
from these
problems, and it is not likely that we will soon see
any solutions to
effectively address these issues.<P>

This issue cannot be addressed at the protocol level,
because the threat
is not apparently at that level. If you want to implement
a protection
against bad applets, it will be necessary to implement
a check of
malicious code within the applet, something which certainly
is a very
nontrivial task. And you will need to do so with every
other kind of
file downloaded by a World Wide Web client. Another
example along the
same line is the downloading and display of Postscript.
Postscript is
really implemented in the language Forth and the Postscript
interpreter
will execute Forth commands. It is therefore possible
to create a
Postscript file with the side effect that when the Postscript
viewer
displays the file, it will also remove files from the
hard disk. I
believe that most modern Postscript viewers on UNIX
(like the GNU
program gs) will now reject such a request, but it is
not necessarily so
for older implementations and some PC-based Postscript
viewers.<P>

It is not just Java that has proven to be a security
problem. Abug in
Netscape Navigator 2.0 allows a browser to send email
to a third party
without the person accessing the web page having any
idea of what is
taking place. This is going a step further than the
old mail spoofing
issue, where somebody telnets to port 25 on a remote
machine, and starts
typing at the sendmail daemon. In this case, the mail
actually
originates on the machine it claims to come from.  Taken
to an extreme,
somebody could create a web page, and when you accessed
the web page,
you would unknowingly send email to whitehouse.gov,
saying &quot;The
President is a Fool. Shoot Him,&quot; then the Secret
Service would beat down
your door, arrest you, and sieze your machine. And lo
and behold, the
machine's log would prove that you did indeed send the
offending email.
Although the above scenario is a bit extreme, in my
opinion, if you are
using Netscape 2.0, you better upgrade as soon as possible.<P>

<B>Tool of the Month</B><P>

This month's tool is Argus, a public domain package
that provides a
generic IP network transaction auditing tool. Argus
runs as an
application level daemon, promiscuously reading network
datagrams from a
specified interface, and generates network traffic status
records for
the network activity that it encounters. Argus has been
built and tested
under SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.3, and SGI IRIX5.2.<P>

Argus enables a site to generate comprehensive network
transaction audit
logs in a fashion that provides for high degrees of
data reduction
semantic preservation. This allows the system administrator
to perform
extensive historical analysis of network traffic. The
package includes
two example programs for analyzing the network transaction
audit logs.<P>

Argus is available from:<P>

 I recently received a warning about a mail virus called
the Good Time
virus. It is supposedly a virus on America Online being
sent by email. I
was told that it will erase the hard drive. Do you have

any information
about this?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Virus is a PC problem, and as such is in an area I
do not know too much
about. The Good Time email virus, however, is one of
the few viruses I
do know about. It is a hoax!!! It is only a virus to
the extent that
people worry about it, and rebroadcast the phoney warning
to various
mailing lists from time to time. Please ignore any messages
you get
about this virus, as otherwise you only continue giving
life to this
urban legend. You can find more information about the
Good Time virus
from CIAG:<P>

 We are mostly a Digital VAX site, but also have a few
RS/6000 systems.
On OpenVMS we have a tool called IRIS that records a
user's terminal in-
and output and calculates all kinds of results such
as network delay
time, service time, response time, etc. Now I am looking
for such a
product on AIX, but haven't found anything. Have you
any idea if such a
product exists?<P>

 Not to my knowledge, but it sounds like a nice package.
You might be
able to get some of the statistics you are looking for
under UNIX, by
using tools such as ping and traceroute; it will not
be as easy and
handy as with your tool though. If anybody knows of
a publicly available
tool for UNIX similar to IRIS, send me a note, and I
will announce it
here.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Do you know of any modified xlock utilities that log
failed attempts at
entry? I'm looking for something better than what comes
standard with
Sun's OpenWindows.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I don't think that anybody has done this, however,
it is a good idea.
It should probably not be too difficult to modify the
program to provide
this. If anybody has done this, send me a note, and
we can make it
available on the ftp server and notify the readers.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 How do I display a UNIX bitmap or raster file in a
cmdtool, shell-tool,
or xterm window? I want to be able to create pop-up
windows with
pictures/drawings in them on OpenWindows.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 There is a shareware program called xv that does what
you want. It is
able to display a number of different, including X11
bitmaps and Sun
raster files, as well as the more common JPEG and GIF
formats. It is
also able to convert between the various formats and
is capable of doing
color editing. It is available by anonymous ftp from:<P>
<PRE>
ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/xv</pre><p>
<p>
If you like the software, there is a shareware license
fee of $25 per
copy. The source file has the necessary information
on how to register
your copy.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I have heard about something called Swip, which should
help increase
security on the Internet. Do you have any further information
about
this.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I think there must be some crossed wires somewhere.
SWIP stands for
Shared WHOIS Project. It is something that Internet
Service Providers
use to submit information to the Internic (who, among
other things,
assign IP addresses and domain names).<P>

What you might have been thinking of the swiPe project,
which is used to
create encrypted IP tunnels through packet encapsulation.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I am looking for write-ups or comparisons about configuration
management tools for Windows, Windows/NT and UNIX client
server
environments. Do you know where I might find them. I
do not have web
access yet.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I don't know of any such comparison that has any technical
validity. It
is unfortunately a highly charged religious issue, in
which most people
are only interested in the part of the facts that supports
their chosen
operating system as being the only true OS.<P>

You might find parts of the firewall mailing list archives
of use, as
there has for some time been an intense UNIX versus
NT flame war going
on. You can find a copy of the archives at:<P>
<PRE>
ftp://ftp.sysadmin.com/pub/admin/ \
firewalls/archives/firewall</pre><p>
<p>
It looks to me that the UNIX geeks think NT is not yet
ready for prime
time, while the NT supporters seem to say that it doesn't
matter as long
as they can run something that is not UNIX. But then,
I am a confessed
UNIX geek and may be biased in this discussion.<P>
