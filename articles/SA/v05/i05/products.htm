<B>New Dimension Software Announces Two Products</B><P>

New Dimension Software Ltd. has announced two products,
Enterprise
Production Management and MultiPlatform CONTROL-SA.
Enterprise
Production Management builds on the company's CONTROL
product line by
combining elements of CONTROL products, such as production
scheduling
capabilities and automated operations technology, into
an integrated
solution designed for distributed heterogeneous environments.
Enterprise
Production Management manages both scheduled and unscheduled
events and
includes a GUI that gives users a global, consolidated
view of the
production workload across the enterprise. Enterprise
Production
Management offers interoperability across multiple platforms
including
new and legacy applications running on MVS systems,
UNIX platforms
(e.g., AIX, SunOS, Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Pyramid, and
NCR), AS/400,
OpenVMS, NT, and OS/2.<P>

The second product, MultiPlatform CONTROL-SA is a tool
for
enterprise-wide security administration in distributed
environments.
Composed of the Enterprise SecurityStation and SA agents,
MultiPlatform
CONTROL-SA gives administrators a central point of management
for a
variety of commercially available security systems.
Features of the
GUI-based Enterprise SecurityStation include: an audit
trail of events
based on prioritized alerts, reporting facility with
customized reports,
and optional password synchronization. Security Station
is a UNIX-based
application that supports Sun, HP, or IBM workstations.
The SA agent
includes MultiPlatform CONTROL-SA's Universal Security
Administration
Application Programming Interface (USA-API), which translates
commands
from SecurityStation to the security product resident
on each platform.
USA-API integrates legacy and client/server applications
into the
enterprise and automates the registration process for
third-party or
in-house applications. SA agents are available for IBM-MVS/RACF,
Sun
Solaris, SunOS, HP-UX, IBM AIX, and Novell platforms.<P>

Prices for Enterprise Production Management start at
