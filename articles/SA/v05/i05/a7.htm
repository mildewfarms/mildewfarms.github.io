<H1>Books: A User's Report</H1><p>
<P>
Elizabeth Zinkann<P>

This month I reviewed an employment book utilizing the
Internet, a Perl
quick reference guide, an Internet security book, an
Internet file
format book, and a Windows 95 help book. Specifically,
I enjoyed Hook
Up, Get Hired by Joyce Lain Kennedy (John Wiley &amp;
Sons, Inc.), Perl 5
Desktop Reference by Johan Vromans (O'Reilly &amp; Associates,
Inc.),
Actually Useful Internet Security Measures by Larry
J. Hughes, Jr. (New
Riders), Internet File Formats by Tim Kientzle (Coriolis
Group Books),
and The Windows 95 Bug Collection by Bruce Brown (Addison-Wesley).
I
also reviewed The IBM Dictionary of Computing on Disk
from McGraw-Hill.<P>

<B><I>Hook Up, Get Hired!
The Internet Job Search Revolution</I><br>
by Joyce Lain Kennedy<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.<br>
ISBN 0-471-11630-0<br>
$12.95</B><P>

The immense resource capabilities and the current popularity
of the
Internet make it an ideal tool for both employers and
job seekers.
Unlike printed classifieds, which change weekly, employment
opportunities displayed online are updated as soon as
a notice is
submitted or withdrawn. Even the printed media utilizes
the convenience

of online access. CareerPath, a new service, features
job listings from
The Washington Post, San Jose Mercury News, Chicago
Tribune, The New
York Times, Los Angeles Times, and The Boston Globe.
(CareerPath can be
reached at http://www.careerpath.com.) For experienced
computer users,
the evolution of the Internet or commercial online service
to a search
utility is not surprising. However, the novice may experience
some
trepidation in using the information or in accessing
it. <P>

Joyce Lain Kennedy, a syndicated career columnist, addresses
the
questions, fears, and apprehension of both new and experienced
users.
She begins with an overview, detailing the role of the
Internet in
today's employment market. One of the most common misconceptions
relates
to locale; since the Internet is a vast network, any
job discovered
through a newsgroup or bulletin board service (BBS)
must be in a
different region. This is a common misrepresentation,
because most
positions discovered in this way are actually local.
Realizing that most
readers may skeptically approach this online search
idea, the author
describes some true experiences and also some examples
of online junk
ads. The user should recognize a legitimate offer versus
one that
appears too good to be true. (&quot;Earn $50,000 an
hour from the comfort of
your own home !&quot; I admit I exaggerated the actual
offer.) Kennedy
explains the different Internet resources (i.e., bulletin
boards,
newsgroups, discussion lists, and the various Internet
utilities,
including Gopher, telnet, and the World Wide Web), and
also demonstrates
how to use each tool.<P>

The fourth chapter features sites that list job offerings,
including
temporary, permanent, full-time, part-time, and contract
options.
Kennedy discusses the choices of the commercial online
services: America
Online, CompuServe, Delphi, GEnie, and Prodigy. She
also discusses how
to access a BBS (Bulletin Board System) and details
some of the best
ones for job opportunities in three diverse groups:
the private sector,
technical, and federal. The author similarly examines
newsgroups,
mailing lists, telnet, and the World Wide Web. In addition
to the online
resources that list available jobs, several other options
exist for the
user: posting a resume, contacting employment consultants,
and
professional societies and trade organizations. Kennedy
also addresses
small business and marketing concerns, which hardware
and software the
user needs, some guidelines for online resumes, autopilots,
and some
organizational considerations. The Appendix itemizes
online and offline
references: books, publications, software, and the InterNIC
(Internet
Network Information Center) organization. She also includes
a glossary
to aid the reader with the Internet's many acronyms.<P>

Hook Up, Get Hired! introduces an accepted practice
to a new medium. Not
too long ago, resumes were always typed or typeset,
with careful
attention to the color and weight of the paper. Now,
the paper often
belongs to the employer (whether by printer or fax machine)
and the
resume exists in cyberspace. The rules for writing resumes
have changed
as well as the formatting.<P>

Kennedy, an established newspaper columnist and book
author, provides a
well-written guide for the job seeker. She uses interviews
to illustrate
online experiences and furnishes &quot;NetNotes&quot;
throughout the book to
assist the novice Internet traveler. This is a superb
book, documenting
new rules for existing techniques. No employer or job
seeker should be
without it.<P>

<B><I>Perl 5 Desktop Reference</I><br>
by Johan Vromans<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-187-9<br>
$6.95</B><P>

Since its debut approximately 10 years ago, Perl (Practical
Extraction
and Report Language) has been preferred by the UNIX
community as a
superior programming utility. Whether it augments or
replaces the shell
programming language, both users and administrators
appreciate Perl's
scope and syntax.<P>

With the popularity explosion of the Internet, World
Wide Web
programmers have also recognized Perl's advantages and
rapidly applied
it to CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts. The original
Perl book,
Programming Perl by Larry Wall and Randal L. Schwartz,
defined the Perl
language and its applications. This new little booklet,
by Vromans,
provides the user with a quick reference to Perl's syntax
and features.
It contains the commands and options for the language,
including
literals, variables, operators, statements, functions,
regular
expressions, and networking.<P>

Vromans furnishes a complete resource in a pocket reference
size. (Perl
5 Desktop Reference is approximately the same size as
Smileys by David
W. Sanderson and Dale Dougherty.) This book should be
on every UNIX and
Internet programmer's and administrator's desktop.<P>

<B><I>Actually Useful Internet
Security Measures</I><br>
by Larry J. Hughes, Jr.<br>
New Riders<br>
ISBN 1-56205-508-9<br>
$32.00</B><P>

Stories of intruders invading Internet systems accompany
almost every
Internet history. New reports appear almost daily. The
weaknesses of the
Internet are not only generally known, but are also
specifically
detailed. Yet, break-ins continue to occur. In the introduction
to
Actually Useful Internet Security Techniques, Hughes
briefly recounts
his own experience with invaders from cyberspace. Through
the pursuit of
his trespassers, the author researched several different
security
concepts and tools. In this book, Hughes not only presents
these ideas
and applications to system and network administrators,
but also to the
general Internet user.<P>

Under ordinary circumstances, everyone recognizes security
and how to
practice it, whether it is locking doors, or double-checking
the lights.
However, as soon as the modem connects the user's personal
computer to
an online service or the Internet, security concerns
fade into the
background. Because most users access the Internet from
familiar and
usually secure surroundings, it is easy for the the
user to feel
completely protected and safe. Unfortunately, this is
not the case. To
educate the user, Hughes begins with The Foundations
of Internet
Security and defines the essential concepts: authentication,
access
control, integrity, and confidentiality. He examines
the OSI (Open
Systems Interconnection) Reference Model and the Internet
TCP/IP
(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) Model.
A basic
understanding of the transmission process illustrates
its most
vulnerable segments.<P>

Electronic mail (email) remains the most popular service
of the
Internet, but the idea that someone else could possible
read your
messages and perhaps alter them is disturbing, to say
the least. Two of
the basic tenets of security, data confidentiality and
integrity,
protect email. Hughes addresses these issues and discusses
the practices
of cryptology, including cryptography and cryptanalysis.
He explains
encryption, ciphers, hash functions, public-key cryptosystems,
and some
familiar algorithms. The following chapters define authentication,
its
features, techniques, uses, and the Kerberos authentication
system. Part
II, Communications and Data-Sharing Applications, evaluates
Messaging 
Mail and News, Virtual Terminal Services, File Sharing,
and The X Window
System. The author examines the potential security risks
associated with
each topic and available solutions.<P>

In the third section, Firewalls and Web Security, Hughes
discusses World
Wide Web Security, An Overview of SATAN, Network Security
Issues, and
Actually Useful Security Tools. The World Wide Web Security
chapter
illustrates common mistakes and security considerations
connected with
the NCSA (National Center for Supercomputer Applications)
HyperText
Transfer Protocol Daemon (httpd). An Overview of SATAN
details the
Security Administration Tool for Analyzing Networks
(SATAN) developed by
Dan Farmer and Wierse Venema. SATAN provides security
auditors and
network and system administrators with a tool that scans
systems for
possible security weaknesses. Hughes outlines its uses,
configuration,
instructions, and vulnerabilities. Network Security
Issues examines
authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and access
control relative
to the Internet's network, transport, and application
protocol layers.
The concluding chapter, Actually Useful Security Tools,
lists the
utilities available on the Internet, their locations,
and descriptions
according to their specific topics. Part IV includes
the Appendices,
Security-Related Organizations and Usenet Newsgroups
as well as a
Glossary, Bibligraphy, and the Index.<P>

Actually Useful Internet Security Techniques is an outstanding
book,
debuting at an opportune time. Hughes not only demonstrates
the
problems, but also presents possible solutions and where
to obtain the
numerous utilities. This book provides an introduction
to security
measures for the user, a practical reference for the
administrator, and
a complement to the more technical security books. Actually
Useful
Internet Security Techniques is a valuable resource
for every user and
administrator on the Internet.<P>

<B><I>Internet File Formats</I><br>
by Tim Kientzle<br>
Coriolis Group Books<br>
ISBN 1-883577-56-X<br>
$39.99<br>
CD-ROM Included</B><P>

The popularity of the Internet often can be linked to
the speed and
convenience of email and the immense amount of resources
that a user can
access. However, when a user downloads a desired file,
he or she is
often confused by its format and frustrated by attempts
to open it.
Internet File Formats addresses this problem for PC,
Macintosh, and UNIX
platforms.<P>

Kientzle divides the formats into six basic sections:
text and document,
graphics, compression and archiving, encoding, sound,
and movie formats.
The introductory chapters recount the history of different
formats on
the Internet and the evolution of standards. They also

address the
problems of identifying specific formats and describe
helpful file
format resources available on the Internet. Each individual
chapter
features a description of the format, relevant instructions,
and tells
when to use it. The first page of each chapter encapsulates
the
important information in boxed outline format (names,
extensions, use,
the author's reference, and any utilities presented
on the accompanying
CD-ROM.) Kientzle discusses approximately 100 different
extensions,
detailing how each works and giving specific information
regarding the
particular type of format. Chapters on document formats
may include a
primer with syntax information, how to generate paragraphs,
text styles,
tables, headings, and more. In contrast, graphic formats
chapters
indicate how to recognize and utilize a specific format
as well as when
to use it. Kientzle examines all of the most popular
formats plus many
of the lesser known ones. The Appendices feature the
following
additional topics: About the CD-ROM, About Files, About
File Formats,
About Transferring Files, and A Binary Dump Program.
The accompanying
CD-ROM provides shareware for conversion, transferring,
compressing,
decompressing, creating, and viewing assorted types
of files for PC,
Macintosh, and UNIX workstations.<P>

Internet File Formats presents practical instruction,
programs, and
answers for the Internet user. It is clearly written
and easily
understood. The concepts of varied file formats, when
one format is
preferable over another, and the principles of compression,
archiving,
and encoding are reasonably explained. Kientzle displays
his extensive
knowledge as he presents the advantages and disadvantages
of each
format. Every Internet user should read (and reference)
this superb
book.<P>

<B><I>The Windows 95 Bug Collection</I><br>
by Bruce Brown<br>
Addison-Wesley<br>
ISBN 0-201-48995-3<br>
$14.95</B><P>

Windows 95 is the most recent Windows upgrade, and depending
on the
current PC hardware and software used, installation
of it may or may not
cause problems. To make the transition from Windows
3.1 to Windows 95
easier, Bruce Brown, editor and publisher of BugNet
has assembled a list
of the known bugs in Windows 95 and solutions to these
problems.<P>

If the reader has not installed Windows 95, but intends
to upgrade in
the near future, it is important to remember that the
success rate for
installation without major difficulty is 95% percent.
This book
addresses the various problems and compatibility questions
with
different hardware and software products. Brown includes
eight major
topics, their identified problems, and workaround solutions:
installation, utilities, hardware, communcations, games,
publishing,
working with numbers, and Windows 95 itself. The beginning
categories
need no explanation, but the last (working with numbers)
details
problems primarily discovered in the different spreadsheet,
accounting,
and database applications and how to avoid them. Windows
95 Itself
examines the idiosyncrasies of the upgrade with basic
commands that the
user previously employed in Windows 3.1.<P>

The Windows 95 Bug Collection features a simple way
to escape
unnecessary stress and avoid headaches. The bugs have
been documented
and reproduced, and the provided solutions work. Brown
introduces each
section with a brief (three to four page) description
of the errors
addressed in that section. He also includes the Bug/Fix
Success Rates
for the specific topic, the section's Biggest Problem,
and its Biggest
Surprise. The individual problems and workarounds follow
the
introduction. The first page of each error/solution
segment displays a
footnote with the Bug and Fix List Legend so the reader
does not have to
keep checking the book's preface to determine a symbol's
interpretation.
The number of possible conflicts is amazing; the accompanying
solutions
are comforting. Brown has furnished the user and administrator
with an
expert tool for installing and configuring Windows 95.
Administrators
and users will appreciate The Windows 95 Bug Collection
and use it
often. It is a practical and effective book.<P>

<B><I>IBM Dictionary of Computing on Disk</I><br>
McGraw-Hill<br>
ISBN 0-07-852800-3<br>
$34.95</B><P>

Most computing professionals do not know the meaning
of every acronym at
the first or even the second glance. They may be able
to deduce the
definition by the context of the sentence, but sometimes
even that is
doubtful. The best computer professionals know where
to look for the
information, and a computing dictionary is usually the
first place to
check. However, due to the rapid changes in the computer
industry and
its terminology, a current dictionary is almost impossible
to maintain.<P>

The IBM Dictionary of Computing on Disk can solve that
problem. It
includes the basic dictionary and updates as needed,
so the user can
possess the most up-to-date reference possible. The
four disks include
both DOS and Windows versions of the software. Both
utilize multiple
search choices. The user can seek a term using a menu,
a term search, a
&quot;sounds like&quot; phonetic search, or an alphabetic
search. Once the word or
phrase is accessed, the user can find other definitions
by browsing
sequentially or by limiting the dictionary to the results
of the initial
search. He or she can copy the information to a word
processing program
or Windows clipboard, notebook, or write program. Choosing
a search by
definition will identify the occurrences within the
selected text.<P>

I implemented this as a Windows program and quickly
learned a few minor
techniques, such as clearing the search screen between
two separate
searches. (One search endeavored to find world + wide
+ web + Backus +
Naur + Java. Surprisingly, there was no match.) The
menu approach took
longer than the other search procedures (which was due
to the input
method). However, the retrieved data was correct and
detailed a
low-level hardware approach. I discovered some specific
Internet terms
missing. However, some of the Internet terms I originally
couldn't find
appeared under their full names (HyperText was there;
HTML was not.) The
other absent definitions are very recent terms. This
software dictionary
contains 18,000 technical entries and remains a worthwhile
product for
anyone requiring precise technical jargon. The IBM Dictionary
of
Computing was originally designed for the use of IBM
staff and is also
compatible with the OS/2 operating system.<P>
