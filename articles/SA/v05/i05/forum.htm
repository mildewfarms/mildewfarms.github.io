<H1>Editor's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
If you are thinking about writing a story for us (or
if you just need
another web site to check out), try our newly minted
home page:
www.samag.com. The site includes our author guidelines,
samples from the
most recent issue, subscription information, and information
about
related products (e.g., the Sys Admin CD-ROM containing
complete
articles and listings from 1992 through 1995).<P>

Actually, you don't need to be a prospective author
or a Web junkie to
find something useful on this site -- but you do have
to know where to
look. We have included a complete list of all stories
in back issues.
It's not a topical index, but the titles of most stories
are
sufficiently descriptive to make this file a reasonably
effective index
into past Sys Admin stories.<P>

To find the file, click on the &quot;Back Issue Listing&quot;
link on the home
page. It will pull up the entire file. Right now, your
best bet is to
search this file with a text editor, as the volume/issue
information
appears in section heads. I'll be posting a more grep
friendly version
soon.<P>

A few issues back, I mentioned the Windows PCNFS client
XFS. I've
recently found some additional information about this
package. First,
it's available as xfs32120.zip on several sites, including
ftp.sunet.se.
This package installs cleanly under Windows 3.11 (WFWG),
and the file
client works nicely with Linux (I didn't bother to check
the print
client). Unfortunately, XFS won't work with Windows
95. Moreover,
according to a Usenet posting, you probably shouldn't
expect XFS to be
upgraded as it has birthed a commercial product named
WinLink NFC. You
can get information on that from
ftp.winlink.no/winlink/beta/nfc11spc.txt.<P>

The same Usenet thread suggests using native Microsoft
LanManager
protocols (instead of NFS) and running a compatible
server (Samba) on
the UNIX host. If this sounds interesting to you, watch
closely for our
next issue, as it will feature a story describing one
administrator's
experience with Samba. If you can't wait, you can get
your own copy from
nimbus.anu.edu.au. (Look in the directory /pub/tridge/samba.)<P>

Sincerely yours, <br>

Robert Ward<P>
