<H1>Sidebar: Public Key Cryptography</H1><p>
<P>
The most widely used verification of both the client
and server identity
in SSL is based on RSA, a public key encryption algorithm.
Public key
encryption is based on the following principle. You
have two keys, a
public one and a private one. The public one, as the
name indicates, may
be known to anyone. The private key should only be known
to the owner.<P>

The trick is that a message that has been encrypted
with one of these
keys can only be decrypted by the other key. So, if
someone wants to
send you some private email, he or she can encrypt this
message with
your public key. Upon receipt only you can decrypt it,
because as you
are the only person who knows the private key.<P>

If the sender wants to sign the message, it can be encrypted
with his or
her private key. Then this message is encrypted with
your public key and
sent to you. Upon receipt, you decrypt it with your
private key, but you
then need the sender's public key to decrypt to the
plaintext message.<P>

The strength of the public key system is based on the
fact that it is
very hard to deduce one key from the other. Both are
derived from a
large prime number through a mathematical process. This,
and the actual
process of signing and verifying, which is far more
complicated than
explained here, is described in Schneier's Applied Cryptography.
This
method of encrypting is sometimes referred to as asymmetric
encryption,
because you need different keys for encrypting and decrypting.<P>

Another form of encryption is symmetric encryption,
meaning that
encrypting and decrypting are done with the same key.
An example of
symmetric encryption is DES, which is available in a
number of flavors.<P>

In SSL, both forms of encryption are used. RSA is used
to verify client
and server and to exchange the encryption keys. Normal
data is encrypted
with some form of DES, using the key that was established
during the
initial handshake.<P>
