This month I reviewed an assortment of books that I
found useful. I hope that you can find some help from
them, too. I read and reviewed The UNIX Dictionary
of Commands, Terms, and Acronyms by John Levine, Margaret
Levine Young, Chris Negus, and Larry Schumer (Computing
McGraw-Hill); The Internet Roadmap, Third Edition by
Bennett Falk (Sybex); Encyclopedia of Graphics File
Formats, Second Edition by James D. Murray and William
vanRyper (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.); HTML Visual
Quick Reference, Second Edition by Dean Sharf (Que);
Learning the HP-UX Operating System by Marty Poniatowski
(Hewlett-Packard Professional Books, Prentice Hall);
and Electronic Resume Writing: Creating A Winning Resume
for the New World of Job Seeking, Second Edition by
Joyce Lain Kennedy and Thomas J. Morrow (John Wiley
&amp; Sons, Inc.).<P>

<B><I>The UNIX Dictionary of Commands, Terms,
and Acronyms</I><br>
by John Levine, Margaret Levine Young,
Chris Negus, and Larry Schumer<br>
Computing McGraw-Hill<br>
ISBN 0-07-037643-3<br>
$39.50<br>

The UNIX community possesses its own language and slang,
not unlike a country. A visitor can easily become confused
by the many different terms or by hearing the same
term used to describe unrelated concepts. In addition
to the existing jargon, new technology constantly creates
accompanying vocabulary. The UNIX Dictionary of Commands,
Terms, and Acronyms provides an excellent resource
for anyone working with UNIX or a UNIX variant. The
authors include definitions for UNIX System V, BSD
UNIX, Linux, Apple Macintosh's A/UX, RISC terminology,
and other UNIX systems' specific nomenclature. Levine,
Young, Negus, and Schumer also define commands, library
routines, utilities, environment variables, data structures,
protocols, communications software, and hardware.
The UNIX Dictionary of Commands, Terms, and Acronyms
is an excellent reference tool for any UNIX administrator,
user, or manager. It explains the elementary aspects
(e.g., the keyboard character tilde ~ and its uses)
and the more complex (e.g., sockets) The authors include
entries pertaining to the C and LISP programming languages
and identify many members of the original UNIX development
team. This dictionary presents a clearly written, extensive,
and superb resource for anyone working in the UNIX/C
environment.<P>

<B><I>The Internet Roadmap</I><br>
Third Edition<br>
by Bennett Falk<br>
Sybex<br>
ISBN 0-7821-1890-9<br>
$16.99</B><P>

The third edition of The Internet Roadmap features a
reorganization of the topics in the previous version
plus a modification and expansion of the existing information.
These changes reflect the evolution of the Internet
itself. Falk divided the book into three sections:
Introducing the Internet; The Internet Community's
Applications: The World Wide Web, Gopher, and NetNews;
and Internet Fundamentals: FTP, E-mail, and Telnet.
In the first section, the author describes the Internet,
demonstrates some of its capabilities, and analyzes
how it works. The second chapter details how to establish
an Internet connection. The second and third sections,
which form the principle portion of the book, illustrate
the essential utilities every Internet user needs:
the World Wide Web, Gopher, Usenet, ftp (File Transfer
Protocol), electronic mail, and telnet. Veronica, Jughead,
and Archie are also discussed. Falk demonstrates how
to choose a Web browser and search the Web with ease.
He also describes different gophers, how to use them,
and discusses Usenet, newreaders, and alternative methods
for reading the news. The third section explains the
mechanics, importance, and options connected with ftp,
email, and telnet.
The Internet Roadmap, Third Edition, is an excellent
and informative guide. Its design allows the reader
to access the most important utilites of the Internet
quickly and simply. Falk presents many diagrams, figures,
tables, and tips to reinforce the logical and well-written
text. Many of the Internet's more complex aspects and
more recent developments are addressed in shaded sidebars.
This edition of The Internet Roadmap is a notable and
straightforward addition to the Internet library.<P>

<B><I>Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats</I><br>
Second Edition<br>
by James D. Murray and William vanRyper<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-161-5<br>
$79.95<br>
CD-ROM Included<br>

The previous edition of the Encyclopedia of Graphics
File Formats (1994) was amazingly complete. In addition
to providing detailed information for 90 individual
file formats, Murray and vanRyper presented an overview
containing an Introduction, Computer Graphics Basics,
Bitmap Files, Vector Files, Metafiles, Platform Dependencies,
Format Conversions, Working With Graphics Files, Data
Compression, and Multimedia. The second edition includes
even more specific graphics format entries and additional
revised information. New topics in the overview discuss
corruption, encryption, and viruses in graphics files,
Writing a File Format Specification, and Trademarks,
Patents, and Copyrights. The Data Compression chapter
also examines JBIG (Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group)
Compression, ART Compression, and Fractal Image Compression.
The individual entries include a summary table, an
overview, the format's file organization, file details,
and &quot;For Further Information.&quot; The summary
table lists the following information for each format:
the format name, aliases, type, colors, compression,
maximum image size, multiple images per file, numerical
format, originator(s), platform(s), supporting applications,
specification, code, or images on CD, references, usage,
and comments.
The accompanying CD-ROM contains the contents of the
entire book (more than 1,115 pages), a Web browser,
selected graphics images, utilities for Microsoft Windows,
MS-DOS, OS/2, Macintosh, and UNIX platforms, and updated
file format specifications from the vendors. The CD-ROM
can be accessed from Windows 95 and NT, Windows 3.1,
Macintosh, and UNIX. Because file formats change so
rapidly, O'Reilly has established the Graphics File
Formats (GFF) Web Center. In this way, readers can
keep up with new or revised formats, reference Frequently
Asked Questions (FAQs), and search the What's New area.
One of the co-authors, James Murray, will maintain
the GFF and users will be able to contact him with
questions or ideas.
The Encylopedia of Graphics File Formats, Second Edition,
is an exemplary contribution to the computer graphics
resource library. The meticulous presentation of the
information not only applies to the overview chapters,
but also extends to each format entry. The text demonstrates
a straightforward and logical style. Anyone who has
attempted a file format conversion will immediately
recognize this book's merit. Those who frequently convert
file formats will discover a superior resource. The
Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats, Second Edition,
is an outstanding reference, both online and offline.<P>

<B><I>HTML Visual Quick Reference</I><br>
Second Edition<br>

ISBN 0-7897-0786-1<br>

Beginning and casual Web page designers are often overwhelmed
by the volume of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) books
available and also by the size of the individual texts.
However, several good HTML books demonstrate how to
use HTML without explaining everthing the language
can do. One of these slender, informative texts is
the HTML Visual Quick Reference by Sharf. The author
designed this book for the beginner or as a quick reference
guide. For the novice, it not only assists with Web
page creation, but also introduces elementary Web concepts
and reveals some options related to Web page design.
This second edition refines existing subjects through
supplementary topics (i.e., Backgrounds, Adding Space
Around Graphics, Horizontal Alignment of Text and Graphics,
and Line and Paragraph Breaks.) Sharf has also updated
the versions of the documented authoring software and
included a completely new section detailing tables.
Each entry consists of the title, a brief text explanation,
and examples of both code and its corresponding display.
The HTML Visual Quick Reference illustrates an individual
concept, its implementation, and its final appearance
(although different browsers will generate varied final
appearances). This is an excellent first book for the
serious programmer, guide for the casual user, or quick
reference for the professional. Sharf provides general
concepts for the uninitiated and confidence for those
not yet comfortable with the computer community. He
presents the procedures in a readable, straightforward
manner with clear examples. This is a superior introduction
to the Web, its appearance, and specific page creation.<P>

<B><I>Learning the HP-UX Operating System</I><br>

The new UNIX user often encounters difficulties navigating
through his or her system the first few times. Luckily,
there are several quality introductory texts to assist
the reader. However, the selection of texts narrows
if the new system is from Hewlett-Packard (HP-UX.)
The user can always use a generic beginning UNIX book,
but that approach may not specifically describe the
HP-UX system. Learning the HP-UX Operating System addresses
new users, experienced computer users without HP-UX
background, and those who research features and commands
as they need them. Poniatowski introduces the concepts
to the HP-UX novice in an easily readable style. He
discusses: HP-UX Components and Typical Installations;
Login and Password; The HP-UX File System; Permissions,
the ls Command, and File Name Expansion and Wild Cards;
File System Related Commands; HP-UX Tools; HP-UX Networking;
Shell Programming; HP Visual User Environment Introduction;
The vi Editor; HP-UX System Administration Introduction;
Programming With SoftBench; and a Command Summary.
Poniatowski introduces the reader to several popular
HP-UX installations and some of their capabilities.
As the author explains the different procedures and
concepts, he not only examines fundamental commands,
but also presents some advanced commands that the system
administrator may execute. This allows the reader to
view what happens both at his or her terminal and to
the system in general. Throughout the book, the author
displays the screen's appearance (both before and after
a command), the command outputs (using various options),
summary tables, and representative diagrams and figures.
Learning the HP-UX Operating System is a superb introduction
for the beginner. Poniatowski presents the material
logically, in a step-by-step format. He provides the
essential information, plus a little extra data for
the reader's benefit. In this way, the author helps
the user develop techniques to accomplish tasks for
both beginning and advanced applications. The chapters
on HP-VUE (Hewlett-Packard Visual User Environment)
and the vi editor merit particular attention. Poniatowski's
expertise and exemplary approach make Learning the
HP-UX Operating System a valuable and effective book.<P>

<B><I>Electronic Resume Writing: Creating A Winning
Resume for the New World of Job Seeking</I><br>
Second Edition<br>

Technological advances have changed many aspects of
our lives, and the popularity of the Internet has multiplied
the influence of new developments. However, resumes
and job searching have remained rather stable. Job
seekers typically rely on the print medium (usually
the newspaper), although online searches and submittals
are becoming more standard. Fax machines and computer
fax software have also simplified sending resumes and
cover letters, but the formats have remained consistent.
Applicants typically write resumes (ideally one page
and not more than two pages) in either a chronological
or functional style. Then, they hope that someone at
a company will read their resume, be impressed, schedule
an interview, and hire them. With the affordability
of scanners and the improvements of optical character
recognition (OCR) software, companies can now scan
resumes and search for key phrases when hiring, so
if a resume doesn't possess the right terms, it may
never be considered.
In the Electronic Resume Revolution, Kennedy and Morrow
address these issues and related practices. They demonstrate
how to write a resume and send it via email, examine
the new scanning procedures, and ways in which electronic
and scanned resume compositions differ. The authors
discuss: The Resume That's Sweeping the Nation, The
Technical Details, Key Concepts for Keywords, The Right
Look for Your New Resume, Floor Plans for a Keyword
Resume, Resumes by the Dozen, the Resume Sample Book,
The Video Resume Interview, and When Computers Don't
Give You A Passing Glance. Kennedy and Morrow first
illustrate the procedures that companies now use upon
receipt of a resume. Following an explanation of current
practices, they demonstrate several ways to ensure
your resume is viewed in the most favorable way. Submitting
resumes for several different positions within the
same company may now hurt, rather than help, the applicant.
Kennedy and Morrow review popular keywords and the
keyword resume format, and discuss formatting (or lack
of it), because formatting with many different or unusual
fonts can disable the OCR program's ability to read
your resume. They also present resume samples (approximately
30) and describe solutions to persistent problems.
The authors examine current problems for the job seeker
in today's market and provide methods for applicants
to circumvent these obstacles. They discuss these procedures
clearly, furnishing several types of examples. The
text is well written and offers practical solutions
for many different types of jobs, applicants, and situations.
The authors' knowledge and expertise in this field
is evident throughout the book. The Electronic Resume
Revolution: Creating A Winning Resume for the New World
of Job Seeking is an outstanding book that should be
read by everyone in today's job market. <P>
