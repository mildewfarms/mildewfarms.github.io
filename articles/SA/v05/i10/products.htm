<B>Walnut Creek Upgrades FreeBSD</B><P>

Walnut Creek CDROM in association with the FreeBSD Project,
has upgraded
FreeBSD, a 4.4 BSD Lite-based UNIX-like operating system
for PCs.
FreeBSD comes with a full development environment with
C/C++ and FORTRAN
compilers and debuggers. FreeBSD includes BSD networking
and services
like NFS, NIS, SLIP/PPP and IP routing /firewall security
features. The
X Window System (XFree86 3.1.2), USENET News, UUCP,
email software, and
graphical utilities are also included. FreeBSD installs
alongside other
operating system such as DOS and Windows and shares
DOS files both on
the local disk and over the network with SAMBA and PCNFS.
Also SCO,
Linux, and BSD/OS emulation lets FreeBSD run executables
from these
systems. Full source code is provided.<P>

FreeBSD 2.1 includes a revamped VM system with a merged
VM/file buffer
cache that improves performance and reduces the memory
footprint. Other
features of FreeBSD 2.1 include NIS client and server
support,
transaction TCP support, dial-on-demand PPP, an improved
SCSI subsystem,
early ISDN support, support for FDDI and Fast Ethernet
(100 Mbit)
adapter, and support for the Adaptec 2940 (WIDE and
narrow) and 3940
SCSI adaptors. Additionally, FreeBSD 2.1 offers a collection
of ported
software programs. The 350 programs range from http
servers to games,
languages, and editors. The software collection requires
10 Mb of
storage, and all ports are expressed as &quot;deltas&quot;
to their original
sources.<P>

FreeBSD is free on the Internet at ftp.freebsd.org.
A CDROM version of
FreeBSD is available from Walnut Creek CDROM. For more
information,
contact Walnut Creek CDROM, 4041 Pike Lane, Ste. D,
Concord, CA 94520;

GOConnect acts as a &quot;wizard&quot; to walk users
through prompts for the
information required for specific connections. GOconnect
can be used to
deploy large numbers of remote users, to automate an
individual user's
simple or complex connections, or as a connection engine
into X
Window-compliant applications.<P>

GO-Global supports Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows
NT, Workgroups, and
OS/2. GO-Global also supports SunOS, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX,

<B>Amdahl Introduces Fibre 2000 Storage Array Series</B><P>

Amdahl Corporation has introduced the Fibre 2000 Storage
Array Series
for use on Solaris operating systems. The Fibre 2000
supports data
warehousing and other applications the require high
throughput. The
Fibre 2000 can be configured with the following RAID
levels, 0, 1, or, 5
and uses 25 Mbps fiber channels<P>

For protection against a disaster, the Fibre 2000 arrays
can be
connected to a server located in an alternate building
up to two
kilometers away. The Fibre 2000 includes an intelligent
controller, with
a nonvolatile cache that off-loads much of the I/O processing
burden
from the server CPU. When used with A+FailSafe software,
the Fibre 2000
Storage Array Series supports &quot;hot spares&quot;
and a dual-ported controller
for failover protection. The &quot;hot spare&quot; option
lets customers choose
the exact time to replace a faulty disk. Because the
hot spare is
activated immediately, data is rebuilt, and RAID protection
is restored.
Also, a GUI interface tool lets the user monitor status,
tune
performance, and reconfigure the system while continuing
to let users
access their data.<P>

The Fibre 2000 Storage Array Series is available in
three models, the
2100, the 2200, and the 2500. The Model 2100 array uses
up to thirty 2.2
Gb low-profile 3.5-inch drivers. The Model 2200 supports
scalability for
datacenter applications requiring multi-terabytes of
storage by
utilizing up to thirty-six 9 Gb, 5.25-inch drivers.
Both models support
disk replacement without taking the system down or rebooting.
The Model
2500 combines the Fibre 2000 controller with hot pluggable
disk drives
and with redundant &quot;hot&quot; pluggable power supplies
and fans. The 2500
supports 3.5 inch 4.2 GB disk drives. The Fibre 2000
Storage Array
Series integrates with the Sun Microsystems line of
Ultra Enterprise
servers.<P>
