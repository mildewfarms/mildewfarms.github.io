This month I reviewed TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 3,
TCP for
Transactions, HTTP, NNTP, and the UNIX Domain Protocol,
by W. Richard
Stevens (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series),
Internet in
Plain English Second Edition, by Bryan Pfaffenberger
(MIS Press),
WebMaster Windows: How To Build Your Own World Wide
Web Server Without
Really Trying, by Bob LeVitus and Jeff Evans (Academic
Press
Professional), Programmer's Guide to Online Resources,
by Bob Kochem
(John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.), and UNIX Tamed, by Rodney
Wilson (Prentice
Hall). I hope that you enjoy them as much as I did.<P>

<B><I>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 3: TCP for Transactions,
HTTP, NNTP, and the UNIX Domain Protocols</I><br>
by W. Richard Stevens<br>
Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series<br>
ISBN 0-201-63495-3<br>
$39.76</B><P>

The most recent addition to the TCP/IP Illustrated series
actually
covers three topics: T/TCP (TCP for transactions), TCP/IP
Applications,
specifically HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol, the
basis of the World
Wide Web) and NNTP (Network News Protocol, the foundation
for Usenet),
and the UNIX domain protocols. Each topic can be read
separately from
the other two topics. Stevens assumes that the reader
possesses a basic
understanding of the TCP/IP protocols and how they function,
whether
from experience or other TCP/IP books. This volume builds
on both TCP/IP
Illustrated, Volumes 1 and 2. The section on T/TCP refers
to both
previous volumes. The segment of HTTP and NNTP was initially
started in
Volume 1, and the UNIX domain protocols were originally
scheduled for
Volume 2, but canceled due to space limitations. Throughout
the text,
Stevens refers both to previous material and to sections
appearing in
this volume.<P>

Stevens is an extremely logical and precise author.
Therefore, in both
the introduction to the book and in the T/TCP Introduction,
he defines
what a transaction is for the duration of the book:<P>

&quot;...the term transaction means a request sent by
a client to a server
along with the server's reply&quot; (p. 3).<P>

TCP for transactions (T/TCP) is an alternative to TCP
and varies

slightly from the TCP procedure. As a result, it retains
TCP's
reliability, while increasing both speed and efficiency.
It also reduces
the number of packets needed. In chapter 1, T/TCP, TCP,
and UDP
processes are compared. Chapters 2 through 4 describe
the T/TCP Protocol
and Examples. The second section (chapters 5 through
12) examines the
T/TCP implementation. (This is the actual implementation
as it exists
within the 4.4BSD-Lite networking code.)<P>

The second topic, Additional TCP Applications, discusses
HTTP: HyperText
Transfer Protocol, Packets Found on an HTTP Server (demonstrating
how a
busy HTTP server actually works) and NNTP: Network News
Transfer
Protocol. This is not an explanation of a Web browser
or how to use the
Web. This details what is actually happening after a
user requests
access to a site until he receives the information on
his screen.<P>

The UNIX domain protocols are furnished by all UNIX
TCP/IP
implementations and are even on some non-UNIX implementations.
They use
the same sockets interface as TCP/IP and are a form
of IPC (interprocess
communication). The UNIX domain protocols are faster
than TCP/IP because
the data remains in one place, as in the X Window System
utilizing a
workstation. Stevens presents an introduction, the implementation,
and
I/O and Descriptor Passing for the UNIX domain protocols.
The Appendices
include Measuring Network Times and Coding Applications
for T/TCP.<P>

Stevens' writing is always amazing. He examines his
topics thoroughly,
presents them clearly, and identifies any problems that
he realizes the
reader could experience. His knowledge of the subject
remains
overwhelming, and he illustrates the concepts with figures
and diagrams
when possible and demonstrates how the source code operates
at every
opportunity. TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 3 is an exceptional
book. Anyone
and everyone who either works with TCP/IP or protocols
or is interested
in them should carefully read this book both for its
presention
technique and its extensive information.<P>

<B><I>Internet In Plain English<br>
Second Edition</I><br>
by Bryan Pfaffenberger<br>
MIS Press<br>
ISBN 1-55828-439-7<br>
$19.95</B><P>

In the beginning paragraphs of the introduction, Pfaffenberger
demonstrates the computer user's need for an Internet
dictionary. Anyone
accustomed to the Internet's operations can converse
in acronyms
reminiscent of Lewis Carroll's nonsense poetry. However,
without the
definitions of these acronyms and an understanding of
their related
concepts, the user cannot utilize the advantages that
the Internet
offers.<P>

The second edition retains the organization of the original
text.
Pfaffenberger presents an acronym finder, an abbreviation
finder, the
dictionary contents, and a topical index. The acronym
finder is a
particularly useful section. Whereas some acronyms have
become general
language terms, such as BBS (bulletin board systems),
and some are
familiar, such as LED (light emitting diode) and MIME
(Multi-Purpose
Internet Mail Extensions), others will always need to
be referenced. A
dictionary may either list them by their acronym or
what the acronym
means.<P>

Pfaffenberger updated Internet In Plain English to reflect
the current
emphasis on the World Wide Web and other recent developments
pertaining
to the Net. He provides Tips, Do, and Do Not Do hints
as additional
information throught the book. Tips detail practical
ideas and the Do
and Do Not Do hints offer netiquette practices. Every
Internet book
provides a section on netiquette, but these ideas demonstrate
its scope
in various activities. The second edition of Internet
In Plain English
is an excellent reference for any user.<P>

<B><I>WebMaster Windows: How To
Build Your Own World Wide Web
Server Without Really Trying</I><br>
by Bob LeVitus and Jeff Evans<br>
Academic Press Professional<br>
ISBN 0-12-445572-7<br>
$29.95<br>
CD-ROM Included</B><P>

The popularity of the World Wide Web not only applies

to window shopping
(or, more accurately, web browsing), but also includes
individual web
page creation. Surfing the net is no longer a spectator
sport. Once a
user decides to implement his or her own home page,
the procedure can
appear confusing. In WebMaster Windows, LeVitus and
Evans simplify the
process. The authors begin with a history of the Web.
Assuming that
everyone has read at least one history of the Internet
somewhere, they
concentrate on the Web history alone and its size, both
past and
present. They also demonstrate how the reader may determine
the current
size of the Internet and why this is an important factor.
The second
chapter discusses provider connections and related costs.
The authors
describe the different options available (if money is
no object) and the
alternatives (for those on a tight budget.)<P>

Chapter three, Introduction to HTML (HyperText Markup
Language) provides
the essential instructions for programming a Web page.
The introduction
made this reviewer smile for several reasons: first,
a reference to the
early word processing days evoked pleasant memories
of nroff and troff;
second, the sample HTML page reminded me of a shell
script; and third,
the authors used &quot;&lt;grin&gt;.&quot; (Friends
often ask me &quot;Do you KNOW that you
use online abbreviations in snail mail?&quot;) Levitus
and Evans present a
logical, straightforward approach to HTML, demonstrating
its elements
and corresponding HTML source with the resulting Web
page.<P>

The following chapter features the more advanced capabilities,
including
forms, scripts, and the CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
that allows the
exchange of data between the server and scripts. A form
may request
information, such as a survey; the data is gathered
by a script, and the
results are delivered to the server through different
CGIs, depending on
the platform used. The final chapters discuss the Windows,
Windows 95,
and Windows NT choices and contains interviews with
some of the people
whose careers center around the Internet. The appendices
include a
glossary, Internet Providers, HTML Netscape Extensions,
the WebMaster
Toolkit, and Announcing Your WWW Site and Then Some.
The CD-ROM contains
HTML editors, graphics tools, sound and movie tools,
and Web server
software.<P>

LeVitus and Evans have written an informative, enjoyable
book
illustrating how to construct a World Wide Web site.
Everything the user
needs (with the exception of a computer) is either in
the book or on the
enclosed CD-ROM. The directions are provided step-by-step,
logically,
and humorously. The sidebars (presented in boxes) furnish
worthwhile
suggestions and also a laugh. One of my favorites begins:<P>

&quot;In case you've been dead and didn't know, Windows
95 is Microsoft's new
32-bit operating system....&quot; (p. 140).<P>

WebMaster Windows details the building of a Web site
without confusing
or boring the reader. I highly recommend it!<P>

<B><I>Programmer's Guide to Online
Resources</I><br>
by Bob Kochem<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.<br>
ISBN 0-471-12852-X<br>
$24.95</B><P>

The Internet keeps expanding; new ftp, telnet, gopher,
and World Wide
Web sites are created daily. Additionally, the online
services
reorganize frequently, with new forums and message boards
to assist the
user. Software and hardware support is readily available,
from the
vendors or other users, but locating the exact information
you want can
be difficult, even for the experienced researcher.<P>

Kochem has assembled the various types of references
used specifically
by programmers and organized them in a logical manner.
He first presents
an overview of the different resources: bulletin board
systems,
commercial online systems, and the Internet. The author
continues with
What's On Online Services, exploring the major online
providers
(CompuServe and America Online), new services (the Microsoft
Network and
the Interchange), and services originated by publishers
(Bix and
Ziffnet). (Prodigy and Genie were not included because
this reference is
primarily for programmers.)<P>

Chapter three examines the Internet: its capabilities
and its
limitations. (Yes, it DOES have limitations!) This chapter
includes a
short UNIX command summary and a brief description of
Internet basics.
Kochem also addresses vendors online and includes a
minidirectory of
some of the vendors. A Web site address is listed that
maintains a
larger directory of vendors with their own Web sites.<P>

The author demonstrates how to find user groups and
presents some of the
more popular ones. Kochem then illustrates what magazines
or magazine
forums are available to the programmer and includes
their addresses. The
rest of the book contains resources for diverse topics:
programming
languages, generic operating systems and environments,
computer
platforms, graphics, multimedia, virtual reality/worlds,
games
development, security, encryption and (anti-) virus,
networking and
telecommunications, and databases. The appendices provide
top sites and
Important Internet Lists. The references listed specialize
in
programmers, their needs, and interests. Kochem does
not limit the
resources to Web sites, Internet addresses, or Bulletin
Board Systems.<P>

Programmer's Guide to Online Resouces is an excellent
tool. It provides
a variety of topics specific to programmers' needs.
Each reference
includes clear instructions for accessing the site.
The text is well
written and will be an excellent addition to any programmer's
library.<P>

<B><I>UNIX Tamed</I><br>
by Rodney Wilson<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-443037-9<br>
$24.95</B><P>

As a book review columnist, I often get requests for
book titles on
specific topics. The most frequent request refers to
beginning UNIX
books. This question originates with every level from
college students
to experienced system administrators. Often a company
has changed to the
UNIX operating system, and none of the employees are
familiar with it.
UNIX Tamed by Rodney Wilson presents a good first book
for UNIX users.
It can also be used for someone who needs information
but lacks a lot of
time to read.<P>

Wilson provides a basic introduction to necessary commands
and
file-handling methods. The concepts of permissions,
directories, and
linking are followed by an introduction to the Bourne
shell and its
environment, redirection, filters, and metacharacters.
Part 2, Moving
Ahead, describes the ex and vi editors and the Korn
shell (ksh).
Separate chapters on the Bourne and C shells examine
some of the
elements of shell programming and features exclusive
to the respective
shells. In Part 3, Getting Good, the reader learns some
advanced
commands (sort, find, the stream editor (sed) and the
awk programming
language).<P>

In Basic Programming Tools, Wilson discusses the construction
of binary
executables (mark this section, you will use it later
on!), the C
compiler, the make utility, the Revision Control System
(RCS), and
libraries. The Basic System Administration chapter addresses
the
bootstrap procedure, backup, printer configuration,
mounting file
systems, the X Window System, ftp, and telnet. The final
chapter
discusses the Practical Extraction and Report Language
(perl). The
appendices include exercise answers, a command reference,
and review
questions.<P>

Two qualities make this a good beginning book: the sections
are brief
(allowing the reader to take a small section or a larger
portion at a
time), and each segment has its own short exercises.
The text is
straightforward and presents many examples as the author
progresses from
the simple to the more complicated tasks. UNIX Tamed
is a beneficial
book for the beginner.<P>
