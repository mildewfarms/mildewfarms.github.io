<B>Qualix Releases NetProbe</B><P>

Qualix Systems Group has released NetProbe, a network
security analysis
tool. NetProbe scans the local network's address range
and detects host
misconfigurations that allow unauthorized remote access
from within or
outside the firewall. NetProbe runs 85 tests including
appropriate CERT
and CIAC advisories for remote access vulnerabilites.
NetProbe also
tests pingable hosts with no specification for machines
on the network
required. When the security analysis is complete, NetProbe
points to an
applicable advisory, which recommends the appropriate
security fix.<P>

According to the company, NetProbe runs a subset of
tests against 100
hosts in 2 minutes and all tests in 5 minutes. NetProbe
can also be
configured to repeatedly test for problems resulting
from new software
installations, ineffective security fixes, file restorations,
and
undetected intrusions. Other features of NetProbe include
a GUI and a
configuration file that lets the system administrator
tailor reports by
specific date, host, or test and output as ASCII or
HTML.<P>

NetProbe runs from a single SPARC workstation and tests
systems
accepting TCP/IP packets. Prices for NetProbe start
at $2,500, depending
on network size. For more information contact Qualix
