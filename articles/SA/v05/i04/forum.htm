<H1>Editor's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
When we started Sys Admin, four or five years ago,
we very rarely
encountered a full-time administrator. At trade shows
like Unix Expo,
when I'd ask attendees if they were system administrators,
they would
almost always answer no. Finally, I got smart and began
to ask &quot;Do you
ever do any system administration?&quot; That got a
positive answer much more
often.<P>

Frequently, the answer would be &quot;Yeah, I do all
the administration for
my office, but my real job is ...&quot; This attitude
birthed the message on
the back of our t-shirts: &quot;System Administration:
it's a dirty job but
someone said I have to do it.&quot; That line has always
gotten a chuckle at
shows like Unix Expo.<P>

At the San Diego Usenix technical conference, that same
t-shirt drew
some irritated groans rather than chuckles. For the
first time, I
encountered more than one full-timer who found the t-shirt
offensive,
rather than humorous.<P>

I think this marks an important transition in both system
administration
and the deployment of UNIX. At least for a significant
portion of the
Usenix attendees, system administration is their real
job. That's good;
the job is complex enough to deserve that kind of focus.
It's also a
sign that UNIX is being deployed in environments where
management canOt
hide the resource sys admin requirements by relying
on the
self-preserving behavior of programmers or the cheap
labor of grad
students.<P>

But, the professional, full-time administrator is still
more the
exception than the rule. SAGE (the sys admin SIG within
USENIX) is
particularly concerned with advancing the professionalization
of
administrators. In particular, they have a nice flyer
(&quot;Job Descriptions
for System Administrators&quot;) that gives job descriptions
for sys admins
with varying levels of sophistication. This brochure
can be a real help
to your personnel officer, or to you if you are trying
to decide on a
logical next step for increasing your skills. You can
find parts of this
in the SAGE web posting. Start at http://usenix.org
and follow the
links. Check it out. There's a lot of other useful information
there.<P>

And ... don't be offended if I still wear my t-shirt.
I and a lot of
part-time administrators still get a kick out of it.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Robert Ward<P>
