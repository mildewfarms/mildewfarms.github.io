<H1>Sidebar: Network Client Installation</H1><p>
<P>
Solaris is distributed on a CD-ROM. A year ago, when
I was upgrading
several clients from SunOS to Solaris, I used to have
to carry around a
CD-ROM drive, attach it to each workstation and verify
it, boot from the
CD-ROM and install the OS, then remove the drive and
move on to the next
workstation. Unfortunately, this method was slow (even
when I used a
double-speed drive), and required installing clients
in a linear
fashion. I have since then set up a server on the network
so that new
clients can boot directly from it. This tends to be
somewhat faster, and
several clients can be set up in parallel. You need
an install server on
the network, and if any clients are not on the same
Ethernet segment as
the install server, you must also have a boot server
on each segment.
The disk requirements are about 25 Mb for the boot server,
and about 320
Mb (including the boot directory) for the install server.<P>

Full instructions for setting up an install server (and
a boot server,
if needed) accompany the Solaris distribution media,
and the process is
fairly simple. I used our primary NFS server as the
install server, and
my workstation as a boot server for my subnet. I have
only had occasion
to install one client with this system so far, but it
is very easy once
the servers are set up. Just type boot net from the
PROM prompt, and
from there it's the same as a regular install.<P>
