<H1>New Products</H1><p>
<P>
<B>Alphatronix Upgrades Inspire</B><P>

Alphatronix has upgraded Inspire, its integrated suite
of storage
management software. Inspire is based on an object-oriented
architecture
that lets companies centralize management and administration
of their
data, while keeping their data and storage applications
distributed.
Features of Inspire Version 2.0 include High Availability
SME
capability, SME Developer Interface, Peek Mode Data
Access, and
Pre-Stage Migration.<P>

The first module, the High Availability SME, provides
automatic
protection and database recovery. If part of the database
is corrupted
or accidentally destroyed, it is automatically rebuilt
using a
replicated database copy and automatic journal entries.
The High
Availability SME resides in the Inspire Storage Management
Engine (SME)
and tracks the location of files. The second module,
SME Developer
Interface, lets non-Alphatronix applications integrate
with Inspire.
This interface lets document management or imaging applications
directly
call Inspire storage management functions.<P>

Another feature of Inspire 2.0 includes Peek Mode Data
Access, which
lets users read migrated data directly from secondary
storage without
first moving the data back to the hard disk. According
to Alphatronix,
this feature can increase access time by a factor of
10 or more and can
reduce the disk capacities needed for applications such
as imaging and
document management. The last feature, Pre-Stage Migration,
automatically &quot;pre-stages&quot; files to their
migration designation (without
deleting them from the hard disk) so that when new data
fills a hard
disk, the &quot;pre-staged&quot; files can be instantly
flushed. Another feature,
disk caching for tape migration, automatically queues
files to be
migrated to tape in a cache until the cache is full.<P>

Inspire 2.0 applications share a common GUI and can
share storage
peripherals. Inspire 2.0 runs on Solaris 2 servers that
may be directly
attached to a TCP/IP network for heterogeneous, multiplatform
support.<P>

Pricing for Inspire 2.0 is modular and is based on application
and
capacity needs. For more information contact Alphatronix,

<B>McAfee Announces WebShield</B><P>

McAfee has announced WebShield, a secure antivirus software
tool for
network firewall and Internet gateways. WebShield is
a companion
product to WebScan, McAfee's antivirus scanner for Web
browsers.
Together with WebScan, WebShield provides protection
against
virus-infected SMTP, ftp, and HTTP traffic on a TCP/IP
network.
WebShield's antivirus detection can be updated each
month with McAfee's
virus signature updates.<P>

WebShield resides independent of the network firewall
and uses a
dual-homed architecture system. Dual-homed architecture,
which uses two
network interface cards, provides an added barrier to
potentially
infected traffic. Network traffic is scanned between
the cards, alerting
administrators of any detected viruses. For further
security, only the
administrator has access to the WebShield system, and
this access is
granted with a one-time password key that generates
a randomly different
password each time it's used. WebShield is transparent
to users and
requires no user training or IP address management.
WebShield's packet
filtering scanning engines scans all incoming and outgoing
traffic.<P>

In a related announcement, McAfee has announced that
Border Network
Technologies and Secure Computing, two firewall vendors,
have agreed to
enter into WebShield OEM agreements. Also,  McAfee has
entered into an
agreement with CheckPoint Software Technologies aimed
at ensuring the
interoperability of CheckPoint's FireWall-1 with WebShield.<P>

WebShield supports DOS, Windows 3.x, Windows 95, Windows
NT, UNIX, OS/2,
the Internet, and Macintosh. WebShield runs on hardware
supporting the
Intel compatible and DEC Alpha processor system. WebShield
supports most
TCP/IP Internet gateway environments including: Windows
NT, NetWare, Sun
Solaris, HP-UX, DEC Alpha, IBM AIX, Silicon Graphics,
and Berkeley
Systems Development. A WebShield subscription license,
which provides
two years of free updates and support, is priced at
$3,995. WebShield is
priced per gateway, and supports an unlimited number
of network attached
client workstations. For more information contact McAfee,
