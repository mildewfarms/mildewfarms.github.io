<H1>Editor's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
This is the last issue of Sys Admin that will carry
my name in the mast.<P>

I wrote and discarded several less abrupt introductory
paragraphs for
this editorial, but that's really what needs to be said
-- difficult as
it is.<P>

I've been central to the creation of four successful
technical
magazines: C/C++ Users' Journal, Windows Developer's
Journal, Network
Administrator, and Sys Admin. All except Network Administrator
are still
in publication. Although Sys Admin is neither the oldest,
nor the biggest, I
still draw a special satisfaction from its success.<P>

In Sys Admin's case, I feel more ownership for the concept
and more
affirmation that the concept was &quot;right.&quot;
More than with any of our
other magazines, I knew exactly what I wanted Sys Admin
to be and do.
And more than with any others, Sys Admin has succeeded
because it
conformed to that concept. It is an example of good
design. That's
gratifying.<P>

Despite my special affection for this magazine, a few
months ago I asked
Miller Freeman, Inc. to replace me. Simply put, I'm
not expert enough in
system administration to supply the technical leadership
the magazine
needs, and at this point in my life I'm not really motivated
to climb
that particular learning curve. I'm a programmer and
an engineer, not a
system administrator. It's one of those instances in
which the best you
can do is to let someone else do it.<P>

In this case, that someone else is eminently qualified.
Our new editor,
Ralph Barker, through his roles as a UNIX systems consultant
and system
administration trainer, has been immersed in system
administration since
1986. He has also served for four years as Directory
of Technical
Services for UniForum. Most recently, he has been working
as Technical
Editor for UNIX Review. He is definitely more fluent
in shell script
than I.<P>

So, this is farewell. Although I will be offering some
advice and
assistance during the transition, the next voice speaking
in this column
will be Ralph's, not mine. While I can, I'd like to
thank those who've
been especially important to me and to the magazine.<P>

Martha Masinton: thank you for being the real editor
while I ran the
company. I wish you success and satisfaction in your
new role.<P>

Larry Reznick: thanks for making us look more expert
than we really
were.<P>

Amber Ankerholz and Lori White: thanks for taking my
copy at bluelines,
and for tolerating all those sidebars.<P>

And perhaps most importantly, thanks to all our readers.
Without your
eagerness to learn, we wouldn't have any customers.
Without your
willingness to share, we wouldn't have any writers.
Without your
tolerance and support, letters to the editor would be
an inhumane hell.<P>

Thank you.<br>

Robert Ward<P>
