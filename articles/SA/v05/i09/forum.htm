<H1>Editor's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
I have followed the progress of Sys Admin from its
early days, so it is
with great enthusiasm that I assume the mantle of senior
editor. Robert
Ward and the magazine's editorial and production staff,
have done an
excellent job addressing the informational needs of
UNIX system
administrators. Together, the staff and I intend to
continue that
tradition and improve as we move forward.<P>

Speaking of forward movement, the industry and society
as a whole are
gulping down Web technology at a ravenous rate. The
marketing folks are
scrambling to understand the dynamics of this fast-moving
medium, while
behind the scenes, you, the system administrator, must
keep the systems
supporting all of this hustle and bustle up and running.
So, in the
October issue, we will examine a range of Web-related
topics to assist
you in that endeavor. That issue will include articles
about setting up
Web servers, Web security tips relating to the Common
Gateway Interface
(CGI), and the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL). We
will also discuss
connectivity issues - methods for estimating levels
of traffic and the
resulting impact on your ISP connections, as well as
how to control
bandwidth on your Web server.<P>

In November, the emphasis shifts to Security. Do you
remember when
security meant making sure that you did not have holes
in your uucp
setup and that passwords were being used properly? Although
password
policy enforcement is still a matter of concern, the
level of uucp-based
traffic has diminished greatly. Forward movement has
replaced much of
the uucp dial-up network with more complicated concerns.
Those concerns
include detecting intruders (or, would-be intruders
if you have done
well), monitoring the vulnerability of your systems,
and minimizing your
exposure to a variety of attack methods, such as IP-spoofing.<P>

December theme articles will cover performance and how
to maintain the
forward momentum of your systems. Although system and
network
performance may evoke yawns among certain job titles,
it is near and
dear to the hearts of most administrators. In the December
issue, we
hope to provide you with a few new holiday tunes - disk
tunes, kernel
tunes, and the like to keep your systems humming.<P>

The editorial calendar for 1997 looks even more interesting.
January
will kick off the year with our traditional Linux issue.
Other topics
for 1997 will include (in no particular order) system
administration
tools, output management (printers, fax, paging, etc.),
storage
management, security, back-up technologies, networking,
and
connectivity, just to name a few. You will also see
articles on
fast-moving technologies sprinkled throughout the year.
We plan to keep
the treatment of these themes at the hands-on level,
because that is the
type of coverage you have indicated is the most relevant
for you. Also,
based on reader survey results, we plan to broaden our
efforts to
provide you with product information - keeping the focus
on hardware and
software that directly relates to system administration.<P>

In short, we plan to make Sys Admin even more useful
to you in your
day-to-day endeavors, keeping the magazine at the top
of your must-read
stack. We understand that demands on your time and attention
are
becoming more complex as organizations strive to be
more cost-efficient
and competitive. We also understand that it is our job
to serve your
UNIX system administration information needs in a highly
relevant
manner. To better understand those needs, we will continue
to randomly
survey our readers on a periodic basis. If you happen
to receive one of
our reader surveys, we hope you will find the time to
let us know what
you expect from us.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Ralph Barker<P>
