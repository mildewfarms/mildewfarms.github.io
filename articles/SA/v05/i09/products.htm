<B>Aurora Software Announces SarCheck for HP-UX</B><P>

Aurora Software, Inc. has announced Version 2 of SarCheck,
for HP-UX
operating system versions 9.04+ and 10.01+. SarCheck
is a performance
management tool designed to assist the system administrator
in the
analysis of a UNIX system's performance by translating
sar reports into
plain English. SarCheck identifies performance bottlenecks,
recommends
specific parameter and hardware configuration changes,
and quantifies
the amount of remaining system capacity.<P>

SarCheck is an excellent way for system administrators
to save time and
learn more about how their systems work, because it
explains resource
utilization in plain English. SarCheck reports consist
of three sections
and a summary. The first section contains recommendations
that can be
used to improve system performances, such as tuning
kernel parameters,
balancing disk load, and increasing memory size or CPU
speed. The second
section is an analysis of all system resources monitored
by SarCheck.
This section contains insights that can help an administrator,
even when
no resource bottlenecks were detected. The final section,
Capacity
Planning, is used to approximate how large an increase
in workload a
system can support, based on the sar data being analyzed.<P>

A single SarCheck license for HP-UX begins at $600;
other licensing
options are available. Versions for other UNIX platforms
are available
or under development. For more information, contact
Aurora Software
Inc., P.O. Box 1033, Plaistow, NH 03865; (603) 382-4200;

pages to be printed. Jobs can be retained and reprinted.
Built-in
security insures that only authorized users have access
to printers,
print queues, and print job control. Printing bottlenecks
can be reduced
by associating multiple printers with a queue, so that
a large print job
will not delay all others in the queue. COS/Print distributes
printer
configuration details, providing for simplified administration.
An
administrator need add the details of a new printer
only once. Changes
can be made from any system on the network. Multiple
levels of security
provide flexible management and control.<P>

COS/Print provides three interface options: a command-line
interface, a
full-screen character interface, and a graphical user
interface.
COS/Print is available as a standalone product or as
part of OSM's
COSMOS systems management environment. COSMOS consists
of 13 application
areas, available independently but all sharing a common
look and feel.
Applications include: duty scheduling, backup/restore,

<B>Norman Data Defense Systems updates Norman Virus Control</B><P>

Norman Data Defense Systems, Inc. has announced Version
3.51 of Norman
Virus Control (NVC), which secures data against infection
by more than
9,000 viruses, including all known polymorphic strains.
NVC v3.51
provides protection against macro viruses and Windows
95 viruses.<P>

Microsoft Word macro viruses are a particular problem,
as they attack
data rather than executables, and because they can spread
across
platforms. The latest release of NVC addresses the security
risk posed
by the macro viruses as well as increasing the security
of Windows 95
data.<P>

Norman's NVC software combines high-speed scanning technology
with
behavior blocking to detect, identify, and remove viruses
to protect
data enterprise-wide. The scanner transparently detects
file and boot
sector viruses. A companion cleaning program disables
the viruses,
without disabling the user. Norman's Smart Behavior
Blocking uses AI
techniques to continually analyze the behavior of programs
and files
during execution. Infected portions of programs or files
are disabled
before they can infect other files and programs. Norman
Virus Control
workstation platform products communicate with NVC for
NetWare - Norman
FireBreak - a true NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) that
detects and
eliminnates viruses on NetWare Servers.<P>

NVC v3.51 supports networked Windows (95 and NT), DOS,
and OS/2
platforms. Pricing is per workstation with price dependent
on quantity.
Representative prices are $75 per workstation for 15
machines, or $11
per workstation at 1,500 machines. Behavior blocking
for Windows 95 and
NT will become available with the next update of NVC.

<B>Young Minds Announces UltraStudio Jukebox CD-Recording</B><P>

Young Minds, Inc., has announced the UltraStudio, a
CD-Recording system
that combines Young Minds' UNIX-based CD Studio CD-Recording
system with
its UltraCapacity CD-ROM Mass Storage Systems. Initially,
UltraStudio
will be available with the Pioneer DRM 5004x and NSM
Mercury 31
jukeboxes.<P>

UltraStudio consists of a CD-Recordable/CD-ROM jukebox,
a CD Studio
controller, MakeDisc premastering software, and CD-ROM
Mass Storage
software. Recording capability is provided by the MakeDisc
premastering
software running on the host workstation. Data to be
recorded can reside
anywhere on the network, and any user that can remotely
access the host
workstation can record discs. MakeDisc sends the premastered
data to the
CD Studio controller. While the premastering task can
run as a
background task, recording a CD places a large demand
on system
resources, particularly in multi-user, multi-tasking
environments such
as UNIX. Once the premastered image has been sent to
the controller,
Young Minds' controller technology off-loads the task
of actually
recording the disk and prevents data underrun.<P>

Yound Minds has also introduced StudioNT, a Windows
NT-based
CD-Recording System. For more information, contact Young
Minds, Inc.,
1906 Orange Tree Lane, Suite 240, Redlands, CA 92374;
