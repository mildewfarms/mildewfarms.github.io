This month has been a challenging and busy one, with
new UNIX books and
Java, CGI, and HTML books. I reviewed the HTML Sourcebook:
A Complete
Guide to HTML 3.0 Second Edition by Ian S. Graham (John
Wiley &amp; Sons,
Inc.), Integrating UNIX and PC Network Operating Systems
by William Lund
(Prentice Hall), CGI Programming on the World Wide Web
by Shishir
Gundavaram (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.), The Simple
Book: An
Introduction to Networking Management, Revised Second
Edition by
Marshall T. Rose (Prentice Hall), HTML: The Definitive
Guide by Chuck
Musciano and Bill Kennedy (O&iacute;Reilly &amp; Associates,
Inc.), Practical DCE
Programming by Charles Knouse (Hewlett-Packard Professional
Books,
Prentice Hall), UNIX System V Release 4: An Introduction,
Second Edition
by Kenneth H. Rosen, Richard R. Rosinski, James M. Farber,
and Douglas
A. Host (Osborne McGraw-Hill), and Hooked on Java
Creating Hot Web
Sites with Java Applets by Arthur van Hoff, Sami Shaio,
and Orca
Starbuck (Addison-Wesley). I hope that you enjoy the
reviews and hope
they assist you.<P>

Correction: In the May issue, I reviewed Actually Useful
Internet
Security Techniques by Larry J. Hughes, Jr. (New Riders,
ISBN
1-56205-508-9 $32.00) I incorrectly renamed it Actually
Useful Internet
Security Measures. I apologize to Mr. Hughes and New
Riders Press.<P>

<B><I>The HTML Sourcebook: A Complete Guide to HTML 3.0</I><br>
Second Edition<br>
by Ian S. Graham<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.<br>
ISBN 0-471-14242-5<br>
$29.95</B><P>

Since its creation, the World Wide Web (WWW) has provided
users with
information and entertainment. For some users, Web surfing
itself has
become a hobby. Professional Webmasters design, create,
and maintain
sites, and if a user wants a private home page, there
are services,
utilities, and documentation at his or her disposal.
HTML (HyperText
Markup Language) determines the appearance of the text
on the WWW page.
The first edition of The HTML Sourcebook included an
introduction to
HTML with examples: HTML In Detail, Uniform Resource
Locators (URLs),
HTTP and the Common Gateway Interface, HTML and CGI
Tools, HTML Editors
and Document Translations, Web Browsers and Helper Applications,
HTTP
Servers and Server Utilities, and Real World Examples.<P>

In the second edition, Graham expanded and reorganized
the material
significantly. The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and
the HTTP
(HyperText Transfer Protocol) both merit individual
chapters, and more
examples are featured throughout the book. The new version
contains:
Introduction to HTML and Document Design, The Design
of HTML Document
Collections, HTML in Detail, The Next Generation  HTML
3, Stylesheets
and Applets, URLs, HTTP, Communication with the Common
Gateway
Interface, CGI Programs and Tools, HTML and Web Utilities
and Tools, Web
Developer Resources, and Real-World Examples. Graham
discusses the
design of both single pages and Web collections, details
HTML syntax,
and illustrates how to add images, movies, and sound
elements. He
demonstrates how to convert existing text from other
formats into an
HTML document.<P>

The HTML Sourcebook: A Guide to HTML 3.0 provides an
excellent
reference. It should appeal to both beginning and experienced
Web
developers because it presents the language syntax,
corresponding
explanation examples, and recommended uses for each
element. Graham also
indicates current trends and future developments, noting
which features
are currently universally accepted. The references listing
Web sites at
the end of most of the chapters are extremely helpful,
and the second
edition's improved format makes it easier to read. The
second edition of
The HTML Sourcebook is an excellent reference and guide
for both casual
and professional Web developers.<P>

<B><I>Integrating UNIX and PC Network Operating Systems</I><br>
by William Lund<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-207374-9<br>
$35.40</B><P>

The UNIX system administrator often supports more than
one type of
operating system. Combining them into a single network
often leads to
disappointment and frustration if the administrator
is not aware of
potential interfacing difficulties. Lund presents an
overview of three
UNIX-based systems: Pacer Share, Netware for UNIXWare,
and LAN Manager
for UNIX. He begins with a brief examination of UNIX
and how an
additional operating system works with UNIX. The author
then
investigates each of the three network operating systems,
their
respective installations, configuration, and features.
Lund illustrates
how the network operating systems share files and other
resources,
identifies some differences between Ethernet and IEEE
802.3, and
concludes with some aspects to consider when planning
a similar
implementation.<P>

Lund addresses these concepts from the systems analyst&iacute;s
viewpoint.
Integrating UNIX and PC Network Operating Systems illustrates
topics
that should be considered before purchasing software.
Lund assumes that
the system administrator possesses all of the manuals
for each system
and does not repeat that information. The book's major
strength appears
in its many figures and diagrams. It is a good reference
source for
management prior to any installation or purchase, highlights
potential
advantages and drawbacks to each setup, and furnishes
a good general
research source, and basic introduction to the design
of these
implementations. However, this book does not provide
enough details for
a system administrator&iacute;s use.<P>

<B><I>CGI Programming on the World Wide Web</I><br>
by Shishir Gundavaram<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-168-2<br>
$29.95</B><P>

Part of the fascination of Web sites involves the ability
to present
dynamic data immediately. This information can be simple
(i.e., a
counter, date, or an average) or complex (i.e., a cartoon,
selected
painting, or a greeting card.) The CGI enables Web developers
to
implement all these features. A user accesses a Web
site and either
provides or requests information. The WWW browser forwards
either the
responses or the queries to the server, which calls
the CGI. In turn,
the CGI runs the appropriate program and returns the
requested
information to the server, which releases it to the
user. The WWW
gateways are essentially programs or scripts (in this
case, the terms
are interchangeable) written in one of several languages.
Gundavaram
primarily uses Perl and occasionally Tcl. However, he
notes the other
possibilities (Applescript, C/C++, C shell, and Visual
Basic) and
presents their respective advantages and disadvantages.
For the non-Perl
reader, he describes the examples thoroughly, to prevent
difficulty
understanding the functions of the programs.<P>

Gundavaram begins CGI Programming on the World Wide
Web with chapters
about input to and output from the CGI interface. He
continues with
Forms and CGI; Server Side Includes; Hypermedia Documents;
Advanced Form
Applications; Multiple Form Interaction; Gateways, Databases,
and
Search/Index Utilities; Gateways to Internet Information
Servers;
Advanced and Creative CGI Applications; and Debugging
and Testing CGI
Applications. The Appendices include: Perl CGI Programming
FAQ, Summary
of Regular Expressions, CGI Modules for Perl 5, CGI
Lite, and
Applications, Modules, Utilities, and Documentation.
The author presents
basic CGI concepts and demonstrates some elementary
procedures.
Gundavaram then describes more complex applications,
including counters,
Server Side Includes, CGI Includes, animation, and how
to implement
multiple forms using magic cookies. He often describes
several different
ways to achieve the same result, emphasizing the advantages
(and the
disadvantages) of the various methods.<P>

CGI Programming on the World Wide Web is a superb book.
Gundavaram
presents the concepts of CGI programming clearly and
precisely. He
demonstrates a technique, builds upon that for more
complex tasks,
provides different solutions to a single problem, and
emphasizes common
errors to avoid. CGI Programming on the World Wide Web
is a valuable
reference for anyone interested in the WWW; no Web developer
should be
without it.<P>

<B><I>The Simple Book
An Introduction to Networking Management</I><br>
Revised Second Edition<br>
by Marshall T. Rose<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-451659-1<br>
CD-ROM included</B><P>

This latest edition of The Simple Book features the
Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) and the latest modifications
to SNMPv2. The
previous second edition was published in 1994. When
SNMPv2 was released,
some elements did not perform as expected. In the preface
to this
revised second edition, Rose states:<P>

&quot;In particular, the approach taken to add security
features to SNMP had
proven unworkable in the field; and as a result, adoption
of SNMPv2 in
the marketplace was virtually nonexistent.&quot; [page
xxii]<P>

Therefore, the security features were removed from SNMPv2,
necessitating
a revised second edition. This new edition contains
the following
chapters: Introduction, Concepts, Information Model,
Administrative
Model, Operational Model, and the Future. The last chapter
includes the
Appendices: Internet Standards and Documents, Other
Resources, and
Network Management is Simple.<P>

Rose has streamlined the text, but has retained his
clarity, wit, and
style, resulting in an excellent resource. The newly
revised second
edition provides a current description of SNMPv2 and
its features.<P>

<B><I>HTML: The Definitive Guide</I><br>
by Chuck Musciano and Bill Kennedy<br>
O&iacute;Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-175-5<br>
$27.95</B><P>

The combination of browsers and the HTML source determines
the
appearance of Web pages: text, graphics, and hypertext
links. HTML
specifies the design of the text, the fonts, the layout,
and which other
sites can be immediately contacted. How a specific Web
browser
interprets the HTML document controls how the page ultimately
looks. The
same HTML document, formatted by different browsers,
may produce
contrasting results. HTML: The Definitive Guide addresses
the issues
that can cause these conflicts for the user.<P>

Musciano and Kennedy begin with the HTML 2.0 language
standard,
reminding the reader that although HTML 3.0 does exist,
it has not been
approved. (HTML 3.0 is currently a draft. However, many
of the new
features in 3.0 can be utilized as extensions. The authors
designate
which versions of the various browsers support individual
extensions.)
they demonstrate how to learn HTML, including: HTML
and the World Wide
Web; HTML Quick Start; Anatomy of an HTML Document;
Text Basics; Rules,
Images, and Multimedia; Links and Webs; Formatted Lists;
Forms; Tables;
Frames; Netscape Dynamic Documents; and Tips, Tricks
and Hacks. The
Appendices feature: the HTML Grammar, an HTML Tag Quick
Reference, The
HTML DTD (Document Type Definition), Character Entities,
and Color Names
and Values. An HTML Quick Reference Card is also provided.
Through
description, diagrams and examples, the authors illustrate
how to add
images, sound, and animation to an HTML document. They
explain the
concepts of dynamic information, utilizing Server Push
and Client Pull,
and the effective design of forms.<P>

HTML: The Definitive Guide discusses every topic connected
with Web page
creation: dynamic information, Java applets, adding
multimedia,
hyperlinks, effective design principles, and specific
browser
preferences. Musciano and Kennedy emphasize HTML's functions,
its
primary features, and secondary capabilities. The Web's
popularity is
rapidly expanding; it has become an entertainment, information,
and
marketing resource. As more users become actively involved
in the makeup
of the Web, an understandable reference is needed. HTML:
The Definitive
Guide is a superior book, written in an easily readable
style for any
level of user. The serious developer will find its HTML
grammar, tag
reference, design techniques, and browser specifics
valuable; the casual
author will appreciate the book's clarity, organization,
and abundant
examples. Every Web surfer will enjoy this outstanding
book!<P>

<B><I>Practical DCE Programming</I><br>
by Charles Knouse<br>
Hewlett-Packard Professional Books<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-324419-9<br>
$34.40<br>
Disk included</B><P>

The Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) from the
Open Software
Foundation (OSF) is currently being utilized in client-server
application development. DCE can solve many of the problems
associated
with client&ntilde;server applications. However, because
these features are
already in place, the programmer must maintain or connect
DCE calls.
This book addresses the elements in the Distributed
Computing
Environment (both DCE 1.0 and DCE 1.1) that client&ntilde;server
programming
employs, utilizing C code examples.<P>

Knouse introduces the different client&ntilde;server
types, explains DCE
components, and presents the basis of the Room Schedule
example.
Following this preamble, each chapter details various
DCE features and
builds upon the Room Schedule application. Other DCE
subjects include:
Remote Procedure Calls, Interface Definition, Basic
Client and Server
Setup, Client and Server Setup Using CDS (Cell Directory
Service),
Security, Server Management in DCE 1.1, Objects and
Managers, Access
Control, and Threads. The Appendices contain Hints for
Debugging DCE
Applications and the Room Schedule Application. The
accompanying
diskette has the source files for the sample applications
in MS-DOS
format, which have been saved in UNIX tar format.<P>

This book provides an excellent guide for programmers
implementing
client&ntilde;server applications in the OSF/DCE 1.0
or 1.1 environment. It is
well written, assumes that the reader knows C programming
and is also
familiar with the general concepts of remote procedure
calls,
client&ntilde;server implementation, and security. Knouse
demonstrates the
benefits of using OSF/DCE and client&ntilde;server applications
together and
discusses the various techniques. Practical DCE Programming
is an
excellent resource for a specialized field, and is an
excellent choice
for any programmer's library.<P>

<B><I>UNIX System V Release 4: An Introduction</I><br>
Second Edition<br>
by Kenneth H. Rosen, Richard R. Rosinski,
James M. Farber, and Douglas A. Host<br>
Osborne McGraw-Hill<br>
ISBN 0-07-882130-4<br>
$39.95</B><P>

This new edition presents an introductory UNIX book
that is not limited
to the novice. In the past 5 years, many new systems,
languages, and
utilities have developed. Although some of the products
are older than 5
years, the affordability of hardware, particularly large
hard drives and
CD-ROM drives, now make them more available to the general
public.
Rosen, Rosinski, Farber, and Host divided this second
edition into nine
sections: Basics, Text Editing and Processing, Networking,
Tools, System
Administration, User Environments, Development, UNIX
Variants, and the
Appendices. The Internet is now covered (in the networking
section), new
tools include the Perl, TCI, and C++ languages, and
UNIX Variants
discuss Linux, UNIXWare, Solaris, HP-UX, and IRIX. The
appendices
encompass How to Find out more, Compatibility Packages,
a Glossary,
Major Contributors to the UNIX System, and Command Summaries.<P>

UNIX System V Release 4 : An Introduction (Second Edition)
is an
outstanding book. The authors explain the concepts in
a logical,
readable style, and use examples well and often. They
demonstrate how to
accomplish a task and show how one way is preferable
to another. Rosen,
Rosinski, Farber, and Host have produced a superb text
for the beginner
or the experienced user. I highly recommend it.<P>

<B><I>Hooked on Java
Creating Hot Web Sites with Java Applets</I><br>
by Arthur Van Hoff, Sami Shaio, and Orca Starbuck<br>
Sun Microsystems, Inc.<br>
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company<br>
ISBN 0-201-48837-X<br>
$29.95<br>
CD-ROM included</B><P>

This informal excursion into the Java side of the World
Wide Web
features ways to use Java applets, explains a little
about its
beginnings, and simply describes the language. Written
by three members
of the Sun Java Programming Development Team, Hooked
on Java simply
tells what Java is, how it can be used, and how to use
it without
programming it. The volume of information available
about Java can be
overwhelming; there are now Java columns, Java magazines,
Java books,
and Java software. The authors of Hooked on Java don't
assume that
readers know anything about Java, but they do presume
that they would
like to know something. Hooked on Java includes six
chapters
(Introducing Java and Java Applets, Java and the Internet,
Applets
Explained, Cool Applets, Java in Depth, and Building
an Applet) and
seven appendices (an Applet Guide, Places to Go, Source
Code, javac,
java, Appletviewer, and Applet Tag Definition.)<P>

Because Java is relatively new, van Hoff, Shaio, and
Starbuck explain
how Java began and introduce Duke, the Java mascot.
The authors provide
a brief introduction to Java, noting the important definitions
in the
margins, and also present the history (enter Duke).
They briefly address
the Java language and demonstrate how to use an applet
with or without
programming it. They show how to include an applet on
a Web page and
provide some &quot;cool applets&quot; to use. The concluding
chapters discuss the
language in more depth and illustrate how to build your
own applet. The
Applet Guide is a quick reference to the furnished applets.
There are
also Web addresses (for further information) supplied
throughout the
book, the source code for applets introduced in the
concluding chapter,
the man pages for the Java interpreter, compiler, and
Appletviewer, and
the document type definition for the Java applet tag.
The CD-ROM
contains Java applets, HTML pages with Java, Java source
code, the final
release of the Java Developer's Kit for Windows 95,
Windows NT, Solaris
2.x, and online documentation.<P>

Hooked on Java is a fun book. The authors present a
low-key introduction
to Java, with an emphasis on the less serious Java applications.
This is
an outstanding book for anyone interested in the Internet,
animation, or
object-oriented programming. Shiao, van Hoff, and Starbuck
demonstrate
how Java can be used, how to use it without programming
it, and how to
program it. It is a gentle introduction and a superb
book.<P>
