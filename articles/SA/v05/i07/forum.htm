<H1>Editor's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
Earlier this year, I attended a Usenix conference and
noticed that many,
if not most, of the presenters were using a web browser
as their
presentation vehicle. By that, I mean the presenters
had developed their
visual aids as HTML documents hosted on their notebooks
and displayed
via some projection TV. In many cases, the speaker would
tell the
audience that the &quot;slides&quot; were also available
for downloading or
viewing at their web site. I thought, &quot;that's clever.&quot;<P>

About two months later, I attended Software Development
'96 and noticed
several presenters doing the same thing. Oddly enough,
that time I
thought, &quot;that's significant.&quot; I guess it's
a matter of cognitive
dissonance. Seeing a bunch of UNIX hacks doing the obvious
(i.e., using
a presentation engine_read web browser_to do presentations)
with a tool
from the UNIX environment seemed natural enough. Seeing
a bunch of
Windows and DOS hacks doing the same thing seemed like
a event with
significant portent.<P>

These two incidents aren't the only signs that something
significant is
going on. In December, I noticed a Florida mall kiosk
that used Mosaic
to present hypertext information about various merchants.
The CD-ROM
based proceedings at SD '96 were HTML-coded. If you've
been reading past
issues of this magazine carefully, you noticed several
stories about
companies that are using HTML for internal documents
and data access
engines. Compuserve recently announced that it will
convert to HTML, and
AOL has made a similar move.<P>

The significance of these developments is that we are
(finally) seeing
rapid convergence upon a standard for coding presentation
(SGML/HTML).
So far in the &quot;computer revolution&quot; we've
seen this kind of convergence
in data storage (ascii), information retrieval (sql),
and data
transmission and networking (IP), to name a few. This
type of
convergence always has radical impact upon markets and
models. In fact,
some authors have argued that &quot;the information
age&quot; is really the result
of information transmission and information storage
converging upon a
standard representation.<P>

Thus, although doing so risks feeding the hysterical
web frenzy, I must
point out that web browsers are, indeed, a big deal.
Yes, they let you
access a huge, unstructured, chaotic ocean of sometimes
useful,
frequently useless &quot;information&quot; on the Internet.
But that isn't such a
big deal in my book. What's important is that they also
implement (for
free) a general purpose presentation engine that will
drive the
acceptance of a common presentation markup language.
Help engines,
desktop publishing systems, visual aid authoring tools,
CD-ROM
presentation engines, interactive query systems, bulletin
board systems,
and other &quot;specialized&quot; presentation markets
will all be radically
affected.<P>

I have for some time been following SGML (HTML's meta-language)_watching
for better support in DTP tools as a signal that it
might fill this
role. It looks like we're getting the less capable HTML
instead. That's
okay by me. HTML is not everything I'd like in a media-independent
presentation language, but it's an adequate starting
point and already
has a huge user base. That &quot;critical mass&quot;
of users will drive the
enhancements necessary to address the most significant
cross-media
limitations.<P>

If you haven't thought about how a &quot;presentation
standard&quot; affects your
product or improves communication in your company, it's
time to do so.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Robert Ward<P>
