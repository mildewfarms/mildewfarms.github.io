third utility,
Analyse filesystem, is a smart fsdb utility. This utility
checks the
inodes to find deleted data blocks with valid data-pointers.
The Analyse
filesystem utility can also reconstruct the pathname
of deleted files
and copy the deleted file back to the disk.<P>

The Filesystem Utilities from Compunix can be used through
the SMIT
interface or from the command-line interface. The Filesystem
Utilities
