<H1>Internet Security Information Sources</H1><p>
<P>
William Steen and Emmett Dulaney<P>

Keeping up to date on the latest in security trends
and breaches can be
a laborsome job for a system administrator. Such concerns
become
especially high priorities when part of your network
is exposed through
an Internet connection associated with a Web server.
Fortunately, there
are a number of organizations that specialize in providing
users with
bulletins and advice on Internet security. They are
basically divided
between government-sponsored groups such as the Computer
Emergency
Response Team (CERT), university organizations, such
as COAST, and
vendors. All of these organizations can help you protect
your systems or
deal with intrusions. Vendors typically offer free security
bulletins to
recipients of the appropriate mailing list, along with
a Web/ftp archive
of previous bulletins.<P>

This article provides a review of the major sites of
interest that
readers may find useful, and a listing of pertinent
security-related
RFCs.<P>

<B>AT&amp;T</B><P>

For information on research being conducted at AT&amp;T
- including the new
(so-called) java-killer language, Inferno, (and its
operating system
counterpart, Inferno), check out the Web site at
http://www.research.att.com/ or the ftp site at
ftp://Research.att.com/dist/internet_security.<P>

<B>bugtraq</B><P>

bugtraq is a popular mailing list that involves detailed
discussion of
Unix vulnerabilities. The amount of email traffic generated
by this
source is quite substantial. To subscribe, send the
text subscribe
bugtraq to: listserv@netspace.org.<P>

<B>CERT</B><P>

The U.S. Computer Emergency Response (CERT) Team was
founded in 1989 by
the U.S. Department of Defense to protect the infrastructure
of the
Internet. Situated at Carnegie-Mellon University, in
Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, CERT consists of about a dozen employees
who respond to
reports from Internet users regarding network security,
issuing
bulletins, notifying vendors, characterizing the state
of the Internet
from a security standpoint, working with the mass media
to publicize and
address concerns, and researching solutions to Internet
security
problems. CERT is frequently mentioned in media reports
from
publications such as the New York Times and Scientific
American.<P>

CERT has one of the largest mailing lists for security
advisories, with
more than 100,000 subscribers. Anyone can subscribe.
The CERT ftp
archive contains a wide range of security programs,
as well as every
advisory and bulletin that CERT has issued.<P>

The CERT group recommends encrypting security information
before
emailing; they support DES, PGP, and PEM. They have
a 24-hour hotline at
(412) 268-7090. CERT advisories are posted on comp.security.announce.
The ftp address is ftp://info.cert.org; email: cert@cert.org.<P>

<B>CIAC</B><P>

The U.S. Department of Energy's Computer Incident Advisory
Capability
(CIAC) group was created in 1989 in response to the
Internet Worm. It
primarily serves the Department of Energy from its Lawrence
Livermore
National Laboratory site, but also provides email advisories
and an
ftp/Web site for anyone on the Internet. The Web offers
advisories,
security documents, and ftp links to many significant
programs.<P>

The ftp address is ftp://ciac.llnl.gov/pub/ciac. The
Web address is
http://ciac.llnl.gov; email: ciac@llnl.gov.<P>

<B>COAST</B><P>

The Purdue University COAST project was founded by Eugene
Spafford. It
stands for Computer Operations, Audit, and Security
Technology and is
dedicated to improving network security. The COAST Web
site features
links to large numbers of security sites. There is also
a comprehensive
ftp archive and one of the largest collections of papers
and tools on
the topic of network security.<P>

COAST also issues a newsletter, works closely with major
companies and
government agencies, and has created a number of useful
tools. The ftp
address is: ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu. The Web site
is:
http://www.cs.purdue.edu/coast/coast.html; email:
coast-request@cs.purdue.edu.<P>

<B>Cygnus</B><P>

Cygnus is a vendor of GNU and Keberos-related products
and services. For
information on Kerberos, go to the Web site
http://www.cygnus.com/data/cns. Additional Kerberos
information can be
obtained from MIT at: ftp://athena-dist.mit.edu \ /pub/ATHENA.<P>

<B>8lgm - Eight Little Green Men</B><P>

This mailing list sends out advisories and exploit scripts
for Unix
vulnerabilities. They frequently adhere to full disclosure
on security
holes, so they are one of the best sources for understanding
the source
of vulnerabilities.<P>

To subscribe, send the text subscribe 8lgm-list to:
majordomo@8lgm.org.<P>

<B>FIRST</B><P>

The Forum of Incident and Response Security Teams, or
FIRST, is a
non-profit corporation of representatives from the vendors,
universities, national and international government
agencies, and large
private corporate computer users. A complete list of
members (currently
45 groups), along with contact information, is available.
CERT redirects
requests regarding security problems to the appropriate
FIRST member, so
that FIRST can address the issue and provide resolution
information to
CERT for advisories or bulletins.<P>

FIRST provides a forum for security response teams to
share security
information, tools, and practices. FIRST sponsors a
yearly week-long
meeting of representatives, a mailing list for discussions
among
members, and a point of contact for Internet users with
security
concerns.<P>

The ftp address is: ftp://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/pub/first.
The email
address is first-sec@first.org, and the web address
is:
http://www.first.org/first/.<P>

<B>RFC Index List</B><P>

The remainder of this article contains selected citations
for the past
few years of RFCs containing information pertinent to
security. RFCs are
listed in reverse numeric order (as of 5/20/1996), and
appear in the
following format:<P>

NUM STD Author 1, Author 5., &quot;Title of RFC,&quot;
Issue date. (Pages=##)
(Format=.txt or .ps) (FYI ##) (STD ##) (RTR ##) (Obsoletes
RFC####)
(Updates RFC####)<P>

<B>Key to Citations</B><P>

#### is the RFC number; ## p. is the total number of
pages.<P>

The format and byte information follows the page information
in
parenthesis. The format, either ASCII text (TXT) or
PostScript (PS) or
both, is noted, followed by an equals sign and the number
of bytes for
that version (PostScript is a registered trademark of
Adobe Systems
Incorporated). The example (Format: PS=xxx TXT=zzz bytes)
shows that the
PostScript version of the RFC is xxx bytes and the ASCII
text version is
zzz bytes.<P>

The (Also FYI ##) phrase gives the equivalent FYI number
if the RFC was
also issued as an FYI document.<P>

&quot;Obsoletes xxx&quot; refers to other RFCs that
this one replaces; &quot;Obsoleted
by xxx&quot; refers to RFCs that have replaced this
one. &quot;Updates xxx&quot; refers
to other RFCs that this one merely updates (but does
not replace);
&quot;Updated by xxx&quot; refers to RFCs that have
updated this one (but not
replaced). Only immediately succeeding and/or preceding
RFCs are
indicated, not the entire history of each related earlier
or later RFC
in a related series.<P>

For example:<P>

1129 D. Mills, &quot;Internet time synchronization:
The Network Time
Protocol&quot;, 10/01/1989. (Pages=29) (Format=.ps)<P>

Many RFCs are available online; if not, this is indicated
by (Not
online). Online copies are available via ftp from the
InterNIC Directory
and Database Services server, ds.internic.net, as rfc/rfc####.txt
or
rfc/rfc####.ps (#### is the RFC number without leading
zeroes).<P>

Paper copies of all RFCs are available from InterNIC
Information
Services. For more information, contact info@is.internic.net
or call
1-800-444-4345 (choose prompt 3 from the InterNIC menu).
RFCs can also
be requested through email from the InterNIC Directory
and Database
Services automated mail server by sending a message
to the following
address: mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body of the
message, include
the following command:<P>
<PRE>
document-by-name rfcNNNN</pre><p>
<p>
in which NNNN is the number of the RFC. For PostScript
RFCs, specify the
extension (e.g., document-by-name rfcNNNN.ps). Multiple
requests can be
sent in a single message by specifying each document
in a
comma-separated list (e.g., document-by-name rfcNNNN,
rfcYYYY), or by
including multiple document-by-name commands on separate
lines.<P>

The RFC Index can be requested by typing document-by-name
rfc-index.<P>
