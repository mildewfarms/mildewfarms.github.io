The popularity of the World Wide Web continues to expand,
for both
personal and business sites. The most successful pages
include links to
other pages, counters, forms, surveys, database queries,
and animation.
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programming produces
these dynamic
information exchanges. The Perl programming language
is often used for
CGI programs because of its speed, simplicity, and portability.
In Teach
Yourself CGI Programming with Perl in a Week, the primary
focus is CGI's
environment and concepts. However, Herrmann provides
the basic design
and syntax of Perl scripting.  He presents enough Perl
details to allow
the reader to program CGI scripts, and he also recommends
Perl books for
the language's more advanced features. Because this
book describes a
time frame (ideally one week), its sections are divided
into days,
rather than parts or sections. Day 1 features An Introduction
to CGI and
Its Environment plus Understanding How the Server and
Browser
Communicate. Using Server Side Include Commands, Using
Forms to Gather
and Send Data, Decoding Data Sent to Your CGI Program,
and Using
Environment Variables in Your Programs occupy Days 2
and 3. Day 4,
Putting It All Together, includes Building an On-Line
Catalog and Using
Existing CGI Libraries. Day 5, Using Applications that
Make Your Web
Page Cool, examines Using Image Maps on Your Web Page
and Keeping Track
of Your Web Page Visitors. The week concludes with Using
Internet Mail
with Your Web Page, Guarding Your Server Against Unwanted
Guests,
Debugging CGI Programs, and Tips, Tricks, and Future
Directions. The
Appendices contain: (A) MIME Types and File Extensions,
(B) HTML Forms,
(C) Status Codes and Reason Phrases, and (D) The National
Center for
Super Computing Applications (NCSA) imagemap.c Program.
The accompanying
CD-ROM contains the source code for the book's programs,
libraries of
CGI programs, Perl (both 4.0 and 5.0), and other CGI
development tools.<P>

Herrmann explains the concepts of CGI programming, including
its
definition, why it differs from other programming, and
enumerates common
CGI programming errors. He discusses other files in
the directory and
how they can affect the CGI programs. Each separate
topic carefully
builds on the information previously presented to the
reader. (This
sequential approach assumes that the reader is a novice;
a more
experienced user can either select the topics he or
she needs or quickly
skim the more familiar segments.) With the extensive
knowledge furnished
in this book, the Web designer can display image maps,
tabulate a site's
traffic, both through counters and guestbooks, and procure
data through
interactive forms, surveys, and queries. The author
demonstrates
animation, how to customize existing programs, how to
save data, and
where to access the data after it has been saved.<P>

Teach Yourself CGI Programming with Perl in a Week is
an excellent book.
Herrmann provides a valuable resource, particularly
for readers who need
this information immediately. He utilizes real-life
examples (as opposed
to abstract concepts) to illustrate how the process
operates. The author
explains a topic, its function, and itemizes the essential
facts to
remember. He also emphasizes the most common errors
in CGI programming.
Each chapter begins with an introduction and ends with
a summary and a
question and answer section. Throughout the text, Herrmann
displays
Do/Don't boxes, Notes, Tips, and Warnings in shaded
sidebars. His
writing style is clear and often humorous, and he extensively
describes
CGI and Perl programming. Teach Yourself CGI Programming
with Perl in a
Week is a superior book that merits the attention of
every Web
programmer.<P>

Any casual Internet user can attest to both the immense
variety and
quantity of information available. Educators see both
a research tool
and an opportunity for their students. Through the Internet,
teachers
may show students how to access various databases for
facts and
articles. Students also can consult professionals via
email. In
addition, teachers can communicate with each other and
discover
different approaches to the same topic.<P>

Serim and Koch demonstrate the benefits and disadvantages
of using and
teaching students the Internet. They specifically address
the K-12
educators, their classes, and school administrators.
The authors have
divided the text into four sections: Part I -Inspiration
and Innovation,
Part II - From Theory to Practice, Part 3 - Broadening
Your Vision, and
the Appendices. Part I includes an Introduction and
Classroom Tales. The
second segment features Classroom Connections, Basic
Internet Training,
Students in the Internet Classroom, and Teachers Creating
Online
Collaborations. Broadening Your Vision investigates
The Innovative
School, The Connected Community, and Bringing It All
Back Home. The
Appendices contain (A) Internet Pioneers, and (B) World
Wide Web
Resources plus a Glossary and a Bibliography. The accompanying
CD-ROM
offers a free month of unlimited Internet access through
Global Network
Navigator (GNN) for Windows and GNNpress for Windows
95, a Web authoring
tool. (The Macintosh version is not available at this
time.)<P>

NetLearning: Why Teachers Use the Internet is a valuable
teaching
reference. For educators teaching the Internet, the
authors demonstrate
how other teachers currently use it. Serim and Koch
illustrate the
Internet's advantages, drawbacks, and capabilities through
the
experiences of other teachers. Throughout the book,
the authors provide
Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for exceptional World
Wide Web sites,
helpful tips, and useful email addresses. This is an
excellent
reference, especially for teachers beginning to use
or teach the
Internet.<P>

<B><I>Prime Time Freeware for UNIX, Issue 4-2</I><br>
Rich Morin, Editor<br>
Prime Time Freeware<br>
ISBN 1-881957-18-7<br>
$50.00<br>
CD-ROMs Included<br>
(http://www.ptf.com)</B><P>

This collection of UNIX-related software encompasses
every possible user
interest: compilers, Graphical User Interface (GUI)
tools, multimedia
editors, games, Internet access and text processing
utilities, and more.
(The two CD-ROMs possess 5000 Mb of UNIX Freeware.)
It also compiles on
the following UNIX variants: AIX, Alpha OSF/1, A/UX,
BSD/OS, FreeBSD,
HP-UX, Linux, NetBSD, SCO/ODT, Solaris, SunOS, and UnixWare.
The book
includes the Preface, Acknowledgements, In This Issue,
Legalities, Quick
Start, Tutorial Introduction, Troubleshooting, HTML
(WWW) Notes, the GNU
General Public License, Freeware Central, Prime Time
Freeware, and
Yggdrasil Computing. The Appendices contain: (A) Package
Overview, (B)
Package List, and (C) Keyword Index. The keyword index
refers to an
entry or entries in the package list, rather than page
numbers. In this
way, you can locate a specific utility or game on the
CD-ROMs without
being near a computer.<P>

The first issues of Prime Time Freeware (that I recall)
appeared in July
1992 and January 1993. They had approximately 3 Gb of
UNIX-related
freeware. (This was before CD-ROMs were routinely attached
to books, and
the amount and scope of the CD-ROMs content was amazing!)
The
accompanying text, in spiral-bound 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot;
binders, included a
Preface, Acknowledgements, Legalities, In This Issue,
Getting Started,
Troubleshooting, PTF Order Forms, a Hierarchical Package
List, and a
Permuted Index. The text is much better in Issue 4-2,
and there is more
freeware on the CD-ROMs. Prime Time Freeware still strives
to provide
the UNIX user with the best Freeware available for an
affordable price.
(The price has decreased through the years.) Any serious
UNIX user (and
some frivolous ones) will greatly appreciate both the
freeware and the
book. I highly recommend it.<P>

The practical application of data compression, &quot;zipping,&quot;
causes most
online beginners problems and confusion. Now, with Zipping
For
Beginners, the Abacus Development Group has simplified
the task. They
present the guidelines for zipping and unzipping in
two sections:
Getting Started and A Little More Advanced. In the first
section, the
authors examine the following topics: What Is A Zipped
File, Installing
the Companion Diskette, The Fine Art of Unzipping, Zipping
A File, and
Viewing Compressed Files.<P>

The Advanced section discusses: Zipping Several Files
to One Zipped
File, Zipping Files That Span Multiple Disks, Create
An Executable
Self-Extracting Archive, Create A Self-Extracting Archive
With WinZip
SE, and Zipping And The Internet. The companion diskette
includes full
evaluation copies of PKZip 2.04G and WinZip both for
Windows 95 and
Windows 3.X. Zipping For Beginners demonstrates simply
how to zip and
unzip a file. It presents the installation and directions
for the
programs in a logical step-by-step manner. Every novice
and computer
instructor will value this book for its easily understood
technique.<P>

For the more confident user, Abacus presents the Zip
Bible by Kespret.
This text addresses data compression and several ways
to accomplish it.
Kespret discusses Data Compression, Data Compression
Elements,
Decompressing Data, Compressing Your Data, Self-Extracting
Archives,
Advanced Data Compression Features, EXE Compressors,
Command Summary and
Switches, Installing the Companion CD-ROM, and presents
a Glossary of
Terms. The accompanying CD-ROM includes evaluation copies
of the WinZip
6.0 (for both Windows 95 and Windows 3.X), PKZip, LHArc,
ARJ, PKLite,
ZOO, and Diet data compression programs. The book demonstrates
how to
effectively use these programs to their highest potential,
details
restoring damaged archives, backing up and sharing compressed
files, and
protecting files with passwords. Kespret writes in a
logical, readable
style and illustrates several compression procedures.
Any online user
will recognize the merits of the Zip Bible.<P>

<B><I>Internetworking With TCP/IP, Volume III<br>
Client-Server Programming and Applications</I><br>
Second Edition<br>
by Douglas E. Comer and
David L. Stevens<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-260969-X<br>
$54.00<br>
(http://www.prenhall.com)</B><P>

The third volume of the Internetworking with TCP/IP
series is both the
most practical and the most topical of the set. The
first and second
volumes define the TCP/IP Protocol Suite and describe
its
implementation. This volume demonstrates its use in
client-server
applications. Most Internet, HyperText Markup Language
(HTML), and
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programming books have
a small section or
chapter on client-server design and implementations.
Comer and Stevens
clearly illustrate the client-server structure as it
applies to the
TCP/IP protocols. The second edition modifies the C
code to adhere to
the ANSI C standards, and Chapter 24 (Network File System
Protocol (NFS
Mount) ) has an additional section on Changes in NFS
Version 3. The most
visible modification is an additional chapter, Deadlock
And Starvation
In Client-Server Systems. The authors examine ways in
which
client-server systems can fail. Comer and Stevens define
both deadlock
and starvation, illustrate how either can possibly occur,
and present
ways to avoid these two states.<P>

The second edition reflects the changes in standard
and new versions,
and the importance of preventing client-server failure,
particularly in
fault-tolerant systems. The book maintains the standard
of excellence
that the Internetworking with TCP/IP series exemplifies.
This is a
superb book on an essential topic.<P>

<B><I>Web Developer's Guide to JavaScript &amp; VBScript</I><br>
by Peter Aitken<br>
Coriolis Group Books<br>
ISBN 1-883577-97-7<br>
$39.99<br>
CD-ROM Included</B><P>

As the World Wide Web's popularity increases, so do
the number of varied
utilities to assist the Web developer. A few of them
(HyperText Markup
Language (HTML), Common Gateway Interface (CGI), and
Java) have become
important and necessary tools. Among the essential utilities
are the
scripting languages. Without some type of script within
an HTML
document, a Web site will appear (hopefully) as a nicely
formatted and
well-designed page. However, that is all it will be.
Any movement or
animation requires a script. Two of the scripting languages
are
JavaScript, developed by Netscape, and VBScript, a Microsoft
product.
The Web designer and Webmaster should know both. Although
the concepts
of scripting languages are similar and JavaScript and
VBScript possess
some common elements, their syntax and identifiers differ.<P>

In the Web Developer's Guide to JavaScript and VBScript,
Peter Aitken
demonstrates the similarities and differences between
the two languages.
He discusses the basis for the languages and their common
interface in
Scripting the Web and HyperText Markup Language. Aitken
continues with
an examination of JavaScript and its environment. The
JavaScript
chapters include: Using Netscape Navigator Gold; JavaScript;
Objects,
JavaScript Methods and Functions; Responding to User
Actions; Outlining
Your Documents; Using JavaScript for Data Verification;
and JavaScript
Odds and Ends. The dedicated VBScript chapters encompass:
VBScript from
Step One; VBScript Data, Statements, Operators, and
Procedures; Using
Objects and Events; VBScript Functions and Error Trapping;
and VBScript
in Action. The Appendices address: (A) Internet and
Web Basics, and (B)
What's On the Disk.<P>

This is a superior text. Aitken presents essential details
pertaing to
both languages and demonstrates how to use each language.
He explains a
concept and immediately reinforces his description with
an example. The
author not only details how the scripts work, but also
provides tools
and code on the CD-ROM to assist the user. Aitken has
furnished a
welcome and informative guide for anyone involved in
Web design,
programming, or maintenance.<P>
