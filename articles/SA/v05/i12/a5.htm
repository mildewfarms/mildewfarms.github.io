<H1>Detecting System Intruders</H1><p>
<P>
Jeffrey B. Davis<P>

While working on a project one afternoon, I noticed
the load average of
my machine starting to climb. I could tell the machine
was also slowing
down a bit because my compiles were taking longer than
they had a few
minutes before. Within a few minutes, things returned
to normal, but I
wanted to know what had happened. I decided to look
around to see what
had occurred, because I thought there might be an intruder
on the
system. Detecting system intruders usually just involves
searching for
an intruder's mess, and this article describes some
of the things to
check if you suspect an intruder.<P>

You should start by checking some of the more common
logs (see Table 1)
including lastlog, messages, and syslogs. By checking
the lastlog, you
might find some interesting login attempts. last is
a utility that
displays login information, and doing a last -10 shows
who, where, when,
and how long a connection was open. See display examples
in Figure 1.<P>

I look for connections from locations that should not
be connecting to
the box, along with errors in the lastlog listing. Determining
which
machines and users have access will allow you to decide
which, if any,
log entries are from possible intruders. Using the sample
lastlog
listings, I would become suspicious upon seeing the
ftp session from
www.yourcompany.net, if I knew they were not allowed.<P>

I would get even more suspicious because the length
of that connection
was considerably longer compared to the rest of the
ftp sessions. In the
heavy use ftp site example shown in Figure 1, the only
interesting
access is the 4-hour access. This could just be a slow
link; however,
Mary (an example office employee) probably does not
normally log into
the system right after midnight, use it heavily until
4:18 a.m., and
then show up to work the next morning. Sometimes, intruders
attempt to
cover their tracks by fixing the logs. An example of
a fixed log might
look like this:<P>
<PRE>
ftp    ftp    dial04189.netviX Sun Aug  4 00:08 - 00:48  (00:39)
ftp    ftp    XXX.170.136.134  Sun Aug  4 00:08 - 00:16  (00:08)
ftp    ftp
ftp    ftp    XXX.171.140.188  Sun Aug  4 00:04 - 00:20  (00:16)
john   ftp    XXX-152-156.ipt. Sun Aug  4 00:02 - 00:12  (00:10)

wtmp begins Sun Aug  4 00:02</pre><p>
<p>
The above example would be cause for alarm because the
wtmp file should
continue to grow and should have just started out on
the time reported.
Also, it is strange to have an entry without the standard
information
(this one has white space instead). Sometimes, the log
fixing utilities
used by intruders do not do a good job of hiding their
last login.<P>

I also check the messages file to make sure that nothing
nonstandard
appears. The messages logs usually reside in /var/adm.
Depending on how
your /etc/syslogd.conf file is constructed, different
information will
be in this file. I check for odd su root attempts from
users who do not
have su privileges, along with other unusual lines.<P>

Example messages lines from a Solaris 2.3 box:<P>
<PRE>
Aug  4 11:25:04 strange su: 'su root' failed for smith on /dev/pts/3
Aug  4 11:25:24 strange su: 'su root' failed for smith on /dev/pts/3
Aug  4 11:25:44 strange su: 'su root' failed for smith on /dev/pts/3
Aug  1 19:16:47 strange sendmail[17472]: AA17470: SYSERR: net hang
reading from duffel.net: Connection timed out during
greeting wait wi
Aug  2 15:42:38 strange /usr/local/sbin/sshd[2490]: Local: Session
terminated on signal 1.</pre><p>
<p>
The sshd is great for doing secure TCP/IP connections
in a noncommercial
environment. (See http://www.uni-karl sruhe.de/~ig25/ssh-faq.)<P> 

Also during my log search, I read some of the syslog.
The syslog is
another log file to which other system information gets
written. The
contents of these logs is definable by the /etc/syslog.conf
files. in
the syslog file. I check for unusual, incomplete, and
corrupt entries.
Figure 2 shows a sample syslog file. In that example,
the ftp connection
from the competitor's host would cause me to suspect
an intrusion.<P>

If you see an entry from an unauthorized machine (or
set of machines)
while reading these log files, you should become suspicious.
Also, if
you are positive that these logs are being created,
but find that they
do not exist or have become corrupt, your should definitely
suspect an
intrusion. Next, you should take a look at some other
system
information.<P>

You should check for unauthorized users on the box.
Doing standard w and
who commands to look for unauthorized users might reveal
a strange
connection or user, but chances are it will not. Doing
a netstat to see
whether a foreign connection is open might help. You
should also check
the process table to see what is in ps -ef or ps -auxw,
depending on
your flavor of UNIX. These binaries are all good targets
for
modification once a hacker has gained access. Compare
the information
from the log files with the information you received
from the previous
commands to help narrow your search. The next check
would be to use the
find utility to look for any setuid files that you know
should not be
setuid.<P>
<PRE>
find / -perm -4000 -user root -print</pre><p>
<p>
I also look for shells (ksh, zsh, tcsh, bash, etc.),
old security bugs
(time, uudecode, etc.), and other abnormalities.<P>

By now, you should have a pretty good idea of whether
there is or was an
intruder. The next step would be to comb through shell
history files. I
use bash, so I would look in ~jeff/.bash_history, whereas
some users
might have a .history. If you run system accounting,
where all commands
get logged, you would check there for commands that
your suspicious
userid executed. In the shell history file, you might
see it linked to
/dev/null (which should raise more suspicions) or possibly
deleted. You
might also read commands that users or possible intruders
executed.<P>

If you think you have found an intruder, refer to your
security policy
on how to proceed. If you need to create a security
policy, I suggest
you start by looking at
http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/spaf/hotlists/csec-top.html,
which has
numerous links to security pages and to some policy-creating
pages. If
you stumble upon an intruder's mess, such as corrupt
log files, setuid
binaries that should not exist, and history files containing
privileged
commands, those things should be backed up, but also
noted. Remember,
the intruder could be the boss's child, the boss, a
future employee, or
a criminal.<P>

For further help, there are some utilities that will
do some security
checking for you - these should be run consistently.
Take a look at
tiger, cops, and satan or some of the commercial products
for up-to-date
security hole detecting. Finding an intruder's mess
is usually easier
than cleaning it up.<P>
