<B>FacetCorp Ships FacetWin</B><P>

FacetCorp has begun shipping FacetWin, Windows to UNIX
connectivity
software. FacetWin includes an all-in-one feature set
that lets users of
Windows 95 and Windows NT clients transparently access
and use
UNIX-based network resources such as files, disks, applications,
and
printers. Features of FacetWin include transparent file
and print
service, terminal emulation, and the ability to automatically
back up
network PCs to a UNIX tape drive. Other FacetWin features
include
networked modem access for PC users, an email POP3 server,
and remote
computing support that provides network functionality
to users connected
via modem.<P>

FacetWin's transparent file and print services are based
upon
Microsoft's SMB technology for transferring data. FacetWin
provides a
UNIX SMB server for system administration, which requires
no additional
software to be loaded on the PC. SMB technology was
chosen for FacetWin
because of its high throughput for file and print services,
and because
it is easy to install and administer. The only part
of FacetWin to run
on the PC is the terminal emulator, which was designed
as a native
Windows 95 32-bit application. FacetWin uses FacetTerm
as its terminal
emulation software.<P>

A single-user license for FacetWin is priced at $195
with discounts for
multi-user licenses. FacetCorp is offering free 30 day
evaluation
copies. For more information, contact FacetCorp, 4031

<B>OSM Announced COS/Relay</B><P>

Open Systems Management Inc. has announced COS/Relay,
an automated
software distribution and installation package. COS/Relay
automates the
process of software installation across a distributed
network. COS/Relay
lets the administrator distribute software to a number
of systems on the
network from one console, the master system. As part
of the installation
process, COS/Relay can execute operation on the target
system; this can
include such thing as rebooting or restarting daemons.
If the software
requires user input, the responses can be recorded at
the master system,
distributed to the target systems and replayed during
the installation.<P>

COS/Relay checks each step of the installation process
and the entire
operation can be rolled back if a network error occurs.
Distribution can
be continued to all systems that have not failed. COS/Relay
also
automatically collects audit information, recording
details on the
software installation. COS/Relay also includes built-in
security that
restricts users to accessing only the facilities for
which they have
authorization. Distribution to secure target is also
possible by use of
configurable communications methods, allowing the maintenance
of
different levels of security across a network.<P>

COS/Relay is available for a wide range of UNIX systems
and is part of
the COSMOS suite of applications. For pricing and other
information,
contact Open Systems Management Inc., 1111 Third Ave.,
Suite 2500,
Seattle, WA 98101; (206) 583-8373; Fax: (206) 292-4965.<P>

<B>Windward Releases Two Products</B><P>

Windward Technologies Inc. has released LookOut V1.4.2
and na.LookOut.
LookOut V1.4.2 is a hardware failure prediction application
for UNIX
platforms. LookOut functions as a background daemon
or intelligent
agent, monitoring the node for potential hardware problems
and
delivering early warnings that identify the device,
subsystem or node,
the severity of the error, and the evidence that led
LookOut to its
conclusion. Primary notification is via email to a node-specific
distribution list and may include any valid email address
reachable from
the node. A shell script is included to notify alphanumeric
pagers or
other specialized applications or interfaces.<P>

Features of LookOut 1.4.2 include realtime notification
across an
enterprise network to either the LookOut GUI or the
Solstice proxy
agent, na.LookOut. Other features of LookOut include
a summary report
generator, a command-line interface, and an optional
GUI. LookOut's
background daemon, running on each node being monitored,
communicates
with its companion application via a registered ONCRPC
protocol. LookOut
is certified Solaris Compatible and supports on SunOS,
Solaris,
SolarisX86, AIX on RS/6000 and PowerPC, HP-UX on PA-RISC
(HPUX 9.xx),
and DEC-Unix on Alpha.<P>

The second product, na.LookOut, is a proxy agent that
integrates LookOut
with Suns' Solstice Enterprise Management portfolio.
With na.LookOut,
early warnings of potential hardware problems can be
delivered three
ways: email to system and network administrator, console
notification on
the Solstice topology map; and traps sent to other management
applications that are integrated with Solstice. na.LookOut
is certified
Solaris Compatible and supports SunOS, Solaris and SolarisX86.<P>

Per-node pricing for LookOut V1.4.2 ranges from $200
for a workstation
license to $9,000 for an enterprise server license.
The optional GUI is
priced at $2,000. na.LookOut is priced at $2,000. For
more information,

<B>AXENT Releases OmniGuard/EAC For UNIX</B><P>

AXENT Technologies, Inc. has released OmniGuard/Enterprise
Access
Control for UNIX (EAC/UNIX) release 3.0, its user management
and access
control software for UNIX systems. EAC/UNIX provides
a GUI for the
central site management of user accounts and restricts
access control
across homogeneous or heterogeneous UNIX environments.
OmniGuard/EAC 3.0
uses a client/server architecture to manage security
in a distributed
environment without relying on NFS or NIS. The client/server
architecture lets the EAC/UNIX master database be automatically
mirrored
on multiple backup repository systems. EAC backup repositories
function
as secondary master databases in the event the master
system is
unavailable, providing a fault-tolerant access control
system.<P>

Features of OmniGuard/EAC 3.0 include manager-agent
architecture that
allows for secure communications of account information
between servers,
NIS+ support, fault-tolerant global updates through
a retry mechanism,
an improved command-line interface, and HP-UX 10.x trusted
mode support.
Also included in OmniGuard/EAC 3.0 is SecureHosts. SecureHosts
restricts
changes to the file of EAC agent systems so that unauthorized
system
additions or changes cannot be made. In addition, SecureHosts
ensures
the EAC system can perform updates to the EAC users
database only where
authorized. Other features of OmniGuard/EAC include
the ability to
define user accounts for heterogeneous UNIX environments
through one
central console and the fault-tolerant repository systems
automatically
propagates account and password changes to all EAC/UNIX
systems.<P>

For pricing and other information about Omni/Guard/EAC
3.0, contact
AXENT Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD; (301) 670-3653;
Fax: (301)

passwords. Web Scanner generates reports with lists
of specific
vulnerabilities for each Web server and application,
as well as lists of
service running on each Web server.<P>

The second scanner, Firewall Scanner 4.0, provides security
auditing for
testing the configuration of firewall applications and
the platform
running under the firewall. Firewall Scanner includes

<B>Nakamichi Introduces 4-Disc CD-ROM Changer</B><P>

Nakamichi America Corporation has introduced the MJ-4.8s,
an internal
half-height 4-disc CD-ROM changer. Features of the MJ-4.8s
include a
&quot;direct-loading&quot; mechanism that draws the
disc into one of four internal
slots and only contacts the 2-mm rim edge of each disc.
The changer
