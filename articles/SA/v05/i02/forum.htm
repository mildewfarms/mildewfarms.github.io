<P>
During the next few weeks, I expect to have ample opportunity
to test
the real-world practicality of "telecommuting." I'm
planning to drive
cross-country to attend the USENIX conference in San
Diego. That's some
1,500 miles in a 1978 vintage motor home.<P>

(On second thought, maybe a trip in a '78 motor home
isn't really such a
"real-world" test. Oh, well.)<P>

I'm planning a very leisurely trip with lots of sightseeing
and
photography, I'm also a semi-professional photographer,
specializing in
product and special effects photography. (I've used
many of my special
effects photos as covers for The C/C++ Users Journal
and Windows
Developer's Journal.) On this trip I hope to do some
serious landscape
work. (For the other shutterbugs out there, I'll be
carrying a Minolta
35 mm system, a Mamiya RB 67 system, and a Toyo 4 x
5 view camera and
will be able to do E-6 processing on site.)<P>

Even though I'm planning a lot of play during this trip,
I still need to
keep in touch with the magazine staff to review proposals,
manuscripts,
and galleys. I'm hoping to do all that on-line from
my motor home --
though I'm not exactly certain how.<P>

Of course, I've done remote work before, but usually
by a direct login
to our machine here -- and just to pick up email during
short business
trips. This trip is so long that I'll have to do more
than just email --
and as a nomad, I don't think I can count on being granted
long distance
privileges in all sites and I'm too cheap to pay for
hours of cellular
time.<P>

So, I'm planning to stop every few days in a city that
is large enough
to have a local CompuServe number and a campground with
telephone
hookups, or a convention center where the pay phones
have data hookups.
If that doesn't work, I'll use my good-standing as a
private pilot and
go beg to set my notebook up in a local pilot's lounge.
And if that
doesn't work ... well, it seems silly, but I guess I
could park my motor
home in front of a cheap motel room long enough to make
a call. How
weird!<P>

Wish me good luck -- I may need it.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Robert Ward<P>
