<H1>New Products</H1><p>
<P>
<B>Aurora Software Announces SarCheck Version 2</B><P>

Aurora Software Inc. has begun shipping Version 2 of
its performance
management tool, SarCheck. SarCheck is designed to help
system
administrators analyze UNIX systems for performance
bottlenecks by
translating sar reports into a more legible form. SarCheck
identifies
performance bottlenecks, recommends parameter and hardware
configuration
changes, and quantifies the amount of remaining system
capacity.<P>

SarCheck reports consist of three sections and a summary.
The first
section contains recommendations for improving system
performance, such
as changing parameters, balancing disk load, and increasing
memory size
or CPU speed. The second section is an analysis of all
system resources
monitored by SarCheck. The final section, capacity planning,
can be used
to approximate the amount of capacity remaining. SarCheck
reviews a
system's peak resource utilization so that it can predict
the capacity
for additional workload before performance degradation
becomes likely.<P>

A single SarCheck license for SCO UNIX is priced at
$199; other
licensing options are available. Versions for other
UNIX platforms are
under development. For more information, contact Aurora
Software Inc.,
P.O. Box 1033; Plaistow, NH 03865; (603) 382-4200.<P>

<B>FOCUS Presents EtherLAN Hubs</B><P>

FOCUS Enhancements, Inc. has announced EtherLAN Hub
16 RM and 32 RM --
repeater hubs that provide one thinnet and AUI connector,
plus 16 or 32
10Base-T ports for use in 10Base-T networks or mixed
thin, thick, and
10Base-T networks. Each 10Base-T port can support one
network node or
another hub, and standard Category 3 or 5 twisted pair
cable can be used
for connection to the ports. Both models provide BNC
connection to
thinnet, enabling up to 30 devices to be connected via
standard coaxial
cable and T-connectors. Both the Hub 16 RM and 32 RM
can also serve as a
node on a thinnet backbone or segment.<P>

The hubs feature autopartitioning and reconnection,
allowing for the
removal of a port under excessive collision and reinstatement
of the
port once it is clear. No management software is required
to support
this feature. The hubs use two status LEDs per port
to display the link
and partitioning status of each port. Hubs can be cascaded
using the
selectable IN or OUT ports 16 or 32. The units have
their own power
switches, internal power supply, and can be rack mounted
on a standard
19-inch rack.<P>

Hub 16 RM is priced at $419, and Hub 32 RM is $699.

<B>New Era Systems Updates HARBOR</B><P>

New Era Systems has announced HARBOR Version 3.2 for
UNIX on five
platforms: AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, SunOS, and AT&amp;T
System V. HARBOR is
distributed systems management software that has been
enhanced to
support changed-data-only backup capability for Oracle
and Sybase
databases, backup of UNIX raw partitions, software distribution
services, an improved UNIX user interface, and host
initiation of UNIX
backup functions. HARBOR uses SQL-BackTrack software
from Data Tools,
Inc. to perform incremental backups of changed data
while leaving the
database online. HARBOR/BR can backup and restore raw
UNIX partitions.<P>

HARBOR/DM provides software distribution services for
UNIX systems, with
support for three distribution models: push (administrator
driven), pull
(user initiated), and queued (in-basket style). HARBOR
3.2 for UNIX
provides a consistent Motif graphical user interface.
HARBOR also
supports remote initiation and self-upgrade capabilities.
An ETS gateway
provides network transparency, allowing clients (including
UNIX) to
connect to HARBOR's three-tiered server architecture
without requiring
TCP/IP. Fault tolerance provides for shifting to an
alternative path or
protocol if a link fails.<P>

<B>CyberAccess Announces Broadcast Message System</B><P>

CyberAccess Incorporated has announced Broadcast Message
System, an
electronic announcement tool for the Windows and UNIX
environments that
will pop up a message window regardless of what application
is currently
running, ensuring that priority messages are not delayed.
The Broadcast
Message System provides security measures so only authorized
individuals
have access to emergency messages. The administrator
may view or print
such messages. When a critical message needs immediate
attention, the
Broadcast Message System can target individuals or groups
at one
location or multiple locations. Default values can be
set to
automatically delete messages to prevent disk clutter.<P>

The Broadcast Message System is available in two versions:
BMS-LAN and
BMS-TCP. The BMS-LAN works with a network operating
system, such as
Novell, Banyan, or Windows for Workgroups. The BMS-TCP
is a
client-server architecture using the TCP/IP protocol.
Clients use
WinSock on workstations running Windows. The server
acts as a postmaster
distributing messages and keeping track of where users
are located. The
server runs on SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX, IBM AIX, or Windows
NT.<P>

Evaluation copies and volume discounts are available.
