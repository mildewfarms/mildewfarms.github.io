"Creating Online Help for Vi" by Michael Harold on Page
93 "Listing 5,"
some codes look like this:<P>
<PRE>
clear
echo
DATE=`date|awk '{print $1 &quot; &quot; $2 &quot; &quot; $3}'`
TIME=`date|awk '{print $4}'|cut -c1-5`
USER=`who am i|awk '{print $1}'`
#MAILMSG='grep Message-Id: $MAIL|wc -l'
echo $DATE $TIME|awk ' { printf(&quot;DATE: %-4s%-4s%-45sTIME: %-5s\n&quot;, $1, $2, $3, $4) }'
#echo $MAILMSG $USER|awk '{ printf(&quot;MAIL: %-53sUSER: %-15s\n&quot;, $1, $2) }'

echo &quot;exit&quot; &gt; formkey
exit 0</pre><p>
<p>
The $MAIL variable is never declared anywhere. I believed
that it was an
environment variable setup. The codes hang up because
it was undeclared
in my environment. I use Sun OS4.1.3.<P>

Thanks.<br>

<I>Thank you for your comments.<P>

You are correct about the MAIL variable. It should be
set in the user's
.profile using commands similar to the following:</I><P>
<PRE>
MAIL=/usr/spool/mail/`logname`; export MAIL</pre><p>
<p>
<I>The location of user's mail files vary among systems.
The example shell
script identifies the number of mail messages by counting
the number of
lines in the user's mail file containing the string
"Message-Id."</I><P>

<I>I developed the script on SCO Unix and ported it to
DG/UX. In addition
to changing the path to the user's mail files I had
to substitute egrep
for the grep command since DG/UX's grep does not support
the "-e"
argument.<P>

Subject: Sys Admin Paper&amp;font<P>

I have been meaning to mention this. It appears since
the new ownership
there has been a change in the paper used in the Sys
Admin journal. The
new paper seems glossy and thinner. It appears that
the type font used
is also a little smaller. I had always found it a pleasure
to read copy
that had a very matte finish, didn't reflect, and graphics
from the
opposite side of the page don't show through.<P>

The articles always somehow manage to discuss a problem
I just started
having and I continue to look forward to every issue.
I hope I can keep
up with a monthly issue.<P>

Thank You,<br>

<I>Thanks for noticing the matte finish. For several years
I've "bucked"
other opinions in the company and insisted that we print
on a
matte-finish coated stock -- purely because I know it's
an easier read. I
think you are perhaps the first reader who has commented
on that. It's
nice to know someone noticed.<P>

We did, recently change to a lighter paper -- but it's
the same matte
finish we've always used, just a lighter grade. Sys
Admin is now on the
same paper as our other matte-finish publications. That
results in some
economies at the printer and some substantial savings
in mailing costs.
We needed those economies to help offset the increased
production costs
associated with going monthly.<P>

We are now doing the typesetting on Macs under Quark.
That platform
offers some significant advantages over our prior setup
(Ventura on a
PC). But like everything, it also has some disadvantages
-- and the type
problem you've spotted is one of them. The main book
typeface is the
same font and size we used in our earlier Ventura setup.
But, we're
using a different font for the code and code fragments.
I think that
font is what creates the impression that the type is
smaller.<P>

Personally, I'm pretty unhappy about the change. Previously
we used a
letter gothic font which I had heavily modified to better
display
certain characters important to programmers. The custom
font was
extremely condensed -- which allowed us to use a larger
point size and
still get entire URLs and other code structures to fit
in a column.
Equal signs and minus signs had been changed to print
well, even when
compressed. (I hate it when the C increment, decrement,
and logical
equality operators run together.) Without the benefit
of that condensed
face, we have to use a smaller face to get meaningful
"chunks" of text
to fit in a column.<P>

Unfortunately, that font didn't make the transition
to the Mac
environment. Even though the modified font was available
as a Postscript
outline, the MFI support staff was unwilling to install
it. I think it
amounts to their not wanting to take long-term responsibility
to support
one of my kludges. I understand that unwillingness in
the abstract, but
not in this specific instance. The font is Postscript.
What's the
difference?<P>

At this point, I've pretty much given up on getting
acceptance for my
"homebrew" font, but Martha and I are still trying to
find ways to beat
this problem. Perhaps someone out there knows a commercially
available,
highly-condensed, mono-spaced Postscript font that would
be appropriate?
