<B>Mazama Announces Mazama Packet Filter Version 1.2</B><P>

Mazama Software Labs, Incorporated has announced the
Mazama Packet
Filter V1.2. The Mazama Packet Filter (MPF) allows for
filtering of
TCP/IP packets from an external network to an internal
network. MPF has
a user-friendly setup program that enables configuration
based on IP,
ICMP, TCP, and UDP packet attributes and common services.
A C-like
scripting language allows for more detailed setup for
services and
site-specific filtering. MPF provides the capability
to run detailed
tests on the configuration to check for inadvertent
security holes and
to verify the configuration. Mazama has also introduced
Intelligent
Defense Devices (IDD), the first of which is the MPF
Dynamic Host
Blocking (DHB). The DHB can detect activities such as
the traffic
generated by someone running a scanning program like
SATAN.<P>

Notification facilities make it possible to launch programs
when events
occur. UNIX programming tools such as shell scripts,
perl, and awk can
be used to develop supporting tools for specialized
applications, for
example integrating with other security applications
and network
management systems. MPF provides the following features:
blocking of all
services not explicitly enabled; blocking of ICMP redirect
packets;
blocking of IP source route options; blocking of spoofed
IP addresses
and fragments; default blocking of services such as
rsh/rlogin, X
Window, Openwindows, NFS, and other RPC services. TCP
services use
SYN/ACK checking to verify the directions of TCP connections.<P>

The Mazama Packet Filter V1.2 costs $1,995. Source code
is available in
some countries. MPF requires a 386 or higher PC, with
8Mb of RAM, two
network interface cards, and the Linux OS. For more
information, contact
Mazama Software Labs, Incorporated, 15600 N.E. 8th St.,

<B>DEC, SunSoft, and Xerox Form Printing Services Alliance</B><P>

Digital Equipment Corp., SunSoft Inc., and Xerox Corporation
have
announced a strategic alliance with the intent of providing
platform-independent printing services and simplifying
print management.
The group is developing Printxchange, a platform-independent
network
printing service designed as an open architectural foundation
for
print-related applications and services. Printxchange
is built on
existing industry standards (ISO 10175 Distributed Print
Application or
DPA) and will be bundled with existing products at no
additional cost.<P>

Printxchange simplifies managing networked printing
by providing for
troubleshooting and capacity reporting for a remote
location.
Printxchange includes the APIs and portability libraries
needed to
facilitate development. Printxchange supports a variety
of functions
including status information immediately upon submitting
a print job;
forwarding print jobs to alternate printers; and cost
accounting on
print jobs. Printxchange will first be available on
Digital UNIX and
SunSoft Solaris, and Xerox will ensure that its printers
are
Printxchange compatible. Novell and Xerox plan to work
together on
interoperability between NetWare Distributed Print Services
(NDPS --
another ISO DPA print system) and Printxchange. The
alliance has funded
and now operates a Printxchange Interoperability Laboratory
in El
Segundo, California. The lab is equipped to simulate
of variety of mixed
vendor client/server printer and network systems and
will be available
to system integrators, system and print vendors, and
other companies for
compatibility testing.<P>

Printxchange consists of three distinct software modules:
a client
program, a spooler, and a print supervisor. Xerox is
developing the
client and spooler modules, as well as publishing and
supporting the
APIs and user interfaces (both command line and graphical).
Digital will
provide the print supervisor, and SunSoft will contribute
a
bidirectional gateway between Printxchange and UNIX
print systems
(lp/lpr). For more information, contact Howard Lev,
Digital, (508)

<B>Internet Security Systems Announces Internet Scanner 3.0</B><P>

Internet Security Systems has announced Internet Scanner
3.0, an
automated &quot;attack simulator&quot; for protecting
networks against hackers.
Internet Scanner checks for more than 100 security vulnerabilities,
including those associated with firewalls and the World
Wide Web.<P>

Internet Scanner systematically probes an organization's
network for
security holes, providing a vulnerability report on
network devices,
with recommendations for corrective action. Network
devices could
include a UNIX host, firewall, router, a web server,
or PC. Internet
Scanner can perform security checks automatically, day-after-day.
Internet Scanner 3.0 provides parallel scanning; a graphical
user
interface; and added testing for WWW servers, firewalls,
IP spoofing,
and 8 LGM.<P>

<B>HEROIX Integrates RoboMon with Network Managers</B><P>

HEROIX has announced the integration of RoboMon UNIX
with network
managers, such as NetView and OpenView, providing rule-based
event
management on an enterprise-wide basis. RoboMon can

problem. The SNMP traps will handled by network managers,
and NetView or
OpenView can provide management for RoboMon. RoboMon
can address
problems via notification using email, paging, or SNMP,
or it can use
its own event monitor. RoboMon can be used to filter
alerts for network
managers.<P>

<B>OCS Enhances Express for UNIX</B><P>

Operations Control Systems (OCS) has announced the addition
of fault
tolerance and workload balancing to the client/server
EXPRESS for UNIX
automated job scheduling and workload management product.
EXPRESS for
UNIX relies on a master/agent architecture, with a master
schedule
residing on one platform controlling other local or
remote agent
machines. Fault tolerant agents will not be affected
if the master
schedule platform or the shared network fails. EXPRESS
users can specify
a number of machines that might be used to run any given
job. EXPRESS
will launch jobs on any of the designated machines based
on availability
and CPU utilization.<P>

EXPRESS for UNIX provides a GUI interface on Motif or
MS-Windows clients
with a Gantt chart presentation in addition to a command-line
interface.
Master schedules can be distributed across machines,
and agents can be
designated as fault tolerant or runtime (runtime agents
provide more
centralized control).<P>

EXPRESS for UNIX is available for HP-UX, IBM RS/6000,
Sun, and AT&amp;T/GIS
platforms. Pricing begins at $9,000. For more information,
contact
Operations Control Systems, 560 San Antonio Road, Suite

<B>IRI Announces UNIX COSORT Version 4.5</B><P>

Innovative Routines International has released UNIX
COSORT v4.5,
providing more data types, universal data translation,
and reformatting.
COSORT users do not need separate converters or reporters.
Mainframe-to-UNIX data translation can occur in the
same pass as the
sort and report. COSORT users can map from EBCDIC to
ASCII, from packed
decimal to numeric, or between any data types. Multifile,
multiformat
input can be mapped to multifile, multiformat detail
and summary output
in a single pass through the data, with or without sorting.<P>

The sortcl report writer, a key utility of the COSORT
package, includes:
data type recognition, field mapping facilities, and
support for calls
from COBOL. sortcl can also process multinational timestamps,
currency
data, floating and defined precision fields, filled
and milled fields,
machine macros, control characters, and conversion specifiers.
Summary
report functions include maximums and minimums in addition
to sums,
averages, and counts. Version 4.5 increases the speed
of all of COSORT's
interfaces as well. A new parameter called MaxMemory
within the
COSORT_TUNER environment variable allows users to set
the amount of RAM
used for sorts. Sorts are as much as 20 percent faster
than in previous
versions. Besides sortcl, COSORT includes a faster replacement
for
/bin/sort, an interactive and batch users session for
flat file sorting,
and an MVS JCL-to-sortcl script translator and debugger.<P>

COSORT 4.5 has redesigned documentation and is available
on UNIX-based
hardware. License fees start at $2,490. For more information,
contact
