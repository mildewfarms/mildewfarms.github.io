<H1>Editor's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
This issue we devote special attention to Linux. (Just
in case you've
had your head in the sand for the last year or so, Linux
is the
fast-growing copyleft version of UNIX by Linus Torvalds
and others.) I
have run Linux on a home server for about a year now
and find it rock
solid in that application. We have also experimented
with Linux in a
couple of dedicated internal applications.<P>

Perhaps the best testimonial to Linux's reliability
and value is the
increasing acceptance it is finding in certain commercial
applications.
This issue's two Linux feature articles, for example,
describe
installations where Linux was used as an internet gateway
and as a
dedicated router. With the tips in these two articles
and the IPFIREWALL
package, you could easily configure Linux as a firewall.
As you can see
from one of the letters to the editor, some of our readers
are committed
to using Linux in much more general commercial applications.<P>

And why not? I find Linux very pleasant to administer;
I am most
familiar and cordial with BSD style systems. Both hardware
and software
support is relatively good. Not only can you get all
the drivers you
might want for standard commodity hardware -- common
disk and tape
controllers, video boards, multi-port serial I/O --
you can also get a
surprising array of very polished multimedia software
-- like a CD-ROM
player for Xview, an A/D converter and software oscilloscope,
speech
synthesizers, Midi software, and more. (For a 17-page
list of compatible
software get the Linux Software Map from
http://siva.cshl.org/lsm/lsm.html. A good entry point
for additional
Linux information is the UCF Linux user group home page
http://pegasus.cc.ccf.edu/~Linux/.)<P>

While all this is available free, off the net, the more
convenient
starting point for most users is one of the CD-ROM Linux
distributions.
Most of these are incredibly easy to install, and for
$30 to $50, they
represent an unmatchable bargain.<P>

I hope you find this issue interesting and useful, and,
as always, I
look forward to hearing about your own experiences.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Robert Ward<P>
