<H1>Sidebar: Installing Linux</H1><p>
<P>
There are a number of Linux distributions available,
all more or less
complete and capable of being installed from a variety
of media. To
provide basic pointers for a sample installation, I
chose the Slackware
distribution, which is widely available. I selected
the InfoMagic
implementation because it comes with clear instructions
for the
installation process. For this article I used Slackware
2.3.<P>

The first step in installation is to check your hardware.
Not all
available hardware is supported by Linux yet, so you
make sure it works
before installing. It's also a good idea to check all
INTERRUPT and I/O
ADDRESS settings before installing. The fact that some
settings work
under DOS does not guarantee that they will do so under
Linux.<P>

The second step is to select the source media. Most
distributions are
available on (one or more) CD-ROMs. If you don't have
a Linux-supported
CD-ROM player, you can copy the necessary software packages
to your DOS
partition and install it from there. Or you can make
the CD-ROM
available on your network and mount it via NFS.<P>

The third step is to create a boot floppy and a root
floppy. You will
always need these, no matter what your source media
is. You can select
from a number of different boot floppies (i.e., kernels).
The particular
one you need will be determined by your hardware and
choice of source
media. You can use the tools available on the CD-ROM
to create these
floppies.<P>

After booting from your two floppies, you can follow
the online
instructions for installing. These take you step-by-step
through the
whole process. <P>

Note that if you are going to use your Linux system
as an Internet
server, you need to install all network-related packages,
along with the
development system, as you'll need to build some extra
tools.<P>

After completing the installation, reboot your PC --
you should be up and
running Linux.<P>
