            <P> Along with this February Security issue, <I>Sys Admin</I> is providing 
              a special supplement focused on training and certification. The 
              supplement includes an overview of training and certification vendors 
              and a sample test, which were compiled by Emmett Dulaney, certification 
              columnist for UnixReview.com along with results from the SANS 2005 
              Salary and Information Security Career Advancement Survey, compiled 
              by Alan Paller.
            <P> <I>Secure Enterprise</I> magazine recently conducted their own 
              security-related survey; see:
            <P> 
            <pre>

            According to the article by Ted Kemp, the Third Annual Strategic Deployment 
            Survey, which polled more than 1500 readers, showed that "Resourceful 
            information security professionals are still getting the job done.... 
            But their efforts have been hampered by undersized staffs and underfunded 
            budgets that limit many choices, from what products they buy to what 
            vendors they work with."
            <P> To complement the results from the SANS Survey included in our 
              supplement, I'm including some highlights from the Strategic Deployment 
              Survey taken from the Web site. To start, the survey showed "IT 
              security staffing almost unchanged from last year -- and, in a word, 
              deficient. Forty-four percent of this year's respondents described 
              their security groups as moderately understaffed, with 21% saying 
              they're severely understaffed. Last year, those numbers were 45% 
              and 20%, respectively."
            <P> When questioned about IT spending, 16% of respondents indicated 
              that less than 1% of their organization's IT budget was allocated 
              for information security, 38% reported 1-5%, 18% reported 6-10%, 
              7% reported 11-15%, 4% reported 16-20%, 3% reported more than 20%, 
              and 14% were unsure.
            <P> Security spending is driven by a variety of factors, with the 
              top five being improved business practices, auditing regulations, 
              industry standards, security breaches from external sources, and 
              legislative regulations.
            <P> Methods used to assess risk before making an information security 
              purchase include: assessment of regulatory compliance/noncompliance 
              (61%), input from peers (58%), informal risk analysis (57%), internal 
              audit (49%), penetration testing (44%), input from vendors (40%), 
              and external audit (35%).
            <P> Twenty-nine percent of the survey's respondents described their 
              organization's information security structure as a formal dedicated 
              team, and the number of organizations using individuals within IT 
              to carry out security as only a secondary part of their jobs decreased 
              from 40% last year to 35% this year. Also, the number of survey 
              respondents who reported having a formal security policy increased 
              from 57% in 2004 to 67% this year.
            <P> When asked to rate the importance of various qualities when choosing 
              a security product, respondents said the leading trait was integration 
              with existing networks. The second and third ranked qualities were 
              performance and high availability. When choosing a vendor, the most 
              highly desired quality was responsiveness to product security problems, 
              followed by vendor reputation. More details from the survey can 
              be found on the <I>Secure Enterprise</I> Web site.
            <P> I hope you find this month's articles useful and informative, 
              and if you have suggestions for future coverage, please let me know.
