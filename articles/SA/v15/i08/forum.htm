            <p> In a call for papers that we ran a few years ago, the technical editor asked for articles covering 
              intrusion detection tools "but not Snort" because we had recently run several articles 
              on Snort, and it seemed as if we'd covered it sufficiently for the time being. Time goes on, 
              however, and there are lots of new things to say about Snort, which is "the most widely deployed 
              intrusion detection and prevention technology worldwide" according its Web site. In this 
              issue, three articles provide different perspectives on using Snort.
          <p> In "Tuning Snort", Richard Bejtlich explains how to tune Snort to reduce the number 
            of alerts it produces, thus increasing security and improving an administrator's productivity 
            all at the same time.
          <p> Matthew Jonkman contributes "Three Free Tools to Detect and Prevent Spyware and Malware 
            at the Network Perimeter", in which he describes some open source tools and techniques, such 
            as DNS blackholing, user agent filtering, and various intrusion detection software, that can 
            help increase your system's security. Jonkman, by the way, is the co-founder of Bleeding 
            Snort, which is "a Free Zone for Snort IDS signature development, and a number of other related 
            security projects." According to the home page, this site takes Snort Signatures and organizes 
            them into coherent rulesets, then distributes them free of charge to all who are interested. At 
            the time of writing, the site had just posted a call for a few admins to help review and process new 
            data sources. So, for more information on Bleeding Snort and how to contribute to this effort, please 
            see: <b>http://www.bleedingsnort.com/</b>.
          <p> Russ McRee also talks about Snort in his article, "Extrusion Detection with Aanval and 
            Bleeding Edge Snort". McRee focuses on the use of Aanval (a data management and analysis console 
            designed specifically for Snort) in conjunction with Bleeding Snort rules to detect spyware as 
            well as IM and P2P network violations. You can learn more about this "extrusion detection" 
            approach in Richard Bejtlich's new book, Extrusion Detection: Security Monitoring for 
            Internal Intrusions, which was reviewed on UnixReview.com at:

            </pre>
Also on UnixReview.com in recent days, Marcel Gagn&#233;'s "Linux Game of the Month" 
covered SolarWolf, which Marcel says is a "superb" arcade-style game inspired by the 
old Atari game, SolarFox. Ed Schaefer's "Shell Corner" column featured "Bash 
Dynamically Loadable Built-In Commands" by Chris F.A. Johnson, which you can read at:

And, Emmett Dulaney examined the new Ubuntu Professional Certification. If you need some experience 
with Ubuntu Linux before tackling professional certification, check out Marcel Gagn&#233;'s 
brand new book Moving to Ubuntu Linux, which is due to be published in August by Addison-Wesley; 
see: http://www.marcelgagne.com/mtubuntu.html for more information.
<p> Also, please note that we're currently working on a Linux supplement to accompany the 
  October "Server Management" issue. It's not too late to submit an article for 
  consideration in either of these issues. If you'd like to contribute, please send your proposals 
  and manuscripts to Rikki Endsley (rendsley@cmp.com), and she'll provide all the details 
  of our process.
