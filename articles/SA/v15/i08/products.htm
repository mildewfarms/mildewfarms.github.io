            <b>OpenVZ Supports IPv6 and Bridged Networking</b>
          <p> The OpenVZ project released its operating system-level 
            server virtualization software technology with support for the next-generation Internet 
            Protocol Version 6. According to the company, support for bridged networking is 
            also now available, which gives OpenVZ virtual servers the ability to run software 
            that relies on special network capabilities such as broadcasts, multicasts, or those 
            having a MAC (media access control) address.
          <p> OpenVZ is operating system-level server 
            virtualization software technology, built on Linux, which creates isolated, secure 
            virtual environments on a single physical server, thus enabling greater server utilization 
            and superior availability with fewer performance penalties. The virtual servers 
            ensure that applications do not conflict and can be re-booted independently.
          <p> OpenVZ kernels including support for 
            IPv6 and bridged networking are available for download from http://openvz.org/download/beta/kernel.

            <b>Novell Unveils the Bandit project</b>
          <p> Novell announced the creation of Bandit, an open 
            source project with a charter to unify disparate identity systems and provide a 
            consistent approach to securing and managing identity. Novell has already contributed 
            engineering resources and code to this effort. The goal of the Bandit project is 
            to provide organizations with a consistent approach to enterprise identity management 
            challenges such as secure, role-based access and regulatory compliance reporting.
          <p> Novell already incorporates some of 
            Bandit's open identity services within its SUSE Linux distribution and plans 
            to include Bandit's identity services in future releases of other products. 
            Novell will continue to support the Bandit project with engineering resources and 
            will maintain the project while the Bandit community grows.

            <b>Oracle Announces Validated Configurations Program</b>
          <p> Oracle announced the Oracle Validated Configurations 
            program, providing customers with pre-tested, validated, and supported architectures 
            -- software, hardware, storage, and networking components -- for deploying 
            Oracle solutions on Linux. According to the company, the program is jointly developed 
            with strategic partners, helps speed deployment and reduce testing, and enables 
            customers to achieve faster time to market and lowered infrastructure costs while 
            helping to improve performance, scalability, and reliability.
          <p> Oracle Validated Configurations are 
            available now on the Oracle Technology Network at: http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/linux/validated-configurations.

            <b>Hammer Z-Series Network Storage Line Now Shipping</b>
          <p> Hammer Storage, a division of Bell Microproducts, 
            Inc., announced that its new line of network storage, the Hammer Z-Series, is now 
            shipping. According to the company, Bell Microproducts expanded the Hammer line 
            to fill a disparity in the market by adding Zetera Corporation's Z-SAN Storage-over-IP 
            (SoIP) technology to create the Hammer Z-Series, which is ideal for small to medium 
            businesses. SoIP uses Internetworking Protocol (IP) as the only storage fabric, 
            eliminating the need for costly controllers, dedicated switches, and RAID controllers 
            that also serve as performance bottlenecks.
          <p> The first Hammer Z-Series solutions 
            include the Z-Box desktop and the Z-Rack 1U rackmount solutions with capacities 
            of up to two terabytes per device. The desktop delivers a superior price/performance 
            advantage over competing desktop 4-bay NAS products. The 1U rackmount competes with 
            rackmount NAS and entry-level SAN solutions by providing better performance, scalability, 
            and reliability.
          <p> Hammer's Z-Series solutions are 
            available now, and prices for one (1) terabyte desktop and 1U rackmount solutions 
            start at $1299 and $3999, respectively. Compatible with any IP network, the Hammer 
            Z-Series is backed by an one-year warranty. The Hammer Z-Series will include solutions 
            offering greater than 9TB capacity per enclosure later in 2006.
          <p> For more information on the Hammer 
            Z-Series solutions, visit http://www.Hammer-Storage.com.

            <b>CommVault Introduces RecoveryDirector 6.1</b>
          <p> CommVault announced new features for its QiNetix 
            6.1 Unified Data Management suite. According to the announcement, the new feature 
            set, called RecoveryDirector 6.1, combines certain functionality of the QuickRecovery 
            and Galaxy Backup and Recovery software products, thereby enabling storage administrators 
            to simply and seamlessly manage snapshot and backup data across the continuum of 
            protection, recovery, and archive tiers. With RecoveryDirector, enterprises with 
            storage area networks (SANs) will be able to create online &#147;recovery images&#148; 
            that extend traditional backup methods and expand data protection capabilities. 
            RecoveryDirector extends the benefits of QuickRecovery by enabling storage administrators 
            to simplify recovery of data from multiple recovery points, reduce or eliminate 
            backup windows, and improve RTO/RPO service levels.
          <p> Integrating CommVault ProxyHost, Image, 
            QuickRecovery, and QSnap components, CommVault RecoveryDirector combines backup 
            and snapshot management into a logical workflow. With this capability, users can 
            easily manage concurrent multiple point-in-time snapshots and backup sets, improve 
            resource utilization , and eliminate duplicate operations. For enterprises seeking 
            to simplify use of device-embedded snapshot capabilities, RecoveryDirector manages 
            a variety of snapshot technologies including those offered by Data Domain, Dell, 
            EMC, HDS, HP, NetApp, Xiotech, and others. RecoveryDirector simplifies and automates 
            the process of creating snapshot images and online recovery volumes for immediate 
            recovery from data loss, large database corruption, and email virus attacks.
