            <p> Amy Rich
          <p>
            <font size='+4'>Q</font> I'm running an NFS home directory server 
            on Solaris 8. When people have left the company, we've been doing <b>userdel</b> to remove their accounts. 
            I've just discovered (because of UID reuse) that apparently the quota information stays 
            around, though. I have two questions that deal with this topic. Is there a way to remove a user's 
            quota information when the user is removed with <b>userdel</b> (or perhaps some other tool)? Also, how 
            can I clean up the existing quota entries of users that have already been removed?
          <p>
            <font size='+4'>A</font> Unfortunately there is no way to remove 
            users' quotas when you delete them short of rolling your own script. This is generally a good 
            idea, anyway, because <b>userdel</b> will not catch things like crontab entries, files outside of the 
            home directory, etc. You can trivially do a mass cleanup of all of the quota entries that don't 
            have usernames assigned with uids, though.
          <p> First, make sure there's a user on the file server that has no quotas. 
            If there isn't one, set one up using <b>/usr/sbin/edquota</b> (nobody is often a good choice for a 
            prototype user):
          <p>
          <pre>
/usr/sbin/edquota nobody

fs /export/home blocks (soft = 0, hard = 0) inodes (soft = 0, hard = 0)
            </pre>
Second, run <b>/usr/sbin/repquota -va</b> to find all of the users who begin with <b>#&lt;uid&gt;</b> and run <b>/usr/sbin/edquota -p nobody</b> to remove the quota (make it match that of the 
prototype user, <b>nobody</b>) for that uid. You can wrap this in a shell script or a Perl script, which you 
can then run out of cron every so often if you don't get around to cleaning up quotas when you 
delete accounts. Try something like the following:
<p>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use POSIX qw (WEXITSTATUS WIFSIGNALED WTERMSIG);

my $repquota = '/usr/sbin/repquota';
my $edquota = '/usr/sbin/edquota';

open (REPQUOTA, "$repquota -va |") || die "Can not open $repquota: $!\n";

while(&lt;REPQUOTA&gt;) {
  if (/^\#(\d+)/) {
    if (system ("$edquota", "-p", "nobody", "$1") != 0) {
      if ($? == -1) {
      die "Failed to execute $edquota: $!\n";
    }
    elsif (WIFSIGNALED ($?)) {
      die "$edquota terminated by signal: " . WTERMSIG($?)
         . (($? &amp; 128) ? ", core dumped\n" : "\n");
    }
    else {
      die "$edquota exited with value " . WEXITSTATUS($?) . "\n";
    }
  }
}

close REPQUOTA;

<font size='+4'>Q</font> Since upgrading to sendmail 8.13.6 because 
of the security hole, I'm noticing that a lot of <b>df</b> files are being left in my queue without corresponding <b>qf</b> files. Is there a problem with the new sendmail delivering my mail? Every time I test, all of the 
mail gets through okay (even if a <b>df</b> file is left behind).
<p>
<font size='+4'>A</font> You don't offer a lot of details about 
  your sendmail setup, but I suspect you're using buffered I/O (perhaps a milter?) and running 
  into a known issue with 8.13.6. This problem will be corrected in later versions. From the release 
  notes at:
<p>
<pre>
http://www.sendmail.org/releases/8.13.6.html
</pre>
<ul>
  (2006-04-11) If a timeout occurs, a df file can be left in the mail queue if 
  buffered files are used. This is a regression in 8.13.6 caused by the new I/O error handling. A fix 
  will be available in the next release, in the meantime simply remove old df files (i.e., if they are 
  older than the maximum queue timeout and if they have no corresponding qf, Qf, or hf files).
</ul>
<p>
<font size='+4'>Q</font> I was reading your answer about Solaris <b>coreadm</b> in the March issue of <i>Sys Admin</i> and was wondering if there was a way to make HP/UX 11.23 split 
  core files out by name/pid. That would be much more useful than having the core files overwrite each 
  other all the time.
<p>
<font size='+4'>A</font> HP/UX 11.00 and later introduces the <b>core_addpid</b> kernel parameter, which will allow you to save core files as <b>core.&lt;pid&gt;</b>. Since you're 
  running 11i v2, run the following command to modify the kernel:
<p>
<pre>
echo 'core_addpid/W 1' | adb -o -w /stand/vmunix /dev/kmem
</pre>
For HP/UX 11.00 and 11i v1, you can instead run:
<p>
<pre>
echo 'core_addpid/W 1' | adb -k -w /stand/vmunix /dev/kmem
</pre>
<font size='+4'>Q</font> I'm investigating using <b>wanboot</b> for Solaris 
9 and 10, but it appears that to do a hands-off install, you need to upgrade the OBP to a version that 
supports <b>wanboot</b>. I've searched the Sunsolve patch database and come up with some hits, but 
it looks like the majority of our hardware is unsupported. Is there a definitive list of systems 
that can be upgraded to support <b>wanboot</b>?
<p>
<font size='+4'>A</font> <b>Wanboot</b> requires a minimum of OBP version 
  4.17 in the 4.x OBP source tree. Newer hardware like the T1000 and T2000 series machines will already 
  be at the correct OBP version and not require an upgrade. You can find a definitive list of patches 
  for various hardware types at the following URL if you have a Sunsolve account:
<p>
<pre>
http://sunsolve.sun.com/handbook_private/Devices/Boot_PROM/ \
  BootPROM_Sun4u.html
</pre>
The patches currently listed for the newest OBP versions equal to or greater 
than 4.17 are:
<p>
<pre>
Sun Blade 100               119235-01      OBP 4.17
Sun Blade 150               119235-01      OBP 4.17

Sun Fire V440 / Netra 440   118319-02      OBP 4.17
</pre>
If your systems are too old to support <b>wanboot</b> in the OBP, you'll need 
a CDROM drive on your machine. See:
<p>
<pre>
http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-5504/6mkv4nh7b?a=view
</pre>
for information on performing a secure Solaris 10 <b>wanboot</b> from the local 
CDROM media. In this case, the client uses the <b>wanboot</b> program from the CDROM rather than from the 
server:
<p>
<pre>
  boot cdrom -o prompt -F wanboot - install
</pre>
<font size='+4'>Q</font> I have two files of hostnames, where one is a complete 
list of all our machines and the other is a list of machines that have already been upgraded. I want 
to wind up with a list of machines that still need upgrading. What's the best way to accomplish 
this with the tools that come with the system? I'm not allowed to install any third-party tools, 
so this needs to be something pretty basic.
<p>
<font size='+4'>A</font> You don't say what kind of system you 
  have, so I won't assume anything fancy like <b>perl</b>. If your two lists are dictionary sorted, 
  and you don't have duplicate entries (you can get there by using <b>sort -u</b> on both files if order 
  isn't important), you can use the <b>comm</b> command. It takes two files as arguments and prints 
  out three columns of output: lines only in the first file, lines only in the second file, and lines 
  in both files. You can pass the arguments 1, 2, and/or 3 to <b>comm</b> to have it not print out certain columns.
<p> Let's say <b>all-hosts</b> contains all of your hostnames and <b>upgraded-hosts</b> contains the ones you've already upgraded:
<p>
<pre>
comm -23 all-hosts upgraded-hosts &gt; remaining-hosts
</pre>
If your list of hosts isn't sorted, you can use <b>grep</b> to accomplish the 
same thing. Make sure that your version of <b>grep</b> supports all of the following flags. If you're 
using Solaris, for example, you'll want to run <b>/usr/xpg4/bin/grep</b> instead of <b>/bin/grep</b> since <b>/bin/grep</b> does not contain the <b>-x</b> flag.
<p>
<pre>
-x: All characters in the input line must be used to match the pattern.

-v: Invert the matching logic and only print lines that do NOT match
    the pattern.

-F: Interpret each pattern, separated by the newline character, as a 
    fixed string instead of a regular expression.

-f pattern_file: Read patterns from pattern_file, each separated by 
   the newline character.
</pre>
The command-line syntax you'll use is:
<p>
<pre>
grep -xvFf upgraded-hosts all-hosts &gt; remaining-hosts
</pre>
<font size='+4'>Q</font> I'm running an Apache 1.3.33 Web server 
on five identically configured Fedora Core 4 systems. Apache is started at boot time via the script 
located at <b>/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S90apache</b> (also <b>/etc/rc.d/init.d/apache</b>), which calls the <b>/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl</b> script distributed with Apache. We use <b>cronolog</b> to handle the log messages for <b>error_log</b> and <b>access_log</b> in <b>httpd.conf</b> as follows (trimmed to a few hosts for the sake of brevity):

On four of the five machines, the log files were being created with <b>cronolog</b> with ownership of <b>root:other</b> and permissions of 0644. On the fifth box, we noticed a number of log 
files were all created with the same ownerships, but the permissions 0600. When we restarted the 
errant box, the log files were created with the correct permissions again. Within a month, though, 
we had more 0600 permissioned log files on one of the other machines. We rebooted this second machine, 
and it also started creating log files with the correct permissions again.
<p> This is an issue for us since the log files need to be world readable so 
  another process can do statistic reporting. It's also troublesome, since I'm not sure 
  what's causing the change in permissions. Where should I start looking?
<p>
<font size='+4'>A</font> If the machines are truly identical, including 
  init scripts, cron jobs, etc., then the cause of the discrepancy must be something that's 
  being run by a human and not an automated process being run by the machine. The difference in the permissions 
  on the log files generally points towards a <b>umask</b> issue. Perhaps one of your admins is restarting <b>apache</b> with an environment different from the one that the operating system has when it boots. If 
  you catch another one of your machines creating log files with the wrong permissions, you may want 
  to use a small script to dump the environment that <b>apache</b> is running with. It might be illuminating 
  if there are differences.
<p> Make sure that people are starting/restarting <b>apache</b> in the same way 
  all of the time and that their environment is not being carried over by something like <b>sudo</b>. To ensure 
  that the correct environment is being passed to <b>apache</b> when it starts, you might want to explicitly 
  set things like the <b>PATH</b> and <b>umask</b> in <b>/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S90apache</b> and <b>/etc/rc.d/init.d/apache</b>.
<p> There is also always the chance that one or more of your machines has been 
  compromised, so you may want to boot from CDROM and make a full security sweep of all your machines 
  if you think this might be the case.

<font size='+4'>Q</font> I'm trying to build sendmail 8.13.6 
  from source on Solaris 8. I'm following the documentation and running the <b>Build</b> script, but 
  it dies with the following:

</pre>
<font size='+4'>A</font> This is generally indicative of having replaced 
the stock Solaris <b>/usr/include/ndbm.h</b> or having a conflicting <b>ndbm.h</b> file in your include path 
somewhere. You've probably installed Berkeley DB, and it's using the header file from 
that instead. You can temporarily rename the conflicting file (or remove it if you're not 
using whatever package it's attached to) and then rebuild the sendmail source using <b>./Build</b> fresh.
