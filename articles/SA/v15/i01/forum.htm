            <P> Version 11 of the <I>Sys Admin</I> back issue CD-ROM is now available. 
              As always, it includes complete articles and code beginning with 
              the magazine's premiere issue in 1992 through December of 2005, 
              and all content is available in both HTML and ASCII format. A few 
              articles do not appear on the CD either because we couldn't track 
              down the authors to request permission or because they chose not 
              to have their content included. The new version of the back issue 
              CD can be ordered by telephone or through the <I>Sys Admin</I> Web 
              site for $49.95 ($24.95 for registered owners of the previous version). 
              See page 61 of this issue for more details about the CD and ordering 
              process.
            <P> If you'd like to see an article of yours included in a future 
              <I>Sys Admin</I> CD, you can begin by sending a manuscript proposal 
              to Rikki Endsley, managing editor, at: <B>rendsley@cmp.com</B>. 
              Currently, we're accepting proposals for articles on clustering, 
              spam management, backup and <BR>
              recovery, and database management, but all proposals will be considered.
            <P> We're also looking at some topics of special focus outside the 
              regular issue themes for the coming year. These topics include console 
              servers, training and certification, and disaster recovery. Please 
              check the call for papers on page 44 for pertinent deadlines.
            <P> Also, as part of our continuing efforts to make both the magazine 
              and the Web site more useful to you, we're compiling information 
              to depict a day in the life of a sys admin. If you'd like to participate 
              in this project, I invite you to keep track of your activities throughout 
              a given day and send me the list. Record all the troubleshooting, 
              programming, meeting attending, game playing, Web browsing, problem 
              solving, delegating, news reading, software installing, cable stringing, 
              and other activities that make up your day and send me your results 
              via email. The more responses we get, the better we'll be able to 
              provide the information you need to do your job.
            <P> Please send comments, suggestions, questions, and details of your 
              daily existence to me at: <B>aankerholz@cmp.com</B>. Creativity 
              will be rewarded.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
            <P> <I>Amber Ankerholz</i><br>
