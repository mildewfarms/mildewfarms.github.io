              Annual SAGE Salary Survey</h1>
            <P> Rob Kolstad
            <P> Probably the sharpest focus for salary surveys is on the actual 
              salaries of the participants and the rate at which they are changing. 
              The SAGE salary survey asks dozens of questions about demographics 
              and other items that include benefits, certifications, commute time, 
              corporate policies, education, hours worked, location, professional 
              organizations, telecommuting, time off, and another 18 similar items.
            <P> However, once the demographics are collected, it's always the 
              same thing: "Show me the money".
            <P> This year's survey suggested that sys admins (of all kinds) generally 
              seem to be moving up the salary ladder, with a moderate number of 
              exceptions. Table 1 shows the breakdown of participants' experience 
              levels and the mean salaries and increases.
            <P> Overall, the average increase this year was 6.12%. Means, of course, 
              can be misleading. They are easily influenced by a concentration 
              of responses at either the high or low end. The median (50% above, 
              50% below) was 5%. Almost 27% of the respondents said they had a 
              10% or more raise in the last 12 months. About one sixth (16.0%) 
              reported no change in salary. (These statistics are calculated after 
              discarding extreme raises above 30% or below -30%.) Figure 1 shows 
              graphically how people did.
            <P> <b>Formal Education</b>
            <P> How much difference does formal education make for a person's 
              salary? The answer to this question must take into account not only 
              education but also experience (never mind geography and industry, 
              which also affect salary ranges). Table 2 shows some statistics 
              (where the education level is "education related to your technical 
              field"). Entries marked by "#" summarize a sample of respondents 
              that is probably too small to use for drawing conclusions.
            <P> The table's rows are ordered stereotypically by perception. Interestingly, 
              the salaries earned are not necessarily ordered that way. One might 
              conclude that technical certificates are worth less than a high 
              school diploma (or no certificates whatsoever). Generally, though, 
              the table supports the idea that increasing post-secondary education 
              increases one's earning power and sometimes decreases the average 
              raise one might expect over time.
            <P> <b>Respondents Comments</b>
            <P> This year's SAGE Annual Salary Survey document runs to 60 pages, 
              not all of which are summarizable here. The most interesting responses 
              for me were the free responses concerning the "future of the profession". 
              Last year's responses were quite dismal, with a general pall cast 
              over hundreds of them, what with off-shoring, automation, and layoffs. 
              Those responses have dramatically diminished and have been replaced 
              by optimism and enthusiasm. The most optimistic comments included: 
              "It's better this year than last", "I feel the economic situation 
              has improved", "The future of system administration is bright indeed 
              :-)", and "The most intellectually rewarding job I've ever had".
            <P> <b>Summary</b>
            <P> Members of the profession continue to see their salaries increase. 
              Of course, new people enter the field at lower salaries and higher-paid 
              people reach retirement or leave for other reasons. All-in-all, 
              though, it's difficult to argue that systems administration is not 
              a well-paid, vibrant, challenging career for those who enjoy it.
