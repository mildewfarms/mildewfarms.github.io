            <P> <b>Asigra Releases Televaulting 6.0</B>
            <P> Asigra announced Asigra Televaulting 6.0, which includes upgrades 
              and new capabilities such as Oracle 10g and SQL 8.0 support, centralized 
              mass deployment, and cross-platform protection for Unix, Linux, 
              Windows, and Mac environments.
            <P> According to the company, Televaulting 6.0 provides hot agentless 
              database backup for DB2, Oracle 10g, and SQL 8.0, which allows database 
              users to operate while backup operations are in process without 
              disruption. The software also includes a block-level resume feature 
              for Oracle so that if a connection is lost, the backup session can 
              be continued at the block level rather than the file level.
