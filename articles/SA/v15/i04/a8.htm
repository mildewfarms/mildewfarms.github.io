            <P> Amy Rich
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're in the process of upgrading 
              the memory in a number of our Sun V240s from 4G to 8G. Two of the 
              machines we're upgrading keep coming up with only 6G of RAM (according 
              to top). My guess is that a couple of the DIMMs or slots are bad. 
              Other than systematically swapping memory in and out of the machine, 
              how do we tell which DIMMs/sockets are bad?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you're running Solaris 10 
              or later, the predictive self-healing feature should tell you exactly 
              which DIMM is bad, including the location silk-screened onto the 
              motherboard next to the slot. Under earlier versions of Solaris, 
              you might see a message during boot (which you can retrieve with 
              <B>dmesg</B>) indicating which DIMM is bad.
            <P> You can verify whether the system is seeing the DIMM at all by 
              running <B>/usr/platform/sun4u/sbin/prtdiag -v</B>. The pertinent 
              sections (this one shows a full 8G) of the output are:

            Each processor controls two physical banks of two DIMMs each. To improve 
            interleaving, each physical bank is divided into logical banks by 
            splitting each DIMM. Each processor controls the logical banks seen 
            in the <B>prtdiag</B> output above. If one or more of your physical 
            DIMMs isn't recognized, you should see it missing from the Memory 
            Module Groups output.
            <P> The letters in the Memory Module Groups output stand for Motherboard, 
              Processor, Bank, and DIMM. The diagram at:

            shows the corresponding location of each DIMM slot on the motherboard. 
            Notice that the Bank and DIMM slots are numbered lower when closer 
            to the CPU as opposed to the outside of the board.
            <P> If you put a known good DIMM in the socket with the "dead" DIMM 
              in it, and it's still not seen, you most likely have a bad socket 
              and require a new motherboard.
            <P> If you also need to know vendor and part number information to 
              order matching replacement DIMMs, you can use the service console. 
              From the serial console of the machine, type <B>#.</B> to drop to 
              the <B>sc&gt;</B> prompt (you may need to log in). Once there, type 
              <B>showfru</B> to see information on all of the field replaceable 
              units, including the memory modules. One of the DIMMs might look 
              something like the following:

            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> In my consulting business, I run 
              across a lot of small companies without their own sys admin that 
              need some sort of simple shared-disk solution. They can set up a 
              server with lots of disk, but that's more of an administrative headache 
              than these people need. The other route is to get something like 
              a Netapp or high-end SAN, but those are generally way out of the 
              small business price range. Is there a decent solution for the SOHO 
              market other than "build it yourself?"
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> This question recently came up 
              on a mailing list that I'm on, and they discussed two lines of products 
              fitting your description. The first was Buffalo Technology's TeraStation:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://www.buffalotech.com/products/storage.php
</pre>
            They sell three different models that are internally the same technology 
            but with different capacities: .6TB, 1.0TB, and 1.6TB.
            <P> The second was Infrant Technologies' ReadyNAS line of servers:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://www.infrant.com/products.htm
</pre>
            They sell the ReadyNAS X6, 600, and rackmountable 1000S NAS appliances 
            as well as the boards and OS to roll your own if you want to use commodity 
            hardware. The ReadyNAS X6 and 600 are the same hardware, but the X6 
            makes management a bit easier for users who don't understand RAID 
            at all. To determine which might be better for your clients, take 
            a look at their "Which is right for me" FAQ in their support forum:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://www.infrant.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7650#7650
</pre>
            Both company's products do CIFS/SMB, but only the ReadyNAS also does 
            NFS, so that may be a deciding factor if your clients are UNIX-based 
            (and don't run something like Samba) instead of Windows or Mac.
            <P> <I>Network World</I> did a recent story on SMB-based NAS appliances, 
              at:

            <pre>
http://www.networkworld.com/reviews/2005/102405-storage-test.html

            It awarded the ReadyNAS 600 the "Clear Choice Award" over Anthology 
            Solutions' Yellow Machine, Iomega's StorCenter Pro NAS 200d with REV 
            drive, and Netgear's Storage Central SC101.
            <P> <I>Tom's Networking</I> also did reviews of each of the abovementioned

            Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you're running BIND 9.3 or 
              later, you can use a TSIG (transaction signature) key to select 
              the view you want. If you're running a version of BIND prior to 
              9.3.0, you'll need to configure both of your nameservers with additional 
              IP addresses so you can pass transfer the zones based on IP restrictions. 
              Take a look at the BIND FAQ for specific examples on how to implement 
              each of these:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/FAQ.php
</pre>
            Look for the question "How can I make a server a slave for both an 
            internal and an external view at the same time? When I tried, both 
            views on the slave were transferred from the same view on the master." 
            If you're unfamiliar with TSIG keys, also take a look at Nominum's 
            BIND FAQ:

            Occasionally, Firefox will go nuts, eat a ton of memory, then die 
            on me. I'm pretty certain there's a memory leak in there somewhere, 
            so I'd like to file a bug report. I'm not sure where to start or how 
            I provide the best information. Do you have suggestions?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> To begin, I'd strongly suggest 
              upgrading to a newer version of Firefox since you're dealing with 
              outdated software. Version 1.5 of the source code can be obtained 
              from:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5/source/
</pre>
            and binaries can be obtained from:
            <P> 
            <pre>
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5/contrib/
</pre>
            If you're still having issues after upgrading, then Mozilla has a 
            Web page on how to report Firefox bugs:
            <P> 
            <pre>
&lt;http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/bugs
</pre>
            Note that the very first thing they ask you to do is use the latest 
            nightly build with a new profile. There's also a useful tutorial on 
            writing good bug reports that should get you started.
            <P> If you suspect a memory leak, you can try running Firefox under 
              <B>libumem</B> with <B>mdb</B>. For information on using these tools, 
              take a look at Robert Benson's article titled "Identifying Memory 
              Management Bugs Within Applications Using the libumem Library",
