            <h1><img src="a5.gif" width="200" height="167" align="right">Quick 
              and Dirty Debian Preseeds</h1>
            <P> Joe Blaylock
            <P> For a long time, my co-workers and I have been taking part in 
              an evolutionary movement that will sound familiar to many readers. 
              We've been migrating from huge, expensive, proprietary systems, 
              to small, inexpensive, open ones. Like the fast-breeding shrew-like 
              rodents that replaced the dinosaurs, our systems have been proliferating 
              wildly. Clusters of cheap, relatively disposable systems are replacing 
              powerful singleton hosts. Like the prolific mammals, the survival 
              of our service no longer depends too much on any single host. If 
              a given node or set of nodes dies, there are ample replacements.
            <P> At the heart of our appliance-computing evolution, we've placed 
              the Debian GNU/Linux operating system. Debian is famous (some would 
              say infamous) as a Linux distribution committed to free software, 
              portability, and stability. Being appropriately conservative with 
              releases in their quest for stability, the Debian project has gotten 
              a reputation for cruftiness in some circles. Releases have been 
              known to take years to freeze. Still, it is the extreme amount of 
              care taken that makes Debian so appealing to so many. When you run 
              a Debian system, you know what to expect, from package documentation 
              to upgrade procedures.
            <P> All is not puppies and chocolate-chip cookies in the land of Debian 
              systems administration, however. In particular, when you find yourself 
              handling large numbers of systems, host automation and easy installation 
              become critical. This is an area in which Debian has historically 
              lagged. There has been at least one attempt over the years to make 
              things better; Progeny packaged Kickstart for its Debian-based distribution. 
              However, this didn't really catch on in the larger Debian community, 
              and systems administrators were left to fend for themselves. Until 
              Sarge.
            <P> Since the release of Sarge, Debian has supported partially or 
              fully automated installation using pre-configuration files ("preseeds"). 
              Preseed files are simple sets of key/value pairs that tell most 
              Debian software (including the Debian Installer) how you would like 
              various debconf package configuration questions answered. This frees 
              you, the extremely valuable human being, from having to answer them 
              yourself. Preseed files can be stored on modified installation media, 
              on removable media, such as a USB stick, or even on the network 
              (provided you can help your host onto the network, one way or another). 
              Thus, they can provide significant help to the working systems administrator, 
              whether you have one system or one hundred.
            <P> <B>Getting Started</B>
            <P> Starting a Debian installation with a preseed file is easy. At 
              the boot prompt, simply provide the kernel with an extra parameter, 
              "preseed/url" or "preseed/file". If you wanted to install Sarge 
              using the default startup options and a preseed file on your trusty 
              floppy disk, you would just use:
            <P> 
            <pre>
linux preseed/file=/floppy/preseed.cnf
</pre>
            This would boot Linux, passing the preseed/file parameter to the Debian 
            Installer, which would then look in that location to load a set of 
            defaults. Similarly, a preseed file can be passed in from the network 
            using:
            <P> 
            <pre>
linux preseed/url=http://example.com/preseed.cnf
</pre>
            But take care! If no local resource provides the Debian Installer 
            with a meaningful set of parameters to help it set up the networking, 
            it will default to trying to get a DHCP lease. If it can't get one, 
            then it won't be able to reach your preseed file. This might be okay 
            -- you might be perfectly happy to sit at the keyboard long enough 
            to set up networking on the machine, and then go for coffee. Try not 
            to be too surprised, though, if you seed your installation from the 
            network and go to lunch, only to find later that the machine hasn't 
            done much of anything because it's not plugged into the Ethernet or 
            you forgot to register your MAC address.
            <P> <b>Simple Sample, Explained</b>
            <P> Listing 1 (<B>first.cnf</B>) contains a simple pre-configuration 
              for the Debian Installer, which sets a few installation parameters 
              and then loads additional data from the file <B>second.cnf</B> (Listing 
              2). As you can see, the format has the (possibly abbreviated) name 
              of the package to be preconfigured, the package configuration query 
              to be configured, and the setting to assign, separated by whitespace. 
              In Listing 1, the time zone is preconfigured, and in Listing 2, 
              the system's default locale setting. This shows how preseeding might 
              be useful for often-repeated and rarely altered settings that would 
              be made to all of your nodes -- even if a fully automated installation 
              would be overdoing it.
            <P> <B>FAI and Preseed</B>
            <P> To prepare a set of pre-configuration files for a fully automated 
              system installation, it is best to begin by installing the system 
              manually and to keep careful notes. In particular, a record of the 
              extra packages installed from outside of base would be useful. Any 
              services configured outside of debconf should be recorded, too.
            <P> If your system has the "debconf-utils" package, then a small script 
              like the one in Listing 3 might come in handy. The <B>debconf-dump-settings.sh</B> 
              script will create a file, <B>/root/selections-tidy</B>, which will 
              contain a listing of all of the debconf selections (both explicit 
              and implicit) made during your system installation, sorted for easy 
              reference. Using this, you can add entries to your preseed file, 
              and then try installing the system again -- this time, specifying 
              your new preseed file to try things out. A certain amount of trial 
              and error may be necessary to get things just right, particularly 
              if you're going for a fully automatic system installation.
            <P> The effort to develop a smooth system installation is well worth 
              it, however. Preseeding can make the Debian installation itself 
              painless. Even better, an annotated preseed file set serves as comprehensive 
              documentation of the system's initial state. Keeping the preseed 
              in CVS ensures a record of systems architecture changes over time. 
              What working systems administrator isn't excited by the thought 
              of systems documentation that comes almost for free?
