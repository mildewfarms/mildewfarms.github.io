            <p> The most recent issue of <i>Technology Review</i> magazine announced this year's 
              TR35 -- an annual list of 35 innovators under the age of 35 
              "whose new technologies seem most gloriously creative and most likely 
              to expand human life". The list used to be the TR100, which named 100 
              innovators under 35 but it's recently been pared down; nonetheless, this year's list is full of hope. I look 
              forward to the list every year because of the inspiration these scientists 
              and engineers bring to diverse disciplines. This year's winners 
              include a neurobiologist who has devised a way to make particular neurons 
              fire at will, an electrical engineer who builds electronics that stretch 
              like rubber bands, and a chemical engineer cleaning up toxic waste with 
              nanoparticles. The complete list can be found 
              on <i>Technology Review</i>'s Web site here: <b>http://www.technologyreview.com/tr35/</b>
          <p> Some of these innovations are indistinguishable from 
            magic to me, while others can be more easily comprehended. It's in 
            the nature of good inventions, though, that they seem obvious once you see 
            the need for them. In an article accompanying the list, Jason Pontin 
            pondered how successful innovations come about. He says "successful 
            innovators are famously untroubled by the prospect of failure". 
            Pontin quoted Bryan Cantrill (2005 TR35 winner and inventor of DTrace; see 
            "Learning DTrace -- Part 4: Solving Real Problems" by Chip 
            Bennett in this issue) as saying, "People who have innovated once, 
            and who say they are not frightened that they won't be able to repeat 
            their success, are probably lying. The challenge is not to be crippled by 
            fear, but allow it to drive you forward". Pontin says some innovators 
            actually appreciate failure as an indicator that they're pushing the 
            boundaries. Other innovators find inspiration in asking the big, really 
            hard questions rather than more limiting ones, and still others find <br>
            success in applying knowledge across disparate disciplines. 
          <p> One place to hear from innovators in the field of 
            systems administration is, of course, within the pages of <i>Sys Admin</i>, but you can also hear 
            from them in person at the upcoming LISA conference. The conference will be 
            in Washington, D.C. December 3-8, and this year's presentations will 
            include Richard Bejtlich on "TCP/IP Weapons", a keynote address 
            by Cory Doctorow, and invited talks by Elizabeth Zwicky, Tom Limoncelli, 
            and W. Curtis Preston. Full details are available at: <b>http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa06/</b>
          <p> Meanwhile, I invite you to reveal your innovations, 
            describe your successes, and share your expertise by submitting an article 
            to <i>Sys Admin</i>. We're currently looking for articles on 
            virtualization, security, backup and recovery, and clustering, and we look 
            forward to hearing from you. 
          <p> Sincerely yours, 
          <p> Amber Ankerholz <br>
