            <h1><img src="../../resource/syslog.gif" width="215" height="85" align="right">syslog </h1>
            <p> This issue of <i>Sys Admin</i> focuses on networking, which is a topic that certainly 
              involves cables, configuration, speed, and connectivity but also includes 
              the reason why we set up systems in the first place -- to send and 
              receive information. 
          <p> While watching the Tour de France on television 
            recently, I've been struck by the network of information there. 
            Besides the mesmerizing machine-like force and sheer endurance of the 
            riders and besides the daredevil maneuvering of the mechanics who, 
            seemingly as a matter of course, hang out the window of a moving car to 
            adjust the derailleur of a cyclist pedaling alongside, I'm impressed 
            by the infrastructure. A tremendous logistical effort goes into organizing 
            the riders, the support cars, the security 
            personnel, and the equipment. Also, a huge amount of information is 
            gathered and communicated to the riders throughout the race -- data 
            such as heart rate, speed, distance, exertion level, road conditions, etc. 
          <p> The two-way radio system between the riders and their 
            team cars provides them with all sorts of information about what's 
            happening on the road and allows them to adjust speed and change tactics 
            accordingly. The information can send sprinters to the forefront to chase 
            down a breakaway or alert the whole group to some unseen danger. 
          <p> Maybe your users don't individually burn almost 
            6,000 calories a day or collectively go through 800 tires over the course 
            of a race, but they consume equally important resources, such as storage 
            and bandwidth, which must be provided on 
            demand. In this issue, we provide several articles that discuss ways to 
            ensure your own smoothly running network infrastructure. Anshuman Kanwar 
            describes the use of a tool called Rancid to 
            help automate the process of backing up network device configuration, and 
            Jon Hoffman shows how to build a Java class containing the 
            "heartbeat" functionality needed to check the status of remote 
            computers. Nico Coetzee shows how to build a TCP/IP network accounting 
            system, and Greg Bledsoe shows the benefits of using Linux's built-in 
            traffic control features. 
          <p> I hope you find these articles useful, and I invite 
            you to share your own proven practices with 
            your peers by submitting an article for publication. 
            We're currently looking for articles within the broad themes of Open 
            Source, Security, and Clustering, so please send your proposals to Rikki 
            Endsley Kite at: <b>rendsley@cmp.com</b>. 
          <p> Sincerely yours,
