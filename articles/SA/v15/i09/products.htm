            <b>Seagate Introduces Maxtor Shared Storage II</b>
          <p> Seagate Technology introduced a new network storage 
            solution that lets users access, share, and protect all their digital 
            content from a centralized location on a small office or home network. 
            According to the company, the Maxtor Shared Storage II product family from 
            Seagate automatically backs up business files, accounting records, videos, 
            photos, music, and other digital files stored on multiple networked 
            computers without swapping out tapes, CDs, or DVDs. It provides data 
            management and security for up to 20 PC or Mac users. 
          <p> The 1TB Maxtor Shared Storage II solution comes with 
            an EasyManage CD that automatically gives users a desktop icon for access 
            to a shared public folder and a set of personal password-protected private 
            network folders. A new high-speed Gigabit Ethernet connection ensures fast 
            data transfers and file sharing between computers on wired and wireless 
            networks. A SimpleView feature acts like a built-in IT administrator, 
            providing detailed backup and storage status at a glance of all users on 
            the network. 
          <p> The manufacturer's suggested retail price for 
            the new terabyte (1,000GB), dual-drive solution is $899.95. For more information, visit: http://www.maxtorsolutions.com.

            <b>Exanet Unveils ExaStore CDP </b>
          <p> Exanet, a provider of clustered NAS software, 
            announced a continuous data protection product that fully integrates with 
            high-end, high-performance, clustered NAS platforms. According to the 
            company, ExaStore CDP enhances an organization's ability to quickly 
            and easily recover critical data by giving administrators access to a 
            virtually infinite set of data recovery points. ExaStore CDP encapsulates 
            and integrates replication with the ability to capture block-level changes 
            on a continuous basis, reducing capacity requirements by capturing only the 
            portion of the files that has changed. ExaStore CDP enables a simple 
            transfer to a secondary disaster recovery system, as well as a simple 
            roll-back to any known good recovery point before the event. In both cases, 
            the system enables a full reconstruction of the data from the CDP image, in 
            combination with a previously replicated copy of primary data.

            <b>SXP Releases HampusDB </b>
          <p> SXP announced HampusDB, an open source hybrid 
            database. According to the company, after several years as a proprietary 
            database, HampusDB is now &nbsp;released as an open source product, free 
            and available for download at http://www.hampusdb.org. 
          <p> HampusDB is a flexible and efficient hybrid database, 
            a mixture of a &nbsp;filesystem and a database. The aim is to fill the gap 
            when storing data in a relational database is too rigid and storing data in 
            textfiles is too cumbersome. A typical example would be XML, configuration, 
            or hierarchical data. 
          <p> HampusDB comes with a wide range of command-line 
            utilities for manipulating and extracting data. It's designed for 
            both embedded, desktop and server systems. It currently runs on Linux and 
            has interfaces to C, C++, Java, and Perl.
