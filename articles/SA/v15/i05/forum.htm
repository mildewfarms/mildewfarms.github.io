            <P> Interest in last year's supplement focusing on console servers 
              was so favorable that we decided to do another one. Accompanying 
              this issue, you'll find the Console Servers Supplement containing 
              a product survey compiled by Steve Michnick and the <I>Sys Admin</I> 
              staff that details features and specifications of various console 
              server offerings. The survey includes information only from those 
              console server vendors who completed and returned the form we sent 
              out.
            <P> Other articles in the supplement include "Worldwide Access to 
              Your Serial Consoles" by John Fox and Mark Uris, which provides 
              implementation details of the authors' experience building a centralized 
              console management solution using conserver software, and "Console 
              Design Considerations" by Ron McCarty, which explains some important 
              features and requirements to consider when designing and acquiring 
              a console infrastructure.
            <P> I always welcome reader's comments and suggestions, and I recently 
              heard from Casey Milford in response to Hal Pomeranz's article, 
              "File Integrity Assessment via SSH" that appeared in the February 
              issue. Milford recommends a tool called RFC (Remote Filesystem Checker) 
              as an alternative to Hal's solution. According to the Web site, 
              RFC (<B>http://rfc.sourceforge.net</B>) is a set of scripts that 
              aims to help sys admins run a filesystem-checker (like Tripwire, 
              Aide, and so on...) from a master node to several slave nodes using 
              SSH, scp, sudo, and few other common shell commands. Check it out.
            <P> Reader Bernardino Lopez wrote that he'd like to see an article 
              on Xen virtualization, and our technical editor, Hal, heartily seconded 
              the suggestion. In fact, Hal says he's interested in virtualization 
              in general -- Xen, UML, VMWare -- as well as what people are doing 
              with it as far as server consolidation and migration, security, 
              etc. Hal would also like to see articles on the following:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> What's up with Sendmail X, Perl 6, and other "emerging" open 
                source projects? 
              <li> Newer Web technologies like Ajax and Ruby on Rails. How do 
                these impact the jobs of systems and Web administrators? 
              <li> Sun seems to be betting heavily on its new AMD64-based hardware 
                platforms. Are they really sexy or just ho-hum? Is there anything 
                exciting from any of the other commercial Unix vendors?
            </ul>
            <P> 
            <P> So, if you'd like to share your knowledge of these topics with 
              your peers, please send an article proposal (a brief outline detailing 
              what you plan to cover) to me or directly to the managing editor, 
              Rikki, at: <B>rendsley@cmp.com</B>. We look forward to hearing from 
              you.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
            <P> <I>Amber Ankerholz<BR>
