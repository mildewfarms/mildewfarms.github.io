            <P> <b>NEC Solutions Announces 4GB Storage Arrays</B>
            <P> NEC Solutions, Inc. announced two new storage disk arrays -- the 
              S2500 midrange array and the S1500 entry-level model. According 
              to the company, NEC's S2500 and S1500 provide high-speed performance, 
              increased availability, and simplified operation. The S2500 and 
              S1500 deliver tiered storage through their support of a mixture 
              of high-speed FC disks and low-cost, high-volume SATA disks within 
              a single cabinet. With combined FC/SATA functionality, critical 
              data can be stored in the FC disks and archived data can exist on 
              the SATA disks. NEC also offers redundancy of its main components, 
              its proprietary Phoenix technology, which identifies failing drives 
              to reduce downtime, and RAID-6 support as a standard on its SATA 
              disks to enable continuous operation (even if two hard drives experience 
              a failure).
            <P> The S2500 and S1500 provide cache memory up to 8GB and 4GB respectively. 
              NEC offers up to 32.7 terabytes (TB) storage capacity on the S2500 
              model, and 17.6 TB for the S1500. This performance and scalability 
              is delivered in a compact three-U rack. For more information, visit: 
              http://www.necsam.com.
            <P> <B>Monarch Empro Available in a Four-Way Tower</B>
            <P> Monarch Computer announced the addition of a four-way processor 
              tower to their Empro Server line. According to the company, the

            <P> <B>SAINT Introduces SAINTexploit</B>
            <P> SAINT Corporation announced the launch of the SAINTexploit penetration 
              testing tool. According to the company, SAINTexploit allows administrators 
              to evaluate the security -- or vulnerability -- of a network by 
              running controlled exploits on targeted machines. This automated 
              product examines potentially vulnerable services discovered by SAINT, 
              exposes points where an attacker could penetrate the network, and 
              exploits the vulnerability to prove its existence. The file browsing 
              and command execution capabilities resulting from a successful exploit 
              provide evidence of a network vulnerability. SAINTexploit demonstrates 
              the path an attacker could use to breach a network, quantifies risk 
              to the system, and allows administrators to manage resources more 
              efficiently to better defend information assets. Armed with evidence 
              of system weaknesses, companies are more equipped to fix vulnerabilities 
              and secure their network. SAINTexploit's features include seamless 
              integration with the SAINT graphical user interface, a multi-platform 
              exploit library with continuous updates, and the ease of use to 
              manage penetration testing in-house. SAINTexploit offers additional 
              tools to test client vulnerabilities such as Web browser and media 
              players. The launch of SAINTexploit corresponds with the release 
              of the SAINT Scanner 6.0 vulnerability assessment tool. SAINT 6.0 
              features vulnerability tests, a Web-based interface, and full integration 
              with SAINTexploit.

            <P> <B>Utimaco Debuts SecurE-Mail Gateway 5.0</B>
            <P> Utimaco Safeware released SecurE-Mail Gateway 5.0, the latest 
              version of its enterprise email security product. According to the 
              company, SecurE-Mail Gateway 5.0 includes role-based administration 
              that allows security staff to implement company-specific guidelines 
              for monitoring and managing corporate email systems. Utimaco's SecurE-Mail 
              Gateway provides secure email communication by attaching signatures 
              to email and automatically checking their validity, yet is transparent 
              for its users.
            <P> Via SecurE-Mail Gateway 5.0's new role-based administration, security 
              staff can keep all areas of administrative responsibility separate 
              and distinct from each other. The feature ensures that areas of 
              responsibility of IT security staff and network administrators never 
              overlap; it also allows security staff to establish an auditor role 
              to oversee security policies. Another primary component of SecurE-Mail 
              Gateway is the integrated key server for S/MIME and OpenPGP email, 
              offering centralized administration and distribution for public 
              keys used by an enterprise's communications partners. With the SecurE-Mail 
              Gateway, certificates and keys can automatically be separated from 
              emails and then imported. The technology enables certificates to 
              be administered effectively even when email traffic levels are very 
              high.
