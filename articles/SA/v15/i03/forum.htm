            <h1><img src="../../resource/syslog.gif" width="215" height="85" align="right">syslog</h1>
            <P> I recently received a review copy of <I>Time Management for System 
              Administrators</I> by Thomas A. Limoncelli (O'Reilly), which is 
              tagged "Stop working late and start working smarter". My copy already 
              bears the various creases and earmarks of being well used. 
            <P> Limoncelli himself wastes no time in explaining why sys admins 
              might have difficulty with successful time management and need a 
              book tailored specifically for their use. He says that sys admins' 
              problems are different. For example, they have an unusually high 
              number of interruptions that prevent them from getting projects 
              done. Their solutions are also different; they can handle more high-tech 
              tools to solve problems than a typical, non-technical person. Limoncelli 
              says another difference is that sys admins lack quality mentoring. 
              He says although sys admins need to learn the fundamentals of to-do 
              list management, calendar management, and life-goal management just 
              like anyone else, their mentors are technical peers, often on email 
              lists, and often in different parts of the world. So, they have 
              fewer opportunities to learn by watching. 
            <P> To address these specific needs, Limoncelli offers six principles 
              right off the bat that he carries throughout the book: 
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> One "database" for time management information (use one organizer). 
              <li> Conserve your brain power for what's important (conserve RAM). 
              <li> Develop routines and stick with them (reuse code libraries; 
                don't reinvent the wheel). 
              <li> Develop habits and mantras (replace runtime calculations with 
                precomputed decisions). 
              <li> Maintain focus during "project time" (be like a kernel semaphore). 
              <li> Manage your social life with the same tools you use for your 
                work life (social life isn't an optional feature). 
            </ul>
            <P> 
            <P> Throughout the book, while he examines these principles in greater 
              detail, Limoncelli offers insights and practical guidelines for 
              managing not just your work day but your whole life more effectively. 
              For example, along with concrete suggestions for setting goals, 
              prioritizing your to-do list, and managing all your email accounts, 
              he also offers tips for managing stress, dealing with customers, 
              and even managing your boss. In Chapter 11, he focuses on common 
              time wasters, such as office socializing and disorganized meetings, 
              and explains how to manage those as well. If you'd like to read 
              an excerpt, you can check out Chapter 4 ("The Cycle System") online 
              at the O'Reilly Web site. I highly recommend this book. 
            <P>
