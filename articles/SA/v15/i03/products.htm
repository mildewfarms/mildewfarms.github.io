              which includes software to manage two separately located SANmelody 
              disk servers, each capable of supporting terabyte storage pools, 
              plus a choice of disaster recovery software (either asynchronous 
              LAN/WAN-based replication software for disaster recovery over great 
              distances, or simple and fast synchronous LAN or SAN failover mirroring 
              software for storage pools supporting systems stretched across buildings, 
              campuses, or cross-town distances). 
            <P> DataCore protects storage pools serving multiple platforms or 
              a mix of Windows, NetWare, VMware, Novell, Mac OS, Solaris, and 
              Linux systems. For more information, visit: http://www.datacore.com. 
            <P> <B>Astaro Introduces Astaro Security Gateway 525</B> 
            <P> According to Astaro, the Astaro Security Gateway 525 uses a dual-processor 
              architecture that is enhanced by an acceleration card, which increases 
              virus-scanning performance to provide high throughput when running 
              multiple simultaneous security applications. Additionally, it incorporates 
              gigabit-Ethernet ports that allow for high-speed copper and fiber 
              connections to servers and network components. Fully redundant hot-swappable 
              hard disks and power supplies further enhance reliability. 
            <P> Astaro's line of threat management appliances integrate nine forms 
              of security to protect computer networks from a variety of threats 
              including viruses, hackers, spam, spyware, phishing, and unauthorized 
              content. The Astaro Security Gateway 525 can serve larger organizations 
              of 1000-2000 employees, depending on how many security applications 
              are deployed.
