            <h1><img src="../../resource/syslog.gif" width="215" height="85" align="right">syslog </h1>
            <p> Last month, I asked readers to let me know how 
              they're dealing with spam. My questions were prompted by a lack of 
              articles submitted for the June spam issue. From the responses that I 
              received, the consensus seems to be that third-party tools handle the 
              problem well enough that sys admins don't have to worry too much 
              about it. However, there are issues still to be dealt with. Jim Edwards put 
              it like this: <p>
             <ul>
              1. The problem has mostly been solved. <p>
              2. The problem is here to stay...
            </ul>
            <p> By way of explanation, he says: <p>
            <ul>
              1. The problem has mostly been solved. There are some 
              simple solutions that work very well. We use Brightmail because we get a 
              lot of email from the public, and Brightmail has a very low false-positive 
              rate. 60% of our incoming email is spam, and about 2% of it gets through... 
              The reason no one wrote about it is that there really isn't much else 
              to say that hasn't already been said. <p>
              2. Spam is like traffic, taxes, and death. It is a 
              simple fact of life on the Internet. If you have email, you're gonna 
              have spam; just like if you have a car, you're gonna deal with 
              traffic. If I already have a 98% effective solution in place, is it really 
              worth my time and effort to try to weed out the other 2%? Take into that 
              the fact that the second I come up with a solution, the spammers are going 
              to come up with a way to beat it.
            </ul>
            <p> I also asked readers to tell me what article topics 
              they'd like to see in the future and received a wish for these 
              spam articles: "How to write SpamAssassin Rules", "A 
              Comparison of Anti-Spam Services", "A Survey of Anti-Spam 
              Applications", and "How Bayesian Filtering Works". 
            <p>
            <p> G.K. Meier responded with suggestions in other areas: 
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>How to configure best-of-breed open 
                source software as application layer firewall proxies. 
              <li>How to build reflexive open source 
                firewalls to dynamically reconfigure rules and real-time alerting, and 
                integration with IDS systems.
              <li>Hardening examples of (Unix-like) Web and 
                file servers deployed in DMZs. 
              <li>How to build read-only, flash-based file 
                system images to reduce maintenance, and control sensitive information for 
                use as a hard drive replacement for use with Citrix, SSL VPNs, MS Terminal 
                Services, and VoIP. 
              <li>Methods to allow Unix-like systems to 
                authenticate against Active Directory, using software such as LDAP-UX, 
                OpenLDAP Bridges, and Radius. 
            </ul>
            <p> I thank all of you who wrote to me and who kindly 
              allowed me to share your responses. If you have other suggestions for 
              articles that you'd like to see in Sys Admin or if you'd 
              care to submit an article on your own pet topic, please email me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b> or send a 
              proposal directly to Rikki at: <b>rendsley@cmp.com</b>. 
            <p>
            <p> Sincerely yours,
