            <b>FarStone and Linspire Launch RestoreIT for Linux</b>
          <p> FarStone Technology, Inc. and Linspire, Inc. announced a partnership to 
            offer a Linux version of FarStone&#146;s Personal Disaster Recovery software solution, RestoreIT. 
            According to the companies, the software is designed to complement Linspire&#146;s desktop Linux-based 
            operating systems, and it allows users to restore lost data or an entire system that has been damaged 
            due to computer errors or other common mishaps.
          <p> FarStone&#146;s RestoreIT is a software program that simplifies data 
            and system recovery. The software tracks all changes to a user&#146;s hard drive on a separate hidden 
            disk partition at incremental backup points. In the event of a disaster, a user can restore the system 
            and data that they have lost, as well as choose how far back they would like to go &#151;an hour, two 
            hours, etc. By clicking the spacebar, users can instantly restore their data, files, or a complete 
            system. Since it loads before the OS, RestoreIT will recover all files, system applications, personal 
            settings, and passwords. In addition to automatic backups per a user-defined schedule, RestoreIT 
            can also be configured to automatically restore to pre-defined backups on a regular basis.
          <p> For more details on RestoreIT for Linspire, visit http://www.linspire.com/farstone.
