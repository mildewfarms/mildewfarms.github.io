            <b>Coraid Releases ATA-over-Ethernet Driver for Solaris<sup>TM</sup></b>
          <p> Coraid, Inc. released an ATA-over-Ethernet (AoE) 
            driver for the Solaris operating system. According to the announcement, the 
            new Solaris driver is provided as both source code and a loadable binary 
            and can be downloaded from Coraid's Web site (http://www.coraid.com) 
            at no cost. The new driver works with 32-bit and 64-bit SPARC-based systems 
            running Solaris 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
          <p> Coraid sells its AoE storage products under the brand 
            name EtherDrive. AoE is a non-routed protocol. According to the company, by 
            eliminating the overhead of TCP/IP, there is no need for ToE (TCP/IP 
            off-loan Engine) cards or HBAs (Host Bus Adapters). The announcement says 
            that AoE delivers a scalable, low-cost alternative to iSCSI and 
            FibreChannel. For more information, visit: http://www.coraid.com.
