            <p> Once again, it's time to review the 2006 <i>Sys Admin</i> Editorial 
              Survey results. There's nothing particularly surprising about the 
              results this year, but here are a few highlights: 
          <p>

          <ul>
            <li> 64% of respondents have been reading <i>Sys Admin</i> for more than 4 
              years. 
            <li> Amy Rich's "Questions and 
              Answers" column again topped the list of "most useful regular 
              feature". 
            <li> 84% of 
              readers find the articles in <i>Sys Admin</i> technically to be about the right level, 9% find them 
              too technical, and 7% find them not technical enough.
            <li> The question about years of experience in systems administration breaks down 
              just beautifully with one-third of respondents having 1-5 years experience, 
              one-third having 6-10 years, and one-third having more than 10 years of 
              experience. 
            <li> 42% of respondents work for companies 
              with fewer than 500 employees, and 58% work for companies with 501 or more 
              employees. 
        </ul>
            Within those organizations, respondents support the 
    following users and operating systems:
            <p>

          <ul>
            <li> 25% of respondents support 1-100 users, 
              40% support 101-500 users, and 32% support more than 500 users. 
            <li> 79% of respondents support Linux, 48% 
              support Solaris, 21% support AIX, 21% MacOSX, 18% BSD, and 18% support 
              HP-UX. 
            <li> On average, survey respondents each 
              administer about 30 servers. 
        </ul>
            For me, the most fun part about the annual survey 
    process is reading the write-in comments to questions, such as "What 
    do you like most about <i>Sys Admin</i>?" This year's replies included:
    <p>

  <ul>
    <li> Not much fluff, very tech oriented
      
    <li> Plain simple Linux help 
      
    <li> Functional (useful) info in articles 
      
    <li> Perl Advisor 
      
    <li> Layout and usefulness. It's the 
      only magazine to which I still subscribe! 
      
    <li> Shell script articles 
</ul>
    Things respondents said they didn't like about <i>Sys Admin</i> included:
    <p>

  <ul>
    <li> Too much programming 
      
    <li> Vendor-supplied supplements 
      
    <li> Not enough BSD coverage 
      
    <li> New products section 
      
    <li> Not enough info on different systems each month 
      
    <li> Not enough time to read it 
</ul>
    Remember that one way you can directly affect the 
    future content of <i>Sys Admin</i> is by writing an article on your particular area of expertise. 
    Upcoming themes include open source, clustering, backup and recovery, and 
    security, but we welcome all proposals, comments, and suggestions. Please 
    write to me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b> or to Rikki at: <b>rendsley@cmp.com</b>. We look forward to hearing from you.
    <p> Sincerely yours, 
  <p> Amber Ankerholz <br>
    Editor in Chief
