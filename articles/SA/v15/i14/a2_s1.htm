            <h1><B>Justification or Getting Console Servers in the Door</B></h1>
            <P> If you have not yet received budgetary approval to pursue a console 
              server solution, then you will likely need to provide a justification 
              to purchase the console server. Purchasing approval can be difficult 
              to obtain, especially if the approver does not understand or appreciate 
              the technology. Here are some suggestions and approaches that have 
              proven useful for others.
            <P> <B>Disaster Recovery</B>
            <P> The major reason for having a console server is to speed a recovery 
              operation. Often, the approach used to sell this idea, however, 
              is to say "this will make my life easier" or "this will let me fix 
              it without being there". Although these are true statements, they 
              do not represent the business view of what is advantageous about 
              making your life easier. This justification must be translated to 
              "the console server will reduce after-hour response times by 1 to 
              1.5 hours", for example.
            <P> If your business uses SLAs, uptime statistics, or must either 
              report or pay for downtime to the customer, then these metrics can 
              be pretty accurately used to estimate the time and/or cost saved.
            <P> <B>Audit Time</B>
            <P> Because of Sarbanes-Oxley, everyone is working on audits. One 
              of the common themes of audits is the requirement to protect data 
              as part of a data management policy. Typically, the features required 
              for data protection include tiered access, additional logging, and 
              encryption of sensitive data. Console servers can help meet these 
              requirements by providing tiered access to the console port (with 
              multiple authentication approaches possible), logging and alerting 
              of console events, and encrypted access to the management port.
            <P> <B>Phased Approach</B>
            <P> If you support a large environment, it can be very difficult to 
              justify enough console servers for the whole environment. Therefore, 
              a phased approach over time and budget cycles is best. Individual 
              console servers are very affordable and can be deployed to the most 
              critical servers initially.
            <P> <B>Hardware Refresh</B>
            <P> Console servers can be brought in as part of a hardware refresh. 
              The cost is minimal compared to the total system cost.
            <P> <B>Hardware Standards</B>
            <P> Console servers should become part of the standard build-out process 
              much like fiber, Ethernet, and storage, and each system purchased 
              must either have a free port on existing console servers or a new 
              console server purchased.</table></table>&nbsp;
