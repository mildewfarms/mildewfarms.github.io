            <h1>Console Servers Product Survey</h1>
            <P> Steve Michnick
            <P> The principal gateway for accessing and managing all systems in 
              a modern datacenter is a solid and secure console server. Console 
              servers provide access to almost any device controlled by a serial 
              port such as servers, network hubs, routers, switches, and power 
              management systems. The datacenter support staff needs a fast and 
              reliable means to connect to all datacenter components through one 
              centralized service. Sys admins need secure local and remote access 
              to system consoles from any location at any time to effectively 
              and efficiently manage all the servers in a distributed environment. 
              System managers need the ability to monitor connection sessions, 
              audit access logs, and ensure encryption of console activity to 
              meet increasingly strict security expectations from customers and 
              government regulators.
            <P> A console server is much more than a large KVM switch that extends 
              the connection distance to your terminals. Today's console servers 
              are designed to address security and redundancy requirements and 
              provide features that simplify the task of operating fleets of data-processing 
              equipment. You can find products that offer features such as extensive 
              buffering to capture diagnostic information from a serial device 
              that is having problems. Console server vendors have developed systems 
              to allow you to use the native cables and keyboards for your computers 
              and provide multi-platform and multi-user capabilities. Redundancy 
              features of multiple power supplies and independent network access 
              are now widely available to ensure that the mission critical function 
              of console server is always available.
            <P> The aim of this year's survey is to help you understand some of 
              the features available when evaluating console server products and 
              show how vendors in the marketplace are positioning themselves to 
              meet your console server requirements. The participating vendors 
              provided extensive information about the features of their console 
              server products, and that information is summarized in the accompanying 
              table. For more detailed console server information and pricing, 
              please contact a vendor sales representative and visit the vendors' 
              Web sites.
            <P> <B>Console Access Methods</B>
            <P> The most critical features to consider when evaluating console 
              servers are the methods they provide for accessing your computer 
              systems and network devices. There are two fundamental methods: 
              terminal server and browser-based approaches. All surveyed vendor 
              products support terminal server access and all but one support 
              browser-based access with moderately varying degrees of features.
            <P> <B>Terminal Servers</B>
            <P> Terminal servers provide a command-line interface (CLI) that can 
              use secure shell (SSH) protocol for encrypting the console network 
              connection. The CLI approach to accessing consoles has been the 
              standard method of console access for years and vendors provide 
              a variety of terminal emulations to provide support for the widest 
              range of serial port managed systems possible. You should still 
              check with the console server vendors about compatibility if you 
              have devices that do not support VT-100 interfaces.
            <P> One critical limitation to terminal server access across SSH is 
              that it requires sys admins to carry their SSH client licenses and 
              keys with them to successfully connect to a system console. Another 
              limitation to the CLI/SSH approach is the extent to which the terminal 
              server's SSH clients can determine and cache critical alerts. This 
              is important so alerts can be sent to the admin when starting a 
              console connection.
            <P> Finally, it is important to understand whether a vendor's console 
              server SSH-based client will interact with your operations standards 
              for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) systems, 
              such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), RADIUS, Active 
              Directory, and Cisco Systems TACACS+.
            <P> <B>Browser Access</B>
            <P> Accessing the console server using a Web browser is desirable 
              because it provides sys admins with a way to connect to the console 
              server through WANs and even the Internet under the protection of 
              the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol using a wide variety of 
              Java-enabled devices. This provides sys admins with around-the-clock, 
              on-call responsibilities, and the capability to quickly respond 
              to alerts from any place that can provide access to the World Wide 
              Web. Browser access sets a sys admin free from carrying a copy of 
              an SSH client along with the requisite server keys.
            <P> Web-browser solutions also can take advantage of the full potential 
              of the console server operating system's ability to cache and intelligently 
              process system messages to provide a full report of alerts and traps 
              from a managed server. Browser solutions also provide flexibility 
              in implementing encryption algorithms and AAA solutions for directory 
              services due to the ease of sending Java applets to the client browser. 
              The main drawbacks to browser access to console servers are the 
              limitations to terminal emulation and the lack of support for out-of-band 
              access, which is critical if confronted with a network denial-of-service 
              attack.
            <P> <B>How to Use the Survey</B>
            <P> This survey is organized into four categories: console server 
              features, platform specifications, connectivity, and security. Each 
              line categorizes some of the important aspects to consider when 
              developing specifications for evaluating console server vendors.
            <P> <B>Console Server Features</B>
            <P> This is a short summary of the platform, operating system, addressing 
              support, and redundancy features available from the vendors who 
              responded to the survey:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Direct Port Addressing determines whether sessions can be established 
                directly to a console port, bypassing the console server command 
                interface. 
              <li> Redundancy features are critical given the central command 
                and control role a console server will play in data center operations. 
                Redundant network interfaces and power supplies are a necessity 
                for data operations with high availability requirements. Hot-swappable 
                components help to eliminate downtime when a hardware component 
                fails.
            </ul>
            <P> <B>Platform Specifications</B>
            <P> This section provides the details of the number of CPUs, available 
              RAM, and Flash Memory capabilities of each vendor's products. You 
              can also see whether the vendor system hardware uses common hardware 
              platforms such as Sparc or x86-based systems or whether the console 
              server is built with specialized processors or proprietary hardware. 
              This section also provides information about each vendor's redundancy 
              features, such as dual NICs, dual power supplies, and hot-swappable 
              components.
            <P> <B>Connectivity</B>
            <P> This section details the port capacity, data transfer rates, Ethernet 
              interfaces, protocols supported, and Web-browser access. A business 
              merger or acquisition can rapidly increase the number of systems 
              in a datacenter. Managers of datacenters should consider how well 
              a console server product can scale to meet the future growth demands 
              of their operation. An Out-of-Band connection feature provides for 
              access to the console server outside of the datacenter network, 
              typically using a dial-in modem. This is a critical requirement 
              for gaining access to the console server when normal network conditions 
              do not exist.
            <P> <B>Security</B>
            <P> This section summarizes key security features offered by the vendors. 
              Security features are principle concerns of CIOs and Datacenter 
              Managers. Understanding the features offered by vendors is important 
              for determining whether the console server will meet security requirements 
              now and in the future. These features include encryption algorithms, 
              authentication method, session monitoring and logging capabilities, 
              history buffering, SSH compatibility, and the method of sending 
              critical system alarms. Most vendors provide security features but 
              not all offer the same range of encryption options and AAA capabilities. 
              Understanding the security requirements and technical specifications 
              mandated by your datacenter policies will help you pick the console 
              server that is compatible with your needs.
            <P> <B>Vendor Notes</B>
            <P> The vendors who responded to this survey provided generous information 
              about all the console server products they offer. These replies 
              were condensed to show the common features available across each 
              vendor's product lines along with specific notes describing where 
              there are differences in the features available between the vendor 
              models. Please consult the vendor Web sites or sales consultants 
              for complete and specific details on each of the models they offer.
            <P> All but one vendor included in this survey offers integrated hardware/software 
              console server solutions. Carlo Gavazzi provides software to turn 
              a Sun Solaris server, equipped with proprietary Asynchronous Multi-port 
              Controllers, into a console server. Carlo Gavazzi's unique approach 
              provides the ability to custom-build a console server with the level 
              of performance, redundancy, and number of console ports to suit 
              your needs.
