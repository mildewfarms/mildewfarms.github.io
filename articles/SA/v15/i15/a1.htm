            <h1>Using Console Servers to Support Audits Driven by Sarbanes-Oxley </h1>
            <p> Ron McCarty 
            <p> The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which was passed in 2002, 
              established requirements for public companies to ensure accuracy of their 
              financial reporting. These requirements have created an audit focus point 
              for most IT shops in publicly traded companies. 
            <p> The SOX Act does not specifically define the particular 
              process or controls that companies and IT must implement. However, the 
              Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which oversees the accounting 
              portions of the act, recommends use of the COSO framework, which focuses 
              mainly on the accounting aspects of SOX. For IT-related matters, many 
              organizations choose to follow the COBIT framework, which is defined by the 
              ISACA, an information governance organization for auditors and security 
              professionals. 
            <p> Regardless of framework, there are common themes that 
              IT shops ultimately end up concentrating on from a systems 
              administrator's standpoint. Of these common themes, there are several 
              areas that console servers lend themselves well to supporting: security, 
              incident management, installation, and technical support. Let's 
              examine some of the specific auditing needs that console servers can be 
              used to meet. 
            <p>

            <b>Security: Physical </b>
          <p> When providing access to the data center and 
            individual systems, a common objective is to ensure that access is given 
            only to those that need it and that the least privileges necessary are 
            granted to an employee for a particular function or job. 
          <p> Traditionally, in mainframe shops that pre-date open 
            systems, this was achieved through physical segregation where tape drives 
            were kept in one area, CPU resources in another, and front-end processing 
            in yet another area. Tape operators, for example, could access the tape 
            area, but not the CPU area, and system personnel could access the central 
            processing area, but not the tape area. 
          <p> With open systems, segregation of areas has not always 
            been possible or desired. However, the practice of separation is still a 
            basic security posture and a common audit theme that can minimize security 
            risks. 
          <p> Console servers can help implement a separation of 
            areas. Console servers can be deployed in areas that have equipment with 
            various support responsibilities and then be used to provide access and 
            segregate the equipment. For example, in a large organization with hardware 
            support teams, console access can be granted to network administrators, 
            systems administrators, and PBX administrators. None of these 
            administrators will have access to another's equipment and can access 
            their own equipment only after provisioning takes place to allow specific 
            console access. Everyone else can be denied access to the area. 
          <p> For areas with the tightest physical security or remote 
            sites, some console servers provide power management options that allow a 
            server's power to be cycled in those rare circumstances where a 
            system is completely hung. 
          <p> The console server also builds in an audit trail by 
            allowing activity to be logged. The logs can be stored for reactive use 
            (i.e., when something happens), can be randomly inspected by data center or 
            network security personnel, or can even be monitored by custom tools or a 
            third party to alert based upon particular regular expressions. 
          <p>

            <b>Security: Logical </b>
          <p> This physical control of the port also lends itself to 
            additional logical controls. For example, many simpler devices and legacy 
            equipment may not have authentication support at the console interface. By 
            forcing all console traffic through console servers, authentication is 
            provided to the console port that did not previously support 
            authentication. Additionally, most console servers support port 
            provisioning based upon user and group membership, so that the combination 
            of authentication and segregation is provided 
            in the most granular fashion possible. On systems that do provide 
            authentication, the console server does not 
            bypass the authentication, so native security measures are also kept in 
            place. 
          <p> Additional audit objectives of meeting strong password 
            requirements (length, characters, aging, etc.) can also be met. By 
            utilizing many open and industry standards, console servers can typically 
            meet the password requirements of your organization by utilizing password 
            mechanisms already in place, such as secure lightweight directory access 
            protocol (LDAP). This means that even if the device cannot natively support 
            the appropriate strong passwords requirements, the console server can 
            enable the functionality. 
          <p> If physical security cannot be tightened as much as 
            needed, additional security can be put in place on the console server to 
            monitor loss of signals and system prompts that suggest a system has been 
            disconnected. 
          <p>

            <b>Incident Management: Security </b>
          <p> Besides the logging mentioned above, console servers 
            can play a role in investigating security incidents by providing an 
            out-of-band method to access the particular device that is being used to 
            monitor the incident. Although the use of out-of-band is not required 
            during an attack, it does make the investigation easier by keeping the IP 
            traffic from the investigation separate from the traffic that is being 
            investigated. 
          <p> Out-of-band access is required, however, when the 
            decision is made to disconnect the system from the network. If a system is 
            compromised, the organization must weigh the risks of further internal 
            compromises and external attacks, and the choice to disconnect the system 
            from the network is usually made. Without the console access, security 
            professionals and systems administrators must access the system locally, 
            which would draw further unwanted attention to the compromised system. 
          <p> The console posture shows auditors that the 
            organization takes incidents involving company data seriously but is 
            carrying out investigations discreetly and professionally to increase the 
            likelihood of stopping the incident and identifying the intruder. 
          <p> For shops that leverage honey pots during security 
            incidents, the console server also provides the needed access to the 
            original system that the honey pot is mimicking. 
          <p> In addition to the out-of-band use, the 
            console's capturing and buffering capability can be used to capture 
            data during a denial-of-service attack that is causing syslog traffic to 
            not reach its destination. (Syslog uses UDP, so delivery is not 
            guaranteed.) Syslogd can be configured to write output to the console 
            during the attack, ensuring the messaging is captured so that the incident 
            management team can investigate the incident thoroughly. 
          <p> Many console servers also allow others to watch a 
            session while someone else is carrying out work. This can be a very 
            powerful tool to allow both administrators and security professionals to 
            follow an incident in real time. It can also be used to allow a vendor to 
            participate or allow someone to watch as a vendor carries out particular 
            work during a security incident without the keyboard user and the "watcher" being in the same location. To mitigate risk during 
            these types of incidents and to provide access to lesser-privileged 
            accounts, many console servers provide read-only accounts to limit activity 
            to viewing. 
          <p>

            <b>Installation </b>
          <p> To help meet audit objectives, many organizations 
            ensure a system turn-up sheet is used to comply with the IT 
            department's security requirements during installation. Often many 
            organizations jump through many procedural hoops to document the fact that 
            particular steps were followed during a turn up to ensure a pass during an 
            audit. For example, the administrator may refer to the checklist, create a 
            ticket for the turn up or particular steps, perform the work, update the 
            ticket, and then update the checklist. This is often done using copy and 
            paste or by manually entering summaries of particular steps. 
          <p> The console server can be leveraged to automate many 
            of the reporting portions of these tasks. At the basic level, the systems 
            administrator could simply use the console server's ability to 
            capture information to ensure an accurate record is captured and attached 
            to the checklists (soft or hard copies) and tickets. A more advanced 
            approach would be to place wrappers around the captured output during 
            system turn up and have tickets and turn-up checklists generated 
            automatically if the effort is worth it, which will most likely depend on 
            the size of the shop. 
          <p>

            <b>Technical Support</b>
          <p> Auditors have long realized that information systems 
            are at higher risk during technical support issues because the focus is 
            either on fixing an issue or providing a needed service quickly. To balance 
            the need to fix things quickly, auditors and IT shops recognize the value 
            of change management policies and procedures that are approved as standard 
            methods of dealing with issues before the issue arises. 
          <p> Often times, a post mortem report is necessary if the 
            technical support was part of a restoration of services incident. However, 
            organizations must spend a lot of time re-hashing the incident to determine 
            which activity took place when. These post mortem reports and the change 
            management tickets that were entered to support the incident are often 
            lacking in the type of detail auditors prefer to see. 
          <p> Console servers can address the deficiencies of trying 
            to remember specific details by providing a log of what occurred. By 
            requiring personnel to work though the console servers during incidents 
            that will require additional reporting, the post mortem report can be 
            completed much more quickly, with more than enough technical detail to meet 
            any auditor's questions. 
          <p>

            <b>Summary</b>
          <p> Systems administrators at public companies find 
            themselves spending a lot of time supporting SOX audit initiatives. Often 
            as soon as an internal audit is completed, a kickoff for the next external 
            audit is started, followed by another internal, in a never-ending c</span>            
          <span 
    class="text2">ycle to ensure that financial results are reported 
    accurately.
            <p> Systems administrators can leverage console servers to 
              meet audit demands, especially in the areas of security, incident 
              management, installation, and technical support as covered here. By tuning 
              existing console servers to meet the auditing requirements or acquiring 
              console servers to meet audit requirements, administrators can increase the 
              likelihood of passing audits.
