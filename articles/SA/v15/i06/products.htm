            <b>Internet Security Systems Enhances Server Protection for Linux Platform</b>
          <p> Internet Security Systems, Inc. announced Linux support for its Proventia Server Intrusion Prevention System product line. According to the company, key features of Proventia Server for Linux include vulnerability-based intrusion prevention, Buffer Overflow Exploit Prevention (BOEP), and support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Servers. Proventia Server for Linux is constantly updated with vulnerability discoveries and can automatically patch and protect critical servers until organizations are able to obtain and apply patches from affected vendors. Also key to ISS server protection strategy is the company&Otilde;s BOEP technology, which protects hosts from attackers and worms that attempt to use known or previously unknown buffer overflow attacks to exploit the system or propagate.
          <p> Proventia Server for Linux is available now. For more information, visit: http://www.iss.net/find_products/server.php.

            <b>Parallels Workstation 2.1 Delivers Virtualization Solution for Intel-powered Apple Computers</b>
          <p> Parallels announced that it is beginning beta testing for Parallels Workstation 2.1 for Mac OS X, the first virtualization software that gives Apple users the ability to simultaneously run Windows, Linux, or any other operating system and their applications alongside Mac OS X on an Intel-powered Apple computer. According to the company, virtualization software enables users to run multiple operating systems, like Linux or Windows, in isolated &Ograve;virtual machines&Oacute; directly on a Mac OS X desktop, giving users the ability to run programs that are only available on those operating systems, without having to give up the usability and functionality of their Mac OS X machine. Each virtual machine operates like a stand-alone computer and contains its virtual hardware, including RAM, hard disk, processor, I/O ports, and CD/DVD-drives.
          <p> New and existing Parallels users can download and evaluate a free, fully functional 30-day trial of Parallels Workstation 2.1 for Mac OS X at http://www.parallels.com/download/mac/. Beta users can submit comments, suggestions and feedback by visiting http://www.parallels.com/en/support/mac/, or by sending an email to macbeta@parallels.com.
