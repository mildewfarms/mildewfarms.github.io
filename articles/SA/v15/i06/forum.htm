            This month's theme as stated on the cover is 
    spam. You may notice, however, that there's really only one 
    spam-related article in this issue. It's Hal Pomeranz's article 
    on the GreetPause feature in Sendmail, which can identify specific, 
    unwanted email traffic. Hal's article is excellent and definitely 
    worth reading, but my point is that he wrote it because we received no 
    spam-related manuscripts in response to our call for papers on the topic.
            <p> Why is this? Have systems administrators effectively 
              "solved" the spam problem, so they're not worried about 
              it and thus don't have much to say about it anymore? Are users more 
              educated on the topic, making it less of a problem than in the past? At our 
              office, I often hear Rikki across the hall saying, how did <i>this</i> make it through the 
              spam filter? I, meanwhile, do a daily search of my spam folder for 
              business-related notes that got trapped there. But, that's just a 
              matter of tweaking, swatting at flies essentially. Maybe there's just 
              not much new to say about spam, or maybe the topic just hit readers at the 
              wrong time. I'm curious, though, and would like to hear your 
              thoughts. Do you need more articles about spam? If not, what do you need? 
              What problems are you working on right now? What topics will you need to 
              know about in the future? 
          <p> What would you like the magazine themes to be for the 
            year 2007? Send me a list, and I'll give your suggestions full 
            consideration. 
          <p> We're planning for next year right now, and as 
            part of that planning, we will soon mail an editorial survey to a subset of 
            readers. If you receive a survey, please take the time to fill it out and 
            return it. Use the survey as a tool to tell us what you like and 
            don't like about the magazine and what you think would make it 
            better. The information you provide is invaluable to us in determining how 
            to make the magazine more useful to you. 
          <p> But regardless of whether you receive a survey, take a 
            minute to write and let us know what you'd like to see in the 
            magazine. Send your suggestions for future coverage to me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>. 
            Or, send a proposal for an article directly to Rikki at: <b>rendsley@cmp.com</b>. We look 
            forward to hearing from you. 
          <p> Sincerely yours, 
          <p> Amber Ankerholz <br>
