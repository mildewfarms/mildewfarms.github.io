            <h1>What Makes Salaries Rise for Security Professionals?</h1>
            <P> Alan Paller
            <P> Systems administrators and security administrators work hard all 
              day, protect critical assets, keep systems operating, clean up after 
              the messes that users make, and generally keep the organization 
              operating smoothly. Yet, at the end of the day, they rarely know 
              whether all that work is going to be rewarded and whether they are 
              being treated fairly for the effort they are putting in.
            <P> Now a new survey, sponsored jointly by <I>Sys Admin</I> magazine, 
              <I>Certification Magazine</I>, and the SANS Institute offers a few 
              answers. The answers may not work for every reader, but they just 
              might provide a clue about what matters most in getting raises.
            <P> The data used for this article reflects answers from 1,597 Technical 
              Security Professionals with titles like Systems Administrator, Network 
              Administrator, Programmer, Security Engineer, Systems Engineer, 
              Security Analyst/Consultant (hands-on), Security Auditor (hands-on), 
              Systems Integrator, Security Penetration Tester, and Web Security 
              Manager. Each of these people provided detailed answers to a 30-question 
              survey between October 20 and November 10, 2005. Their answers constitute 
              one of the clearest pictures ever of the developed of the technical 
              security professional's job.
            <P> Let's get to know the people who completed the survey.
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> 11% are women, and 89% are men. 
              <li> Nearly a quarter (22%) are government contractors, reflecting 
                the huge market for security professionals in government. 
              <li> They are a well-educated group -- 54% have undergraduate degrees, 
                and 18% have Masters or Ph.D. degrees. 
              <li> Most are individual performers, but 15% manage one to three 
                subordinates, and 7% manage four or more subordinates. 
              <li> Their employers range from very small to very large. The respondents 
                are approximately evenly divided among the following employee 
                size categories:
                <P> Under 250 (18%)
                <P> 251-2,000 (20%)
                <P> 2,001-10,000 (22%)
                <P> 10,001 - 50,000 (21%)
                <P> More than 50,000 (19%) 
              <li> Nearly 90% have earned certifications:
                <P> 29% have earned vendor certifications, such as those from 
                  Microsoft or Cisco.
                <P> 22% have earned GIAC certifications.
                <P> 21% have earned CISSP or another ISC2 certification.
                <P> 12% have earned Security+ or Network+ or A+ certifications.
                <P> 4% have earned CISA or CISM certifications from ISACA.
                <P> 11% have earned no certifications. 
              <li> They have been working a long time:
                <P> 5% have fewer than 3 years of experience.
                <P> 8% have 3 to 5 years of experience.
                <P> 27% have 5 to 10 years of experience.
                <P> 36% have 10 to 20 years of experience.
                <P> 24% have more than 20 years of experience.
                <P>
            </ul>
            <P> Now that we know a little about who provided the information, 
              let's try to determine what controls their salaries.
            <P> We compared their salaries with the industries in which they work 
              (see Table 1). From the table, one might think that moving to work 
              for a utility or construction/resource industry or transportation 
              company would be a good move. Sadly, there are <I>very</I> few jobs 
              in those industries. So to get higher pay, one might have to move 
              to government or banking or telecommunications companies, but that 
              may also be hard because it requires learning an entirely new industry.
            <P> We compared their salaries with the size of their employers (see 
              Table 2). Not surprisingly, larger employers paid more, up to a 
              point. Beyond 10,000 employees, there was no impact. If you work 
              for a small- or medium-sized company, you could do better working 
              for a larger company or government agency. But that, too, is hard. 
              Larger organizations can be very bureaucratic and difficult for 
              people used to a more free-wheeling smaller organization.
            <P> <B>How Can You Earn More?</B>
            <P> So we started looking for what you can do inside your existing 
              organization to earn more money.
            <P> We asked whether having a certification was worthwhile (see Table 
              3). The data showed that technical certifications matter and that 
              multiple certifications matter more.
            <P> We asked whether people with any of the three technical certifications 
              groups earned more money (see Table 4). People holding the management-oriented 
              certifications from ISC2 (CISSP) and ISACA (CISA, CISM) earned more 
              than those holding more technical certifications. Of the three technical 
              certifications, GIAC holders had the highest salaries while vendor-specific 
              certification and CompTIA certification holders made less.
            <P> Then we went deeper and asked what respondents thought was most 
              important to career advancement (see Table 5). Not surprisingly, 
              98% felt that technical skills were important or very important 
              (80% felt they were very important).
            <P> The tough question is how can professionals prove they have great 
              technical security skills? Employers usually learn otherwise only 
              when hackers have taken over the computers and stolen critical information 
              or when some other incident has occurred.
            <P> To try to get an answer, we asked people who held certifications 
              (and obviously knew what they were worth) which of the certifications 
              would be the best indicator of hands-on technical security skills 
              (see Table 6).
            <P> Not surprisingly, respondents holding certain certifications thought 
              that those certifications reflected strong hands-on security skills. 
              For example, 75% of those holding vendor-specific certifications 
              (e.g., Checkpoint or MCSE or CCNA) thought their certifications 
              proved they had solid technical skills. Similarly, 91% of those 
              who hold GIAC certifications said their certifications reflected 
              strong hands-on security skills.
            <P> What was surprising was that neither CompTIA certification holders 
              (Security+, A+, etc.) nor ISC2 certification holders (CISSP, etc.) 
              thought their certifications demonstrated strong hands-on security 
              skills. These professionals voted nearly two to one that vendor-specific 
              certifications and GIAC certifications were far better indicators 
              of hands-on security skills than their own certifications were.
            <P> <B>Salary Isn't Everything</B>
            <P> Regardless of pay, you really need to like your job to have a 
              satisfying career. We ended the survey by asking what respondents 
              liked best and what they hated most about their employers. We didn't 
              prompt them at all, but gave them a blank form in which to write 
              their answers.
            <P> In the "liked best" category the most often repeated entries included:
            <P> 
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Gives me freedom to make decisions and try new ideas. 
              <li> Listens to me and trusts me. 
              <li> Allows me to get advanced training to keep my skills current. 
              <li> Appreciates what I do and thanks me. 
              <li> Gives me interesting and challenging projects. 
              <li> Gives me flexibility in hours. 
              <li> Provides a relaxed work environment (most of the time).
            </ul>
            <P> 
            <P> In the "liked least" category the most often repeated entries 
              included:
            <P> 
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Job overload and schedules that are too short. 
              <li> Bureaucracy, layers of management, clueless bosses. 
              <li> Dumb users I have to teach the same things to over and over. 
              <li> Low salary. 
              <li> No training budget. 
              <li> Not responding to ideas for improvement, even when they solicited 
                the ideas. 
              <li> Doesn't give us authority to make decisions. 
              <li> Politics.
            </ul>
