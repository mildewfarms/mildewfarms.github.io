            <h1>How Important Is Certification?</h1>
            <P> Emmett Dulaney
            <P> As soon as somebody says "certification", a flood of responses 
              usually follows. Most of the views expressed are typically along 
              these lines:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Is there any value in that? 
              <li> Are people still doing that? 
              <li> Isn't that for people who don't have experience? 
              <li> What's in it for me? 
              <li> That's just a piece of paper... 
              <li> Where can I find what's popular and get more information? 
              <li> Will my employer pay for it?
            </ul>
            <P> 
            <P> And on they go, with people generally falling into one of two 
              camps -- those who think there is value in certification, and those 
              who immediately dismiss the idea. Those in the first camp usually 
              feel the way they do either because they hold certifications of 
              their own, work in HR, or have been told by co-workers/acquaintances 
              that certifications are valuable. Those who fall in the second camp 
              never have certifications of their own, and often have many years 
              experience on the job.
            <P> To help understand these two camps better, I want to move away 
              from the IT field for a moment. We have a tendency to think that 
              the profession in which we work is unlike anything else that exists 
              or has ever come before. How can anyone else understand or appreciate 
              what it is like to rebuild a system after a crash, to write a script 
              that pulls out the one key piece of data hidden in reams of numbers, 
              or to implement a security system that allows you to rest easily 
              at night?
            <P> The truth of the matter is that there is a great parallel between 
              the IT field and many other professions. Consider automotive repair, 
              for example. There are mechanics who have learned everything they 
              know through trial and error; they have little to no schooling in 
              the trade but are naturals at what they do. Some of them have an 
              uncanny ability to diagnose what is wrong with a vehicle and know 
              just what to do to solve the problem quicker -- and more effectively 
              -- than others. They can't always explain what they do in a way 
              someone outside the field would appreciate, and they may scoff at 
              the idea of being able to learn some of what they know through trade 
              schools.
            <P> Working in the same profession are mechanics who have gone to 
              trade schools or dealer training and taken certification exams through 
              the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), 
              for example. They may or may not have the same innate ability to 
              fix vehicles, but they have the certifications to show they've studied 
              the topics and are current in the profession.
            <P> Both are good to have in the field and both provide valuable services 
              -- they can co-exist comfortably in the same vocation. On the surface, 
              it is impossible to say that one is better than another when it 
              comes to working on your car, and you only learn that through repeated 
              interaction with them.
            <P> Now, imagine that you are the service manager for the local car 
              dealership and you have an opening. Who are you going to hire? One 
              applicant says that he has worked on cars his whole life, scoffs 
              at certifications, and tells you he is a good mechanic. The other 
              applicant also tells you he is a good mechanic but has numerous 
              pieces of paper that you can frame on the wall for customers to 
              look at. Yes, some people with papers are simply good at passing 
              tests and might turn out to be dumber than a box of hammers, but 
              that might be equally true of a mechanic with experience only.
            <P> The odds are that those pieces of paper make it easier to slant 
              a hiring decision toward the certified mechanic. Not only do those 
              papers slant it that way for someone in HR, but they have the potential 
              to do that for customers as well. For some reason, I just feel better 
              knowing that the person working on my brake system has been certified 
              as a master mechanic in that specialty.
            <P> Moving away from the analogy, apply those same thoughts to IT. 
              While you don't need a certification to do a job, it looks good 
              to HR; it looks good to customers, and it makes you stand out a 
              bit from those who don't have any acronyms after their name. Although 
              a certification may not be a requirement for the job you currently 
              have, it can be helpful in gaining customers/contracts and in helping 
              you land a job.
            <P> <B>What's Popular?</B>
            <P> Having established that certifications can be beneficial, it must 
              be pointed out that being certified in Windows 3.11 (Windows for 
              Workgroups) will get you nowhere in the market today. If you are 
              going to pursue a certification, it needs to be in something that 
              is presently in demand. That said, the following is a list of six 
              topic areas worth consideration. The list is unscientific; it is 
              based upon the number of times the certifications appear in job 
              postings on Monster.com -- as good a measure of market demand as 
              can be identified:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Security -- You can't go wrong with a security certification 
                these days. Every business is struggling to balance the need to 
                make resources available easily and simply against what may be 
                perceived as an invitation for harm or an open door to liability. 
                At the entry level, there is Security+ from CompTIA, and the possibilities 
                go upward from there, with almost every major vendor offering 
                some sort of security certification. 
              <li> Cisco -- In this category, there is a huge number of listings 
                not only for engineers (CCIE), but also for administrators (CCNA) 
                and others with Cisco certifications. Despite the fact that Internet 
                growth has slowed, there is still a need to support what is out 
                there, keep systems current, and be able to milk bandwidth for 
                all it is worth. Cisco offers a security specialization (CCSP) 
                as well as certifications in a number of other areas of expertise. 
              <li> Project Management -- This occupation existed long before IT 
                but has become so much a part of IT today that PMP (Project Management 
                Professional) books are now shelved in the computer section of 
                many bookstores. Of all the topic areas listed here, this one 
                most clearly falls under the category of "soft skills", meaning 
                that it is not directly tied to any specific product or technology, 
                but rather to a set of principles that needs to be mastered. Once 
                you master those principles, they rarely date and are essentially 
                good for life. 
              <li> Entry level -- There is always a demand for those with entry-level 
                certifications because there are always more openings at the lower 
                levels of any organization than the higher levels. To obtain any 
                entry-level certification, you usually must pass one or two fairly 
                simple tests (almost always multiple-choice) that show you understand 
                the very basics of the topic. CompTIA has made a business of whipping 
                out entry-level certifications with plus signs on them (A+ for 
                hardware, Network+ for networking, Server+ for servers, and so 
                on). While they are a very big player in this arena, they are 
                not the only one. The Linux Professional Institute (LPI), for 
                example, offers a very good entry-level Linux certification that 
                is worth the paper on which it is written. 
              <li> Linux -- Numerous Linux certifications are available, ranging 
                from engineer level (RHCE and CLE) down to the entry level. As 
                the Internet becomes more and more dependent upon Linux as the 
                OS running it, the need for those who know the intricacies of 
                it increases. 
              <li> Microsoft -- While some say the engineer certification (MCSE) 
                isn't as valued as it once was, it still crops up time and time 
                again in job postings.
