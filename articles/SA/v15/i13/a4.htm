            <h1>Test Your Knowledge</h1>
            <P> Emmett Dulaney
            <P> Think you're ready to whip out the company credit card and register 
              for that certification exam that has caught your eye? Before you 
              do, test your knowledge with this sample exam of questions covering 
              basic to intermediate-level Linux/Unix topics.
            <P> One caveat: over time, I've learned that there are risks involved 
              in writing practice tests. The risks fall into two categories: first, 
              there is almost always more than one way to do the same task in 
              Linux or Unix, and second, *nix users love to point out that none 
              of the possible answers are the way they would do it; they have 
              a script they wrote, an application they purchased, or a friend 
              who knows a guy who has a tool, etc.
            <P> When you take an exam, however, whether it's Linux+ from CompTIA, 
              an exam from the Linux Professional Institute, or any other non-lab-based 
              test, you have to pick the best answer from those choices presented 
              to you. Don't over-think the question and talk yourself out of the 
              correct answer.
            <P> With that said, let's see how well you do! (The answers can be 
              found at the end of this article.)
