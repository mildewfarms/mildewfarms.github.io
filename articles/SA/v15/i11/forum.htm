            <p>

            <i>Sys Admin</i> has run several articles about Security Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, over the years. 
              SELinux, as you probably know, is an extension to the standard Linux kernel 
              developed to enforce strict access controls. It allows administrators to 
              confine processes to the minimum amount of privilege required and was 
              integrated into version 2.6 of the Linux kernel. 
          <p> Lately, however, I've been hearing more about 
            SELinux. There's a new book out about it. <i>SELinux by Example</i> by Frank 
            Mayer, Karl Macmillan, and David Caplan (Prentice Hall, ISBN: 
            0-13-196369-4) is a hands-on guide to SELinux that covers its architecture, 
            security object model, policy language, and more. You can read Emmett 
            Dulaney's review of this book on UnixReview.com. 
          <p> There are new products for it. Tresys Technology, a 
            primary contributor to SELinux, has released a beta version of its 
            Brickwall Enterprise Client for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. According to the 
            company, this product makes managing SELinux easier by allowing 
            administrators to configure fine-grained network access control for 
            individual applications without having special knowledge of SELinux 
            policies. You can learn about other products and download the beta version 
            of Brickwall for testing from the Tresys Web site: <b>http://www.tresys.com</b>.
          <p> And there's an upcoming conference about 
            SELinux. The third annual SELinux Symposium to be held in March of 2007 
            will consist of 4 days of conference tutorials and scheduled presentations 
            followed by a developer summit. The call for papers for this conference 
            closes shortly, but you can find topics, an events calendar, and 
            registration information at the Web site: 
          <p> SELinux Symposium 2007 <br>
            March 12-16, Baltimore, Maryland<br>
            http://selinux-symposium.org/ 
          <p> For more information about SELinux, I refer you to the 
            official Web site at: <b>http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/</b>. 
          <p> We're now accepting proposals for security, 
            backup and recovery, and clustering articles. Please send your proposals to 
            me or to <i>Sys Admin</i>'s managing editor, Rikki Kite at: <b>rkite@cmp.com</b>.
          <p> Sincerely yours, 
          <p> Amber Ankerholz <br>
            Editor in Chief
