          <p>
          <p>

            <font size='+4'>Q</font> I have a Mac 15 Powerbook running OS X 
            10.3.9. While I was using Mozilla, it hung the laptop, and the only way I 
            could get it to respond was to hard power it off. I've had this 
            happen a few times before, and the machine comes back fine and runs a <b>fsck</b> in the background. 
            This time, though, it just hung on the gray screen and never actually 
            presented me with a login screen. 
          <p> I tried booting in single-user mode by holding down <b>Command s</b>, and it spit out a few 
            lines, tried to load the kernel, and the last thing it printed before 
            hanging was: 
          <p>

          <pre>
Carbon Lazy values total size 11057 bytes!
            </pre>
I have a second boot partition on the machine, which I 
    can boot from just fine. I can also successfully boot off the CDROM. In 
    both cases, all of the data on the primary boot partition looks completely 
    unharmed, I just can't get it to boot off it. Do you know how I can 
    recover the primary boot partition without losing my data?
<p>
 
<font size='+4'>A</font> I've generally seen the <b>Carbon Lazy values total size 11057 bytes!</b> in conjunction with bad permissions or cache files. 
  Unfortunately, the message is vague, and the fix isn't always the 
  same. Here's a list of steps I'd go through, in order of least 
  to most destructive, to try and fix the issue: 
<p> 1. Boot off the CD or the other boot partition and 
  run the <b>Disk Utility</b> application. Click to repair both the Disk (an fsck) and Disk 
  Permissions (<b>chown</b>/<b>chmod</b> of various files). 
<p> 2. Re-apply the 10.3.9 Updater, available from: 
<p>

<pre>
http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/macosxupdate1039.html
</pre>
3. Remove and recreate the cache directory <b>/Library/Caches</b> by hand or 
    use a fix-it utility like Tiger Cache Cleaner:
<p>

<pre>
http://www.northernsoftworks.com/tigercachecleaner.html
</pre>
4. Perform an upgrade to 10.4.x on the primary partition.
<p> 5. Copy all of your data to your secondary partition and perform a fresh reinstall (of either 10.3.x 
  or 10.4.x) on the primary partition. 
<p>

<font size='+4'>Q</font> We recently applied the Solaris jumbo 
  security+recommended patch cluster to our Solaris 9 machines. After 
  activating the new boot environment (we use <b>luupgrade</b> to patch with minimal 
  downtime) and rebooting, we noticed that one of our processes, <b>smcwebserver</b> (part of the 6130 
  Array management software) would no longer start. The <b>/var/log/webconsole/console_debug_log</b> only 
  showed the following messages for the startup attempt: 
<p>

</pre>
Normally there are a lot of other lines about things 
    like the HttpConnector, Apache, and WebappLoader being initialized and 
    loaded.
<p> After running <b>/usr/sbin/smcwebserver</b> under <b>sh -x</b> to debug the problem, I saw that it was dying on a <b>pwd</b> command inside of <b>/var</b>. Interestingly, when I do 
  an <b>ls</b> of <b>/</b>, /var looks normal: 
<p>

<pre>
&gt;ls -al /|grep var 
drwxr-xr-x  29 root         512 Jul 20 09:17 var 
</pre>
But when I do an <b>ls</b> of <b>/var</b>, I get the following error message:
<p>

<pre> 
&gt;ls -al /var 
ls: /var/..: Permission denied 
</pre>
If I do an <b>ls -ald</b> or an <b>ls -al</b> as root, it works fine. I checked all 
    the patch <b>README</b> files, 
    but nothing looks like it should cause this sort of oddity.
    <p> Right now I'm booted off the original boot 
      environment (which works fine) until we can figure out what the heck is 
      going on. Is there a bad patch out there that I missed? 
  <p>
 
    <font size='+4'>A</font> Your issue doesn't stem from 
    a patch you applied, but from two known bugs that crop up because of your 
    patching procedure (using <b>luupgrade</b>). There is a long-known bug in the Solaris VFS layer in 
    which the permissions of the underlying mount point are consulted instead 
    of the permissions on the mounted file system itself. There's also a 
    known bug with <b>lucreate</b>, in which permissions on newly created mount points are set to 
    700 instead of the expected 755. I presume that <b>/var</b> is separate file system on your 
    machine, and you may have others (maybe /usr or /opt) that are affected, 
    too. Anything that uses <b>pwd</b> or <b>getcwd</b> inside of one of these mount points as a non-root user, for 
    example the <b>man</b> program, will fail with a permissions error. 
  <p> If you have a <b>Sunsolve</b> account, take a look at Document ID 102176 for details:
  <p>

  <pre> 
http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102176-1
    </pre>
The workaround for this issue is to change the 
    permissions on any mount points created by <b>lucreate</b> before booting the ABE by using <b>lumount</b>, for example:
    <p>

  <pre> 
# lumount ABE_name /mnt 
# chmod 755 /mnt/var 
# luumount ABE_name 
    </pre>
For machines that you've already patched, you 
    can boot off the old BE and make the changes, or, if you can't afford 
    the downtime, you can NFS export your root filesystem (and any other place 
    where you have mount points that have been created by <b>lucreate</b>) to <b>localhost</b>, mount it, and modify the 
    permissions there.
    <p> If your machine is not set up to run as an NFS server, 
      the easiest way to make the change is to first make sure that <b>SUNWnfssr</b>, <b>SUNWnfssu</b>, and <b>SUNWnfssx</b> are installed. Then do 
      the following: 
  <p>

  <pre>
cp /dfs/dfs/dfstab /dfs/dfs/dfstab.good 
echo &quot;share -F nfs -o root=localhost /&quot; &gt;&gt; /dfs/dfs/dfstab 
/etc/init.d/nfs.server start 
mount / /mnt 
chmod 755 /mnt/var 
umount /mnt 
/etc/init.d/nfs.server stop 
mv /dfs/dfs/dfstab.good /dfs/dfs/dfstab 
    </pre>
Subsequently remove any NFS packages that you added.
<p>

<font size='+4'>Q</font> I have a bit of an odd question. 
  I'd like to map domain names and IP addresses to actual locations for 
  the purposes of tracking localized marketing effectiveness. How would I go 
  about doing this? 
<p>
 
<font size='+4'>A</font> How to map IPs/hostnames to a 
  physical location is actually a very common question. Whether or not your 
  question has a usable answer is going to greatly depend on what you mean by 
  "localized". You can map IP addresses (and therefore hostnames) 
  to countries based on the various NIC databases by using <b>whois</b> information to get a 
  sense of where the controlling ISP/domain owner might be located within a 
  country. Let's take an example hostname/IP from my blocked spam logs: 
<p>

<pre>
from=&lt;gfmjr@rfidalliancelabs.com&gt; 
relay=[222.172.140.56] 
</pre>
The mail claims to be from <b>rfidalliancelabs.com</b>, but the 
    connecting IP address is much more trustworthy. The same generally goes for 
    other server logs (i.e., Web servers). Try to map the IP to a real domain 
    name:
<p>

<pre> 
dig -x 222.172.140.56 
whois 222.172.140.56 
</pre>
Dig doesn't return a name for the IP, but it 
    does tell you the SOA is <b>ns1.apnic.net</b>. The <b>whois</b> information is much more revealing and redirects to the <b>apnic.whois.net</b> server:

So, the owner of the netblock is the Yunnan Province 
    division of Chinanet, which appears to be headquartered in Beijing. What 
    this doesn't take into account is that the end user may be in a 
    different location than the ISP. Chinanet may be reselling the use of part 
    of their IP block to another provider in the same or another country, or 
    the user may be proxying though Chinanet for some reason.
<p> There's also an experimental extension, LOC, to 
  DNS for providing location information, but it's not widely used. 
  While this isn't a practical way to map your information, it might be 
  academically interesting. The LOC RR is an expression of latitude, 
  longitude, and altitude along with a precision factor. Take a look at 
  RFC1876 for more information:

<font size='+4'>Q</font> I'm running OS X 10.3.9 and 
    using <b>Fink</b> and <b>FinkCommander</b> to keep track of 
    my third-party software. Recently, I tried doing a <b>selfupdate</b> because I noticed some 
    packages were woefully out of date. Every time I tried (on multiple 
    machines), I'd get the following error:
    <p>

  <pre>
rsync -az -v rsync://master.us.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo// \
  TIMESTAMP/sw/fink/TIMESTAMP.tmp 
rsync: failed to connect to master.us.finkmirrors.net: \
  Operation timed out 
rsync error: error in socket IO (code 10) at /SourceCache/rsync/ \
  rsync-14/rsync/clientserver.c(93) 
### execution of rsync failed, exit code 10 
Failed to fetch the timestamp file from the rsync server: 
rsync://master.us.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/. \
  Check the error messages above. 
    </pre>
I tried using different mirrors from both the U.S. 
    (where I'm located) and outside, but they all failed with the exact 
    same error. I then tried switching to <b>cvs</b> to do my update, just in case it was an issue with <b>rsync</b>, but that also failed 
    with similar errors.
    <p> Did I miss some sort of major upgrade? I looked into 
      upgrading <b>FinkCommander</b>, too, but that, as suspected, didn't seem to help. Can you 
      tell me how to resync my source tree so I can update packages again? 
  <p>
 
    <font size='+4'>A</font> Your <b>rsync</b> command might be failing because of access issues on your 
    end. Do you allow <b>rsync</b> connections through your firewall? The same goes for <b>cvs</b>. There's one other 
    thing to be aware of if you haven't updated in a while, though. On 
    March 30th, anonymous access to the <b>Fink</b> cvs repository at <b>sourceforge.net</b> stopped functioning correctly due to issues with (and 
    later restructuring of) the SourceForge <b>cvs</b> service. Because the names of the servers changed, there 
    was no way to get out new information via a <b>selfupdate</b>. To load the new server names into your configuration and 
    reactivate <b>cvs</b> updates, you can download the <b>fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2.tar.gz</b> package file from the <b>Fink</b> Web site: 
  <p>

  <pre>
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=69685 
    </pre>
Once you retrieve that file, do the following to correct your list of mirrors:
<pre>
tar zxf fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2.tar.gz 
cd fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2 
sudo ./inject.pl 
</pre>
After the package installation is complete, you'll be queried about your mirrors:
<p>

<pre>
Mirror selection 

The list of possible mirrors in fink has been updated. Do you want 
to review and change your choices? [y/N] y 
</pre>
You can then select new mirror sites for each major 
    package archive from the lists provided. After choosing valid mirrors, you 
    can go back and run <b>sudo fink selfupdate</b> using <b>cvs</b>, and it should work just fine. You might then need to run <b>sudo fink scanpackages</b> if you 
    encounter issues with <b>sudo apt-get update</b>.
    <p>

    <font size='+4'>Q</font> We have an old Ultra 5 running 
      Solaris 8 and <b>ipfilter</b> acting as our Internet firewall/gateway. Unfortunately, the 
      onboard Ethernet, <b>hme0</b>, has stopped functioning correctly. To fix this, we added another 
      PCI card, but everything is set to use <b>hme0</b> as the Internet-facing interface. Is there a way to 
      identify the new card as <b>hme0</b> instead of <b>hme1</b>? 
  <p>
 
    <font size='+4'>A</font> You can modify the <b>/etc/path_to_inst</b> file so that <b>hme1</b> is actually seen as <b>hme0</b>, but the next time you do a 
    reconfiguration reboot, this information will be lost. To make the change, 
    look for the following two lines: 
  <p>

  <pre>
&quot;/pci@1f,0/pci@1/pci@1/SUNW,hme@0,1&quot; 1 &quot;hme&quot; 
&quot;/pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/network@1,1&quot; 0 &quot;hme&quot; 
    </pre>
Remove the second line and change the first line to:
<p>

<pre>
&quot;/pci@1f,0/pci@1/pci@1/SUNW,hme@0,1&quot; 0 &quot;hme&quot;
</pre>
You might also want to consider just purchasing a 
    used Ultra 5 (you might have to do a few tricks if you have any 
    hostid-locked licenses) or even a new machine to take the place of your 
    existing one. Prices for entry-level Sun hardware have come down quite a 
    bit in the recent past, and Ultra 5s are extremely cheap.
