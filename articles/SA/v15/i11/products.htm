          <P> Beyond Security announced the latest version of its 
            security analysis solution, beSTORM 2.0. According to the company, the new 
            version introduces the 80/20 rule for "smart" blackbox testing, 
            which enables faster testing by focusing first on known vulnerability 
            patterns before searching for unknown problems. beSTORM 2.0 starts by 
            checking a relatively small number of scenarios that are known to be 
            problematic. After checking known attack combinations, beSTORM can then 
            start testing for all other SIP implementation combinations.
