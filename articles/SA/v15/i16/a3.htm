            <p> Marcel Gagn&eacute;
          <p> Ubuntu Linux is hot. Really hot. How hot? Well, if you surf over to 
            Distrowatch (<b>http://www.distrowatch.com</b>), you'll notice that 
            Ubuntu is listed as the number one distribution, at least in terms of hit 
            ranking on the site. SUSE and Fedora are usually duking it out for second 
            and third place. In fact, Ubuntu has been in first place for quite a while 
            now. 
          <p> If Distrowatch was your only source of Linux 
            information, you might be forgiven for thinking that this was the most 
            popular Linux distribution in the world. It isn't, at least not yet, 
            but the level of excitement surrounding this distribution is amazing. In 
            this article, I'll provide a quick introduction to its features and 
            philosophy. 
          <p>

            <b>Big To-Do About Ubuntu</b>
          <p> Let's first see what the Ubuntu Web site has to say: 
          <p>

          <ul>
            "Ubuntu" is an ancient African word, 
            meaning "humanity to others". Ubuntu also means "I am 
            what I am because of who we all are". The Ubuntu Linux distribution 
            brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the software world.
          </ul>
            <p> Ubuntu Linux is funded and supported by Canonical 
              through the Shuttleworth Foundation, headed by billionaire Mark 
              Shuttleworth. I mention this to say that Ubuntu Linux is a solid 
              organization backed by solid financial support. Good financial support is 
              always exciting to businesses looking to use a product. Shuttleworth, by 
              the way, was the world's second "space tourist", which 
              gives him a lot of coolness cachet. Business reasons and space tourists 
              aside, there has to be a lot more to a project to generate that kind of 
              buzz. So, what else does Ubuntu have going for it? 
          <p> People will tell you about the great hardware support 
            and brag that all their devices were detected on installation. That was 
            true for me when I installed Ubuntu and Kubuntu Dapper on my notebook, but 
            it was also true when I installed Mandriva and SUSE. So, what's all 
            the fuss? Ubuntu Linux, after all, is yet another Debian-based Linux 
            distribution (like MEPIS, Libranet, Knoppix, and others), bundling products 
            that you find in plenty of other Linux distributions. These include the 
            GNOME desktop environment, the OpenOffice.org office suite, the Evolution 
            email, calendar, and contact management system, the Firefox Web browser, 
            and so on. 
          <p>

            <b>Speaking Of Applications </b>
          <P> These days, free and open source software serves up 
            applications that are as good as many in the commercial world. The sheer 
            number of these applications at your disposal is impressive, sometimes 
            staggering. It's ironic that this sheer wealth of applications is 
            also part of what scares some users. Choice is great, and in the long run, 
            we all want choice. When starting out, however, some people prefer a 
            streamlined collection of applications that represent a best of breed for 
            the desktop of choice. 
          <P> This is one of Ubuntu's greatest strengths and 
            is something that attracts many people. Ubuntu has selected a simplified 
            core set of applications that makes sense. One Web browser. One word 
            processor, spreadsheet, and presentation package. One terminal program. 
            One... well, you get the idea. To understand why this is such a great idea, 
            consider the new user's confusion when faced with three terminals, 
            five Web browsers, two word processors, and so on. Ubuntu Linux makes it 
            easy by providing intelligent choices for applications that do the job. 
          <p> Furthermore, the whole thing fits on one CD. The CD 
            itself contains a live version of Ubuntu so that Windows users can try 
            Ubuntu without having to install it. The hardware detection and support is 
            excellent, and most users will find the whole process surprisingly 
            painless. After some introduction, those users can install from the same 
            CD. Click the icon on the desktop, answer a few questions, and in a few 
            minutes, their PC is running an installed, full-featured Ubuntu Linux. 
          <P>

            <B>Community Redefined</B>
          <p> Beyond the applications, Ubuntu is something more. The 
            official Web site serves up the Ubuntu manifesto: 
          <p>

          <ul>
            Ubuntu Linux is a complete desktop Linux operating 
            system, freely available with both community and professional support. The 
            Ubuntu community is built on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto: 
            that software should be available free of charge, that software tools 
            should be usable by people in their local language and despite any 
            disabilities, and that people should have the freedom to customise and 
            alter their software in whatever way they see fit.
          </ul>
            <p> Ubuntu Linux is a product based on a community and its 
              values. It's a belief that software can empower people, but for 
              people to reap the benefits of that software, it must be freely available, 
              crossing cultural and language barriers along the way. Companies doing 
              business in the Linux marketplace understand the importance of the 
              community. This is why we have Fedora, OpenSUSE, and recently, FreeSpire. 
              Ubuntu, however, has succeeded in leveraging and energizing the community 
              in a way that few other companies have been able to manage. I believe this 
              is in part because Ubuntu isn't afraid to state its values and to 
              stand behind them. 
          <p> Let's say you've decided to make the jump 
            to Ubuntu (or Kubuntu, maybe) and you need some help. One of the very best 
            places to turn for additional information on your Ubuntu system is the 
            Ubuntu community. You will find many people with considerable knowledge and 
            information about doing things the Ubuntu way. This community includes 
            developers, documentation writers, and perhaps most importantly, Ubuntu 
            users. This is a vibrant, growing community, providing many different 
            options for locating the help you need. 
          <p> The first place to start is the Ubuntu Linux Web site at: 
          <p>

          <pre>
http://www.ubuntu.com 
            </pre>
Closely tied to the Web site is the Ubuntu Wiki, a 
    regularly updated, community-supported source of information. The Wiki is 
    at: <b>wiki.ubuntu.com</b>. 
    And the Ubuntu forums can be found at: <b>ubuntuforums.org</b>.
    <p> Log on to the #ubuntu IRC channel on <b>irc.freenode.net</b>, and you'll find 
      between 500 to 600 people logged on at any time of the day or night. Ask 
      your questions, and it's likely that somebody has answers. 
  <p> You can also join the Ubuntu Users mailing list by 
    visiting this site: 
  <p>

  <pre>
https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-users 
    </pre>

    <b>Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Xubuntu</b>
    <p> Eventually, you're going to hear about other 
      Ubuntus. These include Kubuntu, Edubuntu, and Xubuntu. The important thing 
      to understand here is that none of these otherbuntus, if you'll 
      pardon the expression, are different products deep down. They are not 
      forks, nor are they different distributions. Each one is still Ubuntu, but 
      with a different desktop environment and (in some cases) a different set of 
      core applications. 
  <p> Kubuntu features KDE as its desktop environment of 
    choice. Xubuntu is meant for less powerful machines and uses the 
    lightweight XFCE as its desktop environment. Edubuntu, meanwhile, is 
    modified to suit the needs of an educational environment with teaching 
    games and programs for kids.   Each of the alternative Ubuntus is a 
    tuned implementation of Ubuntu Linux for a specific environment. 
    Nevertheless, choosing one over the other doesn't mean you are locked 
    in. Adding the Kubuntu environment to Ubuntu (or Edubuntu to Kubuntu) is a 
    simple process that takes only a few keystrokes. 
  <p>

    <b>Wrapping It Up and an Offer You Can't Refuse</b>
  <p> Ubuntu, Kubuntu, and the otherbuntus offer plenty of 
    reasons to get excited. They also make it extremely easy for users to get 
    started with Ubuntu and very hard to say no. That's because Canonical 
    will ship free Linux CDs to anyone anywhere in the world. To get your own 
    free Ubuntu CDs, visit: 
  <p>

  <pre>
https://shipit.ubuntu.com
    </pre>
To get your free Kubuntu CD, head over to:
<p>

<pre>
https://shipit.kubuntu.org 
</pre>
Finally, to get Edubuntu CDs, pay a visit to:
<p>

<pre>
https://shipit.edubuntu.org 
</pre>
With free CDs to anywhere in the world, a dedicated and 
    enthusiastic community, an intelligent, streamlined set of applications, 
    great hardware support, and an amazingly simple installation, I think 
    there's reason to make a fuss.
