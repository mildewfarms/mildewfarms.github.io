            <h1><img src="a2.gif" width="200" height="157" align="right">Accessing Windows Resources from a Linux Desktop </h1>
            <p> Marcel Gagn&eacute;
          <p> You're one of the lucky ones. Despite incredible 
            pressures, you've somehow managed to convince your boss to let you 
            run Linux on your workstations instead of Windows. It could be that 
            you've already saved your organization tens of thousands of dollars 
            by convincing them to upgrade to OpenOffice.org instead of the latest 
            Microsoft Office, and now the company is willing to explore other 
            possibilities. However, you are still going to have to deal with the 
            Windows workgroup or domain and the appropriate shared files and printers. 
          <p> It used to be called the network neighborhood. On 
            Windows XP machines, it's called network places. You may now be 
            running a Linux desktop, but there are many important files shared from the 
            XP machine over in accounting, files that are shared in the network 
            neighborhood. Files you need to work with. Ironically, some of those 
            Windows file servers may in fact be Linux servers running Samba, seamlessly 
            providing network drives to Windows desktops inside your company. 
          <p> Samba on Linux does a great job of providing the same 
            file and printer sharing that Windows servers used to and sometimes still 
            do provide, so it should not be surprising that Samba client software tends 
            to come as part of the standard installation on most modern Linux 
            distributions. This means you can connect to a Windows share on the network 
            using the <b>smbclient</b> program, like this: 
          <p>

          <pre>
smbclient -L lex 
            </pre>
This would produce a report of shares that looks something like the following:
<p>

<pre>
Domain=[LEX] OS=[Windows 5.1] Server=[Windows 2000 LAN Manager] 

      Sharename    Type      Comment 
      ---------    ----      ------- 
      Reports      Disk 
      IPC$         IPC       Remote IPC 
      print$       Disk      Printer Drivers 
      SharedDocs   Disk      
      Printer2     Printer   Microsoft Office Document Image Writer 
      LEX_C        Disk 
      ML-1710      Printer   Samsung ML-1710 Series
</pre>
Assuming that you had the permissions to view the <i>Reports</i> folder, you could 
    connect to it like this:
<p>

<pre>
smbclient //lex/Reports -U winuser 
</pre>
In the above example, I am connecting to a Windows XP 
    box from my Linux workstation as user "winuser". The system 
    will then ask me for a password, after which I will be at a Samba prompt 
    that looks like this:
    <p>

  <pre>
Domain=[LEX] OS=[Windows 5.1] Server=[Windows 2000 LAN Manager] 
smb: \&gt;
    </pre>
From here, type <b>help</b>, and <b>smbclient</b> will offer up a list of all the things you can do 
    while connected via the commands at your disposal. A number of them are 
    obvious such as dir, copy, and so on. While this is all good, it's 
    not pretty in the graphical sense, and you can't use this while 
    working in your graphical file managers or inside OpenOffice.org's 
    applications.
<p>

<b>Graphical Clients You Already Have</b>
<p> There's a Swiss army knife approach to a number 
  of Linux tools, with tons of useful tools folded out of the way, waiting to 
  be discovered. It's easy to pass by those friendly, everyday 
  programs, never thinking that they might well be all you need to get the 
  job done. This is true regardless of whether you run KDE or GNOME as your 
  desktop environment. Let's start with the KDE side of things and look 
  at how you would access this machine using Konqueror. Open up Konqueror 
  (either as file manager or browser) and type the following in the Location 
  field: 
<p>

<pre>
smb:/ 
</pre>
Samba servers or Windows machines advertising network 
    shares will first appear in the browser window under their workgroup name 
    (e.g., ACCOUNTING, RESEARCH, etc). Take a look at Figure 1 and you'll 
    see a Konqueror session with a two-panel view (click <i>Window</i> on the menu bar and select <i>Split View</i>, <i>Left/Right</i> -- alternatively, 
    you can press Shift+Ctrl+L). In the left panel is the basic network browser 
    view with three active workgroups. In the right-hand panel, I've 
    clicked on the DARKSIDE workgroup to show the computer(s) that make up part 
    of that group.
    <p> To read, write, or otherwise make use of the files 
      shared on those computers, double-click on the corresponding folder for 
      that computer -- the computer named Lex, for instance. All of the 
      available shared directories (or folders) on that system are then visible 
      (see Figure 2). You can then navigate those folders as you would any other 
      folder visible in Konqueror. That said, you may also see shares to which 
      you don't necessarily have access. Clicking (or double-clicking, 
      depending on your configuration) on them will bring up an authentication 
      dialog asking you for a user name and password. 
  <p> From here, it's all classic drag and drop, 
    graphical file manager browsing. You can go inside whatever folder you have 
    access to, locate the appropriate document, and open it with OpenOffice.org 
    Writer. Right-click on the file, select <i>Open with</i>, and just like that, you are editing a 
    document on a shared Windows resource. 
  <p> Ideally, we don't want to go through this whole 
    navigation process each and every time. To bring a given network share a 
    few clicks closer, simply bookmark the appropriate shared folder. Click 
    Bookmark on Konqueror's menu bar, then select Add Bookmark. 
  <p> Over on the GNOME side of things, we have Nautilus. You 
    will find the process very similar to what we just did with Konqueror. 
    Start Nautilus, press Ctrl+L to open the location bar, and then type the 
    following: 
  <p>

  <pre>
smb:/// 
    </pre>
On a GNOME desktop, such as my Ubuntu system here, you 
    can also click <i>Places</i> on the top panel, and select <i>Network 
    Servers</i>. When the file browser window appears, 
    double-click on Windows Network. Nautilus will then display the active 
    workgroups on the network (see Figure 3).
    <p> From there, you can double-click on one of the 
      workgroups to select a computer. Then, from the list of computers, double-click on your choice and you can browse the 
      individual resources offered (see Figure 4). 
      Again, be aware that while you move around from computer to computer like 
      this, you may occasionally be asked for a user name and password for that 
      computer or even the specific folder. 
  <p> As with the Konqueror example before this, you can 
    save yourself a little time by bookmarking the folder of your choice. The 
    only problem with both of the suggestions I've made so far is that 
    neither of them lets you permanently mount network drives. Mounting a drive 
    is easy, but it's not quite the point-and-click ease that Windows 
    users on your network have access to. 
  <p>

    <b>Smb4K for Power Users</b>
  <p> Konqueror and Nautilus are fine for a great number of 
    applications and, depending on your needs, they might be all that you 
    require. For a more robust and flexible means of working in and with the 
    network neighborhood (or network places), you simply must take a look at 
    Smb4K, a super-classy SMB browser tool that is also flexible and powerful. 
    Furthermore, it makes it possible to preview shares, mount shares locally, 
    disconnect (or unmount) shares when you log out, reconnect shares 
    automatically on startup, and more. You can get Smb4K from the 
    application's Web site at: 
  <p>

  <pre>
http://smb4k.berlios.de 
    </pre>
Smb4K is an excellent and very capable package, 
    definitely worth the time to investigate. Binary packages for Debian, SUSE, 
    and Fedora are available on contrib sites for various distributions (as I 
    write this, I'm installing it on an Ubuntu system using Synaptic). 
    The main Smb4K site also has the full source code available for download.
<p> When you have installed the package, run the program 
  by calling <i>smb4k</i>. 
  As soon as you start Smb4K, it scans the network looking for active shares. 
  You can fine-tune the functionality and options, including such things as 
  whether you want shares to be automatically reconnected by clicking on <i>Settings</i> in the menu bar and 
  selecting <i>Configure Smb4K</i>. The graphical interface is intuitive and easy to navigate and 
  the package is easy to use. 
<p> The display is divided into a left-hand navigation 
  panel where workgroups, computers, and shares can be listed and navigated. 
  To mount a share, right-click on it and select <i>Mount</i>. If you would rather see what you are getting into first, 
  choose <i>Preview</i> instead. 
<p> Mounted drives appear in the top right-hand window as 
  drive icons. Clicking on one of the drive icons opens up a Konqueror window 
  to that particular share. The Network tab provides information about the 
  connected host. Click the <i>Share</i> tab and you'll get further details including the 
  size of the network drive, its current use, and its contents. 
  <p> If you run the <b>df</b> from the command line, you'll see that the drives are 
    now mounted for your use in your own home directory under an <b>smb4k</b> directory prefix. For 
    instance, in the example in Figure 5, the listing looks like this: 
  <p>

  <pre>
Filesystem              Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on 
//SCIGATE/Finance_Data  5.9G  5.3G  569M  91% /home/mgagne/smb4k/ \       
                                              SCIGATE/Finance Data 
//LEX/LEX_C             25G   20G   5.1G  80% /home/mgagne/smb4k/ \
                                              LEX/LEX_C 
    </pre>
The path used by Smb4K to mount the shares is one of 
    the many things that can be changed through the configuration dialog. Click <i>Settings</i> on the menu 
    bar, then select <i>Configure Smb4K</i>. A window will appear with a large work area to the right, 
    and a vertical sidebar of configuration categories to the left (see Figure 
    6).
    <p> Just modify the directory path, then click <i>Apply</i> or <i>OK</i> to exit. Before you exit, 
      however, take a moment to explore some of the additional settings here. 
      Under the same Shares category, there are options for remounting shares 
      when you log in, and unmounting those shares when you log out. This is not 
      the default behavior but you may, like me, find this to be the obvious and 
      most useful way to do things. 
  <p>

    <b>Time for a Backyard BBQ? </b>
  <p> As you can see, there's no great magic in 
    accessing Windows network shares using a modern Linux desktop. For casual 
    use, the standard desktop file browser -- whether it be Konqueror or 
    Nautilus -- may be all you need. Smb4K, on the other hand, will take 
    care of the rest for the most demanding of users. 
  <p> Even though you are surrounded by people running on 
    Windows workstations, you're lucky enough to be using a Linux 
    desktop. That doesn't mean you can't be part of the 
    neighborhood. With the right tools, everyone will be feeling downright 
    neighborly. Better make sure you've got lots of burgers.
