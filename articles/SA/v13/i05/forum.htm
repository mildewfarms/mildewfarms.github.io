            <p>Access (remote or otherwise) is a good thing if it's granted 
              only to trusted users, but it can also be disastrous. If your systems 
              are not properly configured and your users not carefully trained, 
              you may be permitting access to more than you realize. According 
              to the results of a recent CompTIA survey, released on March 31st, 
              84 percent of the nearly 900 organizations surveyed "blamed 
              human error either wholly or in part for their last major security 
              breach". In last year's similar survey, human error was 
              cited as the cause of 63 percent of security breaches.</p>
            <p>Also, 58 percent of organizations experienced at least one major 
              IT security breach in the past 6 months. The survey defined a major 
              breach as "one that caused real harm, resulted in the loss 
              of confidential information, or interrupted business operations." 
              That's up from 38 percent a year ago, according to the report, 
              which can be read at: www.comptia.org.</p>
            <p>Human error is impossible to prevent entirely, but careful configuration 
              and vigilance on the part of both administrators and users will 
              go a long way toward alleviating major problems. In this issue, 
              three articles provide an in-depth look at LDAP and how best to 
              configure it to grant access and manage information. The articles 
              are "Using LDAP to Manage Unix Accounts" by Jeff Machols, 
              "Configuring Linux for LDAP Name Service and Authentication" 
              by John D'Emic, and "The OpenLDAP Proxy Server" by 
              Reinhard E. Voglmaier. Also in this issue, Russell Dyer begins a 
              series on PHP, and Ralph Durkee shows how to get chroot'ed 
              account functionality from OpenSSH. These articles provide key information 
              for configuring your environment with security and functionality 
              in mind.</p>
            <p>Coming up, we'll be doing a special issue on spam. Teaching 
              users never to open attachments is one thing, but there are many 
              other considerations when spam-proofing your environment. Please 
              send your proposals for articles to Rikki Endsley at: <b>rendsley@cmp.com</B>. 
              Manuscripts for the special spam issue are due soon. Please send 
              comments to me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>. As always, I look forward 
              to hearing from you.</p>
            <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
