            <h1><b>Why DHCP?</b></h1>
            <p> For a networked installation, the workstation needs network connectivity. 
              With normal Jumpstart, it broadcasts a RARP request and the boot 
              server responds with an IP address. Unfortunately, RARP requests 
              cannot be sent across a routed network. They are isolated within 
              the broadcast domain of a network segment (for more information, 
              see the excellent book by W. Richard Stevens, <i>TCP/IP Illustrated</i>, 
              Volume 1).
            <p> Some routers can be configured to act as RARP servers, and therefore 
              give the client an IP address. However, this will not work either, 
              because the client to be jumpstarted will request the kernel image 
              from the router.
            <p> DHCP is a protocol that clients can use to request an IP address, 
              as well as other network-related information. With OpenBootProm 
              (OBP) version 3.25, Sun added DHCP support for booting over the 
              network.
            <p> Like RARP, the DHCP protocol uses LAN broadcasts and normally 
              wouldn't be able to cross a subnet boundary. However, modern routing 
              equipment usually allows the systems administrator to specifically 
              configure the router to pass DHCP requests from one subnet to a 
              DHCP server on some other network (for Cisco IOS routers, "ip helper 
              &lt;addr&gt;" where &lt;addr&gt; is the IP address of the remote 
              DHCP server). In this way, you can limit the number of DHCP servers 
              you need to deploy to a reasonably small and easy-to-manage group, 
              and still take advantage of Sun's Jumpstart facility.
