            <p> As you can see, this year's December issue once again contains 
              a bonus Solaris Administration supplement featuring several articles 
              contributed by <I>Sys Admin</I> authors along with technology papers 
              from Sun Microsystems. These articles provide some of the very latest 
              information about Solaris 10 as well as tips for managing other 
              versions of the Solaris operating system. Meanwhile, note that the 
              main December issue includes articles about performing online backups 
              with dump, using the text-only Web browser Lynx, debugging SSL, 
              and implementing syslog-ng.
            <P> I'm pleased to report that the SD Best Practices Conference in 
              September was a success, and I extend my appreciation to all the 
              speakers and attendees. (Special thanks to Hal for acting as program 
              chair!) That show represented <I>Sys Admin</I>'s first attempt at 
              translating our magazine experience into conference courses. By 
              all accounts, the <I>Sys Admin</I> tracks at the Best Practices 
              show were highly informative and useful, and we're already preparing 
              for the next Software Development Conference.
            <P> SD West 2005 will take place March 14-18 at the Santa Clara Convention 
              Center in Santa Clara, CA. The <I>Sys Admin</I> tracks will feature 
              courses by Hal Pomeranz, &AElig;leen Frisch, Randal Schwartz, and 
              Peter Baer Galvin. You can find out more and sign up to receive 
              the conference catalog at: <B>http://www.sdexpo.com</B>.
            <P> I like to think of <I>Sys Admin</I> as a teaching magazine; in 
              every issue, we try to provide articles that inform and instruct 
              on a wide variety of topics, and we're always looking for articles 
              that can help teach systems administrators how to write better scripts, 
              keep information secure, and generally improve performance of their 
              systems. Right now, we're looking for articles on advanced administration 
              topics, and the issue themes for the next several months include 
              Web Admin, Spam, Clustering, Backup and Recovery, and Remote Access. 
              If you have proven techniques for success in these or other areas, 
              please consider sharing your knowledge with peers through an article 
              in <I>Sys Admin</I> magazine.
            <P> Send your article proposals to our managing editor, Rikki Endsley 
              at: <B>rendsley@cmp.com</B>. As always, you can send feedback and 
              suggestions to me at: <B>aankerholz@cmp.com</B> or to Hal Pomeranz 
              at: <B>hal@deer-run.com</B>.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
            <P> <I>Amber Ankerholz</i><br>
