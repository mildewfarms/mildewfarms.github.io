            <h1><img src="../../resource/1_questions.gif" width="245" height="130" align="right">Questions 
              and Answers</h1>
            <P> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a number of systems that 
              need the same modification to root's crontab file (security software 
              that's being added to every machine). What's the best way to go 
              about doing this with minimal effort?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The answer to this question depends 
              on whether you will be doing multiple machine modifications on a 
              regular basis and want minimal up front or long-term work, or whether 
              you're just doing this as a one-off. If you're just doing it as 
              a one-off, then you can whip up a shell script to iterate through 
              the machine and <B>scp</B> the crontab file over and reload it, 
              for example:
            <P> 
            <pre>
#!/bin/sh
for i in host1 host2 host2 host4; do
  scp master.cron root@${i}:/location/to/crontab/file
  ssh root@${i} chmod 0400 /location/to/crontab/file; \
    chown root /location/to/crontab/file; \
    crontab /location/to/crontab/file; \
    crontab -l
</pre>
            The final <B>crontab -l</B> will verify that the correct crontab file 
            is in place on the new machine. The syntax for various <B>crontab</B> 
            commands may differ depending on your operating system. Also, your 
            clients may not support <B>scp</B>'ing or <B>ssh</B>'ing in as root, 
            so you'd have to change that or copy files over as a normal user and 
            then later run a script as root to move them into place. Some operating 
            systems also automatically recognize that the crontab has changed 
            and do not require the reloading step.
            <P> If you're going to be making multi-machine changes on a regular 
              basis, I suggest investing the time and effort up front to install 
              software such as <B>rsync</B> if your needs are simplistic, or a 
              configuration change management tool like <B>cfengine</B> if you 
              want more fine-grained control.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a few Sun servers and a 
              number of Linux desktop clients. I'm trying to set up <B>rsh</B> 
              so that the users don't have to type in their passwords when connecting 
              between machines. Right now I have it working between Sun machines, 
              between Linux machines, and connecting from a Sun machine to a Linux 
              machine. When people try to connect from a Linux machine to a Sun 
              machine, it prompts them for a password. I'm at a loss as to why 
              everything else works, but not this one scenario. Is there an <B>rsh</B> 
              compatibility issue between Solaris and Linux?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> To start, let me strongly advocate 
              using a secure connection method like <B>ssh</B>, instead of <B>rsh</B>, 
              so that your users are not sending sensitive information over the 
              wire in the clear. That said, the most likely problem is that your 
              entries in the <B>.rhosts</B> or <B>/etc/hosts.equiv</B> file on 
              the Sun machines do not include the information being transmitted 
              by <B>rsh</B> on the Linux machines.
            <P> Try <B>rsh</B>'ing from the Linux box to the Sun box and giving 
              it a valid password. When you're logged in, run the command "<B>who 
              am i</B>". Note the address from which you appear to be connecting. 
              It could be a bare hostname, FQDN, or even an IP address. The information 
              listed is what needs to be in the <B>.rhosts</B> and/or <B>/etc/hosts.equiv</B> 
              files. If that information matches, then I'd suggest checking any 
              pertinent log files and running truss against <B>inetd</B> on the 
              Sun machine to see what it turns up.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just noticed that our mail 
              server, running FreeBSD 4.10 and sendmail 8.12.11, has a large number 
              of files in <B>/var/mail</B> that start with the name BOGUS. I'm 
              guessing that we've been hacked, but this would seem like a weird 
              change to make. Here's an <B>ls</B> of one of the BOGUS files from 
              <B>/var/mail</B> to show what I mean:
            <P> 
            <pre>
-r--------   1 nobody   nobody        1 Sep 19 21:34 BOGUS.root.E
</pre>
            The content of each BOGUS file appears to be normal mail messages 
            and nothing suspicious. Is this part of a rootkit? Has sendmail been 
            hacked or something else?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The first thing that strikes 
              me as odd is that the files are owned by <B>nobody</B>. Are you 
              NFS mounting your mail spool and/or delivery area? That's generally 
              considered a very bad idea because you run into issues with file 
              locking and, as it appears in your case, permissions. This setup 
              is probably why you're running into issues and getting BOGUS files, 
              not a break-in. I suspect you're running <B>procmail</B> as your 
              local delivery agent and that the BOGUS files are a result of <B>procmail</B>'s 
              not being able to write to the mail file. Check the <B>procmail</B> 
              log files for an error like the following (from the <B>procmail</B> 
              man page):
            <P> 
            <pre>
Renaming bogus "x" into "x"
The system mailbox of the recipient was found to be bogus, 
procmail performed evasive actions.
</pre>
            The reason for the BOGUS files is also explained in the <B>procmail</B> 
            man page:
            <P> 
            <pre>
If /var/mail/$LOGNAME is a bogus mailbox (i.e., does not belong to 
the recipient, is unwritable, is a symbolic link or is a hard 
link), procmail will upon startup try to rename it into a file 
starting with 'BOGUS.$LOGNAME.' and ending in an inode-sequence-code. 
If this turns out to be impossible, ORGMAIL will have no initial 
value, and hence will inhibit delivery without a proper rcfile.
</Pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've recently inherited 
            a division of our company that's running AIX 5 on their servers instead 
            of Solaris, which our division runs. I'm responsible for keeping these 
            machines up to date with security patches, and I am wondering whether 
            there is anything available from IBM similar to Sun's patch club notifications. 
            Also any Solaris -&gt; AIX command translators you could point me 
            to would be great.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you want listings of IBM's 
              patches, take a look at:
            <P> 
            <pre>
https://techsupport.services.ibm.com/server/pseries.subscriptionSvcs
</pre>
            for the pSeries servers. If you have other hardware/software, look 
            for something similar on one of the other support pages linked from:

</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm attempting to invoke 
            a command from <B>/etc/inittab</B> on a Solaris 9 machine at boot 
            time, but it doesn't seem to be working. Here's the <B>/etc/inittab</B> 
            entry:
            <P> 
            <pre>
logc:2:once:/local/bin/logchart
</pre>
            I followed the syntax for the rest of the entries in the file, so 
            I don't think that's the issue. I can run the command interactively 
            and from a script called <B>/etc/rc2.d/logcheck</B> and it works fine. 
            Any clue what the problem might be?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It's difficult to tell whether 
              your program is having issues due to the way it's run because you 
              don't provide any further information. I suspect that your real 
              problem is that you're not actually going to run level 2 in the 
              first place. Unless you've specified booting to run level 2 or you've 
              modified <B>/etc/inittab</B> to make the <B>initdefault</B> 2 instead 
              of 3, then you're skipping over run level 2. Here's the default 
              entry in the inittab:
            <P> 
            <pre>
is:3:initdefault:
</pre>
            Your program works when you execute it as a script from /etc/rc2.d 
            because those scripts are also run as part of runlevel 3:
            <P> 
            <pre>
s2:23:wait:/sbin/rc2     &gt;/dev/msglog 2&lt;&gt;/dev/msglog     &lt;/dev/console
</pre>
            If you want your program to behave similarly, then change your <B>rstate</B> 
            to include runlevel 3 as well as runlevel 2:
            <P> 
            <pre>
logc:23:once:/local/bin/logchart
</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running OS X 10.3.5, 
            and I have a bunch of jar files that came with the <B>fink</B> install 
            of Mozilla. I'm trying to find one specific file in one of these jar 
            files, but I don't want to have to unzip them all to find it. Is there 
            a quick and easy way to get a listing of every file?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Jar files are just zip files 
              with a different extension. If you're looking for a specific file, 
              then the easiest way would be to use <B>find</B> in conjunction 
              with <B>unzip</B> in listing mode:
            <P> 
            <pre>
find /dir -name "*.jar" -exec unzip -qql {} "*filename" \; -print
</pre>
            For example, to find the file <B>navigatorOverlay.xul</B> to change 
            key bindings, you'd execute the following:
            <P> 
            <pre>
find /sw/lib/mozilla . -name "*.jar" -exec unzip -qql {} \
  "*navigatorOverlay.xul" \; -print
</pre>
            You want the * in front of the file name because you also want to 
            match files in subdirectories. If you don't want to match files ending 
            in <B>navigatorOverlay.xul</B>, then you could use two search terms 
            instead of one, to catch both a top-level file and a file in a subdirectory:
            <P> 
            <pre>
find /sw/lib/mozilla . -name "*.jar" -exec unzip -qql {} \
  "navigatorOverlay.xul" "*/navigatorOverlay.xul" \; -print
  </Pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We run sendmail 
            8.12.11 in conjunction with cyrus-2.2.3 on our mail servers. The problem 
            is that we're often hit by dictionary attacks, and sendmail doesn't 
            know how to reject them because the users are not in the password 
            file. Is there a way to have sendmail read the Cyrus user auth database 
            instead of the password file when rejecting mail?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Take a look at Andrzej Filip's

</pre>
            which uses a socket map or fstat map and FEATURE('mrs') to check the 
            existence of Cyrus mail boxes. Since you're running sendmail 8.12 
            and not 8.13, you'll need the socket map patch:

  sendmail-8.12.7-socketmap-v4.patch

            if you choose to use the socket map method. There's also a patch to 
            sendmail if you opt to use the fstat method:

</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just purchased a 
            used Sun U60 and tried booting it. The machine booted ok, but during 
            the boot, the screen remained black. I only got a video signal once 
            the machine had finished booting and it was showing the CDE login 
            screen. Since I don't have an account on the machine, I tried to boot 
            off the CDROM. The machine powered on and I hit <B>stop-a</B> to halt 
            the automatic boot. The monitor was still black, but I blind-typed 
            <B>boot -s cdrom</B>. The machine accessed the CDROM drive, but I 
            never got a display. At this point, I hooked up a serial console and 
            rebooted off the CDROM, and it seemed to work just fine. Why would 
            I get no video output on the monitor until the machine finished booting, 
            but the serial console would report everything just fine? Is there 
            a problem with my monitor, or the OBP code, or my framebuffer, or 
            something else?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> I would guess that you have one 
              of two problems. One problem could be that your console output is 
              set to a device that you're not using, perhaps another framebuffer 
              or one that got removed. While you have the serial terminal hooked 
              up, run <B>eeprom</B> and check the output-device. The second issue 
              could be that your monitor can't/won't sync to the resolution provided 
              by the OBP. Again, check the output-device variable and modify it 
              as needed.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a large number of identical 
              FreeBSD 4.10 machines that we need to roll out. I don't really want 
              to run them all through the network installation, especially since 
              I'm concerned that things on the mirrors may change between the 
              time we install the first server and subsequent ones. Is there a 
              better way to get a large number of identical machines?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you still want to do the install, 
              you could keep a local image and not make changes to it until you're 
              ready, rather than using the images on the FreeBSD servers. Conversely, 
              you can install one machine and then dump and restore the data to 
              new boot disks for your other servers. You can also use something 
              like <B>ghost</B> for UNIX, <B>g4u</B>, to create a disk image that 
              you can pull from your new servers:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://www.feyrer.de/g4u/
</Pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm writing a shell script 
            to generate <B>in-addr.arpa</B> addresses from a list of A records. 
            I've thought of doing this with <B>rev</B>, but that gives me a mirror 
            reverse of the IP, not a reverse of the dotted quad. Any suggestions?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The easiest way to do this is 
              just change the IFS to . and echo the dotted quads back out in the 
              reverse order:
            <P> 
            <pre>
#!/bin/sh
# revip.sh - reverse an IP (no error checking)

OLDIFS=${IFS}
IFS='.'

while read a b c d; do
  echo "${d}.${c}.${b}.${a}"
done

IFS=${OLDIFS}
</pre>
            Call this script with a file of IP addresses, one per line, as the 
            input or echo a single IP and pipe it to the script:
            <P> 
            <pre>
./revip.sh &lt; /path/to/ipfile
echo 192.168.0.1 | ./revip.sh
</pre>
            You would want to add some more error checking to this script to make 
            sure that the input is actually one or more valid IPs.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Do you know of any encrypted filesystem 
              implementations for Solaris 8? I know of things that run on BSD/OS 
              X, but I can't seem to find anything similar for Solaris, and I 
              really want to protect my data.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> I'm not aware of any OS-level 
              support for encrypted filesystems, especially on something as old 
              as Solaris 8. Some time ago, Matt Blaze wrote an encrypting filesystem 
              add-on, CFS, that does work under Solaris 8, I believe. It's now 
              unsupported, but it may fit the bill until something better comes 
              along. Take a look at:
