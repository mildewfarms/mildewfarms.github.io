              StorBank 4200 Network Attached Storage systems with configurations 
              up to 16,800GB. According to the company, expansion units permit

              The 8U form factor includes independent front-accessible hot-swap 
              drive trays.
            <P> Data stored on a 4200 Series NAS appliance is protected by quad-active

              implementations can take advantage of optional block-level storage 
              replication and failback. The 4200 Series NAS also features snapshot 
              technology to shorten backup windows by creating images of data 
              changes over a specified interval. Web-based management and configuration 
              interfaces allow administrators to remotely set up and maintain 
              the NAS product from any computer with network access.
            <P> The 4200 Series appliance appears in both the FlexStor-NAS and 
              StorBank product lines, developed to serve a range of computing 
              environments. For more information, visit: <I>http://www.dynamicnetworkfactory.com</I>.

              email policy.

              domain; it requires no customer hardware, software, or bandwidth 
              and no technical resources.
