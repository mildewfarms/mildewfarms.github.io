            <P> <I>Dave Taylor</i>
            <p> Take a deep breath, and let's go back in time a few years to Windows 
              95. Think about people saying "Leenucks? What's that?" and just 
              maybe imagine being in a public place without 10% of the people 
              chatting away on cell phones. Remember an upstart company called 
              Netscape and a browser formerly known as NCSA Mosaic. And let's 
              go back just a little bit further...
            <P> When the World Wide Web first appeared on the scene, it was all 
              about content -- not about flashy graphics, animated applets, and 
              wireless browsing hotspots. The first Web browser, in fact, was 
              a text-based browser that only worked in terminal windows.
            <P> Browser technology evolved, "document object models" became the 
              vogue, and the Netscape browser was crushed by Microsoft, acquired 
              by America Online, and then resurrected as an open source project 
              that worked across all the major computing platforms.
            <P> Meanwhile, a small group at the Distributed Computing Group of 
              the University of Kansas was creating and growing a powerful text-only 
              Web browser called Lynx. In fact, two of the original Lynx developers, 
              Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe, joined Netscape in 1994. The Lynx 
              program continues to grow and evolve to meet the ever-changing Web 
              and HTML standards, now maintained by a consortium of Internet programmers.
            <P> If you've been living in the world of graphical Web browsers, 
              you might just be surprised at how useful a text-only, command-line-based 
              Web browser can be for your daily Internet interactions.
            <P> <B>Getting your Own Copy of Lynx</B>
            <P> Odds are good that you have Lynx on your computer already (try 
              typing "which lynx" or "locate lynx" to find out), but if you aren't 
              lucky or you find that you have a really old version (the current 
              version is 2.8.5), you'll find plenty of different download options 
              at:
            <P> 
            <pre>

            Lynx is also available for Mac OS X and various flavors of Windows, 
            so even if you're not a hard-core Unix/Linux type, you can still reap 
            most of the benefits of this terrific utility.
            <P> 
            <p><b>Eight Reasons to Love Lynx </b></p>
            <P><b> 1. Lynx is great for testing Web sites</b>
            <P> Modern Web browsers can sometimes be too sophisticated, and there 
              are also plenty of different browsers to worry about too, from Firefox 
              to Camino, Safari to Internet Explorer. Underneath them all, though, 
              it's the content that you want to come through properly, and Lynx 
              is the Least Common Denominator of browsers. So it's safe to say 
              -- if it renders reasonably well in a text-only world, and the site 
              is readable and functional, it should be at least somewhat okay 
              everywhere else.
            <P> Lynx is also good for reminding you what your site will look when 
              you're on a cell-phone connection, since the current generation 
              of cell-phone Web browsers render text only and barely understand 
              line breaks, let alone anything more sophisticated. But previewing 
              the page in a GUI-based browser makes it pretty difficult to know 
              what's really going to happen.
            <P> <B>2. Lynx shields you from suspicious site tricks</B>
            <P> You're not too susceptible as a Linux user, but Web site owners 
              nowadays have plenty of tricks up their sleeves to make your surfing 
              experience less pleasant than it could be. From malicious spyware 
              and viruses, to sneaky little JavaScript and ActiveX tricks that 
              change your home page, resize your windows, pop up controlling windows 
              that feed you additional adverts, and more, browsing the Web isn't 
              as innocuous as it used to be. But Lynx shields you completely from 
              this because it doesn't read the JavaScript code, doesn't accept 
              or play ActiveX controls, shuns plug-ins, and ignores everything 
              that's not simple, straightforward HTML.
            <P> <B>3. Lynx is really, really fast</B>
            <P> If you're used to working with graphical browsers, I guarantee 
              you'll be blown away by just how fast a text-only browser is. Once 
              you skip all the graphics, you find that the 40-100 connections 
              needed to properly render a Web page in Firefox are reduced to one 
              connection -- for the HTML content only -- in Lynx, and your browsing 
              speed increases commensurately.
            <P> Many people who surf the Web looking for specific information 
              find that Lynx and its text-only brethren help them search for and 
              find what they seek quite a bit faster. There's a reason that Google 
              is almost completely text-based too: it's delightfully fast (particularly 
              compared to overblown ad-heavy monstrosities like MSN and Yahoo).
            <P> <B>4. Lynx is disability-friendly</B>
            <P> If you're reading this article with a Versabraille or some other 
              device that helps you overcome a visual disability, you already 
              know another great facet of Lynx -- it's disability-friendly in 
              a way that no GUI-based browser can be. By its very nature, Lynx 
              is designed for a keyboard-only interaction, with no pull-down menus, 
              no pop-up windows, no mouse controls, and nothing to click on.
            <P> HTML 4.0 introduced quite a few new HTML capabilities for disabilities, 
              but with all the market pressure to add flashy new features, precious 
              few GUI-based browsers have implemented everything in the HTML 4.0 
              standard, and, no surprise, disability features appear to be last 
              on the list. That's why the built-in support of Lynx for disabilities 
              is such a winner.
            <P> <B>5. Lets you ensure you're XHTML-compliant</B>
            <P> This may seem a bit trivial, but if you're building Web sites, 
              you should be obsessively ensuring that every graphic you reference 
              also includes an ALT tag. There are two reasons for this: first, 
              it's good coding style and a requirement of the new XHTML standard, 
              but more importantly, it's a simple way to ensure that your site 
              is disability-friendly. And an added bonus, if the sites you visit 
              with Lynx have well-planned ALT tags then the browsing experience 
              can be remarkably similar to a GUI-browser -- just a lot faster.
            <P> <B>6. Lynx frees you from worrying about connection speeds</B>
            <P> If you're not already paying a premium for high-speed broadband 
              connectivity -- and even if you are -- there are fast connections 
              and not so fast connections. And when you're on the road, even the 
              best dial-up is, well, a dial-up connection. By using Lynx as your 
              Web browser, you can ignore your connection speed, since the basic 
              HTML page downloads in a flash even on the slowest connection!
            <P> <B>7. Lynx lets you browse the Web from servers</B>
            <P> I have a couple of different servers on which I host Web sites 
              and other content, and sometimes it's just plain easier to use Lynx 
              on the server, via an ssh or telnet connection. It's a great way 
              to see what your server applications are seeing, too, if you're 
              scripting or otherwise automating any Web interactivity.
            <P> <B>8. Lynx is a fabulous tool for scripting Web interaction</B>
            <P> I realize that as the author of <I>Wicked Cool Shell Scripts</I> 
              and a 25-year veteran of the Unix command line, I might be a bit 
              more enthusiastic about scripting and command lines than most people, 
              but I have to say, Lynx is the secret ingredient behind dozens and 
              dozens of my favorite tools and utilities.
            <P> Need a command-line tool to convert currencies? Want to have the 
              current weather in Fiji listed when you log in rather than some 
              crufty old fortune? Want to monitor a dozen RSS feeds for your name 
              or your company? All of these can be easily accomplished by scripting 
              Lynx.
            <P> Here's an easy example -- Google assigns each page in its index 
              a "page rank", a value between 0 and 10 that indicates the relative 
              importance (to Google) of the page. It's good to know your page 
              rank because the higher it is, the more relevant your site will 
              be for search results and the better traffic you'll get from people 
              searching Google. You can ascertain the page rank of any given URL 
              with the Google Toolbar, but it turns out various Web sites have 
              figured out how to get the page rank with a simple CGI script call.
            <P> <B>A Perfect Job for Lynx</B>
            <P> Here's a tiny shell script that uses Lynx to feed in a URL and 
              ascertain its page rank from the top25web.com form:
            <P> 
            <pre>
#!/bin/sh

echo -n "$1 page rank is"

echo "url=$1" |
    lynx -post_data "http://www.top25web.com/pagerank.php" | \
    grep "$1" | \
    cut -d: -f3-

exit 0
</pre>
            Easy enough! And with this called, say, "pagerank", you can easily 
            ascertain the page rank of any page with:
            <P> 
            <pre>
$ pagerank http://www.intuitive.com/
http://www.intuitive.com/ page rank is 6/10
</pre>
            Really, the only limitation to scripting Lynx is your imagination. 
            Anything you can find on the Web, anything you can get to come up 
            in a browser, you can script with Lynx and some shell scripting tricks.
            <P> <B>In Conclusion</B>
            <P> I'll be honest with you -- I use Safari, Firefox, and, on rare 
              occasions, Internet Explorer when I'm surfing the Web. But for scripting 
              or testing sites, Lynx is a winner and a tremendous addition to 
              your Linux toolkit. Don't leave home without it!
