            <P> Arkeia Corp. announced their MySQL online backup solutions include 
              new options for administrators who need affordable protection for 
              MySQL database servers. Now incorporated in Arkeia's MySQL plug-in, 
              according to the company, is the ability to run incremental database

              includes only the log of the operations since the last backup; when

              backup of the database information as well as the MySQL binary logs. 
              The systems administrator then replays the log up to the desired 
              date of database state. 
            <P> In addition to the new plug-in version, Arkeia also added support 
              for MySQL on the HPUX/Itanium 2 platform. Arkeia hot backup plug-in 
              includes numerous Linux distributions on Intel x86, Itanium 2, Sparc, 
              PowerPC, and Alpha architectures as well as Windows, AIX, Solaris, 
              HP-UX on PA-RISC, Tru64, Irix, Mac OS X, and xBSDs. The Arkeia MySQL 
              plug-in is compatible with versions of MySQL starting from 3.21 
              and including versions 4.x.

            <P> <B>HELIOS Ships WebShare </B>
            <P> HELIOS Software GmbH is now shipping HELIOS WebShare, a secure 
              and fast server solution that enables users to access their file 
              servers over the Internet. According to the company, WebShare replaces 
              insecure file transfer methods by using an intuitive Web browser 
              interface to enable real-time file uploads and downloads, document 
              proofing, and remote file management. 
            <P> HELIOS WebShare is a two-tier server application. The WebShare 
              WebObjects server is connected to the Internet and generates dynamic 
              HTML content pages from data provided by the WebShare File Server. 
              When a user wants to access or manage files on the internal File 
              Server, the WebShare WebObjects Server accepts the authorization 
              request and forwards it to the WebShare File Server. The File Server 
              then starts a separate process with these user access rights so 
              the remote user can see only the files and directories for which 
              they have file system permissions. 
            <P> In addition to remote file browsing, management, and transfer, 
              HELIOS WebShare works together with HELIOS ImageServer and HELIOS 
              PDF HandShake to provide remote previews of PDF, QuarkXPress, and 
              InDesign documents, as well as all major image formats.
