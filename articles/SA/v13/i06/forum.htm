            <I>Sys Admin</I> magazine is sponsoring two tracks this year at the 
            Software Development Best Practices conference, which will be held 
            in Boston, September 20-23, at the Hynes Convention Center.
            <P> The <I>Sys Admin</I> security track provides essential information 
              to help you stay current with the latest threats and implement powerful 
              tools and techniques to keep your systems secure. In this track, 
              Hal Pomeranz will teach two half-day courses -- "How They Do It: 
              Unix Hacking 101" and "Simple Unix Tricks: Spotting Break-ins". 
              In the first course, Hal will cover stack smashing, session hijacking, 
              and other nefarious tricks for breaking into Unix systems. He will 
              also look at the current state of the art in the rootkits that attackers 
              use to escape detection and maintain access after a successful break-in. 
              In the second course, Hal will present a simple set of checks that 
              systems administrators can perform to monitor the status of their 
              Unix systems.
            <P> In other featured security courses, Peter Galvin will review some 
              useful security features in the latest release of the Solaris operating 
              system, and Kristy Westphal will examine all aspects of honeypots, 
              including building, monitoring, and maintaining them. Jay Beale, 
              primary author of Bastille, a system-hardening tool, will provide 
              an overview of how to implement Bastille to improve the security 
              of your enterprise. Richard Mackey and Brad Johnson will discuss 
              the major issues of securing hand-held devices, covering general 
              vulnerabilities as well as specific security measures you should 
              consider.
            <P> The <I>Sys Admin</I> scripting track offers basic-to-advanced 
              levels of scripting training to help you solve hundreds of problems. 
              The courses describe the underlying technology features as well 
              as limitations to help you avoid common scripting mistakes, understand 
              the best practices, and implement solutions quickly. As part of 
              this track, Randal Schwartz will teach two all-day tutorials -- 
              "Learning Perl" and "Intermediate Perl". In the first course, Randal 
              will show how to use Perl to accomplish many common tasks and lay 
              the groundwork for more advanced study. In the second course, he 
              will cover advanced data structures in Perl and show you how to 
              keep your Perl programs running smoothly. Other courses will provide 
              training in MySQL and Python.
            <P> The SD Best Practices conference, now in its 17th year, provides 
              classes and tutorials in several programming tracks, including: 
              Design and Architecture, Requirements and Analysis, Build and Deploy, 
              and Testing and Quality. It is the conference's mission to provide 
              reliable, trustworthy, and practical training that will help boost 
              efficiency, streamline infrastructure, enhance quality, and achieve 
              successful project outcomes. I'm very excited about <I>Sys Admin</I>'s 
              participation in this conference and invite you to attend. You can 
              see all the details and register online at: <B>http://www.sdexpo.com</B>.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
            <P> <I>Amber Ankerholz</i><br>
