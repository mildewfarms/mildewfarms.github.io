            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to compile Apache 1.3.29

            I'm not sure what the issue is, since everything seems to look fine. 
            Where should all of these functions be declared, and why isn't gcc 
            finding them?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Your problem is not the compiler 
              but your make program. This is a common error if you're using /usr/ccs/bin/make 
              instead of GNU make. If you have GNU make installed, put its path 
              in your PATH before /usr/ccs/bin. If you don't have GNU make installed, 
              obtain and build the source from:

            <pre>

</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have several Solaris 
            8 machines at our facility. One of our users has a very wide terminal 
            he uses to connect to these machines. When he does an ls, it's limited 
            to 80 columns, even though he has the COLUMNS environment variable 
            set. According to the <B>ls</B> man page:
            <P> There are three major listing formats. The default format for 
              output directed to a terminal is multi-column with entries sorted 
              down the columns. The -1 option allows single column output and 
              -m enables stream output format. In order to determine output formats 
              for the -C, -x, and -m options, ls uses an environment variable, 
              COLUMNS, to determine the number of character positions available 
              on one output line. If this variable is not set, the terminfo(4) 
              database is used to determine the number of columns, based on the 
              environment variable TERM. If this information cannot be obtained, 
              80 columns are assumed.
            <P> So why can he only get 80-column output?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There are a couple reasons why 
              you would be getting 80-column output even when using the COLUMNS 
              setting. Make sure you're using /usr/bin/ls or /usr/xpg4/bin/ls 
              and not /usr/ucb/ls. The UCB <B>ls</B> (man section 1b instead of 
              1) does not honor the COLUMNS variable. If you are using /usr/bin/ls 
              or /usr/xpg4/bin/ls and COLUMNS is set to a number above 160, this 
              is assumed to be an error and defaults back to 80 columns. If you 
              have a sunsolve.sun.com account, you can see this referenced under 
              bugids 1233465 and 4133872. As far as I know there is no work-around 
              for Solaris 8, but this has been updated in Solaris 9 so that the 
              maximum column size is 1000. The minimum in both versions of Solaris 
              is 20 columns.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a cable modem connected 
              to an OpenBSD 3.4 machine acting as a router. I'm using dyndns.org 
              to update my DNS information for my personal domain. Is there some 
              nifty script available to handle the dyndns interaction for me so 
              that I don't need to modify things manually when my IP changes?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There's a Perl script called 
              ddclient available in the OpenBSD ports tree under net/ddclient. 
              The ddclient script also supports the following dynamic DNS sites:

</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I just did a recovery 
            of a Solaris 9 machine from a flash archive, but it didn't restore 
            important files like /etc/hosts, /etc/defaultrouter, /etc/vfstab, 
            and /etc/hostname.&lt;interface&gt;. I know these files existed on 
            the master machine where I created the flash archive, but the items 
            restored to this new machine look like blank system default files. 
            How can I get flash to create an exact duplicate?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The flarcreate program does the 
              equivalent of <B>sys-unconfig</B> before the archive is packaged. 
              To keep the machine-specific configuration files, I suggest creating 
              a tar ball or a separate directory with the necessary files. You 
              can then use a script to move these files back into place. If you 
              don't back up these files and use a script to place them back where 
              they belong, <B>sysidconfig</B> should handle the reconfiguration 
              of the machine (whether that be as part of a jumpstart installation 
              or an interactive install depends on the flash installation method). 
              See the man pages for <B>sys-unconfig</B>(1M) and <B>sysidconfig</B>(1M) 
              for more information.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running FreeBSD 5.2-RELEASE 
              and I'm trying to get the GNU GRUB boot loader installed and working 
              from the ports collection. It compiles and installs fine, but when 
              I run <B>grub-install</B>, I get the following errors:
            <P> 
            <pre>

/dev/ad0s1a does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.
grub-install /dev/ad0
/dev/ad0 does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.

            The simplest form of my grub.conf contains the following:

title  FreeBSD 5.2
root   (hd1,0,a)

</pre>
            Why won't GRUB recognize my boot disk at all?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> My guess is that you're using 
              an old version of the GRUB port. Until early February 2004, the 
              GRUB port did not support UFS2, the default filesystem type for 
              FreeBSD 5.2, without chainloading. You can use chainloading as follows:
            <P> 
            <pre>
title  FreeBSD 5.2
rootnoverify (hd1,0)
chainloader +1
</pre>
            If you'd rather not use chainloading, try updating your ports collection 
            and installing the new GRUB with the UFS2 patch. Another option is 
            to use a different boot loader altogether, such as the Graphical Boot 
            Manager, GAG. GAG can be obtained from:

</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running Solaris 7 
            on an Ultra 10. At one point, we experienced a period of high load 
            and killed off a number of processes by hand to try to bring the machine 
            back to normal. For one particular process (an in-house application 
            called stalld) I tried terminating the process using <B>kill &lt;pid&gt;</B>. 
            When that failed, I tried <B>kill -9</B>. That also seemed to fail, 
            because the process was still there after the first <B>kill -9</B> 
            attempt. I ran the <B>kill -9</B> several times, and the process finally 
            died. I thought that <B>kill -9</B> immediately terminated the process, 
            no matter what? Why were the first few <B>kill -9</B> calls ineffective?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> A <B>kill -9</B> will terminate 
              a process as long as the process is not already a zombie. Since 
              your process finally terminated, it's likely that the process was 
              blocked and it took a while for it to receive the kill signal. This 
              often happens when the process is in iowait or is swapped out. Because 
              you mentioned that the load was high, perhaps the program had crashed 
              and was writing a large core file out to disk, or there was no free 
              memory for the process to run.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just acquired an old SPARC 
              20 to use as a router/firewall, and I've successfully installed 
              Solaris 8 on it. A monitor came with the SPARC 20 so that it could 
              be used as an X-capable machine, too. Unfortunately, I don't seem 
              to be able to use X at all. Even the installation wasn't a GUI like 
              I'm used to; it was the character-based install on the graphical 
              monitor. I saw X working on this machine before I got it, so I know 
              it's not something weird with the brand of monitor or the connectors. 
              I've tried everything I can think of to get X configured but I haven't 
              had any luck. Do you have any suggestions?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The fact that the install program 
              started in character mode indicates that it did not recognize the 
              graphics card. It's likely that your SPARC 20 has an old ZX or TZX 
              (leo) frame buffer. You can verify this by identifying the graphics 
              card in the boot message. Solaris stopped supporting the ZX/TZX 
              after 2.6, so it's possible that you saw the machine running with 
              version 2.6 or older of the OS before you acquired it.
            <P> Of course, running X on this card is going to be very slow, and 
              you generally don't want to run X on a machine that's acting as 
              a router and/or firewall anyway, but it should be possible if you 
              choose to do so. Obtain the leo packages from a 2.6 installation 
              and use those to run the graphics card. The leo package directories 
              you'll want off the 2.6 install media are:

            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running FreeBSD 4.9-STABLE. 
              I do a cvsup on a nightly basis to keep my ports tree up to date. 
              I often get timeouts from the primary site in my configuration file 
              and I'm wondering whether there's some way to avoid that.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> A good solution to your problem 
              may be to use the fastest_cvsup program to select your cvsup server 
              each time. The fastest_cvsup program, as its name implies, locates 
              the "closest" cvsup server based on the time needed to establish 
              a connection. The fastest_cvsup program can search all cvsup servers 
              worldwide or be restricted to one or more countries based on the 
              argument supplied to the <B>-c</B> flag. Install the port from /usr/ports/sysutils/fastest_cvsup 
              and modify your cvsup cron entry to look something like the following 
              if you want to test servers in the United States:
            <P> 
            <pre>
/usr/local/bin/cvsup -g -h '/usr/local/bin/fastest_cvsup -Q -c us' \

            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to compile and install 
              OpenSSL 0.9.7d on a Solaris 8 machine with gcc 2.95.3. I obtain

            The library is definitely in /usr/local/lib, and I specified the prefix 
            on the configure line, so why can't it find the library?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Unfortunately, the OpenSSL make 
              files are not smart enough to compile the openssl binary with the 
              runtime environment of the library directory specified on the command 
              line. This is especially odd for OpenSSL; it obviously knows where 
              the libraries will end up because it installs them. You can work 
              around this behavior by explicitly setting the variable LD_RUN_PATH 
              before you compile the software. You can also use <B>crle</B> to 
              add /usr/local/lib to the system-wide library search path. I suggest 
              the former, but many people prefer the latter to work around all 
              software packages that don't compile binaries with the correct run 
              time path. For more information on modifying the system-wide runtime 
              environment, read the <B>crle</B>(1) man page.

              "it depends". If your E450 doesn't have much in the way of disk, 
              PCI slots, or number of CPUs, then you're definitely not going to 
              need the second power supply. If you're packing it full of CPUs, 
              memory, disk, and PCI cards, then you will want the extra power 
              supply for the load. To help determine your specific needs, take 
              a look at:

            and fill out the worksheets contained on that page. Note that the 
            third power supply can only be used for redundancy. In the rare case 
            that your power requirements exceed what two power supplies can provide, 
            you're going to have to remove components until you're under the maximum 
            rated value.
