              Solaris<sup>TM</sup> Performance Advantage</B></h1>
            <P><B> </b><I>Sun Microsystems, Inc.</I>
            <P><I> </i>October 12, 2004 -- Power enterprise applications at 
              record speed with the one-two punch of the Solaris OS and AMD Opteron 
              processors.
            <P> The powerful combination of the Solaris OS and the AMD Opteron 
              processors is shattering benchmark records and delivering breakthrough 
              price/performance for databases, application servers, Web servers, 
              compilers, and more.
            <ul> <li> On similar x86 systems at a financial services company, 
              the Sun Java System Application Server on the Solaris 10 OS is more 
              than twice as fast as IBM WebSphere on Linux (see graphic below).
            <li> On the Sun Java System Web Server, the Solaris 10 OS on 
              the AMD Opteron processor-based systems improves performance by 
              nearly 45 percent on the same hardware, as compared to the Solaris 
              9 OS (see graphic below).
            <li> Sun customers report that the Solaris 10 OS outperforms 
              Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.0 by 14 percent to 38 percent on the 
              Sun Java System Web Server and Apache Web Server, respectively (see 
              graphic below).
            <li> On an AMD Opteron processor-based system (the Sun Fire 
              V20z server), the Sun Studio 9 software on the Solaris 10 OS delivers 
              up to 60% better runtime performance for a scientific application 
              over open source alternatives on Solaris 10.
            <li> For a financial services application, the Sun Studio 9 
              software on the Solaris 10 OS outperforms open source compilers 
              on Linux, delivering a 63% increase in transactions per second.
           <li> On the BLAST bio-informatics benchmark, a Sun Java Workstation 
              W1100z (with a 2.4-GHz AMD Opteron processor) running the Solaris 
              10 OS achieves up to 61 percent better performance than a Dell Precision 
              650 (with a 3.2-GHz Intel Xeon Processor MP) running Red Hat Enterprise 
              Linux 3.0.</ul>
            <P> <B>Dynamic Duo</B>
            <P><B> </b>Using Sun Fire V20z servers with AMD Opteron processors, 
              Solaris 10 delivers superior application and web server performance.
            <P> See the first three notes on this page for full configuration 
              details.
            <P> "Sun's AMD Opteron processor-based systems are the fastest 
              and most cost-effective solutions out there," says Sunay Tripathi, 
              Sun senior staff engineer, Solaris Network and Security Technologies. 
              "Customers can now rely on x86 hardware for all types of enterprise-class 
              applications."
            <P> You can find out more about the record-breaking performance of 
              Sun's AMD Opteron processor-based systems at Sun.com:
            <ul> <li> Sun Fire V20z server benchmarks
             <li> Sun Fire V40z server benchmarks
             <li> Sun Java Workstation W1100z benchmarks
             <li> Sun Java Workstation W2100z benchmarks</ul>
             <B>All About the Solaris<sup>TM</sup> OS on x86</B>
            <B>Key Benefits</b>
             <ul><li> Combines cost-effectiveness and high performance
             <li> Leverages breakthrough technologies in Solaris 10
             <li> Protects investments thanks to full 32-bit binary compatibility
             <li> Supercharges demanding real-world enterprise applications
             <li> Technology test drives at no charge</ul>
             <B>Additional Advantage</B>
            <P><B> </b>The combination of the AMD Opteron processor-based systems 
              and the Solaris 9 OS also proves its performance credentials and 
              price/performance leadership.
            <P> <B>Performance</B>
            <P><B> </b>The Solaris 9 OS on the AMD Opteron processors is up to 
              29 percent faster than the Solaris 9 OS on the Intel Xeon processors, 
              thanks to the AMD Opteron processor's advanced HyperTransport 
              bus.
            <P> On the AMD Opteron processor-based systems, the Solaris 9 OS demonstrates 
              up to 123 percent better performance in I/O-intensive operations 
              than does Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.0.
            <P> <B>Price/Performance</B>
            <P><B> </b>On the SPECjAppServer2002 MultipleNode benchmark, the Sun 
              Fire V20z and the Sun Fire V40z servers running the Solaris 9 OS 
              delivered world-record price/performance of U.S. $82/TOPS@MultipleNode.
            <P> Also a boon to the bottom line, the cost of the Solaris 9 OS (x86 
              Platform Edition) plus standard support is as much as 58 percent 
              lower than the cost of Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS over three years.
            <P> <B>Real-World Performance</B>
            <P><B> </b>Sun's AMD Opteron processor-based systems with the 
              Solaris OS deliver blazing performance in the real world as well. 
              One of the country's leading consumer ISPs had been sending 
              4000 messages per second on the Solaris 9 OS. After briefly switching 
              to Linux, the company returned to the Solaris OS, lured by the Solaris 
              10 OS's astounding performance. The ISP now sends 25,000 messages 
              per second on the same AMD Opteron processor-based hardware and 
              has abandoned Linux.
            <P> Sun also continues to work with partners to expand the application 
              portfolio for x86. Earlier this month, Sun announced that Siebel 
              Systems will support Siebel Enterprise Edition for the Solaris OS 
              (x86 Platform Edition). When complete, customers will be able to 
              cost-effectively run Siebel software on Sun's latest volume 
              systems.
            <P> How Solaris Makes it Happen
            <P> What makes such performance successes possible? With the Solaris 
              OS, Sun has analyzed many different customer workloads to optimize 
              the operating system and amplify the existing strengths of the AMD 
              Opteron processor. The Solaris 10 OS also includes three breakthrough 
              technologies that help maximize real-world performance:
            <ul> <li> High-performance TCP/IP stack (Fire Engine)
             <li> N1 Grid Containers software
             <li> Solaris dynamic tracing framework, DTrace</ul>
            <P> By fully taking advantage of these technologies, Sun AMD Opteron 
              processor-based systems give customers the flexibility to rely on 
              x86 hardware for all types of enterprise-class applications.
            <P> <B>Get Started Today</B>
            <P><B> </b>There are several ways you can begin taking advantage of 
              the performance and price advantages of the Solaris OS and Sun AMD 
              Opteron processor-based systems. Thousands of customers are already 
              benefiting from the groundbreaking new features of Solaris 10 through 
              Sun's Software Express program.
            <P> Also check out the remarkably low prices of Sun's AMD Opteron 
              processor-based servers at the Sun Store: the Sun Fire V20z server, 
              the Sun Fire V40z server, the Sun Java Workstation W1100z, and the 
              Sun Java Workstation W2100z.
            <P> To fully explore the power of the Solaris OS and AMD Opteron processor 
              system combo, take the Solaris OS and AMD Opteron processor test 
              drive. Test your applications on a Sun Fire V20z server running 
              the Solaris 10 OS for two months, free.
            <P> And learn all about how the Solaris 10 OS delivers its extreme 
              performance. As Tripathi says,
            <P> "Sun's focus on performance is an ongoing goal. Performance 
              is not something you're done with."
