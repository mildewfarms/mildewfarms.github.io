            <h4>The Solaris<sup>TM</sup> Containers technology, coming with the 
              Solaris<sup>TM</sup> 10 Operating System, sends resource utilization 
              through the roof and revolutionizes the economics of data center 
              management.</h4>
            <P> 30.Mar.04 -- Let the consolidation begin. Using new software partitioning 
              technology coming with the Solaris 10 Operating System (Solaris 
              OS), Sun customers will be able to combine applications on servers 
              safely, reliably, and with excellent manageability.
            <P> The technology is called Solaris Containers, and it is designed 
              to increase utilization of your hardware resources and boost your 
              server-to-administrator ratio. With the Solaris Containers technology, 
              you can create up to 4000 secure, fault-isolated software partitions 
              (or containers), each with its own IP address, memory space, file 
              area, host name, and root password.
            <P> The Solaris Containers technology provides a management model 
              for virtualizing resources in a single server. The technology includes 
              several powerful capabilities: 
            <ul>
              <li> Resource management to enable flexible allocation of compute 
                power according to your business objectives 
              <li> Separation between containers, such as fault and data isolation, 
                for safe deployment and high service levels 
              <li> Security, including access controls for each container
            </ul>
            The Solaris Containers technology will be available for all Sun server 
            platforms, including UltraSPARC processor-based and x86-based systems 
            with 32-bit Xeon and 64-bit Opteron architectures. The Solaris Containers 
            technology is part of Sun's ongoing N1 Grid initiative, our vision, 
            architecture, products, and services for optimizing network computing. 
            N1 Grid comprises solutions designed and built with a common set of 
            underlying architectural principles, with the ultimate goal of "managing 
            n computers as 1."
            <P> <B>Consolidate and Save</B>
            <P> The goal of consolidation is to reduce costs. With sub-CPU granularity, 
              the Solaris Containers technology supports consolidation by enabling 
              one server to deliver the security and reliability benefits of a 
              fleet of systems, without the management overhead. Because system 
              resources are virtualized, administrators can raise hardware utilization 
              while still meeting peak demand levels. In short, the Solaris Containers 
              technology helps you raise efficiency and deliver high security 
              and fault resilience without compromising performance.
            <P> 
            <ul>
              "With the Solaris 10 Operating System, we're bringing to market 
              a dramatically different software partitioning solution," said Ann 
              Wettersten, Sun vice president, Marketing Operating Systems and 
              Availability. "Solaris Containers creates partitions that are highly 
              efficient to manage because they run on a single instance of the 
              Solaris OS. System administrators can single-handedly raise utilization 
              rates on a whole range of Sun systems, from our 72-CPU Sun Fire 
              E25K server to the entry-level Sun Fire V20z and Sun Fire V60x servers, 
              as well as a whole range of SPARC architecture-based and x86-based 
              blades."
            </ul>
            The Solaris Containers technology differs from other partitioning 
            technologies in two important ways. First, it virtualizes the operating 
            system, enabling multiple execution environments without replicating 
            the operating system kernel. The result is extremely low overhead, 
            both from a management perspective and from a resource utilization 
            standpoint.
            <P> 
            <ul>
              "You can say goodbye to multiple patch and update procedures," says 
              Wettersten, "and you can put 99 percent of your system resources 
              to work where they'll give you the most bang for your buck -- running 
              applications."
            </ul>
            Second, the Solaris Containers technology works alongside Sun's Dynamic 
            System Domains, which are available on Sun's midrange and high-end 
            Sun Fire servers. Want to subdivide a single domain into thousands 
            of containers and create fully isolated test and execution environments? 
            You can. Using the advanced isolation and restart capabilities in 
            the Solaris Containers software, you can even test a new database 
            application on the same system you're using as your production environment. 
            The Solaris Containers software has a feature that lets you start, 
            provision, or restart a container at the flick of a switch, without 
            disrupting any other applications running on the system. That's the 
            beauty of a virtualized environment.
            <P> <B>The N1 Grid Vision</B>
            <P> As part of the N1 Grid initiative, the N1 Grid System provides 
              all the core services for establishing, partitioning, provisioning, 
              and managing grids. It enables virtualization of resources on every 
              system in the data center, including storage and software systems, 
              yielding extremely low cost of ownership.
            <P> The Solaris Containers technology is a key element in the implementation 
              of an N1 Grid System architecture because it provides flexible, 
              software-defined boundaries for isolating applications and services 
              within a server. Because containers can have unique identities that 
              are separated from the system's physical identity (its host name 
              and IP address), you have ultimate flexibility to move or deploy 
              containers onto other systems without the complexity normally associated 
              with such changes.
            <P> The Solaris Containers technology is designed to take full advantage 
              of the tools and advanced features of the forthcoming Solaris 10 
              Operating System, including the following: 
            <ul>
              <li> Dynamic Tracing for fast troubleshooting of sporadic or elusive 
                problems and for improving overall system performance (This exciting 
                new technology will be highlighted in an upcoming Sun.com feature 
                story.) 
              <li> Predictive self healing and fault management, for a highly 
                reliable software environment 
              <li> Advanced security features, such as process rights management, 
                that significantly reduce the risks of system exploits from hackers 
              <li> Instant Restart capability, so you can destroy and restart 
                a containerized test environment quickly and easily, without disrupting 
                operations in neighboring containers 
              <li> Accounting and reporting capabilities that capture usage data 
                based on workloads, not system use, for more accurate billing 
              <li> Network bandwidth management, so you can allocate needed bandwidth 
                to individual application services
            </ul>
            <B>Experience the Future Today</B>
