            <h1><b>Where's Mine?</b></h1>
            <p><b> </b>Several readers have asked how to run Python on particular 
              hosts. The answer I want to give them is simply to invoke the default 
              installed Python at the command line. Nearly all Unix flavors now 
              ship with Python as part of their standard distribution.
            <p> Most of us, though, have responsibilities that extend to the exceptional 
              cases -- old hosts, damaged ones, and experimental setups. How 
              do we install Python so we can use it in the oddball places?
            <p> Your first instinct might be to take advantage of one of the large 
              public depots, like the "Software Porting and Archive Centre 
              for HP-UX". I'm all in favor of these and support them 
              as I can. They're not specialists with Python, though, and 
              they generally concentrate on current operating system releases, 
              while they're often as much as a year behind on their Python 
              version.
            <p> That means you might need to install Python from sources yourself. 
              Rather than give detailed instructions on how to do this on all 
              the different flavors of Unix, I want to emphasize that you should 
              work with the latest stable Python distribution, and follow its 
              README. The Python community is working continuously to improve 
              portability, and your best prospect is to start with the most recent.
            <p> For our purposes, the trickiest aspect of building Python is that 
              the Tkinter module, the focus of this month's article, depends 
              on prior installation of Tcl/Tk in a standard location such as <b>/usr</b> 
              or <b>$HOME/local</b>. My aim is that, by the time you read this, 
              the distribution README will explain the process more clearly. If 
              you still have questions, feel free to write me at: <b>claird@phaseit.net</b>.
            <p> An alternative to working from sources is to pay for a supported 
              version of Python. ActiveState Tools provides free public builds 
              for the popular platforms of Linux and Solaris and, as of the end 
              of 2003, offers contracts on such others as HP-UX and AIX, according 
              to Developer Trent Mick of ActiveState. Other, smaller consultancies 
              specialize in just one or two platforms.
