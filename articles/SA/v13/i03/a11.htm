            <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <i>Thanks to Robert Banniza for a correction to the February 2003

              Q&amp;A about booting a Sun V240 from Solaris 8. Although Sun specifies 
              on their Web site that the V240 should boot from Solaris 8 02/02 
              , Solaris 8 05/03 is actually required because the machine will 
              issue a kernel panic due to missing drivers.</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b>Sun 
              specifies on their Web site that the V240 should boot from Solaris 
              8 02/02 , Solaris 8 05/03 is actually required because the machine 
              will issue a kernel panic due to missing drivers.Q Our group just 
              inherited a Sun AXi that someone had been using as a desktop machine. 
              We were going to turn this box into a small server, but it has a 
              very annoying problem. Every time the machine resets, it won't 
              auto-boot. Instead, it gives the error <b>trap 3e</b>. If you type 
              in <b>boot</b> from the console after the error, the machine comes 
              up just fine.
            <p> I've tried everything I can think of to diagnose/fix this 
              problem. I increased the diagnostic level, and there doesn't 
              appear to be anything really wrong. I tried enabling <b>diag-switch</b>? 
              and setting the diag-device to disk, but it just gives the error 
              twice. I tried reinstalling the OS, reinstalling the boot blocks, 
              and <b>fsck</b>'ing the disk. Nothing ever shows up as actually 
              being a problem, but the machine just fails to auto-boot. Do you 
              have any suggestions?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It sounds like your boot drive 
              is an IBM. There's a known issue with some IBM drives not being 
              ready after a reset. The workaround is to force a disk probe upon 
              power on so that the disks are recognized and ready to boot from 
              by the time the machine tries to boot. To accomplish this, drop 
              the machine to the <b>ok</b> prompt and use <b>nvedit</b> to add 
              the some lines to the nvramrc. The following is a quick key-binding 
              list for nvedit:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Control-B</b>: Move backward one character. 
              <li> <b>Control-C</b>: Exit the editor and return to the OpenBoot 
                command interpreter. The temporary buffer is preserved but is 
                not written back to NVRAMRC. (Use <b>nvstore</b> afterwards to 
                write back the temporary buffer.) 
              <li> <b>Control-F</b>: Move forward one character. 
              <li> <b>Control-K</b>: If at the end of a line, join the next line 
                to the current line (that is, delete the newline). 
              <li> <b>Control-L</b>: List all lines. 
              <li> <b> Control-N</b>: Move to the next line of the NVRAMRC editing 
                buffer. 
              <li> <b>Control-O</b>: Insert a new line at the cursor position 
                and stay on the current line. 
              <li> <b>Control-P</b>: Move to the previous line of the NVRAMRC 
                editing buffer. 
              <li> <b>Delete</b>: Delete the previous character. 
              <li> <b> Return</b>: Insert a new line at the cursor position and 
                advance to the next line.
            </ul>

</pre>
            To begin, record the information stored in the OBP -- just in 
            case you make a mistake and need to restore it later. Then, add the 
            lines listed below to any existing configuration information in the 
            nvramrc temporary buffer. The instance of <b>/pci@1f,0/pci@1/scsi@1</b> 
            below should be replaced with the actual location of your SCSI card. 
            This information can be determined by performing a <b>probe-scsi</b>, 
            but the default on an AXi is <b>/pci@1f,0/pci@1/scsi@1</b>.
            <p> 
            <pre>
nvramrc=probe-all install-console banner
" Probing all to work around IBM boot disk trap 3e error" type cr
" /pci@1f,0/pci@1/scsi@1" " show-children" execute-device-method drop
</pre>
            On the next blank line, type <b>Control-c</b> to exit nvedit and then 
            type the following to make sure that your changes are stored and used 
            during boot time:
            <p> 
            <pre>
nvstore ok
setenv use-nvramrc? true
</pre>
            If you munge the nvramrc and your machine fails to give you a display 
            after you reset it, hit <b>Stop-n</b> to reset the OBP to its factory 
            defaults.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to do some performance 
              tuning on a FreeBSD 4.9-STABLE machine, so I've whipped up 
              a Bourne shell script to time some functions. I'm then parsing 
              and correlating the output from the <b>time</b> command to generate 
              some statistics. Because I needed some extra functionality, I switched 
              to bash. Unfortunately, the <b>time</b> command doesn't seem 
              to be outputting what I expect. Here's the simplest case of 
              the two scripts, with the bash script first:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/bash
time ls -a
</pre>
            The output from the above script is:
            <p> 
            <pre>
.       ..

real    0m0.004s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.003s
</pre>
            And the Bourne shell script:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#!/bin/sh
time ls -a
</pre>
            with an output of:
            <p> 
            <pre>
.       ..
        0.00 real         0.00 user         0.00 sys
</pre>
            How do I make the output match?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You're getting different 
              output because bash reserves the time keyword and prints it out 
              in its own format. You can reformat the bash output to appear like 
              /usr/bin/date output would in the Bourne shell by modifying the 
              TIMEFORMAT variable in your script. Here's an excerpt from 
              the BASH FAQ:
            <p> 
            <ul>
              The value of TIMEFORMAT is a string with '%' escapes expanded 
              in a fashion similar in spirit to printf(3). The manual page explains 
              the meanings of the escape sequences in the format string.
              <p> If TIMEFORMAT is not set, bash acts as if the following assignment 
                had been performed:
              <p> <b>TIMEFORMAT=$'\nreal\t%3lR\nuser\t%3lU\nsys\t%3lS'</b>
              <p> The POSIX.2 default time format (used by 'time -p command') 
                is
              <p> <b>TIMEFORMAT=$'real %2R\nuser %2U\nsys %2S'</b>
              <p> The BSD /usr/bin/time format can be emulated with:
              <p> <b>TIMEFORMAT=$'\t%1R real\t%1U user\t%1S sys'</b>
              <p> The System V /usr/bin/time format can be emulated with:
              <p> <b>TIMEFORMAT=$'\nreal\t%1R\nuser\t%1U\nsys\t%1S'</b>
              <p> The ksh format can be emulated with:
              <p> <b>TIMEFORMAT=$'\nreal\t%2lR\nuser\t%2lU\nsys\t%2lS'</b>
            </ul>
            <p> You want the BSD format, so your script would be written as:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/bash
TIMEFORMAT=$'\t%1R real\t%1U user\t%1S sys'
time ls -a</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to get a grasp on 
            the way <b>sendmail</b> 8.12.10 handles things in the <b>accessdb</b> 
            and in what order entries are processed. I want to add some DNSBL 
            entries to the <b>accessdb</b>, but I need to whitelist some people 
            who may use DNSBL addresses. Does <b>accessdb</b> process OK entries 
            before DNSBL entries so I can whitelist these people? Do I just put 
            the <b>accessdb</b> lines in the order I want them processed?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> <b>Sendmail</b> uses rulesets 
              from the <b>sendmail.cf</b> file to process entries from the <b>access.db</b> 
              file (it's just a lookup table for the rulesets). Therefore, 
              specific parts of a message are processed before others. The ordering 
              of lines in the access file is inconsequential and may not correspond 
              to the order in which the entries are read by the rulesets.
            <p> The <b>sendmail</b> rulesets are organized such that, by default, 
              checks on the sender address occur after the check on the connecting 
              machine name/IP. If your LHS specifies a hostname or IP addresses, 
              then your OK will be processed. If your LHS specifies an entire 
              email address (username and machine name), then the mail may be 
              rejected because the DNSBL lookup happens first. Here's an 
              example access file to make that a bit clearer:
            <p> 
            <pre>
that.domain           OK
user@other.domain     OK
</pre>
            If both <b>that.domain</b> and <b>other.domain</b> are listed in the 
            DNSBL you specify in your mc file, then all users from <b>that.domain</b> 
            can send email to your mail server, but no users at <b>other.domain</b> 
            can email you because <b>other.domain</b> is rejected during the connection 
            phase and never gets to the ruleset that checks the sender address.
            <p> To work around this behavior, you can specify <b>delay_checks</b> 
              in your <b>sendmail.mc</b> file and rebuild your <b>sendmail.cf</b> 
              file:
            <p> 
            <pre>
FEATURE('delay_checks')dnl
</pre>
            When <b>delay_checks</b> is specified, the rulesets <b>check_mail</b> 
            and <b>check_relay</b> are no longer called when a client connects 
            or issues a MAIL command, but are instead called by the <b>check_rcpt</b> 
            ruleset. The <b>delay_checks</b> feature can also take an optional 
            argument for friend or hater:
            <p> 
            <pre>
  FEATURE('delay_checks', 'friend')dnl
  FEATURE('delay_checks', 'hater')dnl
</pre>
            A segment from the <b>cf/README</b> file best explains the friend 
            and hater options:
            <p> If such an argument is given, the recipient will be looked up 
              in the access map (using the tag <b>Spam:</b>). If the argument 
              is 'friend', then the default behavior is to apply the 
              other rulesets and make a SPAM <b>friend</b> the exception. The 
              rulesets <b>check_mail</b> and <b>check_relay</b> will be skipped 
              only if the recipient address is found and has RHS FRIEND. If the 
              argument is 'hater', then the default behavior is to skip 
              the rulesets <b>check_mail</b> and <b>check_relay</b> and make a 
              SPAM hater the exception. The other two rulesets will be applied 
              only if the recipient address is found and has RHS HATER.
            <p> This allows for simple exceptions from the tests, e.g., by activating 
              the friend option and having Spam:abuse@ FRIEND in the access map, 
              mail to abuse@localdomain will get through (where "localdomain" 
              is any domain in class {w}).
            <p> A second parameter, <b>n</b>, can be specified with the <b>delay_checks</b> 
              feature to turn off backward compatibility for versions of <b>sendmail</b> 
              prior to 8.12, which used a different syntax:
            <p> 
            <pre>
FEATURE('delay_checks', 'friend', 'n')dnl
</pre>
            <p> or
            <p> 
            <pre>
FEATURE('delay_checks', 'hater', 'n')dnl
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running an Apache Web server 
            on a machine that needs to have all of its Web traffic encrypted. 
            I want to send everything over port 443 and use SSL, but I also need 
            the server to answer on the standard http port (80). What's the 
            best way to get everyone to send encrypted data but still have the 
            server answer to <b>http://www.my.domain</b> requests?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There are a few ways you could 
              go about this, but the easiest way is probably to change the virtual

              https instance on port 443. The virtual host directive for port 
              80 in your httpd.conf would look something like the following:
            <p>

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We run Solaris 8 on a variety of SPARC 
            hardware. Right now, we're using a homegrown script to modify 
            passwords via cfengine. We want to migrate to using LDAP. One of the 
            big blocks has been that we require password aging for various accounts, 
            and support for that only seems to be in Solaris 9. We can't 
            yet upgrade to Solaris 9 because we have applications that require 
            porting. Has anyone backported password aging with LDAP, or is there 
            a good alternative that provides the same functionality?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There's a LDAP patch for 
              Solaris 8, 108993, that includes password aging with pam_ldap. Be 
              sure not to apply version 29 of this patch because it had issues. 
              The latest good revision of this patch is 26, and this is the documenting

              <p> ******************************************************
              <p> Patch 108993-26 was re-instated on Nov 4, 2003
              <p> Reason:<br>
                Patch 108993-29 has been withdrawn:<br>
                After applying patch 108993-29, the init(1M) command will hang 
                <br>
                when changing the system run level to 0, 5 or 6<br>
                (halt, power off, reboot). In addition, it is not possible to 
                log<br>
                |in to the system in single user mode.
              <p> Please reference bug 4947516 for further information.
              <p> Recommendation:<br>
                Backout patch 108993-29 or replace /etc/lib/nss_files.so.1 with 
                an <br>
                older version of /etc/lib/nss_files.so.1 for Solaris 8. This must 
                be <br>
                from patch revision -26 (or earlier).

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I want to replace some text in a bunch 
            of html files using Perl. I issue the following command from the shell

            This should replace the first instance of any stuff prefixed with

baz  bop foo 1234wxyz bar

            Am I specifying the regex incorrectly? I know I've done something 
            very similar to this before and it's worked fine, but I can't 
            find my previous example.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Your regular expression is fine, 
              but your shell is getting in the way. Because you're using 
              double quotes, the <b>$1</b> is being expanded and substituted by 
              the shell. Because your shell has nothing stored in <b>$1</b>, there's 
              nothing to replace it in your output file. Try using single quotes 
              around your Perl command or create a Perl script instead of calling 
              perl from the command line.
