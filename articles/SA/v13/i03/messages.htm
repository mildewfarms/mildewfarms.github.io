              Subject: "Managing System Identity with changeident"
            <p> Ed, thanks to you and John for the <i>Sys Admin</i> article, "Managing 
              System Identity with changeident". It is very timely! I downloaded 
              the source code.
            <p> From your experience, can I expect the list of modules that you've 
              identified for Solaris 5.7 to be the same ones necessary to change 
              the identity of a Solaris 5.8 system?
            <p> Thanks, in advance, for your help.

            <p> <i>
            Mike, thanks for writing and taking an interest in our "changeident" 
            script. I ran this by John and he thinks that as far as changeident 
            is concerned there should be no difference between Solaris 7 and 8. 
            John says "at least as far as he's read".</i>
            <p><i> Also, the modules presented might not agree with your environment 
              or you may have some issue we're not aware of. Obviously, the 
              server should be tested thoroughly. If you happen to find an issue, 
              we'd be interested to know what it is. Perhaps we can share 
              it with other readers.</i>

            To whom it may concern,
            <p> After reviewing Volume 12, Number 12 for December 2003, I have 
              spotted the following minor clerical error in the article "Backup 
              Scripts from UnixReview.com, 3rd Edition" edited by Ed Schaefer:
            <p> Page 28/Page 30, near the top (first code segment) it reads:
            <p> 
            <pre>
dd of=/dev/rmt/0 bs=10k
</pre>
            <p> which is stated that it is used to send the data in 10k blocks. 
              This is correct, as the manual for dd(1) states that bs will force 
              ibs=BYTES and obs=BYTES. However, in the code presented on page 
              30, Listing 1, the command <b>dd</b> uses "obs=10k", which 
              is just for the output bytes versus both output and input. Although 
              both methods can be used, it may be desired to either use "obs" 
              instead of "bs" on page 28, or explain the differences 
              between obs, ibs, and bs so that a reader who may be unfamiliar 
              with the usage of <b>dd</b> would understand the reasons behind 
              why it is different.
            <p> Thanks,<br>

            <p> <i>Hello Ryan,</i>
            <p> <i>Thank you for your comments. As you correctly noted, there's 
              a difference between "dd obs=10k", which will block the 
              output in chunks of 10k, and "dd bs=10k", which will use 
              10k blocks for both input and output. In the article, the important 
              part was to block the output to a tape drive in 10k blocks. Both 
              mentioned usages of <b>dd</b>
            work, although your suggestion of using "obs=10k" in both 
            cases would have been sufficient.</i>

            Dear <i>Sys Admin</i>,
            <p> I don't know how many times I've thought to myself "I 
              should write to <i>Sys Admin</i> and tell them how much I enjoy 
              their publication," but it must be a hundred times. Actually, 
              I feel rather guilty. For years, I eagerly awaited a hand-me-down 
              copy from colleagues. Finally it dawned on me that I should just 
              get a subscription. I think <i>Sys Admin</i> might suffer from this 
              "hand-me-down" problem more than other magazines, because 
              SAs tend to be so closely bound that sharing magazines/scripts/code 
              is quite common.
            <p> I work in a "high performance computing" (HPC) environment, 
              and enjoy all of the articles related to such. <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              has had a nice share of late regarding the topic. Please remember 
              that some solutions do not lend themselves to network distributed 
              computing, and SMP is still quite important despite all the new-found 
              network computing religion. Any articles on optimizing SMP would 
              be appreciated (kernel tuning, monitoring tools).
            <p> Thanks and Best Regards,<br>

            Dear <i>Sys Admin</i>,
            <p> I seem to always pick up great hints from your magazine. In January 
              you provided a really good article by Hal Pomeranz regarding a DNS-based 
              approach to block advertising.
            <p> At the time I was going crazy remotely trying to pick the evil 
              d(a)emons out of my father's PC. He, being the trusting type, 
              followed a URL that led to spyware, annoyware, etc., rendering his 
              computer useless. I'd run AdAware, get rid of 130+ items, and 
              in two hours another run would yield as many. (That's a Win98 
              box, till I can get a new one to him in a few days, which will be 
              Win2K.)
            <p> He has a cable modem, but I have him using my DNS servers here. 
              I looked at the logs from his DNS requests, and made zone files 
              for all of those domains on my server(s). Well, that worked great. 
              The d(a)emons are still running, but can no longer make his computer 
              useless. And I no longer see very many banner ads.
            <p> So, thanks <i>Sys Admin</i> and Hal Pomeranz! This one was a good 
              one, and I'm telling anyone who'll listen.

            <i>Dear Readers,</i>
            <p><i> We received a few letters in response to our February feature 
              "Securing Intranets with IPCop" by Phil Barnett and Bryan 
              Smith. Some of you expressed concern that the SmoothWall project, 
              from which IPCop was forked, and its developers were not acknowledged 
              in that article. Because there have been so many dedicated contributors 
              to these projects over the years, the authors chose to thank all 
              the developers collectively. For more information (including history 
              and names of contributors) for both projects, please see: <b>http://www.ipcop.org</b> 
              and <b>http://www.smoothwall.org</b>.</i>
