            <p> <b>Panda Software Updates Antiviruses for Linux Mail Servers</b>
            <p> Panda Software released new versions of its antiviruses for Linux 
              mail platforms (Sendmail, Qmail, and Postfix). According to the 
              company, Panda SendmailSecure, QmailSecure, and PostfixSecure include 
              new features that make them more powerful and effective, without 
              affecting the performance of Linux servers. The new versions also 
              include the option to scan fragmented messages.
            <p> Panda SendmailSecure, QmailSecure, and PostfixSecure can now detect 
              whether a virus uses the iFRAME/MIME vulnerability exploit, which 
              allows a new malicious code to trick the system using a false MIME 
              header in the message. This feature blocks viruses that can run 
              automatically when the message carrying it is viewed in the preview 
              pane. These products can be managed through Panda Software's 
              new administration console, Panda AdminSecure, which centralizes 
              installation, configuration, and administration of other tasks related 
              to these antivirus solutions in a single computer. Panda SendmailSecure, 
              QmailSecure, and PostfixSecure can be purchased separately or as 
              part of Panda EntepriSecure, Panda Software's security suite 
              for corporate networks. For more information, visit: <i>http://www.pandasoftware.com</i>.

            <p> Cyclades Corporation introduced the AlterPath PM10 and PM20, which 
              enable remote power control of servers and network gear. According 
              to the company, the new products have the industry's highest 
              density for IPDUs for both horizontal and vertical models. When

              PM10 and PM20 can deliver management capabilities and faster problem 
              solving by integrating console access and power control into a single 
              interface. IT professionals can remotely power off, power on, and 
              reboot network devices using the same console management session 
              from any location via telnet, Secure Shell (SSHv2), or through a 
              secure Web session, which can help automate data center operations. 
              The products, which support 120V with 15, 20, or 30 amps, can also 
              provide accurate power measurement of each IPDU so temperature or
