            <p> Beginning next month with the April issue, we will welcome Hal 
              Pomeranz as the new technical editor of <i>Sys Admin</i>. Hal has 
              had a 15-year career in the areas of System and Network Management 
              and Security, and currently runs his own independent consulting 
              practice. He is a Senior Faculty member for the SANS Institute, 
              and is the track coordinator and primary instructor for the SANS/GIAC 
              Unix Security Certification track (GCUX). Hal is also the technical 
              lead in developing the Unix Security Benchmark documents for the 
              Center for Internet Security.
            <p> Hal has been a member of the Board of Directors for the USENIX 
              Association, BayLISA, and BBLISA. He has written or co-written dozens 
              of technical articles and several books, including <i>Solaris Security: 
              Step-by-Step</i> -- an essential guide for "hardening" 
              the Solaris operating system -- and <i>SANS Security Essentials</i>. 
              In 2001, he was given the SAGE Outstanding Achievement Award for 
              his teaching and leadership in the field of systems administration.
            <p> Along with these formidable credentials, Hal brings fresh enthusiasm 
              and ideas to the <i>Sys Admin</i> team, and we feel pleased and 
              fortunate to work with him.
            <p> Joe Casad, our previous technical editor, has served <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              and other publications in various roles during his years with CMP, 
              including Managing Editor of <i>Network Administrator</i> and Senior 
              Editor of <i>C/C++ User's Journal</i>. We're pleased that 
              Joe will be continuing to work with us in yet another capacity, 
              and we welcome him in his new role as a regular contributor to <i>Sys 
              Admin</i>'s online sister publication, UnixReview.com. For 
              a sample of Joe's work, check out his recent review of Lindows 
              at the UnixReview.com Web site.
            <p> Next month, we'll highlight an updated Call for Papers from 
              Hal, but in the meantime, we're looking for article proposals 
              within the topics of Networking and Clustering. Please send your 
              ideas for articles to me or to Rikki Endsley at: <b>rendsley.cmp.com</b>.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> <i><font size="+2">Amber Ankerholz</font></i><font size="+2"><br>
