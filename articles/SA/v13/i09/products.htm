            <P> <B>HP Announced StorageWorks Scalable File Share</B>
            <P> HP announced a file sharing product that uses new Linux clustering 
              technology to deliver up to 100 times more bandwidth than typical 
              clusters. According to the company, HP StorageWorks Scalable File 
              Share (HP SFS) is a self-contained file server that enables bandwidth 
              to be shared by distributing files in parallel across clusters of 
              industry-standard server and storage components. The product is 
              the second based on HP's "storage grid" architecture and the first 
              commercial research product to use a new Linux clustering technology, 
              called Lustre, which was developed through collaboration between 
              HP, the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE), and Cluster File Systems, 
              Inc. HP SFS allows applications to see a single file system image 
              regardless of the number of servers or storage devices connected 
              to it. Built using industry-standard HP ProLiant servers and HP 
              StorageWorks disk arrays, HP SFS provides protection from hardware 
              failures through resilient, redundant hardware and built-in failover 
              and recovery.
