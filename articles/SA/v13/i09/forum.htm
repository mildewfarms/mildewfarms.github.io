            <p> The USENIX Technical Conference was held in Boston this year on 
              June 27 through July 2. Peter Salus, official USENIX historian and 
              contributor to UnixReview.com, was on hand to record events. Salus 
              attended Bruce Schneier's plenary lecture, among others, and noted 
              the following: 
            <P> Schneier began by remarking that this was an "interesting time 
              for security." He went on to say that security is always a trade-off, 
              and "there is no such thing as absolute security".
            <P> He pointed out that all security tradeoffs are subjective and 
              that there is a difference between actual risk and perceived risk. 
              Where perceived risk is concerned, Schneier said "there are two 
              main culprits: the media and technology." (He feels that "if it's 
              in the news, don't worry about it.") 
            <P> Such items as ID cards, fingerprinting foreigners, etc., "are 
              just not worth it." People and institutions have an "agenda" and 
              the result is that "people in power ... make security decisions 
              for non-security reasons." 
            <P> The agenda is changed by government intervention, market forces, 
              and social norms (like advertising or education). To Schneier, the 
              most important element is to "keep trying to educate people." 
            <P> You can read more of Schneier's views on security at:

            Also, don't forget that <I>Sys Admin</I> is sponsoring two tracks 
            at the Software Development Best Practices Conference, which is also 
            in Boston this year, September 20-23, at the Hynes Convention Center.
            <P> The <I>Sys Admin</I> tracks offer several courses within the topics 
              of security and scripting. Hal Pomeranz, our technical editor, will 
              teach two half-day courses -- "How They Do It: Unix Hacking 101" 
              and "Simple Unix Tricks: Spotting Break-ins". In the first course, 
              Hal will cover the various ways hackers break into Unix systems 
              and look at the state of the art in the rootkits that attackers 
              use to escape detection and maintain access after a break-in. In 
              the second course, Hal will present a simple set of checks systems 
              administrators can use to monitor the status of their Unix systems.
            <P> The <I>Sys Admin</I> scripting track offers basic-to-advanced 
              levels of scripting training. Randal Schwartz will be teaching two 
              all-day tutorials -- "Learning Perl" and "Intermediate Perl". In 
              the first course, Randal will show how to use Perl to accomplish 
              many common tasks and lay the groundwork for more advanced study. 
              In the second course, he will cover advanced data structures in 
              Perl and show how to keep your Perl programs running smoothly.
            <P> If you register for a VIP pass to the conference, you can hop 
              tracks and attend <I>Sys Admin</I> courses as well as the Software 
              Development track offerings. This year, the SD Best Practices Conference 
              will provide classes and tutorials in several programming tracks 
              including: Design and Architecture, Requirements and Analysis, Build 
              and Deploy, and Testing and Quality. You can see all the details 
              and register online at: <B>http://www.sdexpo.com</B>. I hope you'll 
              attend.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
