            <p> <i>Sys Admin</i>'s technical editor, Hal Pomeranz, has put together 
              a new call for papers, which I want to highlight this month. As 
              you're probably aware, <i>Sys Admin</i> relies solely on its readers 
              for its content. One of the original marketing tags for the magazine 
              described <i>Sys Admin</i> as the magazine "by and for systems administrators", 
              and that principle has not changed.
            <p> As systems administrators, you probably develop solutions for 
              complex problems on a fairly regular basis. We would like you to 
              think of <i>Sys Admin</i> as both a tool to help you solve those 
              problems and a vehicle to share your solutions with others.
            <p> We are always looking for articles that explore new territories 
              within systems administration -- articles providing solutions to 
              hard problems or illuminating technologies that are poorly understood 
              or poorly documented. If you've been working on a project that breaks 
              new ground or researching a particular tool or technology, please 
              share what you've learned by writing up your findings for <i>Sys 
              Admin</i>.
            <p> Here are a few specific topics on Hal's list:
            <p> <b>Automation</b> -- New tools written in awk, C, Perl, Python, 
              sed, and/or the shell to automate everything from backups to log 
              monitoring to patch installations to remote system management.
            <p> <b>Cutting Edge</b> -- High-performance clusters and extreme computing, 
              IPv6 and mobile networking, emerging wireless standards, massive 
              and distributed storage models, and new methods of spam control.
            <p> <b>Integration</b> -- Robust enterprise solutions with LDAP, Oracle, 
              Websphere, and more. Effective solutions for big enterprises without 
              big resources.
            <p> <b>Open Source</b> -- New uses and cool hacks for established 
              tools like Apache, BIND, MySQL, Samba, Sendmail, and SSH. New tools 
              that have revolutionized the way you do your job.
            <p> <b>Security</b> -- DNSSec, Kerberos, encryption, VPNs and IPSEC, 
              kernel-level security modules, intrusion detection and prevention, 
              trusted computing, auditing.
            <p> For the complete call for papers, see page 32 of this issue. As 
              always, please send proposals and manuscripts to Rikki Endsley at: 
              <b>rendsley@cmp.com</b> and send comments and suggestions to me 
              at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>. We invite you to make <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              your own by contributing your experiences and expertise.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> <i>Amber Ankerholz</i><br>
              Editor in Chief
