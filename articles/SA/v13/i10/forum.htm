            <p> I've already mentioned that <I>Sys Admin</I> is sponsoring 
              scripting and security tracks at this year's SD Best Practices 
              Conference and Expo; once more, I encourage you to attend. Conference 
              highlights include Perl tutorials by Randal Schwartz and security 
              training from Hal Pomeranz. By the time you receive this issue of 
              the magazine, the show will be just a couple weeks away (September 
              20-23 at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston). You can register 
              online at: <B>http://www.sdexpo.com/</B> or register on-site during 
              conference hours.
            <P> There are other conferences of note coming up this fall. SANE 
              2004 (the International System Administration and Network Engineering 
              Conference) will be held September 27-October 1 in Amsterdam, The 
              Netherlands. More information can be found at: <B>http://www.nluug.nl/events/sane2004/</B>.
            <P> The LISA (Large Installation System Administration) 2004 Conference, 
              sponsored by Usenix, will be in Atlanta, Georgia on November 14-19. 
              According to the Web site, this year's program, "System 
              Administration Reality-Automation, Configuration, and Users", 
              includes technical sessions, the 2nd Annual Spam Mini-Symposium, 
              invited talks by industry experts, refereed papers, and more. See: 
              <B>http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa04/</B> for details.
            <P> Also, the SANS Network Security Conference is at the Riviera Hotel 
              &amp; Casino in Las Vegas (September 28-October 4). Hal Pomeranz 
              will be there, too, teaching "Securing Unix/Linux" and 
              covering such topics as: mitigating or eliminating general problems 
              that apply to all Unix-like operating systems including vulnerabilities 
              in the password authentication system, file system, virtual memory 
              system, and in network protocols such as NFS, NIS, and the Unix 
              RPC mechanism. Hal will also provide specific advice for securing 
              some of the most common Internet services on the Unix platform, 
              including Apache, WU-FTPD, Sendmail, and BIND.
            <P> Note that a good working knowledge of Unix is required to attend 
              Hal's security courses at the SANS conference. According to 
              the SANS Web site, most students attending this track have a minimum 
              of 3-5 years of Unix systems administration experience. If you're 
              wondering about your level of experience, SANS provides an online 
              quiz through which you can test your knowledge of Unix security 
              basics at: <B>http://www.sans.org/conference/unix_quiz.php</B>.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
