              and Answers</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running Solaris 8 on an E420R. 
              Looking through process listings, I note that sometimes ps runs 
              as root, and sometimes it runs as a normal user. My own ps process 
              is always run by me, so I'm wondering if these other users have 
              somehow cracked root or something. I took a look at both /usr/bin/ps 
              and /usr/ucb/ps just to make sure that one of them was not SUID 
              root, and neither is:
            <p> 
            <pre>
-r-xr-xr-x   39 root     bin      5256 Jan  5  2000 /usr/bin/ps
-r-xr-xr-x   39 root     bin      5256 Jan  5  2000 /usr/ucb/ps
</pre>
            I also looked at the checksums on both ps binaries to make sure that 
            they match what came off the install media (to verify that neither 
            was trojaned). Everything checks out ok, so I'm wondering if there's 
            another copy of ps floating around somewhere or something more insidious.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you're running Solaris 8, 
              /usr/ucb/ps is just a wrapper that calls the appropriate version 
              of ps based on the version of SPARC hardware. If you look at /usr/ucb/sparcv7 
              and/or /usr/ucb/sparcv9, you'll see that the ps binary contained 
              within is SUID root. This is not to say that you haven't been cracked, 
              but if this is your only indication, then most likely you don't 
              have anything to worry about.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Since Verisign has put in wildcard 
              records for .com and .net, a bunch of our spam filtering has broken. 
              How can I fix things and ignore their bogus wildcard entry?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Various DNS software developers 
              have put out patches to their software to ignore the wildcard redirect. 
              If you're running BIND, you can install 9.2.2-P3 and use delegation-only 
              for .com and .net:
            <p> 
            <pre>
zone "com" { type delegation-only; };
zone "net" { type delegation-only; };
</pre>
            You can also install BIND 9.2.3rc4 and use the option <b>root-delegation-only</b>. 
            It takes an exclude argument so you can specify domains that are trusted 
            to give undelegated responses:
            <p> 
            <pre>
options {
 root-delegation-only exclude { "de"; "lv"; "museum"; "us"; };
};
</pre>
            If you're running DJB's dnscache, there's a patch at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://tinydns.org/djbdns-1.05-ignoreip2.patch
</pre>
            After patching, recompiling, and installing the new dnscache, configure 
            it to ignore Verisign's redirector by listing the IP in the file /service/dnscache/env/IGNOREIP:
            <p> 
            <pre>
echo 64.94.110.11 &gt;/service/dnscache/env/IGNOREIP
svc -t /service/dnscache
</pre>
            The page containing the patch also shows how to ignore various other 
            TLDs who use wildcards.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'd like to use a USB scanner 
              on FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE, but I'm not having much success finding out 
              what may or may not be supported. Is there a reference anywhere?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> USB scanners are handled via

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just compiled and installed the 
            latest version of OpenSSH on a Solaris 8 machine. I compiled with 
            TCP wrapper support (extended syntax), so I could limit connections 
            from /etc/hosts.deny. Here's how I configured OpenSSH:
            <p> 
            <pre>
./configure --with-random=/dev/urandom --with-tcp-wrappers \
  --with-ssl-dir=/usr/local/lib --with-default-path=/usr/bin:/ \
  usr/ucb:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/libexec:/  \
  bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/openwin/bin
</pre>
            Here's my /etc/hosts.deny:
            <p> 
            <pre>
# sshd : LOCAL 192.168.1. : ALLOW
imapd : LOCAL 192.168.1. : ALLOW
imapd : ALL : banners /usr/local/etc/banners : DENY
ALL : ALL : banners /usr/local/etc/banners : DENY
</pre>
            I started up sshd with the debug flag and tried to ssh in from localhost 
            and got the following on the server side:
            <p> 
            <pre>
sshd -d -d -d
debug2: read_server_config: filename /usr/local/etc/sshd_config
debug1: sshd version OpenSSH_3.7.1p2
debug1: private host key: #0 type 0 RSA1
debug3: Not a RSA1 key file /usr/local/etc/ssh_host_dsa_key.

debug1: private host key: #1 type 2 DSA
debug3: Not a RSA1 key file /usr/local/etc/ssh_host_rsa_key.
debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA
debug1: private host key: #2 type 1 RSA
debug1: Bind to port 22 on ::.
Server listening on :: port 22.
</pre>
            On the client side I got:
            <p> 
            <pre>
# ssh -v localhost
OpenSSH_3.7.1p2, SSH protocols 1.5/2.0, OpenSSL 0.9.7c 30 Sep 2003

debug1: ssh_exchange_identification: No access

ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
debug1: Calling cleanup 0x2cda4(0x0)
</pre>
            Now, if I change my /etc/hosts.deny to allow any access for sshd, 
            it works:
            <p> 
            <pre>
sshd : ALL : ALLOW
</pre>
            But when I use tcpdmatch to make sure that TCP wrappers is functioning 
            properly, my initial /etc/hosts.deny looks like it should work just 
            fine:
            <p> 
            <pre>
tcpdmatch sshd localhost
warning: sshd: no such process name in /etc/inet/inetd.conf
client:   hostname localhost
client:   address  127.0.0.1
server:   process  sshd
matched:  /etc/hosts.deny line 1
option:   ALLOW
access:   granted
</pre>
            I tried running truss on sshd, too, but that just showed it opening 
            /etc/hosts.deny and then pitching back to my banner message. I'm rather 
            at a loss here, and am not sure what to try next. Have I configured 
            ssh wrong for my platform? Is TCP wrappers the culprit? Have I found 
            a bug?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The key to identifying your problem 
              lies in your sshd debug statements. When you start up sshd, it claims 
              that it's binding to ::, an IPv6 address, but it never says anything 
              about starting a service on 127.0.0.1, an IPv4 address. On the other 
              hand, your hosts.deny file explicitly names IPv4 addresses. I would 
              guess that your sshd_config file contains the line:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ListenAddress ::
</pre>
            I would also guess that it does NOT contain the following line, or 
            else it's commented out:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
</pre>
            If you want to use IPv4 access restrictions, you must have an IPv4 
            statement (or comment out both statements to use the default of running 
            both) in sshd_config.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an APC UPS in which the 
              batteries died. I replaced the batteries, charged them up for a 
              day, and then tested them by hitting the test button and unplugging 
              the wall power. Instead of keeping steady power, it turned off and 
              back on a couple times! I powercycled it and the UPS seemed very 
              unhappy. Unfortunately, I don't have a spare UPS of this type to 
              test things in, so I can't be sure it's a bad battery or a bad UPS. 
              Can you tell from my description what the problem might be?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Your description is pretty vague, 
              but if you've just replaced the batteries in your UPS, there's a 
              good chance that you'll need to readjust the microprocessor that 
              controls the batteries by performing a runtime calibration. Once 
              you've charged the batteries, attach a non-critical load of at least 
              30% to the UPS. Be sure the load is non-critical, because the power 
              to the device(s) will be shut off when the batteries are drained.
            <p> Once you have the 30+% load attached, unplug the wall power from 
              the UPS. Allow the battery to drain until it shuts off completely. 
              Then plug the UPS back into the wall, turn it off, and let it recharge 
              fully. While APC only discusses going through this process once, 
              I've heard from several people that it may take several iterations 
              of charge/discharge to get a reasonably accurate calibration of 
              remaining battery life.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> With the recent flood of worms 
              and viruses, our mail server is consuming a lot of space/bandwidth 
              sending back big bounced messages. The worst is when the return 
              address is invalid, and the bounce message just sits in our queue 
              until it expires. Is there a way to tell sendmail (8.12.10) to bounce 
              only the headers and an explanation and not to include the entire 
              message body?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can make sendmail include 
              only headers of the original message in the bounce by adding nobodyreturn 
              to the PrivacyOptions setting. In your mc file, add the following 
              line:
            <p> 
            <pre>
define('confPRIVACY_FLAGS', 'nobodyreturn')dnl
</pre>
            If you already have confPRIVACY_FLAGS defined, you can add nobodyreturn 
            to the existing options, separated by a comma:
            <p> 
            <pre>
define('confPRIVACY_FLAGS', 'nobodyreturn,authwarnings,noexpn,novrfy')dnl
</pre>
            Rebuild sendmail.cf and HUP sendmail so that you read the new configuration 
            file.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a SunFire V880, which I've 
              halted. Normally at the ok prompt, I see:
            <p> 
            <pre>
{2} ok
</pre>
            This time, when I halted the machine, it said:
            <p> 
            <pre>
{3} ok
</pre>
            I'm wondering what the significance of the number is and whether it 
            has anything to do with performance problems we've been having with 
            the machine recently.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The number to the left of the 
              ok prompt is the CPU that the machine's OpenBoot process is currently 
              executing on. This allows you to run/debug code on a specific CPU. 
              You can switch the current CPU by using the <b>switch-cpu</b> command. 
              The following would change the current CPU to 2:
            <p> 
            <pre>
2 switch-cpu
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'd like to do some I/O benchmarking 
            on one of our FreeBSD development boxes. I suspect that the JBOD RAID 
            we have attached to the machine is performing poorly. Do you have 
            any software suggestions to help me out?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You might look at the Bonnie 
              (written in C by Tim Bray) or Bonnie++ (written in C++ by Russell 
              Coker) benchmark suites. If you're using the FreeBSD ports collection, 
              these two programs can be found in /usr/ports/benchmarks/bonnie 
              and /usr/ports/benchmarks/bonnie++, respectively. The Web sites 
              for each are as follows:

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have various files with embedded 
            URLs that I'd like to extract. Is there a program or a simple regexp 
            I can use to grep these files and output just the data I want?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> URLs are difficult to identify 
              because there are various types and syntaxes to deal with. For a 
              good discussion on Perl regular expressions that match URLs, take 
              a look at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.foad.org/~abigail/Perl/url2.html
</pre>
            the resulting regular expression at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.foad.org/~abigail/Perl/url3.regex
</pre>
            and the program at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.foad.org/~abigail/Perl/url3.pl
</pre>
            If your definition of URL incorrectly includes things like www.my.domain/foo.html, 
            then it's going to be next to impossible come up with a foolproof 
            method of extracting that data.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to do some log rotation 
              via root's crontab entry:
            <p> 
            <pre>
0 5 * * * /usr/bin/mv /var/log/testlog \
  /var/log/testlog-`/ usr/bin/date +%Y%m%d.%H%M'
</pre>
            Every time this runs via cron, I wind up with /var/log/testlog- and 
            there's no date appended. If I run the same command from an interactive 
            shell, things seem to go just fine. I'm guessing that there's some 
            weird interaction here (maybe because there's no controlling tty? 
            Can you spot something wrong with that command?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Cron uses the percent (%) character 
              as a separator between code executed by the shell and command arguments. 
              Here's an excerpt from the Solaris man page for crontab:
            <p> Only the first line (up to a ' or end of line) of the command 
              field is executed by the shell. Other lines are made available to 
              the command as standard input.
            <p> You can escape the percent symbols with backslashes (\) to have 
              your command run correctly, or you can put your command into a shell 
              script that is called from cron as a workaround.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running OS X 10.2.8 and I 
              spend most of my time in X. I come from a FreeBSD background, and 
              I'm really missing ctwm and the ability to have root window menus. 
              Has anyone created a window manager that's got virtual screens and 
              can do root window menus?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Annoyingly, OS X is designed 
              not to have such a thing as a root window (if you click on the root 
              window, you just get the finder). What I use as a decent compromise 
              is blackbox-rootless (built and installed via fink). It has virtual 
              windows and a pop-up bar (like the dock) from which you can invoke 
              menus and switch virtual screens. It's not as good as having root 
              menus, but it's the best I've found so far at simulating that functionality.
