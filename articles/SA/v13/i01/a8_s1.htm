            <h1><b>MRTG Front-End Options</b></h1>
            <p> The simplest (and oldest) is indexmaker, which is included in 
              the stock MRTG distribution. Indexmaker simply scans the MRTG configuration 
              file and writes a single Web page that lists monitored variables 
              with human-readable names. Although this is useful for a small number 
              of systems, it is unwieldy for more than about a dozen data stores, 
              since there is very little visual differentiation between each link.
            <p> Another option is BBMRTG, which integrates into Big Brother, an 
              event monitoring system. Where MRTG provides baselines and service 
              metrics, Big Brother provides event logging and notification, and 
              is often used in parallel with MRTG to detect outages. For sites 
              already using Big Brother, this is an excellent method for integrating 
              the data streams, but BBMRTG is not of general use as it does not 
              stand alone.
            <p> To provide a more general interface, 14all (pronounced "one for 
              all") was created, which runs as a CGI script and provides a more 
              flexible view of the data. In fact, it completely sidesteps the 
              MRTG-created files and makes its own, allowing much more flexibility. 
              Newer versions of 14all use the RRDTool file format; thus, it is 
              no longer as useful if you need to keep using the old text format.
            <p> Another program, MRTG Viewer, is also a standalone front-end. 
              It is an impressively detailed front-end, and includes CGI scripts 
              to ping or traceroute to down hosts, as well as collecting statistics 
              on the times that the link was unreachable. However, it needs PostgreSQL 
              installed, so that it can store certain statistics. Although MRTG 
              Viewer is an excellent tool, it is not trivial to install into an 
              already configured MRTG deployment, and requires another system 
              service to maintain.
            <p> Finally, there is the Ops Control Panel (or OCP), the subject 
              of this article.
