            January is traditionally our Open Source issue, and this year is no 
            exception. In this issue, Ralf Spenneberg explains how to use User-Mode 
            Linux (UML) to model a network and emulate a testbed for a VPN solution. 
            John Berninger describes the "Current" project -- an open source update 
            server for downloading and installing system updates and new packages 
            for Red Hat Linux. Randal Schwartz, in his Perl Advisor column, explores 
            the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) and shows how easy it 
            can be to use and to contribute code. Schwartz says the CPAN "is a 
            wonderful place, full of contributed items for you to use, such as 
            scripts and modules. Modules are the core of the CPAN: little building 
            blocks for you to include into your applications." 
            <p> <i>Sys Admin</i> works on pretty much the same principle as the 
              CPAN and other open source repositories. The magazine was originally 
              founded as a "forum" for systems administrators to share scripts 
              and problem-solving techniques. The practical solutions and scripts 
              contributed by authors and readers are the core of this magazine, 
              and all of those scripts are available for download from the code 
              archive on our Web site. I invite you not only to use the code from 
              the archive, but also to contribute to it. Of course, the best way 
              to contribute is to write an article for the magazine. <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              is always looking for articles to help admins understand and implement 
              new technologies, improve their skills, and increase the security 
              and performance of their systems. That means we need administrators 
              to share their solutions with fellow readers by contributing articles. 
              The themes for the upcoming months include Storage, Remote Access, 
              and Networking, but you can always choose the topic you know best.
            <p> On another note, I would like to include the "Letters" section 
              in the magazine more often, which means I need to receive some letters 
              from readers. Your letter need not be verbose -- you can just drop 
              me a few lines saying what you liked about a recent article, correct 
              an error you may have detected in someone's code, or suggest a topic 
              you'd like the magazine to cover. One reader wrote to tell me that 
              he'd like to see additional coverage of OpenLDAP and PHP. What would 
              you like to see?
            <p> Please send your article proposals to our managing editor, Rikki 
              Endsley at: <b>rendsley@cmp.com</b>. As always, send letters (suggestions, 
              feedback, compliments, flames, recipes, etc.) to me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> 
            <p> Amber Ankerholz<br>
