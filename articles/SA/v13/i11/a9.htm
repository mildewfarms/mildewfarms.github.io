              Salary Survey Results</B></h1>
            <P> <I>Rob Kolstad</i>
            <p> The annual SAGE salary survey results for the calendar year 2003 
              have been tabulated. More than 4,000 participants provided a host 
              of information, including age, benefits, certifications, education, 
              experience, focus, geography, hours worked, hours of training, industry, 
              length of employment, recent pay increases, SAGE admin level, salary 
              and bonuses, travel, and a dozen other kinds of data.
            <P> The responses broke out into several different types of jobs: 
              Databases, Desktop, Generalist, Help Desk, Networking, People Management, 
              Project Management, Security, Server Management, Technical Lead, 
              and Other.
            <P> Figure 1 shows the breakdown of the respondents. More than 95% 
              of those participating were men -- up from 93% for 2002 and 
              88.4% for 2001. Some speculate that women may be more "private" 
              with their salary information.
            <P> The average reported salary for the 3,004 respondents using U.S. 
              dollars as their currency was $66,557 (slightly down from last year's 
              $67,675): $66,612 for men (down from 2002's $67,920) and $65,432 
              (up from 2002's $64,946) for women. The overall median was 
              $62,500 (down from 2002's $65,000) and coincided with the median 
              for all men. The median for women was slightly higher at $65,000, 
              up from 2002's $63,000. These numbers do not factor in experience 
              and therefore should not be used as a general comparison of anything.
            <P> The average salary change for those 3,184 full-time respondents 
              with salary changes from -30% to 30% (from all nations and currencies) 
              was 4.88%. 10.8% earned less in 2003 than in 2002; 15.4% received 
              a raise of 0-0.99%. Of those 74.6% who increased their salaries 
              30% or less, the average increase was 8.18%.
            <P> The chart of salary change (Figure 2) is interesting for its bell-curve 
              shape, with a large number of people at "no salary change". 
              The chart shows that the notion that computer administrators are 
              losing out in the salary race is probably not a valid one. While 
              the boom years of the dot-com era with huge increases just from 
              changing employers are gone, the profession appears to be on solid 
              footing, with raises as good as almost any other industry.
            <P> It has been said in the past that systems administration is a 
              young person's game. Figure 1 shows the concentration of admins 
              in various age groups. 13.5% of the respondents were 24 years of 
              age or younger; 29.6% were 35 or older. 56.9% were in the "golden 
              middle" that includes the ages 25-34. It's easy to observe 
              the concentration in that 25-34 age group. The smaller number of 
              "under 25" suggests that fewer admins are moving into 
              the field or that admins are staying in school. Of course, other 
              explanations abound, especially since the dot-com boom might have 
              inflated the 25-29 age group.
            <P> Managers often look to SAGE for a "universal constant" 
              that is the number of admins required per full-time-equivalent user. 
              This year's survey again collected data from which to estimate 
              this elusive value. The answer is, "it depends". A site 
              with resource-intensive users might require far more admins than, 
              for example, Ebay, which has a huge number of users but a smaller 
              admin ratio, since the users are generally exploiting a single application.
            <P> The breakdown shows a bell-shaped distribution when plotted against 
              a logarithmic scale for the number of users (see Figure 3).
            <P> Dozens of charts, graphs, and statistics like these are available 
              in the full SAGE Salary Survey document, which is available to SAGE 
              members at the SAGE Web site (<B>http://www.sage.org</B>). SAGE 
              is very economical to join, so the document is not sold separately.
