              Planning: Lessons Learned from the 9/11 Tragedy </B></h1>
            <P> <I>Lisa M. Jaworski</i>
            <p> The terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, resulted 
              in terrible human loss. Additionally, many buildings were destroyed 
              or damaged to the extent that they had to be condemned. From an 
              Information Technology (IT) perspective, networks were brought down, 
              equipment and cabling were obliterated, and on-site and local backup 
              tapes were destroyed. Because of the lengthy, ensuing chaos in the 
              local area, it was very difficult for businesses, whose key IT functions 
              were disabled, to bring disaster recovery personnel into the area. 
              An unknown number of users lost Internet connectivity because their 
              Internet Service Providers (ISPs) had points of presence in the 
              World Trade Center [14].
            <P> Most of the information published on the Internet about contingency 
              planning focuses on the overall process. Plan templates are available 
              and, although a few articles on lessons learned from the events 
              of 9/11 appear, they do not focus on practical plan development 
              and implementation issues. They rehash what is already considered 
              to be industry best practices. Other related articles focus on the 
              need for insurance. For example, event insurance for invitation-only 
              events such as corporate conferences should be considered [5]. Proper 
              insurance coverage is certainly necessary, but the scope of contingency 
              planning lessons must be much wider in scope.
            <P> This article documents as many of the practical, hands-on lessons 
              learned as possible. Much of this information was made available 
              through personal conversations with senior and mid-level IT managers 
              responsible for contingency planning in their respective organizations. 
              Both government and private perspectives were gathered.
            <P> <B>Lessons Learned</B>
            <P> The following paragraphs discuss contingency planning concerns 
              that were not generally considered part of industry best practices 
              before the 9/11 tragedy. The order in which these concerns are presented 
              is not indicative of their importance. This article assumes that 
              existing best practices related to contingency planning are already 
              in place (e.g., those published by the National Institute of Standards 
              and Technology (NIST) and others [2, 6, 11, 12]). Some examples 
              of best practices are the availability of detailed, written procedures 
              for configuring servers, up-to-date call lists, and an established 
              order of priority for restoring systems.
            <P> <B>Locate Backup Facilities in Different Geographic Regions</B>
            <P> It might seem obvious that backup facilities should be located 
              in a different geographic region than the primary facility, but 
              this was evidently not considered standard practice before 9/11. 
              NetworkWorld Fusion reported that while Genuity has a backup facility, 
              at the time of the tragedy it was located only 12 miles away from 
              the primary facility [14]. Such close proximity invites vulnerability, 
              depending on the nature of the disaster scenario. A disaster that 
              affects the primary site could easily affect the backup site. For 
              this reason, international service provider Equant maintains Network 
              Operation Centers (NOCs) in Reston, VA, Paris, France, and Singapore 
              [14].
            <P> Although the federal government now wants a minimum distance of 
              300 miles between primary and backup facilities, some agencies are 
              resisting this idea because of the high cost associated with establishing 
              a geographically removed site. Note that regional data centers require 
              their own contingency plans and these must be coordinated with overall 
              enterprise-level plans [6]. To preclude the possibility of a directed 
              attack, either network- or physically based, some government agencies 
              and companies (e.g., AT&amp;T) do not publicly reveal the location 
              of their backup sites [14].
            <P> <B>Organize an Alternate, Geographically Separated Response Team</B>
            <P> Quite often, organizations will identify candidates for disaster 
              recovery teams from among the individuals who live in the immediate 
              geographic area as the facility or facilities for which the plan 
              is written and who already work for, or support, that facility. 
              This certainly makes good common sense; however, if there is widespread 
              death resulting from a catastrophic event in this location, the 
              people comprising the response teams may very well be among those 
              who are killed or disabled.
            <P> Disruptions or gaps in the regular chain of command should be 
              anticipated [8]. Even if this worst-case scenario does not occur, 
              the on-site workers may not be mentally ready to do their jobs, 
              as was the case for many people in the Ground Zero area [3, 9]. 
              Organizations should establish two teams of individuals to fill 
              these roles -- one in the immediate vicinity and the other located 
              at least 100 miles away from the primary facility. This team would 
              be different from one that would be in place at an alternate hot, 
              warm, or cold site. This team's function would be identical 
              to that of the people who would normally be on-site at the primary 
              facility.
            <P> The idea is to for the second team to be located close enough 
              so they can travel to the facility without undue difficulty, yet 
              far enough away that they are unlikely to be victims of the catastrophe. 
              Training should be identical for both teams and both should be involved 
              in the annual testing of the organizations' contingency-related 
              plans, processes, and procedures. Driving directions to the facility 
              to be used by the second team should be reviewed as part of the 
              annual test. This team, as well as the primary on-site team, should 
              have building and site maps that show utility shut-off points, gas 
              lines, exits, stairways, designated escape routes, restricted areas, 
              and high-value items [13]. It is imperative that these maps be tightly 
              held and protected as company confidential.
            <P> <B>Identify Alternate, Geographically Separated Storage and Staging 
              Areas</B>
            <P> For reasons similar to those necessitating a second response team, 
              organizations should identify a second local off-site storage area 
              for backup tapes and critical hardware items. It should be located 
              at least 100 miles away from the site being supported. This storage 
              facility should be in the same general area as the alternate local 
              response team. Many establishments keep backup tapes in the same 
              city or town as the facility at which they would be used.
            <P> This practice should be continued because close proximity of the 
              backups to the facility will allow a faster recovery time. However, 
              if a catastrophic event is so widespread that several square miles 
              in the city or town are affected, the local off-site storage facility 
              might also be affected. This was the case with Verizon after the 
              9/11 attacks [7]. MasterCard stated after 9/11 that it would locate 
              backups within three to four hours driving range [9]. If a private 
              corporation is highly IT dependent and its primary facility and 
              all of its backups are destroyed, it is highly likely that the firm 
              will be forced to go out of business.
            <P> If the disaster scenario necessitates the activation of the alternate 
              response team, as discussed above, then it logically follows that 
              this team will need a local staging area. Assuming that the alternate 
              team will be driving to the primary site, they will need an area 
              to assemble equipment and load it into their vehicles. For convenience, 
              the staging area should be close to the alternate local off-site 
              storage facility. Depending on the nature of the emergency, the 
              team may need to stay at the primary facility for an extended time 
              period, so they will need to bring extra luggage for clothes and 
              possibly food, water, and temporary shelter-related items.
            <P> The team should bring everything to the staging area and check 
              each item off a list before loading it. AT&amp;T reported that staff 
              drove to New York from as far away as Jacksonville, Florida [14]. 
              Kemper Casualty Company had computer and telephone technicians drive 
              from Illinois to New Jersey with tools and equipment such as telephone 
              switch parts and server components [8]. If the organization's 
              IT budget permits, organizations should consider employing mobile 
              backup facilities [13].
            <P> <B>Establish a Senior Management Help Desk</B>
            <P> Quickly establishing a senior management help desk after a disaster 
              is important for several reasons. First, it provides a fallback 
              set of managers that the disaster recovery team can contact in the 
              event that key local managers or recovery team members are missing 
              from the recovery management chain, as documented in the contingency 
              plan, due to injury or death. Second, such a help desk facilitates 
              quick decision making, which is needed in a crisis. For instance, 
              being able to get fast management approval on purchasing requests 
              can be important to meeting established recovery time frames. This 
              help desk would also serve as the focal point for the media. Finally, 
              this help desk serves to keep the recovery teams focused on the 
              established recovery priorities.
            <P> Even the very best contingency plan will not address every issue 
              that can come up during an emergency. This is the nature of Murphy's 
              Law. The senior management help desk will be able to review proposed 
              solutions to such issues and ensure that they are consistent with 
              the other recovery efforts. Note that this is actually a lesson 
              learned from the United States House of Representatives after the 
              anthrax attacks, rather than the 9/11 tragedy.
            <P> <B>Identify Alternate Vendors and Shipping Routes</B>
            <P> Companies should establish "quick ship" contracts with 
              vendors for product and equipment replacements in the event of an 
              emergency [3]. They should also anticipate that vendors may be saturated 
              in an emergency situation, so they should identify alternate vendors 
              and establish "as needed" contracts with them. Vendor 
              contact information and contract numbers must be maintained. If 
              a small local vendor is used, organizations should inquire as to 
              their contingency preparations. It should be expected that a vendor 
              would divulge information only if a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) 
              is in place. It is quite possible that the same disaster scenarios 
              will affect these companies, just as they affect the organizations 
              they support.
            <P> Organizations also need to prepare a prioritized list of the equipment 
              types and vendors they use to support each equipment category. According 
              to NetworkWorld Fusion, some industry analysts say that up to 60% 
              of an organization's critical data is stored on individual 
              laptops and desktops [13]. After 9/11, SunGard confirmed that peripherals 
              such as printers were commonly overlooked [3]. The lack of certain 
              equipment, however mundane (e.g., copiers) can affect productivity. 
              Kemper Casualty Company stated that they were able to get immediate 
              delivery of 100 laptops and 200 monitors from their vendor, along 
              with printers and fax machines [8]. In the first three weeks after 
              9/11, Compaq shipped 2,500 PCs to Lehman Brothers [4].
            <P> <B>Assess Locations of Carrier Circuits</B>
            <P> The potential for carrier failures should be addressed in an organization's 
              overall network strategy as well as its contingency plan. Equant 
              lost connectivity to Canada after the 9/11 attacks because the circuit 
              they had purchased for network diversity reasons was routed through 
              Wall Street; however, it was also connected to Toronto and Montreal 
              [14]. Equant stated that they did not know this was the case before 
              9/11. Equant has since reexamined local connectivity for all of 
              its networks [14].
            <P> <B>Redundancy and Data Mirroring Are Crucial to High-Availability 
              Systems</B>
            <P> Assuming that an organization's IT budget can accommodate 
              the high cost of redundancy for its high availability systems, this 
              is key to fast recovery time. Lehman Brothers was able to recover 
              its IT capabilities quickly after the 9/11 attacks because they 
              had redundant networks in both Manhattan and New Jersey [4]. "Every 
              application that ran in New York also ran in New Jersey. All wide-area 
              links were completely duplicated." They had lost access to 
              everything in New York, but were able to access all of their other 
              branches through New Jersey [4].
            <P> CBS Marketwatch.com has said that the 9/11 property loss changed 
              their views on data replication [3]. "The data for their live 
              tickers used to flow into one data center. Now it flows into all 
              three." Southwestern Bell has installed SONET rings and multiple 
              OC-12 links for redundancy [9]. Upon post-9/11 review of its contingency 
              plans, MasterCard expects to expand its use of data mirroring, real-time 
              data duplication, much more significantly [9]. Their goal is to 
              reduce recovery time from 24 hours to two hours [9].
            <P> <B>Establish an Emergency Communication Plan</B>
            <P> Telephone service was down in many areas on the day of the tragedy, 
              either because wires were down or because service requests saturated 
              the system, as was the case with cell phones. Many organizations 
              reported that BlackBerry wireless devices were their only effective 
              means of communicating for several days following the 9/11 tragedy. 
              Bob Schwartz, managing director and Chief Technology Officer for 
              Lehman Brothers during the tragedy, said that as he went down the 
              stairs in Tower One, all he had to activate the disaster recovery 
              plan and alert other managers was his BlackBerry pager [4].
            <P> Organizations need to consider how key members of the management 
              staff and the response team could communicate if phones are out 
              and the email system is unavailable. BlackBerries have proven to 
              be an effective alternative, but organizations should continually 
              monitor the marketplace to identify other options, too. The main 
              point is that organizations cannot rely on phones and email only. 
              At this time, it is unclear whether BlackBerries would become less 
              effective as a means of emergency communication as the market saturates. 
              It should be noted that the BlackBerry uses a store and forward 
              communication method; they keep trying to send a message even if 
              the sender is not continually pressing the send button. Whatever 
              type of device is selected, inter- and intra-team communications 
              with them should be tested as part of the overall contingency plan 
              testing process.
            <P> Minimally, senior managers and all members of the disaster recovery 
              teams should be assigned some sort of backup communication device. 
              Senior managers in the Human Resources Department should be included 
              on the distribution list for these devices so they can begin making 
              arrangements for counseling and other forms of employee assistance 
              in the wake of a disaster or catastrophic event. Human Resources 
              can assist with contingency plan formulation by identifying resources 
              in the local community, such as public safety and utilities, as 
              well as a list of mental health professionals who can assist with 
              post-disaster counseling.
            <P> Utilization of local hotels as emergency work areas should not 
              be overlooked. Lehman Brothers used Sheraton Manhattan to give their 
              people a place to work [4]. The hotel's ballroom became an 
              IT hub with Virtual Private Network (VPN) connectivity to New Jersey. 
              Human Resources can also distribute wallet-size emergency phone 
              numbers for personnel and their families and instruct employees 
              on the need for personal emergency plans and kits, as described 
              below.
            <P> <B>Do Not Assume Air Transportation Will Be Available</B>
            <P> All U.S. planes were grounded for several days after the 9/11 
              attacks and international planes attempting to enter U.S. airspace 
              were turned away. Many organizations' contingency plans relied 
              on the assumption that airlines would be operational to transport 
              both people and equipment, as needed. MasterCard is one firm that 
              had assumed this, and they reportedly are now updating contingency 
              plans to account for a potential lack of air travel [9]. Other means 
              of transportation such as rail and trucking lines were not identified 
              much less contracted.
            <P> This issue also pertains to vendor shipping routes. Long-distance 
              driving directions for key organizational managers and disaster 
              recovery team members were typically not available or, if they were, 
              they were not verified as part of the contingency plan testing process. 
              The lesson here is that multiple means of transportation need to 
              be identified and contracted for on an as-needed, emergency basis.
            <P> <B>Identify a Meeting Place Away from Your Facility</B>
            <P> Many businesses that operated in the World Trade Center had established 
              meeting areas at which personnel would gather after evacuating their 
              offices so that managers could take a head count of work force members 
              and subsequently alert authorities if anyone was missing. In many 
              cases, the meeting spot was in the basement of the building. It 
              would appear that the idea of the whole building collapsing did 
              not seem significant but, unfortunately, we now know that this is 
              a viable scenario. Emergency meeting spots should be at least a 
              block or two away from the office building to preclude people from 
              being injured in a structural collapse.
            <P> <B>Conduct Monthly Evacuation Drills</B>
            <P> Evacuation drills, often referred to as fire drills, should be 
              conducted periodically, and the feasibility of the assigned meeting 
              spot(s) should be evaluated after such drills. Drills should be 
              both announced and unannounced. As an organization grows, additional 
              meeting spots may be needed. It is suggested that announced drills 
              be conducted monthly. In his book <I>The Myth of Homeland Security</I>, 
              Marcus Ranum states that the discipline of constant drills will 
              stand you in good stead even in a completely different kind of emergency 
              [15].
            <P> <B>Everyone Needs a Personal Emergency Plan</B>
            <P> In the confusion after the attacks, many parents could not get 
              to their children's daycare centers to pick up their kids. 
              Because phone service was largely unavailable, the parents could 
              not call each other to see if one of them had the kids. To help 
              reduce these types of uncertainties, each household should have 
              a personal emergency plan [1]. Such a plan would identify a meeting 
              spot outside of the house; location of emergency bug-out kit; location 
              of will, trust documents, and other important papers; copies of 
              medical prescriptions; lists of each person's allergies; and 
              anything else that would be needed in an emergency.
            <P> An out-of-state third party should be identified to serve as a 
              message relay center for the family members. If cell phones are 
              down, a parent could get on a land line and leave messages with 
              this third party. Each adult family member should have a will, which 
              should identify guardians for the children in the event that both 
              parents are killed, durable power of attorney for healthcare, and 
              one for financial decisions. Each family member should also have 
              a wallet-sized card that has all important phone numbers on it as 
              well as current photographs of the other family members.
            <P> <B>All Personnel Need Emergency Kits</B>
            <P> Many survivors of the 9/11 tragedy were horribly burned and, at 
              the time of this writing, some continue to face additional surgeries 
              and rehabilitation therapy. Organizations must educate employees 
              on the need for employees to put together a portable emergency kit 
              that they can keep in their work areas. Such a kit should contain 
              a personal-sized fire extinguisher, fire blanket, flashlight and 
              batteries, an escape ladder, safety glasses, bottle of water, mask 
              to help prevent smoke inhalation injuries, detailed street map of 
              the city or town, first aid kit, and other appropriate items. These 
              should all fit into a large tote bag that a person can grab and 
              run with.
            <P> As part of its responsibility in this area, organizations should 
              hold quarterly seminars that discuss building evacuation routes, 
              identify primary and alternate meeting spots, warn employees against 
              using elevators in an emergency, particularly one involving fire, 
              and provide contact information for employees' loved ones in 
              the event of an emergency. Identification of evacuation routes is 
              especially important in skyscraper buildings.
            <P> <B>Conclusion</B>
            <P> Perhaps the greatest lesson that the 9/11 tragedy taught us is 
              not to underestimate the threats to our nation or our people. The 
              idea of initiating attacks on buildings using airplanes as weapons 
              was known long before 2001; however, most people thought the notion 
              so outlandish that they believed it could never happen. It has happened, 
              and we must learn from this experience. SunGard, a leading business 
              continuity services firm, has stated that the main problem they 
              saw after 9/11 with companies' contingency plans was that the 
              scope had not been completely or accurately defined [3]. This certainly 
              lends credence to the need to expect the unexpected. We must take 
              this lesson to heart.
            <P> As a final note, the idea of distributing lethal pathogens such 
              as anthrax by mail, which occurred shortly after 9/11, was once 
              considered as improbable as using airplanes to perpetuate physical 
              attacks. Thus, in addition to the common sense advice presented 
              in this article, organizations should also identify and address 
              scenarios targeting key personnel as part of the contingency planning 
              process. Experts say that contingency plans should include remote 
              management in case of biological attack [3].
