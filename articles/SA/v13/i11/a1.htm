            <h1><B><img src="a1.gif" width="200" height="167" align="right">Enter 
              the Storage Administrator</B></h1>
            <P> <I>Greg (shoe) Schuweiler</i>
            <p> The tasks of a systems administrator's job are changing. 
              In small and large environments, systems administrators used to 
              spend their days (and nights) managing any number of servers with 
              locally attached disks with an occasional timeout for a game of 
              X-Pilot, Doom, etc. We tuned the servers, managed the disks and 
              the data, and backed up the data to locally attached tape drives.
            <P> The failure of a disk usually meant an outage while the failed 
              disk was replaced, formatted, file systems built, and the data was 
              restored from tape. The outage was a fact of life that both the 
              users and administrators accepted. These were not always the good 
              old days. I do not miss trying to justify to management a 540-MB 
              hard drive that cost $3500. I do miss running scripts via cron that 
              automatically sent an email stating the top five disk hogs to everyone 
              with an account on the system and letting peer pressure do the rest. 
              Alas, one must be a gentler systems administrator nowadays. Sigh.
            <P> Now I have a filing cabinet drawer full of 4.5-GB, 9-GB, 18-GB, 
              and some 36-GB SCSI drives that are perfectly serviceable but too 
              small to be used in production. I just cannot bear to part with 
              them. We now purchase wads of storage that are racked into datacenters 
              in 0.5 and 1-TB clumps (a techie term) or disk arrays that are monolithic 
              blobs (another techie term) that snap together like Lego building 
              blocks and add storage by the tens of terabytes.
            <P> Our businesses' quest for acquiring data makes a salmon's 
              run upstream to its spawning place look like a Sunday stroll around 
              a pond. Because of regulatory compliance reasons, business policies, 
              or both, data is being stored longer and more copies are being kept. 
              We are slicing, dicing, reassembling, and stuffing the results into 
              databases of sizes unimaginable just 10 years ago. Queries and processing 
              against this data take place 24x7, shrinking our backup windows 
              from all night to nothing.
            <P> A good part of a sys admin's time is now spent, if not directly 
              managing storage, answering requests for more space. As server hardware 
              and operating systems improve in reliability, the management of 
              these servers will soon be superseded by the management of storage 
              and the data that is on that storage.
            <P> Systems administrators are trying to keep up with server, network-attached 
              storage equipment such as switches, GBICs, arrays, operating system 
              changes, firmware levels, boot proms, virtualization, consolidation, 
              user demands, and scores of other things that are involved in the 
              data acquisition, processing, and storage environment. While we 
              are overwhelmed with requests from customers and managers, our management 
              and executives are inundated with ads and sales people and are making 
              decisions that will ultimately affect us and the systems for which 
              we're responsible.
            <P> The time has come for us to look seriously at a whole new career 
              path that is opening up in the world of systems administration. 
              This new path is the management of storage and the data contained 
              on it. I propose we name this position right up front. Let's 
              call it "System Storage Administrator" or maybe "System 
              Storage Architect". Either will do, but I am betting that the 
              latter will get you at least $6K more a year and possibly an office 
              (it might be next to the furnace room but, hey, won't Mom be 
              proud).
            <P> So, one of the first things on your agenda should be to influence 
              management all the way to the CIO that a dedicated storage expert 
              or team is necessary to ensure business continuity. Depending on 
              the size of your organization and number of the levels between you 
              and the CIO, this idea may become someone else's along the 
              way. Don't fret, because in this case the means justifies the 
              end. It may be poor judgment on my part, but I am going to assume 
              here that various levels of management have already heard from vendors 
              or elsewhere of the concept of storage virtualization, of the savings 
              from storage consolidation, and a host of reasons why they (the 
              vendor) can build your business a Stepford Storage Area Network. 
              If they haven't, then this will be another task on your list 
              of things to do.
            <P> Most of the discussions you will have about forming a storage 
              administration position or team with your management should be centered 
              around two things:
            <P> 
            <P> 1. Saving the business money in the long run
            <P> 2. Providing a high level of data reliability (i.e., ensuring 
              that the data will be there when it needs to be)
            <P> 
            <P> To do this, start by running a bit of history past them. For much 
              of the history of computing, storage has been seen as an intrinsic 
              part of a computer system. It was regarded as a "peripheral". 
              In more recent years, it has become thought of as a storage subsystem 
              but is still uniquely associated with a computer. Exceptions are 
              the mainframe and some computer clusters where a modest number of 
              cooperating computer systems share a common set of storage devices.
            <P> As companies have become more dependent upon computing, they have 
              also become more dependent upon data, the life-blood of computing. 
              While a failed processor can readily be replaced and operations 
              continued almost immediately after the replacement, a failed storage 
              resource requires replacement followed by typically time-consuming 
              restoration of data. This restoration all too often involves some 
              loss of recent changes to that data that requires recovery action 
              before operations can continue. As a result, storage and the disciplines 
              of caring for data and the storage on which it resides have grown 
              in visibility and importance.
            <P> Additionally, the fraction of the purchase price of a computer 
              system that is represented by the storage component has grown to 
              the point that now the storage component of a computer system is 
              often in the vicinity of half or more of the total price. Beyond 
              the purchase price of storage, the total cost of owning storage 
              has become a significant part of the cost of maintaining the computing 
              environment. In other words, the acquisition cost is a small portion 
              of the total cost of ownership of storage over the lifetime of the 
              storage.
            <P> Computing environments necessarily have grown as we have become 
              increasingly reliant on computing. Thus, the number of computer 
              systems we manage has grown in size and in number. Because the traditional 
              computing model associates storage uniquely with a computer system, 
              a computing environment with many computer systems has many storage 
              and storage management environments to maintain and operate -- 
              one per system.
            <P> Responding to these trends, the IT community has begun to view 
              storage as a resource that should be purchased and managed independently 
              from the computer systems that it serves. The IT community has also 
              increasingly come to view storage as a resource that should be shared 
              among computer systems. These changes allow more focused attention 
              on storage, which leads to reduced costs, higher levels of service, 
              and more flexibility through the sharing of the storage resource. 
              This, in turn, allows a storage administrator or storage team to 
              provide improved quality and response time as business needs change. 
              As the storage system for a computing environment becomes a shared, 
              independent resource, additional requirements emerge:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Reliability -- As required of any large, shared critical 
                resource. 
              <li> Scalability -- To match the size, performance, and physical 
                and geographic placement of computing environments. 
              <li> Manageability -- To provide high levels of service and 
                achieve the expected reduction in operational expenses. 
              <li> Standards-based interoperation -- To avoid excessive vendor 
                dependence in a large, critical component of data centers.
            </ul>
            <P> 
            <P> When all these aspects are considered, a structure emerges that 
              achieves the goals of reliability, scalability, and manageability. 
              That structure is a storage system comprising many computer systems 
              that are the consumers of the storage system, many storage devices, 
              and extensive management capabilities. These systems are richly 
              interconnected and demand high performance. These are the characteristics 
              of a shared storage environment, and these are the benefits that 
              a storage administrator or team can bring to the business.
            <P> If I have convinced you, and you in turn have convinced management 
              that a storage administrator or team is needed, the next step is 
              to determine that storage administrator's responsibilities. 
              This administrator should have three primary goals that are intertwined 
              with each other:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Ensuring data protection (including security) 
              <li> Reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) through optimization 
              <li> Ensuring data availability
            </ul>
            <P> 
            <P> Loss of data in any business should be considered intolerable. 
              Depending on the importance and the content of the data, the storage 
              team will need to work with the application owners, legal departments, 
              even dare I say it, marketing, to determine the level of protection 
              that different types of data will require. Critical data to the 
              operation of the business may be RAID5 with replication to a remote 
              datacenter, whereas views from databases that can be rebuilt may 
              be a RAID0 for quick access. Additionally, the data must be protected 
              from accidental or malicious access from host systems or individuals 
              not permitted to view or access data not intended for them.
            <P> The storage team will reduce the total cost of ownership by optimizing 
              hardware utilization, backup software, management, and management 
              software of the components of the storage network pieces. Because 
              the storage team's concern is storage only, they will be able 
              to be computer system vendor neutral. This will allow the OS and 
              storage administrators to concentrate on their core areas of responsibility.
            <P> The availability of the data must meet the needs of the business. 
              Storage administrators will need to work with systems administrators 
              to provide the required data availability for the applications and 
              departments as needed to provide business continuity.
            <P> So, now that we have a new title, what exactly should be the job 
              description? Where should the duties between systems administrator 
              and storage architect be divided? What should the storage administrator 
              be in charge of? Depending on the makeup of your organization, there 
              will be some grey areas of responsibility with the systems, storages, 
              and network administrator teams or individuals. Here is a suggested 
              checklist for the storage administrators:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Backup, recovery, and disaster recovery (DR) schemes, schedules, 
                and test plans 
              <li> Backup servers, backup managers, APIs resident on slave servers 
              <li> Enterprise storage arrays, Gigabit Interface Controller (GBIC) 
              <li> Enterprise tape drives, libraries, Active Template Library 
                (ATL), Vtape, optical libraries 
              <li> External, SAN management software (Logical Unit Number (LUN) 
                mapping, management) for both in-band and out-of-band implementations 
              <li> Fibre Channel (FC) extenders, dense wavelength division multiplexing 
                (DWDM), and other native FC multiplexing or amplification devices 
                used for long-distance extension 
              <li> Fibre Channel hubs, FC switches, FC directors 
              <li> Fibre Channel-asynchronous transfer mode (FC-ATM) or other 
                gateway devices that use the WAN to tunnel FC or otherwise extend 
                FC through WAN access 
              <li> Fibre Channel cables, plant management, patch panels 
              <li> Fibre Channel/Internet Protocol (FC/IP) or Internet Small Computer 
                Systems Interface (iSCSI) gateway device 
              <li> Fibre Channel-Small Computer Systems Interface (FC-SCSI) bridges 
              <li> HBA utilities and software 
              <li> Host or storage data replication, snapshot, redundant arrays 
                of independent disks (RAID), or data mover software 
              <li> Host volume management software 
              <li> Just A Bunch Of Disks (JBOD) connected to pooled fabric architecture 
              <li> NAS appliance, NAS filer, or other general-purpose server used 
                for Common Internet File System (CIFS) or Network File System 
                (NFS) file serving 
              <li> SAN management software imbedded within switches or directors 
              <li> Server Host Bust Adapters (HBAs) selection 
              <li> Storage virtualization software 
              <li> Switch and director OS software
            </ul>
            <P> 
            <P> Additionally, storage administrators would be responsible for 
              selecting product standards, defining standard configurations, collaborating 
              on component architecture design principles with other teams as 
              they architect storage systems for new requirements, and planning 
              and executing projects for data storage.
            <P> After reading the above list, I can picture some administrators 
              climbing over their piles of antiquated hardware and manuals for 
              non-existent software to get out the door and start shouting that 
              I am a heretic. As I said previously, there will definitely be some 
              grey areas where administrators from different areas will need to 
              work together. Additionally, backups may not be part of storage 
              administration in your company. Some companies already have people 
              dedicated to backups and restores.
            <P> Where do you go from here? You might look at the Association of 
              Storage Network Professionals (ASNP) at <B>http://www.asnp.org</B>. 
              It's a user organization put together by users; membership 
              is free, and there are some great discussion forums on the Web site. 
              Be wary of vendors who believe that they can provide you with a 
              Stepford Storage Area Network. Nothing is perfect. I recommend reading 
              <I>Designing Storage Area Networks</I> by Tom Clark (Addison-Wesley). 
              It provides a very good introduction to this subject. White papers 
              from vendors are very helpful, but remember that they are almost 
              always vendor-specific.
