            <p> Hello <I>Sys Admin</I> readers. Amber has allowed me to invade 
              her personal space for an issue, so I could introduce myself a bit 
              more formally to you all. I'll forego any obvious jokes about 
              my column being "Syslog-NG".
            <P> The November issue marks the 8th issue of my brief tenure as Technical 
              Editor. It's somewhat nerve-wracking taking over a role like 
              this on an already successful publication. If the publication maintains 
              its high-quality standards then it appears to be none of my doing, 
              and if the quality drops off then it's all my fault. Still, 
              I take it as both a challenge and a service to the community to 
              work with Amber, Rikki, and our Contributing Editors in producing 
              a high-quality technical magazine every month.
            <P> I also think it's important to depart from our formula and 
              try new things. Our industry, after all, is one that thrives on 
              innovation and we should reflect that in all aspects of what we 
              do. This month we're breaking the mold by running an interesting 
              "opinion piece" by Greg Schuweiler. Greg is tilting at 
              his particular windmill in an openly provocative way, but I found 
              his article thought-provoking even if I didn't necessarily 
              agree with everything he's saying. See what you think. If you'd 
              like to see this sort of opinion article on a more regular basis, 
              please let us know.
            <P> There's lots of other good stuff in this issue too. Put on 
              your engineering cap and check out Bryan Smith's article on 
              AMD Opteron architectures. Lisa Jaworski's business continuity 
              "lessons learned" from the 9/11 tragedy might just be 
              the impetus you've needed to get started revising (or perhaps 
              creating) your own contingency plans. On the career front, Rob Kolstad 
              presents some of the high-level results from the most recent SAGE 
              Salary Survey of Systems Administrators -- I think the results 
              are surprisingly positive for people in our line of work.
            <P> Speaking of SAGE, November means it's time for the Annual 
              LISA Conference, sponsored by USENIX and SAGE. LISA still stands 
              alone as the pre-eminent Systems Administration conference. Hope 
              to see you in Atlanta, November 14-19.
            <P> If I don't see you at LISA, feel free to drop me a line with 
              your thoughts, comments, suggestions, rants, complaints, and I hope 
              the occasional compliment, too. Any feedback that helps make <I>Sys 
              Admin</I> more useful to you, our readers, is greatly appreciated.
            <P> 
            <P> Best wishes,
            <P> <I>Hal Pomeranz</i><br>
