            <P> <b>Rackable Systems Launches Scale Out Server Series</B>
            <P> Rackable Systems, Inc. has launched the Scale Out Server Series, 
              its new server solution designed for large, high-density, data center 
              deployments.
            <P> According to the company, the new Scale Out Server Series is built 
              from a rack-level, data center perspective as opposed to the 7U 
              or sub-7U chassis design typical of traditional blade server solutions. 
              Traditional blade design inhibits open architecture design while 
              severely hampering thermal efficiency. Scale Out's open architecture 
              approach maximizes non-proprietary, industry-standard components, 
              emphasizing unlimited flexibility for customers requiring specific 
              networking, local storage, and provisioning software solutions.

            <P> <B>BlueCat Networks Releases Adonis DNS/DHCP Appliance</B>
            <P> BlueCat Networks has released the new edition of its award-winning 
              DNS appliance. According to the company, the Adonis DNS/DHCP Appliance 
              now includes a suite of features to manage powerful DHCP services, 
              in addition to tools and wizards for configuring and managing DNS 
              operations. Current Adonis customers can perform an online upgrade 
              to enable DHCP services at no cost.
            <P> The Adonis Data Checker identifies errors contained in DNS and 
              DHCP configurations. Resolution of DNS errors and IP address or 
              resource allocation conflicts before the live deployment of configurations 
              prevents loss of DNS and DHCP services. The 1U, rack-mountable Adonis 
              DNS/DHCP Appliance is powered by a hardened Linux OS kernel and 
              integrated firewall. Between the appliance and its cross-platform 
              Adonis Management Console client-side application is 128-bit encrypted 
              SSL connectivity that provides DNS and DHCP administrators with 
              added protection from external security threats and risks. For more 
              information, see: <I>http://www.bluecatnetworks.com</I>.
            <P> <B>3PAR Announces Virtual Copy DBA for Linux</B>
            <P> 3PAR has released 3PAR Virtual Copy DBA for Linux. According to 
              the company, with 3PAR Virtual Copy DBA and InServ Storage Servers, 
              users can now deploy Linux-based applications more simply, more 
              economically, and more reliably. 3PAR not only allows for rapid 
              Oracle recovery on Linux but also enables simple, on-demand Linux 
              server provisioning.
            <P> With 3PAR Virtual Copy DBA for Linux, users maintain high availability 
              for their Oracle 9i/Linux environment by instantly recovering data 
              after accidental deletions or corruptions. Virtual Copy DBA intelligently 
              takes a non-disruptive and consistent snapshot of an entire Oracle 
              data set. Snapshots created from Oracle databases require no capacity 
              reservations and consume raw capacity only for changed data. 3PAR 
              Virtual Copy DBA for Linux is available immediately. For more information, 
              see: <I>http://www.3par.com</I>.

            <P> Now through December 31, 2004, ShaoLin Microsystems is offering 
              free download of their flagship product, ShaoLin Aptus -- the

              a Linux server sharing its operating system and applications with 
              multiple networked client PCs simultaneously and transparently. 
              Once ShaoLin Aptus is installed on a Linux server, all networked 
              client PCs can turn into the Linux-based fit clients in minutes 
              without individual installations and even local hard drives.
            <P> Users can download the ShaoLin Aptus package for up to 5 clients. 
              To provide free support, ShaoLin has set up a forum for users to
