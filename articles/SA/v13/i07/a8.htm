            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a bunch of Sun machines 
              that we install via Jumpstart. When a new version of Solaris comes 
              out, we download the ISO images and build a new Jumpstart image 
              from them. Since new versions only come out four times a year, it 
              isn't too painful to do this by hand. Lately, though, we've been 
              exploring Solaris 10 via Solaris Express as well as keeping up with 
              the latest production releases. It's become annoying to install 
              each set of disk images by hand now that we do it so frequently. 
              I was wondering whether someone had already written a script to 
              accomplish this before we attempted to (re)invent the wheel.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Because I regularly build Jumpstart 
              servers for various clients, I came up with a script some time back 
              that does everything but download the ISO images for you (see Listing 
              1). The script is under a BSD-style license, so feel free to modify 
              and distribute it as described.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a newly installed HP/UX 
              11.00 machine on our network. After a few minutes of uptime, it 
              suddenly falls off the network. If the machine is rebooted, it gets 
              another few minutes of connectivity. As far as I can tell, the configuration 
              is fine and there's nothing running from <B>cron</B> or <B>at</B> 
              that would kill the connection. I realize that this question is 
              thin on details, but I'm really at a loss here.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Without some debugging details 
              (output from netstat, ndd, ps, tcpdump, etc.) it's difficult to 
              make an accurate diagnosis. My first guess would be that your HP 
              machine is performing Dead Gateway Detection and cannot ping the 
              gateway. Perhaps you've turned off ICMP for security reasons? Dead 
              Gateway Detection relies on section 4.3.3.6 of RFC1918, which states:
            <P> 4.3.3.6 Echo Request/Reply
            <P> A router MUST implement an ICMP Echo server function that receives 
              Echo Requests sent to the router, and sends corresponding Echo Replies. 
              A router MUST be prepared to receive, reassemble and echo an ICMP 
              Echo Request datagram at least as the maximum of 576 and the MTUs 
              of all the connected networks.
            <P> The Echo server function MAY choose not to respond to ICMP echo 
              requests addressed to IP broadcast or IP multicast addresses.
            <P> A router SHOULD have a configuration option that, if enabled, 
              causes the router to silently ignore all ICMP echo requests; if 
              provided, this option MUST default to allowing responses.
            <P> Looking at tcpdump output will verify whether this is the issue 
              or not. You'll see the HP trying to send ICMP packets to the gateway 
              about every three minutes. If it receives no response, the HP assumes 
              that the route is dead and disables it. To work around this, use 
              ndd to disable Dead Gateway Detection:
            <P> 
            <pre>
ndd -set /dev/ip ip_ire_gw_probe 0
</pre>
            To make this change persist through a reboot, modify /etc/rc.config.d/nddconf 
            as follows:
            <P> 
            <pre>
TRANSPORT_NAME[0]=ip
NDD_NAME[0]=ip_ire_gw_probe
NDD_VALUE[0]=0
</pre>

            <P> 
            <pre>
http://www2.itrc.hp.com/service/cki/docDisplay.do?docLocale=en_US&amp;docId=200000062684449</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an AIX machine 
            that has no tape device. I want to create a backup image for disaster 
            recovery purposes, but I'm not really sure how to go about it. Can 
            I still use <B>mksysb</B> or do I need to use something like Sysback 
            or Storix?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> As long as you have a tape or 
              writable CD/DVD drive on another machine, you can create a <B>mksysb</B> 
              image on disk and then move it to the desired media. You can NFS 
              mount a partition from a central server or transfer the <B>mksysb</B> 
              file to another machine after the fact. The command to create the 
              image would be:
            <P> 
            <pre>
mksysb -e -i -X /path/to/mksysb-image-name
</pre>
            If you're keeping a number of images in a centralized location, such 
            as a NIM master, I suggest including the hostname and date as part 
            of the filename. Sysback or Storix would also be viable alternatives 
            to <B>mksysb</B>.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I just upgraded all of my ports 
              using:
            <P> 
            <pre>
portupgrade -a -b
</pre>
            When I check the port versions of everything that's now installed 
            using:
            <P> 
            <pre>
portversion -v
</pre>
            it claims that the version I have installed is <B>newer</B> than the 
            port version. This makes no sense, because I can't have upgraded to 
            a version that's newer than what's available via the ports collection. 
            I'm wondering whether I corrupted something when I did the upgrade.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> After you do a cvsup to update 
              the ports collection, be sure to run:
            <P> 
            <pre>
portsdb -Uu
</pre>
            The portupgrade utility relies on the file /usr/ports/INDEX being 
            up to date. Since this file is only rebuilt on the cvsup servers every 
            month or so, the version numbers of individual ports can appear out 
            of date. Running <B>portsdb -uU</B> rebuilds the INDEX so that it 
            contains the current information culled from the actual ports. The 
            same effect can be achieved by doing:
            <P> 
            <pre>
cd /usr/ports
make index
