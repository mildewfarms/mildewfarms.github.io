            <p> We recently mailed our annual Readers' Survey to a subset of subscribers. 
              If you received one, I encourage you to fill it out and return it 
              to us. We value the feedback from readers. On that note, we received 
              some comments in response to the coverage of LDAP in our May issue 
              and, because of space constraints this month, I'm excerpting one 
              of the letters here. Alf Wachsmann wrote:
            <P> While reading the two articles about LDAP in your May 2004 issue 
              of the <I>Sys Admin</I> magazine I became rather angry: LDAP can 
              NOT be used securely as an authentication system! If someone is 
              looking for alternatives for their current system, look at Kerberos 
              5 (MIT or Heimdal).
            <P> Also, NIS is not insecure per se. It is insecure as an authentication 
              system but has no problems with security as an authorization system 
              (use "securenets" and block NIS ports on your firewall).
            <P> The real shortcoming of LDAP when used for authentication is the 
              fact that encrypted passwords travel over the wire. Modern authentication 
              systems, like Kerberos 5, do not do this. LDAP also cannot provide 
              mutual authentication mechanisms for services. Kerberos has many 
              more built-in security features like a replay cache or pre-authentication.
            <P> Hal Pomeranz, our technical editor, responded as follows:
            <P> <ul>Given the way the articles turned out, your criticisms are generally 
              well founded. We had hoped to include information on SASL binding 
              between LDAP clients and servers, but that did not happen. Once 
              the client-server communication is fully encrypted and there's strong 
              authentication between the LDAP client and server, I actually consider 
              LDAP to be a reasonably secure (though not perfect) authentication 
              system, but unfortunately that was not the full scenario presented 
              in the articles. We hope to acquire a follow-up piece to complete 
              the picture.
            <P> That being said, I'm also a big fan of Kerberos for authentication. 
              What's always been interesting to me has been the perception of 
              Kerberos as "hard" to do, and yet sites seem to be willing to invest 
              as much or more effort in converting over to LDAP-based systems 
              for authentication. I suspect this is because there are a lot of 
              "canned" NIS to LDAP migration tools out there, so people perceive 
              that the transition is smoother. Or it could be the lack of a clear 
              general naming services choice for Kerberos (whither Hesiod?) -- 
              people know that they need to store more than just basic authentication 
              information, so LDAP seems attractive as a "single source" for all 
              of their network data. Again, I think it's a perception more than 
              reality perhaps.
            <P> I'd frankly be interested in more Kerberos-related content in 
              <I>Sys Admin</I> magazine. In fact I'd dearly love somebody to write 
              an article describing how to authenticate Unix Kerberos clients 
              to Active Directory servers and have a single login for users across 
              the Unix and Windows domains.</ul>
            <P> If you're interested in writing an article for <I>Sys Admin</I> 
              magazine on Kerberos, LDAP, or some other topic, or simply have 
              feedback to share, please send your proposals to Rikki Endsley (<B>rendsley@cmp.com</B>) 
              and your comments to me (<B>aankerholz@cmp.com</B>). We look forward 
              to hearing from you.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
            <P> <I>Amber Ankerholz</i><br>
