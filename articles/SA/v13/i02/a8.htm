              and Answers</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm using ipfilter on Solaris 
              8 to protect each of my internal hosts separately. I'm not 
              using NAT on these machines at all. Unfortunately, occasionally 
              some of the more heavily loaded machines will just stop receiving 
              TCP connections altogether. I can clear this up by stopping and 
              starting the filter again, but that kills any existing connections. 
              The weird thing is that it only appears to be TCP and not UDP or 
              ICMP. Any clue what the problem might be?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Your question is sparse on details, 
              and it would help if I knew the version of ipfilter and saw your 
              ipf.conf. I can hazard an educated guess at what your problem may 
              be, though. It sounds like you're overflowing ipfilter's 
              TCP state database. When you notice a machine having problems, do 
              the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ipfstat
ipfstat -s
</pre>
            If you see a large number of lost packet states when you run the first 
            command, and you see a large number of bkts in use with the second 
            command, you've found your culprit. If this isn't the case, 
            then the output from ipfstat will at least give you some statistics 
            to work with.
            <p> To correct the bucket overflow issue, take the following steps:
            <p> 
            <p> 
              <li> Make sure that every rule where you keep state on a TCP connection 
                also has "flags S". Here's an example set of rules 
                for DNS:
                <p> 
                <pre>
pass out quick on hme0 proto tcp from 0/32 to any port = domain flags S keep state
pass out quick on hme0 proto udp from 0/32 to any port = domain
pass in quick on hme0 proto udp from any port = domain to 0/32
</pre>
              <li> Adjust the ipf:fr_statemax and ipf:fr_statesize kernel variables 
                in /etc/system and reboot:
                <p> 
                <pre>
set ipf:fr_statemax = 7000
set ipf:fr_statesize = 10009
</pre>
              <li> Additionally, if you see a lot of half closed and idle connections, 
                you may also want to adjust ipf:fr_tcpidletimeout and ipf:fr_tcphalfclosed 
                in /etc/system and reboot:
                <p> 
                <pre>
set ipf:fr_tcpidletimeout = 172800
set ipf:fr_tcphalfclosed = 7200
</pre>
                If these steps don't seem to correct the problem, search 
                through the ipfilter mailing list archives at:
                <p> 
                <pre>
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ipfilter
</pre>
                After checking through the archives, you can also post to the 
                ipfilter list for help by following the directions at:

                <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> In the past, I've been bitten 
                by cvsup'ing to a release candidate of FreeBSD instead of 
                getting -STABLE. How can I make sure that I get the newest -STABLE 
                instead of the newest RELENG tag? This is what I currently have 
                in my cvsup config file:
                <p> 
                <pre>
  *default host=cvsup3.FreeBSD.org
  *default base=/usr/local/etc/cvsup
  *default prefix=/usr
  *default release=cvs
  *default delete use-rel-suffix
  *default tag=RELENG_4

   # These are the individual collections that make up "src-all".
   # If you use these, be sure to comment out "src-all" above.
   src-base
   src-bin
   src-contrib
   src-etc
   src-gnu
   src-include
   src-lib
   src-libexec
   src-release
   src-sbin
   src-share
   src-sys
   src-tools
   src-usrbin
   src-usrsbin
   src-crypto
   src-secure
   src-sys-crypto
   </pre>
                <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you know that you want to 
                stick with a certain branch, you can specify it, instead of RELENG_4, 
                in your cvsup configuration file. The following would make sure 
                that you get the 4.9-RELEASE (now in -STABLE) branch. This branch 
                will only contain critical fixes:
                <p> 
                <pre>
*default tag=RELENG_4_9
</pre>
                If you specify RELENG_4_9, though, you'll never get the next 
                4.x release until you manually change your cvsup configuration 
                file.
                <p> If you want to leave your tag as RELENG_4, you can always 
                  make sure that you've got a -STABLE before you go through 
                  and compile everything. The file /usr/src/release/doc/share/sgml/release.ent 
                  contains information about the current, previous, and next releases 
                  as well as some other versioning information. In particular, 
                  you want to look for the release.current entry:
                <p> 
                <pre>
&lt;!-- Version of the OS we're describing. This needs to be updated \
  with each new release. --&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY release.current "4.9-STABLE"&gt;
</pre>
                <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm attempting to do some 
                error checking in one of my Bourne shell scripts, but it's 
                not working as I would expect. The simple case script is as follows:
                <p> 
                <pre>
#!/bin/sh
somecommand
echo $?
if [ $? = 2 ]; then
  echo "somecommand failed"
fi
</pre>
                where "somecommand" is a locally written C program that 
                returns 0 on successful completion and 2 on failure. When I run 
                this shell script and somecommand fails, it prints out the number 
                2, but it never prints out "somecommand failed." Clearly, 
                my debugging shows that an error is being generated by somecommand, 
                but the if statement doesn't appear to work. What is wrong 
                with my code?
                <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You have two issues with 
                  your code. First, the equal sign (=) is used to compare strings, 
                  not numbers. Instead, you should use -eq to compare your error 
                  number. Second, the test in your if statement refers to the 
                  output of the echo program, not somecommand. If you want to 
                  use the return code of somecommand in multiple places, you'll 
                  need to store the value in a variable. Try this code instead:
                <p> 
                <pre>
#!/bin/sh
somecommand
returncode=$?
echo ${returncode}
if [ ${returncode} -eq 2 ]; then
  echo "somecommand failed with code ${returncode}"
fi</pre>
                <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We recently purchased several 
                Sun V240 systems that came preinstalled with Solaris 8. I tried 
                to reinstall them with the Solaris CD 1 of 2. The installation 
                failed on each machine when it couldn't find kernel/sparcv9/unix. 
                I also tried a copy of Solaris 9, but that failed as well. Since 
                they failed on all of the machines, I'm guessing I have defective 
                or outdated (more likely) installation media. What do the V240s 
                support?
                <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you want to install Solaris 
                  8, you'll need the 12/02 release at a minimum. From the 
                  release notes at:

</pre>
                The Solaris 8 HW 12/02 media is intended only for installation 
                on Sun Fire B100s, Sun Fire V210, Sun Fire V240, and Netra 240 
                systems. It includes no new functionality other than support for 
                these systems. Customers installing the Solaris 8 operating system 
                on systems other than those listed above are advised to use the 
                Solaris 8 2/02 update instead, and may choose to also add standard 
                patches found on the SunSolve web site: <b>http://sunsolve.sun.com/</b>
                <p> Patches included in this platform-specific release that are 
                  not in the Solaris 8 2/02 update are listed by number in Chapter 
                  9, Released Patches Integrated into the Solaris 8 HW 12/02 Release 
                  of these release notes.
                <p> If you'd rather upgrade the machine to Solaris 9, then 
                  you'll need release 04/03 at a minimum:

                <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running sendmail 8.12.10 
                on an OpenBSD for 3.4 machine. This machine acts as the outgoing 
                SMTP host for IMAP clients run by people in each of those domains 
                (no local delivery takes place here). Because each domain has 
                a different set of filtering rules and policies for outgoing mail, 
                I want to smarthost each piece of email based on the sender's 
                domain, not the recipient's domain. I've found instructions 
                on doing the latter, but not the former. Is this possible with 
                the version of sendmail that I'm running?
                <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There is an add-on m4 file 
                  by Andrzej Filip called smarttable.m4, which should do what 
                  you desire. Obtain the m4 file from:

http://www.polbox.com/a/anfi/sendmail/smarttable.m4
</pre>
                and add it to the cf/feature directory of your sendmail distribution. 
                Create /etc/mail/smarttable and add entries for each of your domains:
                <p> 
                <pre>
@first.domain      smarthost.first.domain
@second.domain     smarthost.second.domain
</pre>
                Create the corresponding map file with makemap:
                <p> 
                <pre>
makemap hash &lt; /etc/mail/smarttable &gt; /etc/mail/smarttable.db
</pre>
                Next, add the following line to your .mc file and rebuild sendmail.cf:

FEATURE('smarttable')dnl

</pre>
                There's also a different method to do sender-based smarthosting 
                by Neil Rickert, which requires a patch to cf/m4/proto.m4:

http://www.cs.niu.edu/~rickert/cf/hack/sender_based_routing.m4
</pre>
                This method uses the mailertable functionality of sendmail (make 
                sure that FEATURE('mailertable')dnl is included in the 
                mc file from which sendmail.cf was built) with a From: tag on 
                the LHS. The mailertable format is:

                but I'm not certain which are valid and which are not. Is

                <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'd like to restrict 
                  a user to his home directory, and I'm not seeing a way 
                  to do that in proftpd 1.2.9. Is there a configuration option 
                  that I missed, or will I have to use a different ftp daemon?
                <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> To cause every FTP user to 
                  be chrooted into his home directory, use the DefaultRoot directive:
                <p> 
                <pre>
DefaultRoot ~
</pre>
                If the DefaultRoot directory is a symlink, it will first be resolved 
                to its parent directory before setting up the chroot. The DefaultRoot 
                directive can also specify a subdirectory of a user's home 
                directory, such as "~/ftp."
                <p> The optional group regular expression argument can be used 
                  to restrict the DefaultRoot directive to a Unix group, groups, 
                  or subset of groups. This becomes especially useful if you want 
                  most users to be chrooted to their home directories but want 
                  to allow system staff to have the run of the machine. The expression 
                  is comma-separated list of the format <b>[!]group-name1</b>. 
                  The expression is parsed using a logical boolean AND for each 
                  expression. An example /etc/group contains the following lines:
                <p> 
                <pre>
users::1000:u1,u2,u3,u4
staff::10:u1,u6
</pre>
                The following DefaultRoot statement chroots users u2, u3, and 
                u4, but not u1 or u6 (logically: users AND NOT staff):
                <p> 
                <pre>
DefaultRoot ~ users,!staff
</pre>
                If you want every user except those in group "staff" 
                to be chrooted, then you'd use:
                <p> 
                <pre>
DefaultRoot ~ !staff
</pre>
                Be aware that chrooting is not secure in and of itself as there 
                are ways to circumvent it, especially if the user has shell access 
                to the machine.
                <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I want to set up a system 
                  account that should never receive mail. To do this, I've 
                  tried using sendmail's accessdb feature, but I'm not 
                  seeing the exact behavior I want. I tried the following entry:
                <p> 
                <pre>
util@  ERROR:"550 User does accept mail"
</pre>
                This blocks mail like I want, but it also blocks mail from any 
                user named "util" that's <i>sending</i> mail to 
                my machine. Obviously, I don't want this behavior, because 
                I'm blocking legitimate email to other accounts.
                <p> Next, I tried the following entry in the accessdb:
                <p> 
                <pre>
util@my.domain  ERROR:"550 User does accept mail"
</pre>
                This blocks mail that uses the FQDN but doesn't stop anyone 
                from sending unqualified email to the user util. Is there an easy 
                answer to what I want to do, or am I going to have to implement 
                something through a milter?
                <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If your machine (you don't 
                  mention OS or sendmail version) delivers mail locally without 
                  calling sendmail, then you're not going to be able to block 
                  local delivery from things like cron. If all of your outbound 
                  and inbound email goes through sendmail, you can use the LHS 
                  tags for the access database to refine your filtering. From 
                  the cf/README file:
                <p> There is now the option to tag entries in the access map according 
                  to their type. Three tags are available:
                <p> 
                <pre>
Connect:    connection information (${client_addr}, ${client_name})
From:       envelope sender
To:         envelope recipient
</pre>
                If the required item is looked up in a map, it will be tried first 
                with the corresponding tag in front, then (as fallback to enable 
                backward compatibility) without any tag, unless the specific feature 
                requires a tag. For example,
                <p> 
                <pre>
From:spammer@some.dom   REJECT
To:friend.domain        RELAY
Connect:friend.domain   OK
Connect:from.domain     RELAY
From:good@another.dom   OK
From:another.dom        REJECT
</pre>
                This would deny mails from spammer@some.dom but you could still 
                send mail to that address even if FEATURE('blacklist_recipients') 
                is enabled. Your system will allow relaying to friend.domain, 
                but not from it (unless enabled by other means). Connections from 
                that domain will be allowed even if they end up in one of the 
                DNS-based rejection lists. Relaying is enabled from from.domain 
                but not to it (since relaying is based on the connection information 
                for outgoing relaying, the tag Connect: must be used; for incoming 
                relaying, which is based on the recipient address, To: must be 
                used). The last two entries allow mails from good@another.dom 
                but reject mail from all other addresses with another.dom as domain 
                part.
                <p> So, you'd want the following to block mail to util on 
                  your machine:
                <p> 
                <pre>
To: util@
</pre>
