            <p><b> Xandros Announces Xandros Desktop 2</b>
            <p> Xandros, Inc. recently announced the availability of version 2 
              of the Xandros Desktop OS. According to the company, Xandros Desktop 
              2 offers an intuitive, graphical environment that installs with 
              four clicks of a mouse. Xandros Desktop 2 provides integration with 
              Microsoft Windows programs and networks, plus new usability enhancements 
              such as drag-and-drop CD burning in Xandros File Manager. The new 
              release employs a Xandros-enhanced KDE 3.1.4 and an underlying 2.4.22 
              Linux kernel. For more information, visit: <i>http://www.xandros.com/products.html</i>.
            <p> <b>VanDyke Updates SecureCRT and SecureFX</b>
            <p> VanDyke Software announced the release of version 4.1 of its SecureCRT 
              secure remote access client and version 2.2 of its SecureFX multi-protocol 
              file transfer client. According to the company, these releases offer 
              increased integration between the client applications and advanced 
              Kerberos authentication when connecting to a GSSAPI-enabled server 
              like VanDyke's VShell for Windows and Unix. Using Kerberos 
              authentication provides a single sign-on to the entire network that 
              can now include secure remote access, secure file transfer, and 
              secure data tunneling. The two applications now use a shared host 
              key database -- once a server's credentials have been accepted 
              by one application, the other also recognizes it as a known host, 
              which can reduce end-user confusion about accepting host keys and 
              reduce support costs. The private key agent cache is also shared, 
              eliminating the need to reenter a passphrase once a connection has 
              been established by either application when using public-key authentication.
            <p> Fully functional evaluation copies of SecureCRT, SecureFX, and 
              VShell can be downloaded from the company's Web site at: <i>http://www.vandyke.com/download/index.html</i>.
            <p> <b>Ecora Patch Manager 3.0 Adds Multi-Platform Support</b>
            <p> Ecora recently announced the addition of Sun Solaris support in 
              Patch Manager 3.0, its automated patch analysis and remediation 
              software. According to the company, Ecora Patch Manager 3.0 helps 
              IT staff to analyze for missing and installed patches, research, 
              test, and deploy the patches across the enterprise to resolve both 
              Windows and Solaris security vulnerabilities. Patch Manager 3.0 
              also includes new features such as Policy Manager for enforcing 
              corporate patch policies, a browser-based Reporting Center, and 
              Patch Test Center to assist lab-testing patches. For more information,

              Integration Center located at the IBM Toronto Lab. According to 
              the companies, the collaboration will initially focus on IBM DB2

              and support of future IBM DB2 software offerings on the SUSE LINUX 
              Enterprise Server platform. This will help ensure optimized functionality 
              of database applications and underlying enterprise operating system 
              technology, making SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server and IBM DB2 database 
              software a highly available, scalable combination for mission-critical
