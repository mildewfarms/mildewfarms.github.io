            <p> This February issue focuses on Network Security -- always 
              an essential topic to systems administrators. One way to stay up 
              to date regarding the latest security tools and trends is to attend 
              a security conference. According to their Web site, the RSA Conference 
              2004 (February 23-27, Moscone Center, San Francisco) offers information 
              on technology trends and best practices in identity theft, hacking, 
              cyber-terrorism, biometrics, network forensics, perimeter defense, 
              secure Web services, encryption, and other related topics. You can 
              find out more from the conference Web site at: <b>http://2004.rsaconference.com/</b>.
            <p> SANS CDI (Cyber Defense Initiative) West 2004 will be held January 
              26-31 at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina, San Diego. The conference 
              tracks offered at SANS CDI West 2004 include: SANS Security Essentials 
              Bootcamp and the CISSP 10 Domains; Firewalls, Perimeter Protection 
              and VPNs; Intrusion Detection In-Depth; Hacker Techniques, Exploits 
              and Incident Handling; Securing Windows; and System Forensics, Investigations 
              and Response. For more information, see the show Web site at: <b>http://www.sans.org/cdiwest04/</b> 
              or check out the SANS brochure included with this issue for the 
              dates of a SANS conference in your area.
            <p> Later in the year, you can attend Computer Security Institute's 
              NetSec 2004 -- Building the Secure Enterprise (June 14-16, Hyatt 
              Regency Embarcadero, San Francisco). According to their Web site, 
              NetSec offers sessions on cutting-edge technologies and the management 
              of those technologies. "NetSec's critical focus means 
              narrowing the beam to spot the details that matter. In defensive 
              strategies, it means best practice; in wireless, it means examining 
              WPA with an eye toward real implementation; in forensics, it means 
              finding the evidence that tells the story." Learn more about 
              the NetSec conference at: <b>http://www.gocsi.com/events/netsec.jhtml</b>.
            <p> In this issue, Barnett and Smith provide an overview of IPCop, 
              an inexpensive solution for intranets that require comprehensive 
              network security. Rajeev Kumar explains how to set up Squid as a 
              proxy firewall in front of your Web server. And, Lawrence Teo describes 
              Dovecot, an open source IMAP server that advertises itself as "an 
              IMAP and POP3 server for Linux/Unix-like systems, written primarily 
              with security in mind." I hope you find these articles useful.

              for future coverage.
