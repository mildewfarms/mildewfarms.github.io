<H1>Archiving Informix On-line from cron</H1><p>
<P>
Carl Nichols and Ed Schaefer<P>

To achieve on-line transaction processing (OLTP) performance,
the 
Informix On-line database engine manages its own resources,
including 
creating (and restoring) database archives. Part of
the archive process 
is backing up the logical log files, which are critical
to Informix 
On-line data recovery.<P>

Unfortunately, the Informix archive utility, tbtape,
is designed 
only to be run in the foreground, and thus ties up resources
such 
as monitors (or at least a window) and tape drives.
This article presents 
an alternative procedure via a shell script for running
archives and 
logical logging from a cron or the background. (Note:
the 
shell script examples included within this article are
the parameterized 
versions of the originals written at Newport News Shipbuilding,
Newport 
News, VA).<P>

<B>What Is an Archive?</B><P>

Informix defines archive-0 as a full database backup,
with archive-1 
and archive-2 being incremental backups. Between archives,
logical 
log files which occupy contiguous disk space are released
for re-use 
after a full logical log is backed up.<P>

<B>The General Solution</B><P>

Since UNIX treats devices as files, you can change the
archive and 
logging tape drives to disk files, thus sending archive
data to a 
file rather than to tape. On-line is controlled by a
configuration 
file pointed to by TBCONFIG; within this file, change
the 
archive device, TAPEDEV, and the logging device, LTAPEDEV,

to disk file names.<P>

Also, UNIX permits standard input to be redirected from
the keyboard 
to an ASCII file, which allows interactive commands,
such as tbtape, 
to be run in the background. The ASCII files needed
are arch_0, 
arch_1, and arch_2, with the first line being an octal

carriage return, \012, and the second a 0, 1, or 2,
depending 
on the archive. Also, the file tbtape_cr contains just
one 
line, consisting of the same octal carriage return.
Below is the file 
arch_0:<P>
<PRE>
\012
0</pre><p>
<p>
<B>The Archive Script: archive.sh</B><P>

You create an archive by calling archive.sh (Listing
1) with 
the proper 0, 1, or 2 argument. The script does 
the following:<P>

<li>Stops logical logging by calling the Ktbtape.sh 
script (Listing 2)<P>

<li>Performs the actual archive 0, 1, or 2<P>

<li>Re-starts logical logging in the background by calling

the Stbtape.sh script (Listing 3).<P>

Since the scripts are relatively straightforward, we
concentrate here 
on potential On-line problems.<P>

<B>Warnings</B><P>

1. Check the parameterized commands for pathname accuracy
for your 
system.<P>

2. Make sure the shell scripts and the redirected ASCII
files mentioned 
earlier are in the $PWD directory.<P>

3. Make sure that archive.sh is only called from the
user 
&quot;informix&quot; cron.<P>

4. If you attempt to change TAPEDEV, LTAPEDEV, TAPESIZE,

or LTAPESIZE using the Informix DBA utility, tbmonitor,

the file or device must exist and be owned and readable
by user &quot;informix&quot;.<P>

5. Be sure the $BACKARCDIR and $BACKLOGDIR file systems

are large enough to hold the largest expected archives,
and are not 
on the same drive as the database partition.<P>

<B>Restoring an Archive</B><P>

Archives are restored from the archive section of the
tbmonitor 
utility. tbmonitor will ask the for the base archive-0

and any archive-1 or archive-2 files. Each archive 
file must be uncompressed if need be, and moved to the
value of TAPEDEV. 
After the last archive is restored, any logical logs
file(s) must 
be restored. The logical log file(s) must be moved to
the value LTAPEDEV. <P>

<B>In Summary</B><P>

Using cron or a background process to archive files
to disk 
may free your resources, but you must also develop a
detailed plan 
for saving the necessary files. For example, each archive
level and 
the copied &quot;full&quot; logical logs after the last
archive should 
be maintained for recovery purposes. <P>
