<B>SuperUsers Releases XMon 1.3</B><P>

SuperUsers a/s has released XMon 1.3, a UNIX System
and Application 
Monitoring Tool. XMon monitors and controls resources,
performance, 
security, and functionality for the operating system
and for applications 
either system wide, or by group/user, or by application.
<P>

XMon can monitor and control hosts from a single display
using a Motif-based 
GUI. The user interface gives an overview of the status
of all hosts 
on a network by using a color-coded icon for each host.
Data collection 
is accomplished using XSensor. XSensor reads data via
the UNIX-kernel 
device drivers datafile &quot;/dev/kmem,&quot; collecting
exact data 
with low overhead.<P>

Also released with XMon 1.3 is XMonGraph, an XMon module.
XMonGraph 
provides line graphs and bar charts of monitored data.
These graphs 
can then be updated with information from the monitored
hosts. An 
XMon ORACLE Monitoring Module is also available.
n
XMon 1.3 is currently ported to 25 UNIX platforms (including
IBM, 
Sun, HP, DEC, SGI, and MIPS), NT, DOS, and MS Windows,
with ports 
announced for VMS, OS/2, and Novell Netware. For more
information

<B>Paradigm Introduces ONSchedule</B><P>

Paradigm Systems Corporation has introduced ONSchedule,
a distributed 
network job scheduling and workload management system.
ONSchedule 
automatically schedules, executes, and manages processes
over a network 
of heterogeneous machines. ONSchedule is a comprehensive
tool that 
centralizes control and management for tasks from simple
batch processing 
to entire production cycles. ONSchedule does not limit
users to simple 
date and time configurations. Jobs can be scheduled
based on the successful 
completion or failure of other jobs, an API passed event
such as the 
arrival of a file, as well as user customizable calendar
configurations.<P>

Features of ONSchedule include: cycle definition and
property inheritance 
which let user commands act on all members of the cycle
and which 
also determine a job's specific properties from the
job's parent cycle; 
real-time monitoring, which lets users navigate through
the ONSchedule 
Network and view cycle processes as they occur; and
a GUI, which identifies 
components in the System, the flow of each cycle, and
the relationship 
between each component. ONSchedule also includes a custom
monitor 
API library which lets users pass asynchronous network
events to the 
scheduler, and a secondary server which serves as a
hot back-up option. 
Other features of ONSchedule include: error recovery,
queue management 
and load balancing, and integrated system security and
fault tolerance.<P>

ONSchedule supports Sun Solaris 1.0 and requires UNIX
running X11/Motif. 
Pricing for ONSchedule is based on network configuration.

<B>Computronics Introduces PEEK for UNIX</B><P>

Computronics has introduced their PEEK software package
for AIX, HP-UX, 
SUN (SunOS4 and Solaris 2), Data General DG/UX, DEC
Ultrix, and MIPS 
RISC/os. PEEK lets users see what is on any user's screen,
