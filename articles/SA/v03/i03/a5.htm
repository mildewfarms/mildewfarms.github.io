<B><I>Zen and the Art of the Internet<br>
A Beginner's Guide</I><br>
Third Edition by Brendan P. Kehoe<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-121492-6</B><P>

In this &quot;New &amp; Improved&quot; edition, Kehoe
has added several 
new developments to his introduction to the Internet.
He looks at 
the problems that chain letters can cause, showing why
they should 
not be sent; explores the bulletin-board systems (BBS's)
on the Internet 
and describes several of them; and presents several
tools that can 
search the Internet, including the Wide Area Information
Server (WAIS), 
Veronica, and Netfind. This edition contains information
on communicating 
with the White House, MTV, the Online Book Initiative,
Internet Talk 
Radio, and the Online Career Center, as well as a chapter
on finding 
further information about the Internet. An appendix
covers current 
country codes, including the Russian Federation and
the new countries 
that were part of the former Soviet Union.<P>

I reviewed the first edition of Kehoe's book. Since
then, it has almost 
doubled in size and is much easier to read due to format
and typesetting 
changes. The quality of the book remains excellent and
the author 
furnishes complete addresses of products that he mentions.
This book 
provides a worthwhile resource and guide to the Internet.<P>

<B><I>The Online User's Encyclopedia: Bulletin Boards
and Beyond</I><br>
by Bernard Aboba<br>
Addison-Wesley<br>
ISBN 0-201-62214-9</B><P>

Aboba has produced a treasure trove of information about
telecommunications 
and computer networks. The guide begins with Quickstart,
which was 
designed to provide the beginner with basic information
about communications 
and online activities. It presents sections on hardware,
software, 
communications settings, bulletin boards, networks,
and global networks. 
The Quickstart section also discusses what users of
different machines 
-- Macintosh, DOS PC, or UNIX workstation -- can accomplish

online.<P>

The second section is devoted to the Internet. It provides
a basic 
explanation of the Internet, describes Internet service
providers, 
and considers privacy and security issues. Aboba discusses
electronic 
mail, different file transfers, online libraries, and
Usenet. He also 
details real-time conversations, such as Internet Talk
Radio; information 
servers, including WAIS, Gopher, Veronica, and the World
Wide Web 
(W3), plus TCP/IP.<P>

The &quot;Store and Forward Network Guide&quot; focuses
on UUCP, BITNET, 
FidoNet, EchoMac, RIME, and ILink, describing the network,
outlining 
their benefits, and telling you how to join them. The
Tutorial discusses 
such topics as &quot;How To Save Money On Your Phone
Bill,&quot; &quot;File 
Transfers Between Macs, PCs, and UNIX,&quot; file conversion,
compression, 
and home control, and includes a diverting chapter on
&quot;Emoticons 
and Other Jargon&quot;. The final section, &quot;Memories
and Visions,&quot; 
presents several histories of different networks as
well as what the 
future may bring. <P>

The appendices include a bibliography, a review of selected
products, 
a directory of online resources, information on cables,
UNIX information, 
conference listings for different networks, and a glossary
of terms. 
This book provides a wealth of information for any user,
regardless 
of his/her platform or level of  experience. It is easy
to spend hours 
perusing this extremely worthwhile guide.<P>

<B><I>UNIX Networks<br>
An Overview for System Administrators</I><br>
by Bruce H. Hunter and Karen Bradford Hunter <br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-089087-1</B><P>

Due to technological advances in both hardware and software
and to 
the current popularity of online communications, the
UNIX system administrator 
must also be a UNIX network administrator. Bruce and
Karen Hunter 
have divided this book into three sections: basic knowledge,
intermediate 
topics, and advanced topics. The introductory chapter
addresses networking 
models and protocol suites, including the International
Standards 
Organization Open Systems Interconnection (ISO/OSI)
model, the TCP/IP-Ethernet 
protocols, and the IEEE 802.3 protocols. The TCP/IP-Ethernet
protocol 
presented is a shorter UNIX model that includes the
IEEE 802.3 protocols. 
The Hunters tackle the difficult subject of data encapsulation
by 
comparing it to a postal service with three agencies.
The example 
discusses the concepts of packets, datagrams, and frames
clearly and 
sensibly. A technical approach to data encapsulation
follows the metaphorical 
one.<P>

The section on basic knowledge continues with chapters
on network 
topology and the network media used, i.e., thicknet,
thinnet, twisted-wire 
pair, or fiber optic cable; active devices, including
transceivers, 
repeaters, bridges, routers, gateways, and other specialized
devices, 
and also including a discussion of  which device is
more appropriate 
for different uses; and network design, creation, and
implementation. 
The network design chapter lists factors to consider
when designing 
a network and prior to purchasing any components, then
presents some 
example networks and describes how they were designed.
Other topics 
addressed in the basics section include addressing,
Ethernet-TCP/IP 
Protocols, routers, file servers, YP servers, print
servers, clients, 
and setting up workstations.<P>

The intermediate section features &quot;Security and
Access Control,&quot; 
plus &quot;Monitoring and Diagnostics.&quot; Different
systems use different 
ways of providing security. Some use Kerberos, from
MIT's Project 
Athena, and some use secure NFS. System V Release 4
and AIX both use 
a shadow file to shield the password encryption in the
passwd 
file from the users. Which diagnostics or monitoring
tools you use 
may depend on the size of your network. If commercial
products aren't 
in your budget, you'll want to use some of the tools
already on your 
system, such as ping, spray, vmstat, pstat, 
netstat, etherfind, and rpcinfo. Bruce and 
Karen Hunter describe these tools and tell you how to
use them. They 
also explain the terms protocol analyzer, network analyzer,
network 
monitor, and network manager, as well as discussing
some specific 
products, including SunNet Manager, SynOptic's Network
Manager, and 
Concord's Trakker Network Monitoring System.<P>

The advanced section addresses &quot;Mail and Sendmail
Administration,&quot; 
&quot;DNS and BIND,&quot; &quot;Administering the X
Window System,&quot; 
and &quot;Network Scenarios.&quot; The X Window System
is treated from 
the administrator's perspective rather than from the
user's viewpoint. 
On the theory that it's easier for an administrator
to cope with problems 
if he/she knows something about the system, the Hunters
provide a 
basic introduction to the X Window System, including
a glossary of 
terms and an explanation of the X client/server relationship.
They 
present an installation summary and installation considerations,
such 
as what the user might want and how to accomplish the
task, as well 
as some answers to problems that might arise during
installation.<P>

A particular useful chapter is &quot;Network Scenarios,&quot;
which 
presents several networking problems and solutions.
The authors don't 
just give the solution to the problem, however; they
present guidelines 
for handling future problems:<P>

Once you solve a problem, take the time to find out
what 
happened. Then, when the same problem comes up, you
know exactly what 
to do [page 357].<P>

UNIX Networks is an excellent resource for installing
and administer 
UNIX networks. It is both a practical guide to UNIX
networks and an 
in-depth look at many topics not usually examined in
administration 
books. In addition to code examples and screen outputs,
the authors 
have included diagrams and figures that help clarify
concepts. The 
writing style is comfortable, and the authors give the
reader a history 
of different ideas, as well as a glimpse of what the
future may hold. 
The present is described in detail.<P>

Bruce H. and Karen Bradford Hunter previously published
root 
magazine (a forerunner to Sys Admin), and UNIX Networks

displays a small box featuring the root dragon on the
cover. 
The authors have produced an excellent addition to the
UNIX library. 
I highly recommend it for system administrators, network
administrators, 
and UNIX users in general.<P>

<B><I>The Internet Complete Reference</I><br>
by Harley Hahn and Rick Stout<br>
Osborne McGraw-Hill<br>
ISBN 0-07-881980-6</B><P>

Hahn and Stout have produced a user-friendly guide to
the Internet. 
They begin with an introduction to the Internet, then
explains how 
to use this book and considers whether or not the reader
needs to 
know UNIX. The next chapter explains how the Internet
works, then 
covers hosts and terminals and client/server systems,
including the 
X Window System. The authors then present a quick and
often entertaining 
tour of Internet resources, including electronic mail,
Usenet, Anonymous 
FTP, Archie, Gopher, WAIS servers, and the World-Wide
Web. At this 
point, they display a roadmap which contains the Internet
resources, 
a brief description of each resource, and the respective
chapters 
that discuss it.<P>

Hahn and Stout recommend that users begin by reading
the first four 
chapters, which feature sections on networks, TCP/IP,
types of Internet 
connections, and Internet addressing. Once done with
the introductory 
material, the reader may choose which sections of the
book to examine 
next. Possible choices include excellent explanations
of the Internet 
mail system, Telnet, Usenet, the rn, trn, nn, and tin
newsreaders, 
Anonymous FTP, Archie, Gopher, Veronica, Jughead, WAIS,
the World-Wide 
Web, and Mailing Lists. The authors also include a catalog
of Internet 
Resources, public access to the Internet, and a list
of Usenet discussion 
groups. In addition, Hahn and Stout explain how to discover
public 
information about an individual using the Finger service,
how to participate 
in discussions using Internet Relay Chat or Talk, and
what file formats 
are commonly used on the Internet.<P>

This book presents a great deal of useful information
pertaining to 
the Internet. The authors explore each topic thoroughly
and discuss 
the different services in detail, providing examples,
a summary of 
different ways to utilize the service, and messages
the user may receive 
and what they mean. The chapters are divided into small
segments, 
which enables the busy reader to digest small portions
without disrupting 
the book's continuity. I recommend this book for anyone
interested 
in the Internet, whether advanced or would-be traveler.<P>

<B><I>The Internet Yellow Pages</I><br>
by Harley Hahn and Rick Stout<br>
Osborne McGraw-Hill<br>
ISBN 0-07-882023-5</B><P>

This book provides the Internet user with a directory
of Internet 
resources and Usenet newsgroups and includes both descriptions
of 
the resources and instruction on how to connect to them.
It can also 
become a way to spend hours on the Internet without
logging on to 
a computer. The illustrations and the accompanying texts
can sidetrack 
the reader very easily -- from agriculture and art to
four sections 
on government to health and medicine, it doesn't take
much effort 
to lose track of time. Other subjects include literature,
music, jokes, 
jobs, cartoons, youth, quotations, pets, and travel,
as well as, of 
course, computers, software, and operating systems.<P>

The list goes on, with games, trivia, and the Swedish
Chef. The 
Internet Yellow Pages identifies over 2400 different
Internet resources 
in addition to the Usenet newsgroups, in alphabetical
order. This 
is the logical way to approach the Internet. This book
won't stay 
on any bookshelf long. It will be used too often.<P>

<B><I>Firewalls and Internet Security<br>
Repelling the Wily Hacker</I><br>
by William R. Cheswick and Steven M. Bellovin<br>
Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series<br>
ISBN 0-201-63357-4</B><P>

Cheswick and Bellovin address the problems of security
facing today's 
system administrator. They begin by asking what we are
trying to protect 
and from whom we are shielding the system's resources.
The answers 
to these questions, along with budget considerations,
will determine 
an organization's security policy. The authors advocate
the use of 
firewalls and define them by the properties that a firewall
should 
possess.<P>

This book uses a bomb icon to indicate serious security
risks. The 
first such symbol appears by the protecting passwords
section. As 
most system administrators know, most users do not select
truly secure 
passwords; consequently, user accounts are often easy
prey for an 
attacker. Cheswick and Bellovin offer suggestions for
defending the 
password file against such attacks. This section also
presents an 
overview of the TCP/IP protocol suite. The authors explore
the different 
layers, and produce a diagram of a sample TCP session
between client 
and server. As they look at routers, DNS, standard services,
RPC-based 
and file transfer protocols, information services, and
the X11 System, 
the areas of serious risk seem to proliferate. The authors
make very 
clear just how easy it is to infiltrate an unprotected
system.<P>

The second section, entitled &quot;Building Your Own
Firewall,&quot; 
examines firewall gateways, creating an application
gateway, authentication, 
gateway tools, and the hacker's tools. Cheswick and
Bellovin begin 
by properly defining gateways, firewalls, and the firewall
philosophy. 
They discuss what a firewall may cost and where firewalls
should be 
positioned within a system, then go on to describe the
limitations 
of a firewall. Some of the tools featured here are proxylib,

proxy, socks (no relation to Chelsea's cat), syslog,

tcpdump, ping, traceroute, and dig. <P>

&quot;A Look Back,&quot; the third section of the book,
details breaking 
and entering and presents an informative example, entitled
&quot;An 
Evening with Berferd.&quot; This chapter recounts the
attempts made 
by a hacker to compromise a system and the steps taken
to thwart him. 
Since no policy was in place to protect the system from
this sort 
of attack, the responses were necessarily ad hoc. The
final section 
of the book, &quot;Odds and Ends,&quot; includes &quot;Legal
Considerations,&quot; 
&quot;Secure Communications Over Insecure Networks,&quot;
and &quot;Where 
Do We Go From Here?&quot; The appendices include &quot;Useful
Free Stuff,&quot; 
&quot;TCP and UDP Ports,&quot; &quot;Recommendations
to Vendors,&quot; 
and a very complete Bibliography.<P>

Cheswick and Bellovin demonstrate how easy it may be
for a hacker 
to invade your system. Fortunately, they provide guidelines
that system 
administrators may follow to protect their systems against
intrusions. 
They also ask questions that focus on how secure your
system really 
is and introduce answers to help you defend that system.
Firewalls 
and Internet Security  merits the attention of system
administrators 
everywhere.<P>

<B><I>The Internet Navigator</I><br>
by Paul Gilster<br>
Foreword by Vinton G. Cerf<br>
John Wiley and Sons, Inc.<br>
ISBN 0-471-59782-1</B><P>

Gilster demonstrates how exciting the Internet can be
by displaying 
several places to visit, then continues by defining
the Internet and 
telling how it works. He explains how to obtain an Internet
account 
and how to access it. He provides the UNIX knowledge
that you will 
need to effectively use the Internet.<P>

Subjects discussed include FTP, Telnet, electronic mail,
BITNET, and 
USENET. To help readers learn how to find resources
and how to conduct 
a search, Gilster introduces Gopher, Veronica, Wide
Area Information 
Servers (WAIS), and the World-Wide Web. To further facilitate
the 
Internet experience, he provides an Internet Toolbox,
containing Finger, 
NSLOOKUP, Netfind, WHOIS, the CSO name server, and the
Knowbot Information 
Service. The toolbox also includes BITNET names, Campus
Wide Information 
Systems (CWIS), talk, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC).
The last section 
of the book consists of a directory of Internet Resources,
a discussion 
of the future of the Internet, and an appendix containing
dial-up 
Internet service providers.<P>

The primary strength of The Internet Navigator resides
in its 
diagrams and screen outputs. The author may use two
or three different 
screens to demonstrate how one example progresses. The
reader knows 
what his monitor will reflect at the beginning, middle,
and end of 
a session or activity. Gilster's careful presentation
of online services 
shows readers how to use these services effectively
with the Internet. 
He has produced a clearly written and worthwhile book
for the Internet 
traveler.  <P>
