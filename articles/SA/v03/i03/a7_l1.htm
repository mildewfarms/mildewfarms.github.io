# Master Profile - Listing 1
#
# This .profile is modified from the original SCO .profile installed by
# sysadmsh.  In order to not violate SCO copyright, only the enhancements
# to the original .profile are included in this file
#
# Standard SCO .profile for rsh with modifications by FLenk for customer users.
# ATTENTION:  The Master Copy of this .profile is kept in /usr/public/profile.
#   The master copy must be linked into all customer's work areas.  Customers
#   use a restricted shell so the linked copy is put in the customers
#   $HOME:
#       ln /usr/public/profile customers/home/.profile
#   Oracle has not made it very clear as to how to use its product in a
#   restricted shell environment.  Therefore, this profile, as well as the menu
#   and the special Xoraenv version of oraenv are all very tightly cooperating.
#   Changing anything in any of the 3 files may break the system or defeat
#   restricted shell, or allow shell escapes.

# Check terminal type:  An additional management requirement was that the
# SysAdmin must provide customized terminal definitions for every supported PC
# terminal emulation, and every supported terminal each PC emulation provides.
# This includes Unix termdef, Oracle termdef and termdefs for every application
# used on the host.  While this has significant maintenance costs, it is
# believed that this will make the user interface easier for customers by
# being able to specify keytop labels associated with the IBM PC keyboard
# rather than the terminal being emulated.
#
# Note that the terminals referenced are quite unique to our environment, and
# will not exist on other hosts.  However, the original code has been
# left in to demonstrate the possibilities.

do not know what kind of terminal you have, or if your terminal is not
listed below, enter \&quot;none\&quot; and you will be logged off.  If you do not
know, please check with your local computer tech for clarification.  If
you enter the wrong terminal type, your screen and keyboard WILL NOT WORK
correctly.

3) PC (HP2392a) using Reflections emulation via local PC or LAN Menu.
4) (Option not currently in use.)
5) HP2392a dumb terminal.
