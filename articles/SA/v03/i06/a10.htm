<H1>Books: A User's Report</H1><p>
<P>
Elizabeth Zinkann<P>

This month so many books have been released that it
was difficult 
to choose which ones to review. Consequently, the selection
ranges 
from AIX, file formats, and the Internet to a special
section on O'Reilly's 
4.4BSD collection. In addition to the 4.4BSD collection,
the assortment 
this month includes: An AIX Companion, by David L. Cohn;
Access 
the Internet!, by David Peal; Encyclopedia of Graphics
File 
Formats, by James D. Murray and William vanRyper; Internet

CD, by Vivian Neou; Internetworking, by Colin Smythe;
net.speak 
the internet dictionary, by Tom Fahey; and Finding It
on the 
Internet, by Paul Gilster.<P>

Several books that I have previously reviewed are now
in their second 
edition. Although I cannot review them all, I am mentioning
the second 
editions for your information. The newest books with
revised editions 
include: All about Administering NIS+, by Rick Ramsey
(Prentice 
Hall, ISBN 0-13-309576-2, $42); Mastering Make, by Clovis
Tondo, 
Andrew Nathanson, and Eden Yount (Prentice Hall, ISBN
0-13-121906-5, 
$22); and Internetworking with TCP/IP, Volume II, by
Douglas 
E. Comer and David L. Stevens (Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-125527-4,

$50). For Internet users, two books that have been modified
to reflect 
current changes are: The Internet Navigator, by Paul
Gilster 
(John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., ISBN 0-471-05260-4 $24.95),
and The 
Internet Companion Plus by Tracy LaQuey (Addison-Wesley
ISBN 0-201-40837-6 
$19.95). Gilster revised his book extensively to keep
pace with the 
changing Internet and includes a section on using FTP
on Delphi. Tracy 
LaQuey's book has always been a favorite and just keeps
improving 
while maintaining a size that fits handily next to my
keyboard for 
rapid searches. UNIX Shell Programming, by Lowell Jay
Arthur 
and Ted Burns (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., ISBN 0-471-59941-7
$29.95), 
is in its third edition, and addresses the topic for
the novice, experienced 
user, and system administrator using the Bourne, C,
or Korn shells. 
It also explores the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
and the linkages 
between the shell and X Windows.<P>

<B><I>An AIX Companion</I><br>
by David L. Cohn<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-291220-1<br>
$38.00</B><P>

This book provides an excellent introduction to the
UNIX operating 
system, with a detailed focus on IBM's AIX version.
Dr. Cohn carefully 
guides the PC manager through the knowledge necessary
to become an 
AIX system manager. He assumes that the reader possesses
a basic background 
in computing, whether or not UNIX or AIX related.<P>

The book is organized in three sections: Using UNIX
and AIX, Understanding 
UNIX and AIX, and Managing UNIX and AIX. In addition
to setup and 
installation, the first section addresses basic AIX
uses and introduces 
InfoExplorer, the AIX help utility, electronic mail,
and the AIX implementation 
of devices. The second section includes operating system
concepts, 
the AIX file system, processes, users and permissions,
the INed editor, 
and UNIX utilities. The final section focuses on the
more advanced 
concepts of shells, shell programming, system management,
and networking. 
Three appendices contain the INed, telnet, and FTP commands
and subcommands. 
Throughout the book, shaded sidebars address the reader
informally.<P>

To show how easily a PC user can become familiar with
an AIX workstation, 
Cohn analyzes AIX's relationship to DOS, Windows, and
the Macintosh 
operating system. He presents a mix of basic UNIX information
and 
AIX-specific information, showing both what they share
and how they 
differ. Numerous screen outputs, figures, flowcharts,
tables, and 
diagrams supplement the text. However, the sidebars
provide the most 
valuable information; in these, Cohn includes tips,
bits of history, 
and some personal clarifications.<P>

An AIX Companion was written by an entertaining and
knowledgeable 
author. He presents the topics in a logical sequence,
so that a PC 
user can understand the presentation easily. This book
fills a void 
in the UNIX publishing world. Anyone involved with AIX
can benefit 
from the material here.<P>


<B><I>Access the Internet!</I><br>
by David Peal<br>
Sybex Inc.<br>
ISBN 0-7821-1529-2<br>
$19.99<br>
Disk Included</B><P>

Peal addresses the Internet, its utilities, and a way
to access it 
easily. Netcom's NetCruiser software accompanies the
text and provides 
all the tools necessary for surfing the Net, plus a
Windows interface. 
In the introduction, the author enumerates the advantages
of the NetCruiser 
software, explains the format and organization of the
book, and discusses 
who the book will benefit.<P>

Three special icons -- Tips, Notes, and Warnings --
denote different 
types of information about NetCruiser and are employed
throughout 
the text. The audience can be novices, current Internet
PC users, 
or experienced corporate users establishing a home Internet
link. 
The inside front covers provide two different types
of information. 
One shows a menu with various Internet capabilities,
a brief description 
of some uses, and references to the chapter that describes
each use. 
The second features five Internet utilities, the individual
toolbars 
associated with each utility, their meanings, and a
brief demonstration 
of how to use them.<P>

In the first chapter, Peal examines the benefits of
the NetCruiser 
software. (Installation and configuration instructions
are presented 
in Appendix A; Appendix B explains how to keep both
NetCruiser and 
Access the Internet! current.) Chapters 2 through 7
discuss 
the six major utilities used on the Internet: electronic
mail, Usenet, 
Telnet, FTP (file transfer protocol), Gopher, and the
World Wide Web. 
Peal itemizes the essential procedures associated with
these tools, 
then covers some of their more informal aspects. These
include a listing 
of some Usenet newsgroups (and a description of their
participants), 
a definition of MUDs (multi-user dimensions) and some
hints about 
them for the uninitiated, available online publications,
education, 
i.e., learning C++ on the Internet, recipes, and one

of my favorites, 
bringing art to the desktop (Monet is a favorite).<P>

One of the most valuable chapters in the book concerns
FTP. As I travel 
the Internet and online services, I find the bewilderment
surrounding 
the downloading procedure astonishing. This topic generates
more questions, 
confusion, problems, and genuine apprehension than any
other feature. 
Peal explains the concept very logically, and details
what kinds of 
files can be transferred and what tools the user needs
to access them. 
A table shows file extensions, file types, and retrieval
mode. The 
chapter also addresses file compression, downloading
multiple files 
simultaneously, and practicing safe and nice (considerate)
transfers.<P>

With the software included with the book, a reader can
access the 
Internet within minutes. The installation instructions
are complete, 
easy to follow, and accurate. Netcom includes a free
month of access 
and free updates via the Internet. The book can be maintained
in the 
same manner. The disk is affixed to the book in such
a way that the 
book is not damaged when you remove the disk. The book
is well-written, 
nicely formatted for easy reading, and employs varied
visual aids: 
figures, diagrams, tables, photographs, screen representations,
icons, 
and shaded sidebars. A particular virtue is that Access
the Internet! 
lets you quickly locate forgotten instructions while
logged in to 
the Internet. Peal succeeds in both encouraging and
enabling the reader 
to venture into cyberspace.<P>

<B><I>Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats</I><br>
by James D. Murray and William vanRyper<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-058-9<br>
$59.95<br>
CD-ROM Included</B><P>

Almost all applications now uses some kind of graphics
data. When 
a user works with more than one environment, the myriad
formats often 
cause confusion and complications. Murray and vanRyper
have produced 
a book for graphics programmers and application programmers
who must 
occasionally become graphics specialists. The book consists
of two 
parts: an overview and the graphics file formats.The
overview covers 
computer graphics basics, bitmap and vector files, metafiles,
platform 
dependencies, format conversions, data compression,
and multimedia 
formats. The second part focuses on approximately 100
file formats; 
each entry contains classification data, an overview,
and specific 
format details. The appendices furnish information pertaining
to the 
CD-ROM, including how to use it for each platform, and
supplementary 
online resources. A glossary explaining many graphics
terms and acronyms 
is also provided. The CD-ROM contains software programs
for MS-DOS, 
Windows, OS/2, UNIX, and Macintosh platforms.<P>

Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats is an extremely
well-written 
and thoroughly researched book. The logical clarity
of the text reflects 
the expertise of the authors. This book fills a void
and is the only 
book needed for graphics formats for every platform.<P>

<B><I>Internet CD</I><br>
by Vivian Neou<br>
SRI International<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-123852-3<br>
$49.95<br>
CD-ROM Included</B><P>

The wealth of information about the Internet on this
CD-ROM will interest 
even experienced users. It contains software products
for Windows, 
DOS, and UNIX users, and explains how to install the
CD-ROM and use 
the packages on it. The introduction (Chapter One) defines
who the 
CD-ROM is for, the hardware requirements, the software
included, the 
documentation, and how to find anything on the CD. One
of the most 
valuable segments of the CD provides collections of
Requests for Comments 
(RFCs), For Your Information (FYIs), Internet Experiment
Notes (IENs), 
and networking mailing lists archives. These are indexed
and the user 
can easily search for documents by using the IFIND program.
Other 
software on the CD includes Eudora, an email package;
Linux, which 
is 386/486 UNIX; Gopher, Telnet, INFOPOP and IPWIN,

which furnish 
information about the Internet, FTP, UUPC, WAIS, Crynwr
Packet Drivers, 
and Trumpet, shareware PC networking software.<P>

The second chapter describes how to use the CD-ROM on
your system, 
and how it is organized. Chapter Three briefly discusses
the Internet 
and its utilities. Although the software on the CD-ROM
is greater 
than the amount of text to explain it, Neou devotes
two general chapters 
to using it: one explores the DOS and Windows software;
the second, 
the UNIX programs. The remaining chapters address IFIND,
Linux, UUPC 
(UUCP for PCs), and the PC Gopher III User's Manual.
The four appendices 
furnish a glossary, a list of service providers with
pertinent information, 
PC SLIP FAQ (by Ashok Aiyar), and a reference list of
books pertaining 
to the Internet.<P>

Neou's writing style is logical, clear, and straightforward.
She uses 
figures and diagrams when applicable, but relies mainly
on examples 
of screen output to ensure that the reader is using
the tools correctly. 
As a reviewer, I am often asked for a good reference
for RFCs. This 
is the book I now recommend.<P>

<B><I>Internetworking</I><br>
by Colin Smythe<br>
Addison-Wesley<br>
0-201-56536-6<br>
$37.75</B><P>

Internetworking is a means of keeping systems flexible
enough to adopt 
to rapid technological change. Smythe's book tries to
clarify several 
misconceptions about internetworking and to provide
the reader with 
a better understanding of the theory of internetworking,
the function(s) 
of its components, and its relationship to the Open
Systems Interconnection 
Reference Model (OSI/RM).<P>

Smythe begins by introducing current networking terms,
then proceeds 
to describe the internetworking of local area networks.
He addresses 
network architectures, protocols, the OSI reference
model, local area 
networks, token ring LANs, established networks, network
relays, repeaters, 
bridges, routers, gateways, network administration,
internetwork design, 
and advanced network architectures. Smythe also discusses
some conclusions 
on networking, internetworking, and the future. <P>

Many tables and figures to augment the text. Each chapter
provides 
both an introduction and a summary. Appendices include
a bibliography, 
abbreviations, glossary, and standards referenced throughout
the book. 
Some of the topics are complex, but Smythe's presentation
makes them 
easy for the reader to follow. This is a well-written
book, exemplifying 
the challenges facing today's network specialists.<P>

<B><I>net.speak
the internet dictionary</I><br>
by Tom Fahey<br>
Edited by Ruffin Prevost<br>
Hayden Books<br>
ISBN 1-56830-095-6<br>
$15.00</B><P>

Like other highly specialized systems, the Internet
has its own acronyms 
and vocabulary. Here, however, the user also encounters
a new etiquette 
(netiquette) and a form of shorthand, such as LOL (Laughing
Out Loud) 
and RSN (Real Soon Now), that often appear in email
messages or chat 
sessions. Emoticons combine characters to produce faces
that can convey 
an emotion, :-&amp; (tongue-tied), a habit :-? (pipe
smoker), or a celebrity 
%-^ (Picasso) in an email message or chat session.<P>

Fahey defines over 2,000 Internet terms in net.speak.
Arranged 
in the normal A-Z dictionary format, the entries feature
a brief description 
of the term, occasionally accompanied by its history.
Some terms require 
a longer explanation, and diagrams or sketches demonstrate
a concept 
when applicable, as with routing or LAN topologies.
Tables present 
FTP commands, filename extensions, and gopher servers,
while menu 
notations, commands, and some informative bits of Internet
trivia 
are sprinkled throughout the book. TIPS discuss ways
to economize 
time and money while on the Internet. For each time
an Internet provider, 
available software, or service, mentioned, Fahey provides
email, FTP, 
or gopher access information. Although the book is organized
in alphabetical 
order, the first chapter, entitled &quot;123,&quot;
contains the entries 
which begin with a number, eliminating the guesswork
usually associated 
with this type of entry.<P>

This is an excellent book; its practical considerations
merit the 
attention of every Internet and online service user.
It complements 
other Internet books, and can be easily referenced and
quickly read 
(for those embarrassing times when an acronym, emoticon,
or command 
momentarily eludes the user). You will use it constantly
for its terms, 
tricks, tips, and acronyms.<P>

<B><I>Finding It on the Internet
The Essential Guide to archie, Veronica, Gopher, 
WAIS, WWW(Including Mosaic),
and Other Search and Browsing Tools</I><br>
by Paul Gilster<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.<br>
ISBN 0-471-03857-1<br>
$19.95</B><P>

The first thing that impressed me as I opened this book
was the inside 
cover, which displays common Internet search commands,
including archie, 
Gopher, WAIS, and the World Wide Web. Individual chapters
include 
&quot;Internet Navigation Tools&quot;; &quot;archie:
Finding Files&quot;; 
&quot;Gopher: Finding Resources by Menu&quot;; &quot;Veronica:
Gopher 
as Search Engine&quot;; &quot;WAIS: Searching for Text&quot;;
&quot;World 
Wide Web: Hypertext As Browsing Tool&quot;; &quot;HYTELNET:
The Database 
on Your Computer&quot;; &quot;WHOIS, netfind, X.500:
Finding People&quot;; 
&quot;E-Mail: Noninteractive Searching&quot;; and &quot;CNIDR:
The Future 
of Internet Searching.&quot; With more people accessing
the Internet, 
a little more confusion has been added, so that trying
to find something 
or someone invites complications and frustration. This
book attempts 
to simplify these problems.<P>

Gilster describes some of the unknowns involved in searching:
Is it 
real? Is it the most current release or a beta version?
Is the information 
accurate? He then discusses the most popular methods
for searching 
for data and demonstrates the proper procedures for
finding answers. 
He begins with a brief discussion of each tool and its
proper use. 
The different utilities perform related tasks in distinctive
ways. 
Gilster examines how one tool works. He also discusses
their separate 
origins and how each contributes to the Internet. The
author shows 
those who only have e-mail access to the Internet how
to conduct a 
search via electronic mail. He also illustrates the
eccentricities 
of each utility through sample searches.<P>

Finding It on the Internet impressively answers one
of the 
most frequently asked Internet questions, &quot;How
can I find ..?&quot;<P>

<B><I>4.4BSD-Lite</I><br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.</B><P>

The 4.4BSD-Lite, distributed by the Computer Systems
Research Group 
of the University of California at Berkeley, the Usenix
Association, 
and O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc., is available directly
from O'Reilly 
&amp; Associates, Inc. as sets (Volumes 1-5 plus the
CD-ROM ISBN 1-56592-081-1 
$150.00; Volumes 1-5 only ISBN 1-56592-077-5, $120.00)
or individually 
from your local bookseller.<P>

<B><I>4.4BSD-Lite CD-ROM Companion</I><br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-081-3<br>
$40.00</B><P>

The CD-ROM includes the source code, manual pages, and
other documentation 
relating to 4.4BSD-Lite. It does not provide any program
binaries. 
Although it has been named &quot;Lite,&quot; it contains
approximately 
95 percent of the utilities in 4.4BSD and almost all
of the files 
from the kernel. The accompanying text describes an
overview of 4.4BSD-Lite, 
the CD-ROM source hierarchy, an Introduction, List of
Manual Pages, 
and a Permuted Index.<P>

<B><I>4.4BSD System Manager's Manual</I><br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-080-5<br>
$30.00</B><P>

The System Manager's Manual presents a short introduction,

list of manual pages, and the permuted index. It also
contains the 
manual pages for commands specific to system administration,
plus 
the documentation written for system administrators.
On the inside 
back cover of each volume is a listing of the UNIX documents
and the 
volume they are included in.<P>

<B><I>4.4BSD Programmer's Reference Manual</I><br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-078-3<br>
$30.00</B><P>

The Programmer's Reference Manual contains four sections
of 
man pages: UNIX system calls, C Library Subroutines,
Special 
Files (device interfaces), and File Formats. Prior to
third-party 
documentation, these pages were the singular source
for many commands. 
Often belittled for being too succinct, these pages
established a 
uniform standard for documentation and, in many cases,
remain the 
best resource for quick and easy references. This volume
is not completely 
4.4BSD specific, and can be used with many other UNIX
implementations.<P>

<B><I>4.4BSD Programmer's Supplementary Documents</I><br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-079-1<br>
$30.00</B><P>

This volume complements The Programmer's Reference Manual.

It presents the technical papers originally used to
learn many of 
the UNIX utilities. (This UNIX user vividly recalls
using the curses 
technical paper to learn about screen management.) It
also contains 
some historical documents, including the original paper,
&quot;The 
UNIX Time-Sharing System,&quot; by Dennis Ritchie and
Ken Thompson, 
and &quot;UNIX Programming -- Second Edition,&quot;
by Brian W. Kernighan 
and Dennis M. Ritchie. (I now remember how I became
good at reading 
and understanding abstracts and technical papers.) The
most recent 
addition is a two-part tutorial on 4.4BSD Interprocess
Communication 
(IPC).<P>

<B><I>4.4BSD User's Reference Manual</I><br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-075-9<br>
$30.00</B><P>

The man pages sections for the User's Reference Manual

feature helpful guides to the 4.4BSD user programs,
games, and miscellaneous 
information. The last division primarily describes the
text processing 
information used by UNIX. This manual also applies to
other UNIX implementations. 
I opened it randomly and happened to find the vi pages.
I 
had forgotten just how straightforward the man pages
format 
is. Within a few pages, all of the vi commands were
listed, 
including the options, their results, and the commands
and options 
specific to the ex and view editors. The reference 
manuals provide a simple and direct resource for users,
programmers, 
and system administrators.<P>

<B><I>4.4BSD User's Supplementary Documents</I><br>
