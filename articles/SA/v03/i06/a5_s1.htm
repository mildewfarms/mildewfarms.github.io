<H1>Sidebar: A Useful Package</H1><p>
<P>
In the course of testing and working with all of these
products, I 
came upon several that did not meet our specific needs
but were nonetheless 
excellent packages. One of these is JSB's Multiview
Desktop. This 
application has a feature called transparent printing
that does pretty 
much what we wanted to do. However, it had one drawback:
in order 
for a printer to be shared, the PC with the printer
not only had to 
be on, but also had to be logged into UNIX. <P>

JSB works as follows: when a login is made to UNIX,
JSB creates a 
file in the device directory with the name you've assigned
to your 
local printer. Anytime you use the standard lp command
and 
specify that file name for the printer name, the print
job is transferred 
to the local printer connected to your PC. For example,
if you want 
to call your local printer &quot;home,&quot; then the
following command 
would send a print job to your printer:<P>
<PRE>
cat filename | lp -d home</pre><p>
<p>
These print requests do go through Window's print manager,
so print 
jobs sent from different origins can be handled correctly.
The beauty 
of this product is that this feature is not a network-only
feature, 
it works for serial connections as well. So if I have
this program 
at home and I dial into a client's site or my home office,
I can redirect 
any of my print jobs back to my home printer. But wait,
it gets even 
better: JSB also has a host support module that can
be installed on 
the UNIX machine. With the module installed, when you
login using 
JSB's terminal emulator either via a network or serial
connection, 
you can have up to eight simultaneous connections, each
one in a separate 
Windows window. How many times have you dialed into
a client's site 
and wished you had more than one login? Maybe being
on the leading 
edge of technology isn't so bad after all. <P>
