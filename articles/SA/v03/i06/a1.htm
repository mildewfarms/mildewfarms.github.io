<H1>Computer Security Revisited: Physical Security</H1><p>
<P>
Neal S. Jamison<P>

Every system administrator must contend with computer
security. As 
computer systems become increasingly networked and internetworked,

administrators must be constantly aware of the threat
of someone attempting 
to break in or to corrupt data. Accordingly, almost
every book or 
journal written about UNIX administration discusses
some facet of 
security. However, there is a very dangerous omission
in most of these: 
they ignore physical security.<P>

Theft of computers and computer components has become
a significant 
problem. Statistics compiled by the National Stolen
Computer Registry 
show that theft in 1992 involved over 700,000 computers
and totaled 
over $800 million in losses -- and these are only the
cases that 
were reported. The registry also reports that individual
components 
such as RAM, hard disks, and CPU chips are being lifted
more frequently 
than entire PCs.<P>

As client/server networks that utilize x86 personal
computers are 
implemented and as UNIX migrates to the x86 desktop,
traditional UNIX 
administrators find themselves responsible for more
than just traditional 
UNIX machines. As users become more aware of their computing
environment, 
and as computer platforms at work more closely resemble
the home PC, 
computer theft will become more prevalent.<P>

You can take several steps to minimize your risk as
a system administrator, 
or to give yourself a better chance of recovering stolen
equipment 
in the event that this does happen.<P>

<B>Securing Your Systems</B><P>

<B>1. Put the user in charge.</B>
When you place a system on a user's desk, tell the 
user that he/she is responsible for that system.<P>

<B>2. Inventory everything.</B>
You must know exactly what you have. Keep a database

that records a description of every component in each
computer. This 
should include serial numbers, manufacturer part numbers,
estimated 
replacement value, etc. Every time a change is made
to the system, 
make sure that this database gets updated. If something
gets stolen, 
your chances of recovery are much greater if you can
determine exactly 
what was stolen. Organizations such as the National
Stolen Computer 
Registry can help recover stolen parts, but only if
the component 
serial numbers are recorded. How many of us actually
open each and 
every computer and record that information?<P>

<B>3. Re-inventory often.</B>
Inform users that there will be a periodic check 
of the equipment. This does not have to make users feel
that they 
are not trusted -- it can also function as a monthly
maintenance 
check.<P>

A number of tools can help you manage a re-inventory.
Certain network 
management tools will let you know if a system has been
powered off, 
or even if the configuration has changed. A simple implementation

of this is the UNIX command rup. rup polls all hosts
on the local 
network, returning a value for that host similar to
that of uptime. 
If you check this regularly, you can easily see if a
computer has 
been recently taken down. If you find that this has
occurred, check 
the system to ensure that there is not a problem.<P>

<B>4. Secure the computer and its components as much as
possible.</B>
Many vendors now sell devices that not only tether 
equipment to the furniture, but can also prevent unwelcome
entry to 
the computer. An investment of less than $100 per workstation
is very 
small when compared to replacing costly components.<P>

Many computer manufacturers are using computer cases
that can be locked. 
If you have this capability, use it. Leaving the key
in the lock on 
the user's desk will only provoke anyone who is tempted.
Label these 
keys and keep them in a safe place.<P>

Replace the screws in the computer case with special
screws requiring 
an uncommon tool for removal. If a would-be thief cannot
easily open 
a case without damaging it, he/she may be deterred.
Most burglars 
want their action to go unnoticed.<P>

If your cases cannot be locked, you can purchase special
holographic 
&quot;security&quot; labels that, once removed, leave
a residue and 
cannot be reused . Each of these labels has a serial
number that can 
be tracked in the database mentioned above. Place one
of these over 
a seam in the computer case. Once these labels are in
place, the re-inventory 
mentioned above is reduced to simply &quot;swapping
howdys&quot; with 
the user and glancing down to ensure that the numbered
label is intact.<P>

<B>5. Limit access.</B>
Most offices keep valuable equipment behind locked 
doors to keep outsiders away. But some control must
be exercised over 
employees also. Keep track of who has access to rooms
where computer 
equipment is used or stored. Maintain a log of who is
working after 
hours and on weekends. If a magnetic ID card lock is
used and a theft 
takes place over a weekend, it is easy to find out who
was in the 
office during the period in question. <P>

<B>Conclusion</B><P>

While we all like to think that our users are honest,
law-abiding 
citizens, the truth is that some of them are not. Computer
theft recently 
hit close to home for me, when three PCs on a client/server
network 
that I was responsible for were pilfered. Replacing
the parts was 
almost as expensive as throwing out the remains and
purchasing three 
new computers. Had I used some of the above practices,
this theft 
could have been prevented.<P>

When computers are pilfered, everyone pays. System administrators

pay because of the unnecessary headache. The users pay
because of 
the increased security hassles and possible downtime
in their network. 
The organization as a whole pays, because replacing
stolen components 
is not cheap, and often when a hard drive disappears,
so may valuable 
or proprietary data. When theft takes place, everyone
is a suspect. 
It is your job to minimize the risk and ensure that
your computer 
environments remain intact. <P>
