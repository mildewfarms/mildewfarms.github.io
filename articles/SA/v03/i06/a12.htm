<H1>Questions and Answers</H1><p>
<P>
Bjorn Satdeva<P>

The LISA VIII System Administration Conference took
place in San Diego, 
CA, September 19 to 24th. The size of this year's conference
was about 
the same as last year's, roughly 1200 people, which
is a lot of system 
administrators in one small place! The technical content
of the conference 
this year was a bit disappointing to me, because several
of the papers 
addressed topics that had been covered at earlier LISA
conferences 
and some of the talks were essentially rehashes of material
the speakers 
had presented before.<P>

Some of the papers I found most useful and interesting
were: &quot;Kernel 
Mucking in Top,&quot; by William LeFebvre, from Argonne
National Laboratory, 
a much overdue paper describing some of the issues in
the very popular 
top program, a ps substitute; and &quot;Managing the

Ever-Growing To Do List,&quot; by Emy Edward, Northwestern
University, 
a paper describing a request-like program, to manage
the admin's 
job queue.<P>

However, the main reason for going was, as always, to
touch base with 
many other system administrators, and simply to compare
notes on a 
person-to-person basis. So even if the speculations
voiced by some 
people -- that LISA may be at a place where it is growing
ever 
larger but its technical content is starting to slip
-- turns out 
to be correct, LISA will still be one of the major conference
on my 
agenda for years to come.<P>

The Interop tradeshow has also taken place, this year
in Atlanta, 
GA. This trade show is also growing bigger each time,
and it is in 
fact getting harder to get good technical information
there. For many 
of the vendors, marketing is increasingly taking precedence
at the 
cost of technical information. The show can be a good
opportunity 
to learn specifics from vendors chosen in advance, but,
as always, 
the most fun places to go were the small startup companies,
with new 
products.<P>

Of products in the latter category, I liked the &quot;Top
of Mind&quot; 
help disk software from the Molley Group, Inc. The product
is intended 
to allow the user to interact directly with a Windows-based
program 
which will ask questions and guide the user to a solution.
The product 
currently runs only under Windows, but UNIX versions
are in the works. 
The software demonstration was very impressive, but
I of course do 
not know how well this product will stand up in a real
environment. 
The Molley Group can be contacted at (201) 884-2040.<P>

I also took the opportunity to stop at the Novell booth,
to ask about 
their vision of what is to come for UNIX. So far, Novell
has totally 
failed to establish any direction for the future of
UNIX, which is 
in many ways unfortunate. However, I was assured by
the people at 
the booth that Novell is about to change this picture,
and that we 
should see evidence of this over the next few months.
It is now a 
question whether this is at all possible, since Sun
has purchased 
a license-free copy of the System V Release 4 sources
for future development 
of their version of UNIX, and BSDI has another version,
based on BSD 
Net2 and 4.4, which is free of any license requirement
from Novell 
and USL.<P>

Next, a number of upcoming events. While LISA is over
for this year, 
the other main conference for system administrators
is ramping up 
on the East Coast. The Fourth Conference on System Administration,

Security, and Networking (SANS IV) will take place April
24-29, 1995, 
in Washington, DC. However, if you want to present a
paper at that 
conference, you need to get your proposal in right away,
as the deadline 
for this is November 1. Please contact sans@fedunix.org
for 
further information on this conference.<P>

Another upcoming conference is ETHICOMP95, the International
Conference 
on the Ethical Issues of Using Information Technology.
It is organized 
by De Montfort University, in the United Kindom, and
Southern Connecticut 
State University, in the United States. The conference
is scheduled 
to take place at De Montfort University, Leicester,
March 28 to 30, 
1995. From the Call for Papers (the deadline for which
precedes the 
publication of this issue of Sys Admin), it appears
that ETHICOMP95 
will provide an excellent forum for stimulating debate
on fundamental 
issues relating to the development and use of Information
Technology 
and Information Systems. There will be an opportunity
to consider 
approaches based on the different cultures/countries
of both conference 
presenters and conference delegates. The three-day conference
consists 
of three parallel themes. Each theme will comprise a
series of papers 
and workshops. For more information, contact Simon Rogerson,
Co-Director, 
ETHICOMP95, Department of Information Systems, De Montfort
University; 
voice: +44 533 577475; fax: +44 533 541891; or email:
srog@dmu.ac.uk.<P>

Yet another conference of interest for UNIX administrators
is the 
&quot;UNIX &amp; The Law&quot; Symposium, sponsored
by the Sun User Group, 
in Austin, TX, to take place November 14-17, 1994. This
conference 
is meant to create a forum where the members of the
once distinct 
areas of technology, legislation, and law enforcement
can meet to 
share experiences and ideas.  The conference consists
of a day of 
tutorials, two days of talks, and yet another day of
tutorials. For 
further conference information, contact the Sun User
Group, voice: 
(617) 232-0514; fax: (617) 232-1347; email: conference@sug.org<P>

And now to the real question and answers.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 At my site, if a user sends any internal mail from
some 
machines (say group A), the mail header consists of
&lt;username&gt;@machine_name; 
from other machines (say group B), if the same user
sends internal 
mail, the header is &lt;username&gt; only. We have tried
copying 
/etc/sendmail.cf from group B to group A machines and
have 
tried sending mail after killing and reinvoking /usr/lib/sendmail,

but the result is same.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 It sounds like entires in your /etc/hosts file 
are incorrect for some of your hosts. The sequence in
that file is 
more important than many man-pages and UNIX admin books
may 
lead you to believe. The first entry is of course the
IP address for 
the machine, and the second is the &quot;real&quot;
name of the machine, 
which must be fully qualified. Following the real name
can be as many 
aliases as you need. Second, you must ensure that when
you set the 
machine name (typically in /etc/rc on BSD systems, and
something 
like /etc/rc1.d/tcp on System V), you use the fully
qualified 
domain name. If you don't follow these rules stringently,
you will 
get the kind of unpredictability you described above.
Figure 1 shows 
some sample /etc/hosts entries.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Do you happen to know of any products that do password

encryption across the network so that the password could
not be read 
by an analyzer/sniffer? I cannot find one anyplace,
and it seems I've 
asked everyone who knows how to spell UNIX if they've
heard of such 
a thing.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I believe that there is no direct solution to this
problem. 
I have, however, two possible solutions for you, although
they do 
not address your question directly. One solution is
to implement Kerberos 
everywhere, in which case the need for sending the password
over the 
wire is eliminated. Another possibility is to implement
a challenge/response 
system, such as the S/Key free-ware or the Secure ID
from Security 
Dynamics. However, if your users do a lot of remote
logins, it will 
be a pain in the neck to use the challenge response
system.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 In the old days, the UNIX man pages came with 
a permutated index, which was helpful if you were looking
for a specific 
kind of operation or command, but did not know which
man page 
covered it. The UNIX system at my site does not have
this, and to 
make the situation worse, we have only the preformatted
man-pages, 
so the old macros do not allow us to build an index
ourselves. Is 
there any way we can get a permutated index for our
version of UNIX?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 It is very unfortunate, but it seems that permutated

indexes are a thing of the past. For people who are
unfamiliar with 
the permutated index, this was an index created by a
program, which 
extracted the the one-line description from the top
of the man page, 
and then did a sorted permutation, somewhat like this
short example, 
using the man-page for man:<P>
<PRE>
display the on-line manual pages    man(1)
display the     on-line manual pages  ............  man(1)
display the on-line     manual pages  ....................  man(1)
display the on-line manual     pages  ...........................  man(1)</pre><p>
<p>
Such a permutated index is, as stated in the question

above, very useful when you are looking for information
and do not 
know exactly which man page has it. We use BSDI on all
our 
machines, and the number of new programs that were picked
up from 
the Internet and are now included on their distribution
cd-rom is 
astonishingly large. A permutated index would have been
very useful, 
but BSDI did not provide one. I therefore wrote the
perl program in 
Listing 1. The program traverses the man-page directory
trees, 
and makes a best attempt at building a permutated index.
As it uses 
the preformatted man pages, it makes some mistakes here
and 
there, but still the output is good enough to be very
useful. <P>
