<H1>Sidebar: IP Addresses</H1><p>
<P>
IP addresses are used to uniquely identify your PC
or workstation 
to the network. Without an IP address, you are inaccessible
to the 
TCP/IP network. An IP address actually has two purposes:
it identifies 
not only the PC or workstation, but also which logical
network the 
machine belongs to. It is possible to have multiple
logical networks 
running across one physical network. For example, you
may have in 
your office one physical network, but three logical
networks, one 
for sales, one for accounting, and one for production.
All of these 
logical networks share the same physical network components;
however, 
they are logically independent of each other. <P>

The IP address itself is composed of four different
numbers, or  octlets. 
Each octlet has a purpose, and is separated from the
others with a 
period. The first octlet of the IP address designates
or identifies 
which network class you belong to. There are three classes
of networks. 
The differences between these classes is in the number
of hosts, or 
workstations, that can be configured into the logical
network at any 
given time. The following is a list of the three network
classes, 
the number of hosts that can belong to each class, and
the valid range 
of numbers that can be used in the first octlet to represent
that 
class:<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1>

<TH WIDTH=100 ALIGN=LEFT><B>Class</B></TH>
<TH WIDTH=200 ALIGN=LEFT><B>Valid IP Range</B></TH>
<TH WIDTH=200 ALIGN LEFT><B>Number Of Hosts</B></TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>A</TD>
<TD>1 - 126</TD>
<TD>16,777,216</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>B</TD>
<TD>128 - 191</TD>
<TD>65,534</TD>
</TR>

<TD>C</TD>
<TD>192 - 222</TD>
<TD>254</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

Note that 0 and 127 are reserved. If you're setting
up 
a TCP/IP network, you will need to determine which network
class you 
will belong to before assigning any IP addresses.<P>

The class that you belong to determines the algorithm
that will be 
used to identify the logical network and the actual
host address of 
your machine. If you belong to Class A, the first octlet
will identify 
which logical network you belong to, and the last three
octlets will 
identify the machine's address. If you belong to Class
B, the first 
two octlets will identify which logical network you
belong to, and 
the last two octlets will identify the machine's address.
And if you 
belong to Class C, the first three octlets will identify
which logical 
network you belong to, and the last octlet will identify
the machine's 
address.<P>

Once you have identified which class you will belong
to, you can  pick 
any numbers that you want for the octlets as long as
you follow the 
guidelines listed below:<P>

<li>Each logical network must have its own unique network

address.<P>

<li>All hosts in a logical network must have the same network

address.<P>

<li>All hosts in a logical network must have a unique host

address.<P>

<li>The range for the second and third octlets can be anywhere

from 0 - 255.<P>

<li>The range for the fourth octet is 0 - 254. <P>
