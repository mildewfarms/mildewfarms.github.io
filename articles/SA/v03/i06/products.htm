<B>NetLabs Ships AssetManager V1.1</B><P><P>

NetLabs, Inc. has begun shipping version 1.1 of AssetManager,
a tool 
which finds and tracks hardware and software resources
on a network. 
AssetManager is based on the following standards: SNMP,
OSF/Motif, 
and the IETF Host Resources MIB. AssetManager 1.1 supports
major UNIX 
workstations including versions for Sun, HP, and IBM
platforms. It 
runs under Sun SunNet Manager, HP Open View, and IBM
NetView/6000 
network management platforms, as well as NetLabs/DiMONS.
<P>

Using AssetManager, lets administrators maintain and
access information 
about hardware and software, automatically collecting
information 
from intelligent network devices such as Synoptics SuperAgents,
Intel 
LANDesk SNMP Gateway, NetWare Management System, IBM
Systems Monitor/6000, 
HP Open View Extensible SNMP Agents, and SUNConnect
SNMP Agent. AssetManager 
provides administrators with configuration, support,
maintenance, 
and other information about network assets.<P>

An AssetManager 1.1 server module license, which includes
software 
for managing database information and data collection,
costs $5,000. 
An AssetManager administrative user license, which includes
software 
for setup, initiation and configuration, costs $4,000.

<B>Freedman Sharp Releases PowerBroker</B><P><P>

Freedman Sharp and Associates, Inc. has released PowerBroker,
a tool 
to help UNIX sites implement secure, shared system administration.

PowerBroker gives system administrators control over
who can run what, 
when, and where in the root account, without knowing
the root password. 
PowerBroker can also create and maintain a log of programs
running 
as root. The system administrator configures PowerBroker
to accept 
requests from users to run specified programs as root
(or as other 
key accounts). Criteria for acceptance can include username,
program 
name, time, date, hostname, directory, group, and others.
The working 
environment for each program can be specified to address
the security 
issues surrounding root activities.<P>

PowerBroker selectively logs root activity, providing
an audit trail 
of important system actions. Optionally, PowerBroker
records entire 
sessions for later replay, to discover both user commands
and system 
responses during a session. PowerBroker can also attach
to sessions 
in progress for real-time monitoring. The network traffic
generated 
by PowerBroker can be encrypted.<P>

PowerBroker supports Sun, HP, IBM, DEC, SGI, and Motorola
UNIX platforms.

Microlink Technologies, Inc. has announced NetWizard,
a TCP/IP file 
transfer software package that works in conjunction
with FTP. NetWizard 
provides a graphical interface and supports encryption,
compression, 
access control, batch operation, and firewalls. NetWizard

system 
access, and security of their data when transmitting
files over public

even 
when sites connecting the system are not using NetWizard.

auto-batch feature lets users automatically transfer
files by mirroring 
the contents of a pre-specified directory to one on
a remote site. 
Other features include: X Window and TTY terminal support,
DES encryption, 
built-in compression, and error detection algorithms.<P>

NetWizard supports SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.x, and HP
