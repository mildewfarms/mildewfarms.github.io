<H1>Sidebar: Getting Connected</H1><p>
<P>
There are a number of ways to gain access to the Internet,
each with 
its benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, the type of
connection you 
choose depends largely on what you and your company
wish to achieve. 
If all you need is to exchange e-mail with other Internet
users and 
you are operating on a tight budget, you may be satisifed
with some 
form of dial-up access. On the other hand, if you want
access to the 
full spectrum of services available to members of the
Internet community, 
a dedicated connection is certainly the way to go. The
following information 
describes some of the available methods of connection,
approximate 
associated costs, necessary hardware and software, and
various advantages 
and disadvantages worthy of consideration.<P>


The cost information provided here is approximate and
based on information 
obtained from the providers listed below. It does not
include telephone 
company charges, or charges for leased lines. Startup
costs do not 
include any hardware or software which you may need
to purchase to 
become &quot;Internet ready.&quot; Services offered
by each provider 
vary widely. You should check with each provider to
find the service 
that's right for you.<P>

<B>Dial Up</B><P>

With dial-up access, your computer does not typically
get its own 
Internet address. Instead, you are buying access on
a computer operated 
by the service provider, and you gain access to the
Internet from 
there. You simply connect to that computer using your
modem, log in, 
and you're all set. Rates are reasonable, and usually
are based on 
flat fee. There may also be fees based on connect time.
You'll want 
a high-speed modem, at least 9600 baud. Great for home
users whose 
needs are limited.<P>

<I>Fees:
Startup (one time): $0-$19
Recurring (monthly): $9-$45
Connect Time (hourly): $2.00-$8.50</I><P>

<B>SLIP/PPP</B><P>

SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) and PPP (Point
to Point Protocol) 
services will bring you all the resources the Internet
has to offer. 
Using normal voice quality phone lines, and a high-speed
modem (V.32 
or V.32bis), your computer (or every computer on your
LAN) can have 
its own Internet address and access to the Internet
through the system 
to which the modem is connected. This type of connection
is usually 
offered on a demand (as needed) basis, where your modem
dials the 
nearest connection point, or on a dedicated basis, where
you use a 
leased line that is always connected. SLIP or PPP software
will be 
required for your host computer. Versions of these software
packages 
are available for many UNIX systems in the public domain.
Service 
providers may provide you with this software, or help
you find it. 
Not recommended for high traffic or interactive use.
If your primary 
needs are for email, USENET news, and ftp in low volume,
this is a 
good, fairly low-cost solution.<P>

<I>Fees:
Startup (one time): 		$300-$1500
Recurring (monthly): 	$175-$275</I><P>

<B>Dedicated (leased) Line</B><P>

Line speeds typically are 56kbs (kilobits per second)
and T1 (approximately 
1.5 Mega bits per second), and are dedicated digital
quality lines 
typically leased from the local phone company or from
companies such 
as Sprint or MCI. This requires a more substantial investment
in hardware, 
including a router and a curiously named device called
a CSU/DSU. 
This type of connection also gives you access to all
the Internet 
services, from every node on your local network. This
is how you'll 
want to go if you expect heavy interactive use, such
as telnet or 
rlogin sessions to remote locations. Note, though, that
a 56kbs line 
can be a bit unfriendly to this type of activity when
traffic gets 
heavy.<P>

<I>Fees:
Startup (one time): 	$2,000-$5,000
Recurring (monthly): 56kbs: $425-$1,800
T1: $1,025-$3,000</I><P>
