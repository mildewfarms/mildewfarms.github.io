<H1>Sidebar: What's Out There?</H1><p>
<P>
The following list gives you a small taste of the kinds
of services 
available to Internet users. Each service occupies its
own little 
niche in the vast web of information that is the Internet.<P>

<B>Finger</B><P>

A utility used to find information about the users of
a particular 
computer. You can finger a user at a remote site using
a command 
like:<P>
<PRE>
finger ryan@some.computer</pre><p>
<p>
If there is a user named ryan on some.computer, you
might 
see this:<P>
<PRE>
Login name: dryan                      In real life: Dan Ryan
Directory: /usr/users/ryan             Shell: /bin/csh
Last login Fri Dec 24 23:57 on console
Unread mail since Sat Dec 18 21:12:03 1993
No Plan.</pre><p>
<p>
<B>Whois</B><P>

Another utility used to find information about Internet
users, usually 
those involved with the government, or network service
providers.<P>

<B>E-mail</B><P>

Perhaps the most frequently used service on the whole
Internet. Whether 
it's with your brother-in-law at a university half-way
across the 
country or another systems administrator on the other
side of the 
globe, e-mail is a terrific way to exchange information.<P>

<B>Mailing Lists</B><P>

Mail distribution lists that cater to various special
interests. Mail 
sent to such a list is forwarded to each &quot;subscriber,&quot;
either 
a message at a time, or encapsulated in a digest form.<P>

<B>Anonymous FTP</B><P>

Utility that makes files available to anyone on the
Internet, without 
requiring a login and password on the computer acting
as the anonymous 
ftp server. Users establish an ftp connection, log in as user anonymous, and, 
as a courtesy, send their e-mail address as a password.  They then have the 
ability to get any file that has been made publicly available from that ftp server.<P>

<B>USENET News</B><P>

Newsgroup, newsgroups, and more newsgroups-perhaps more aptly titled 
discussion groups.  Usenet (often called net news) allows people to engage in on-line 
"conversations" with others having similar interests.  Discussion groups cover a large 
number of topics grouped under general headings.  Users "subscribe" to those groups 
of interest to them.  Access to news is through the use of news reader software. 
Several news readers are available in the public domain.  News groups of interest include  comp.sys.sgi.admin
and comp.sys.sun.admin for discussions related to administration of 
several popular UNIX systems.<P>

<B>Archie</B><P>

A useful way to find software and other files available from anonymous ftp sites. 
Information provided includes the path to files and the name of the anonymous ftp server 
upon which they reside.<P>

<B>Gopher</B><P>

A menu-driven distributed client/server information system.  Gopher was developed at 
the University of Minnesota (The Gopher State), and is rapidly becoming one of the most 
widely used Internet resources.  Using gopher, I can do everything from getting a local 
university library without having to know that the information I retrieved came from two 
different computers in different locations.  To try a public access gopher: use telnet to connect to 
consultant.micro.umn.edu, and login with a user name of gopher.<P>

<B>WAIS (Wide Area Information Server)</B><P>

A distributed client/server-based information system.  WAIS servers contain indexes to the  documents they
make available.  Using a WAIS client program, you can query those indexes until  you find a reference to a
desired topic.  You can then use WAIS to look at each document.  To get 
a sample of what you can do with WAIS, telnet to quake.think.com, login with user name WAIS.<P>

<B>World Wide Web</B><P>

On the surface, World Wide Web (WWW) may appear much like gopher, and in fact you 
can access gopher servers equally well.  The biggest distinction between the two is WWW's 
support of hypertext.  Rather than being limited to the menu structure of gopher, you can 
follow hypertext links around the Web, searching for items of interest, and expanding upon 
topics as need arises.  Its Hypertext capability and integration with other services (gopher and 
WAIS) make the World Wide Web a powerful tool for information search and retrieval on the  Internet.<P>
