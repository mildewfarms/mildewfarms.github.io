<H1>Books: A User's Report</H1><p>
<P>
Elizabeth Zinkann<P>

Once again there were too many excellent books debuting
simultaneously.  However, 
I chose some superb examples for this month's column.
The first is 
the only book on &quot;sendmail,&quot; by Bryan Costales
with Eric Allman 
and Neil Rickert and published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates,
Inc. Another 
&quot;first&quot; is a system administration book intended
solely for 
Hewlett-Packard administrators, written by Marty Poniatowski
and published 
by Prentice Hall. Smoot Carl-Mitchell and John S. Quarterman
combined 
efforts to produce Practical Internetworking with TCP/IP
and UNIX, 
published by Addison-Wesley and Randal L. Schwartz introduced
Learning 
Perl, by O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc. for the beginning
perl programmer. 
I have also attempted to review interviews presented
on the Internet 
and available on audio tape from O'Reilly.<P>

FYI: Internet: Getting Started (ISBN 0-13-327933-2)
and Internet: 
Mailing Lists 1993 Edition (ISBN 0-13-327941-3), formerly
published 
by SRI are now distributed by Prentice Hall in a new
compact format. 
Both of these books were previously reviewed in this
column.<P>

<B><I>Sendmail</I><br>
by Bryan Costales with Eric Allman and Neil Rickert<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-056-2</B><P>

Costales, Allman, and Rickert have produced the most
definitive book 
published on sendmail. Although sendmail is widely 
used, the only attempts at documentation appear in either
system administration 
or TCP/IP books. The authors organized this book into
three sections. 
Part one features a tutorial, part two describes general
administration, 
and part three provides a reference section. In addition,
a fourth 
part examines error messages, the complete client.cf
configuration 
file developed in the tutorial, V8 and IDA macros, and
a bibliography.<P>

Before reading the book, the user should be familiar
with the concepts 
of sendmail. Basically, sendmail will transfer a message

between two networks, whether the formats required by
the networks 
are the same or not. Many users don't realize that they
are using 
sendmail, depending instead upon a mail user interface
(MUA) 
such as /bin/mail or mailx(1).<P>

The tutorial introduces sendmail in a very practical
manner. 
The authors examine the capabilities of sendmail and
discuss 
them for both the novice and the experienced user. They
also develop 
a configuration file, slowly making it more complex.
The sendmail 
tutorial explains the format of the sendmail.cf file
and discusses 
its purpose. Although it is not easy to read, the sendmail.cf

configuration file is easy to parse and contains the
locations of 
important files plus their respective default permissions.
The configuration 
file also includes the instructions needed for rewriting
addresses. 
Among other topics, the tutorial discusses rules, rule
sets, macros, 
options, and headers.<P>

The administration section addresses more experienced
users and introduces 
DNS and sendmail, security, the queue, aliases, mailing
lists, 
and statistics. Costales, Allman, and Rickert focus
on the more advanced 
aspects of these topics. To help you choose which version
will perform 
better on your system, they analyze the strengths and
weaknesses of 
the new Version 8 Berkeley sendmail and the IDA (Institutionen

for Datavetenskap) sendmail, a European version that
uses 
a very readable configuration file. In addition, the
authors describe 
how to obtain and install the source. This section answers
questions 
commonly asked by UNIX system administrators.<P>

Perhaps the most useful part of the book is the reference
section. 
It concentrates on how sendmail works and is divided
into 
topics, each of which is covered in a separate chapter.
Topics include 
rules, rule sets, delivery agents, defined macros, options,
and headers. 
More advanced topics, including database macros, the
command line, 
and debugging, are also examined.<P>

The very fact that this book exists merits a round of
applause. Bryan 
Costales, the primary author, has produced an excellent
guide, with 
the aid of contributing authors Eric Allman, sendmail's
originator, 
and Neil Rickert, IDA specialist. The book is well organized
and each 
chapter closes with either &quot;Things To Try&quot;
(the tutorial) 
or &quot;Pitfalls.&quot; The writing style is clear
and the charts presented 
illustrate the text well. This long-awaited volume should
be on every 
system administrator's desk and should be required reading
for every 
user.<P>

<B><I>The HP-UX System Administrator's &quot;How To&quot; Book</I><br>
by Marty Poniatowski<br>
Hewlett-Packard Professional Books<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-099821-4</B><P>

Marty Poniatowski has written the first system administration
book 
intended solely for Hewlett-Packard's version of the
UNIX operating 
system. He makes this very clear in the first paragraph
of the preface. 
He declares what the book is not (BSD or UNIX System
V) and what it 
contains (HP-UX system administration). Over the years,
the author 
has developed a design for the installation and maintenance
of HP-UX 
systems. The HP-UX System Administrator's &quot;How
To&quot; Book 
presents these guidelines.<P>

Poniatowski has divided the book into five sections.
The first chapter 
addresses setting up a system, and here the author stresses
that you 
must plan prior to the system setup. Some of the systems
include instant 
ignition, a preloaded HP-UX operating system. However,
the chapter 
describes how to install and update your system, with
or without the 
benefit of instant ignition. It also provides a table
of HP-UX filesets, 
their uses, and the size of each to help you decide
whether you need 
to load it or not. It describes some post-installation
tasks, and 
then explains how to set up and run networking, using
either ARPA 
or NFS.<P>

The second chapter discusses everyday system administration
functions 
and how to perform them. Here Poniatowski also describes
the System 
Administration Manager (SAM), a tool which provides
menus for different 
system administration tasks. SAM can access &quot;Printers
and Plotters,&quot; 
&quot;Disk and File Systems,&quot; or &quot;Peripheral
Devices&quot; and 
will first present your current configuration. Using
examples, the 
author shows how to accomplish a task with SAM, then
provides an alternative 
method to the pull-down menus that uses HP-UX commands.<P>

Throughout, Poniatowski emphasizes how important it
is to know your 
system. Nowhere is this more evident than in the third
chapter, where 
the author discusses &quot;system resource utilization
and performance 
monitoring.&quot; He presents several HP-UX commands
that display information 
about system resources and explains how to interpret
their output. 
HP-UX accounting can also monitor &quot;system performance
and resource 
consumption.&quot; Poniatowski both demonstrates how
to produce the 
reports and explains how to read them. He points out,
however, that 
HP-UX also possesses a tool, HP GlancePlus/UX which
combines the best 
features of the command and accounting methods while
filtering out 
unwanted information.<P>

Poniatowski also examines some topics not usually covered
in system 
administration books. He analyzes the two steps required
in startup: 
boot ROM startup and HP-UX startup. As an example, he
uses /etc/inittab 
and displays the format for each entry in the file.
HP-UX system administrators 
often find themselves making HP-UX systems co-exist
with non-UNIX 
systems, such as MS-DOS. One way to accomplish this
is to use SoftPC, 
&quot;a DOS emulation product that runs under HP-UX.&quot;
The author 
also discusses the HP Visual User Environment (HP VUE)
and how to 
customize it. The last section of this chapter presents
several sources 
of information about HP-UX.<P>

The last chapter of The HP-UX System Administrator's
&quot;How 
To&quot; Book features shell programming for the system
administrator. 
It focuses not only on how to program in the UNIX shell,
but also 
on why a system administrator would choose this method
of programming. 
The chapter describes HP-UX programming tools, including
the compiler/linker, 
library management, the &quot;xdb&quot; source code
debugger, and make.<P>

In the past, administrators of Hewlett-Packard systems
often had to 
learn from books intended for the BSD or UNIX System
V administrator. 
Finally, there is a book specifically for them. It addresses
both 
the novice and the expert, presents a number of easily
understood 
flowcharts and tables, and is written in a lucid and
readable style. 
The HP-UX System Administrator's &quot;How To&quot;
Book should 
be welcomed by Hewlett-Packard UNIX system administrators
everywhere.<P>

<B><I>Practical Internetworking with TCP/IP and UNIX</I><br>
by Smoot Carl-Mitchell and John S. Quarterman<br>
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company<br>
ISBN 0-201-58629-0</B><P>

The third book in the &quot;UNIX and Open Systems Series,&quot;
this 
text addresses TCP/IP and UNIX. Carl-Mitchell and Quarterman
explain 
how the two topics work together. They have divided
the book into 
three sections: theory, practice, and advanced topics.
&quot;Theory&quot; 
examines the TCP/IP protocol suite, &quot;Practice&quot;
demonstrates 
through examples the way that UNIX and TCP/IP interact,
and &quot;Advanced 
Topics&quot; discusses different aspects of networking.<P>

Since TCP/IP is the most popular protocol suite used
on the Internet, 
it is essential that system administrators understand
how it operates. 
To address this need, Carl-Mitchell and Quarterman describe
TCP/IP 
and its services. In chapter one, they compare it to
the OSI (Open 
Systems Interconnection) Basic Reference Model. Chapter
three introduces 
the concept of IP and discusses how it works. Following
the TCP/IP 
layers, the transport protocols TCP and UDP are examined.
Chapter 
four also presents two interprocess communications facilities
(IPCs): 
BSD Sockets and TLI. The description of the BSD Socket
Interface is 
one of the clearest that I have encountered. The final
chapter in 
the theory segment focuses on naming conventions and
the DNS (Domain 
Name System).<P>

The second segment of the book &quot;examines how UNIX
implementations 
of the TCP/IP protocols actually work.&quot; This includes
introducing 
different hardware that can be used in a network, the
network devices, 
and how to create both the IP address assignment and
the resource 
naming system. As an example of TCP/IP capabilities,
the authors discuss 
the TCP/IP electronic mail service. This includes the
Simple Mail 
Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the RFC-822 message format,
and the sendmail 
architecture and configuration.<P>

With the Advanced Topics section of the book, Carl-Mitchell
and Quarterman 
introduce personal computers into the TCP/IP network
picture. They 
describe how to integrate both IBM-compatible PCs and
Macintoshes 
into the TCP/IP network. Practical Internetworking with
TCP/IP 
and UNIX also explains how to manage a network. The
authors probe 
issues concerning management rather than those dealing
specifically 
with networking. They also explore UNIX network management
tools and 
network debugging. The book concludes with two helpful
appendices 
and a definitive glossary.<P>

Carl-Mitchell and Quarterman address complex topics
clearly and comprehensively. 
The text is accompanied by figures, tables, and code
segments where 
applicable. The writing style is clear and precise.
Each concept is 
presented, described, and followed by an example when
necessary. This 
book merits inspection by anyone involved with TCP/IP,
UNIX, or networking. 
With the Internet and new superhighways in the news,
this is a book 
you cannot afford to overlook. The references at the
end of each chapter 
make this book a valuable addition to any library.<P>

<B><I>Learning Perl</I><br>
by Randal L. Schwartz<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-042-2</B><P>

Developed by Larry Wall, perl is an acronym for &quot;Practical
Extraction 
and Report Language.&quot; Perl can manipulate text,
files, and processes 
that are too complex for the UNIX shell, but do not
require the structure 
of the C programming language. The difficulties encountered
in writing 
C, sed, awk, and UNIX shell programs prompted Wall 
to replace some of these programs with perl and one
syntax.<P>

Programming Perl, written by Larry Wall and Randal L.
Schwartz 
and better known as &quot;the camel book&quot; because
of the cover, 
addressed the programmer already familiar with perl.
Learning 
Perl introduces the language to the novice. The book
begins with 
an introduction to the capabilities of the perl programming
language. 
The concepts discussed in this chapter are explained
in detail later 
in the book.<P>

The rest of the book is presented in classroom format.
There are approximately 
sixteen additional lectures with accompanying exercises
for the student. 
The answers to the exercises appear in one of the appendices.
Because 
of this the book can be used in either a classroom or
a private setting.<P>

Perl itself is free. It can be obtained from a number
of places, including 
Unix Power Tools by Jerry Peek, Tim O'Reilly, and Mike
Loukides. 
Learning Perl also gives the reader the name of a Usenet
perl 
newsgroup and an alternative way to contact the group.
Another advantage 
to perl is its high portability, and Schwartz devotes
a chapter to 
procedures for converting awk, sed, and UNIX shell 
scripts to perl programs. Perl is not only for UNIX
machines: it has 
been run on machines using VMS, OS/2, and MS-DOS operating
systems, 
as well as Macintoshes.  Schwartz provides an excellent
starting point 
for the beginner interested in perl. He explains perl's
capabilities 
before presenting examples which embody the concepts.
He also gives 
readers a glimpse of version 5.0, which Larry Wall is
completing. 
Learning Perl not only clarifies what perl is, but also
demonstrates 
its advantages.<P>

<B><I>Security &amp; Networks</I><br>
Carl Malamud with Jeff Schiller and John Romkey<br>
ORAudio<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-997-7</B><P>

It is now possible to hear programs produced on the
Internet through 
a workstation with speakers and audio software. O'Reilly
&amp; Associates, 
Inc. and Sun Microsystems are currently sponsoring a
program entitled 
&quot;Geek of the Week,&quot; featuring interviews with
members of the 
Internet community and hosted by Carl Malamud.<P>

Since one of the precious commodities today is time,
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 
Inc. has also decided to make these programs available
on audio tape. 
In this way, anyone who commutes can benefit during
rush hours and 
still be up-to-date on the Internet.<P>

Each tape contains two interviews. As I listened to
&quot;Security 
&amp; Networks,&quot; several of Jeff Schiller's points
about security 
impressed me, from how to make a system secure to whose
job it is 
to ensure that the security for the system works. His
opening argument 
-- that there are only two kinds of security &quot;very
good and 
none&quot; -- is not only convincing but also worthy
of the evening 
news. In the second interview, John Romkey's ToasterNet
reminded me 
of the computer in the movie Electric Dreams. On a more
serious 
note, his conceptions of tools and adding his structure
to general 
data were most thought-provoking. Malamud is an excellent
interviewer. 
His questions are pertinent and the pace of the interviews
never slackens.<P>

Currently, there are three tapes available in audio
format. In addition 
to &quot;Security &amp; Networks,&quot; the listener
can also obtain:<P>
