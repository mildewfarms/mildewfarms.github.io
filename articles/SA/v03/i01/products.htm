<B>Tenon Ships Two Versions of Mach ten</B><P>

Tenon Intersystems has begun shipping two versions of
Mach ten: Personal
Mach ten, Release 2.1, and Professional Mach ten, Release
2.1VM.  With
Mach ten, a Macintosh can be an X terminal, a UNIX Mach
workstation, an
X development platform, and a platform for standard
Macintosh
applications.  Mach ten is a 4.3BSD UNIX with a Mach
2.5 microkernel. 
Both Mach ten packages include software development
tools and the TCP/IP
protocol suites, with file transfer, electronic mail,
telnet, r-series,
UUCP and SLIP communications, NFS client and server
software for file
sharing, and UNIX remote printer spooling for printer
sharing.  Mach ten
TCP communications are supported across EtherTalk, LocalTalk,
and Token
Ring.  Also, an expanded Control Panel lets users configure
networks
using a Macintosh-style dialog box.<P>

Professional Mach ten, release 2.1 VM provides a demand-paged
virtual
memory protected environment for UNIX and Mach applications.
The
Professional software development tools include an ANSI-standard
C
compiler, a C++ compiler, a source debugger, lex and
yacc, and support
for Mach C threads and Mach ipc.<P>

Mach ten X Windows software includes X client software,
Motif libraries,
and X server software.  The Mach ten X Window Client
software contains a
set of X11R5 programming libraries, Athena widgets and
utilities, and
configuration files (the imake configuration system).
Accompanying
Motif programming libraries contain the Motif widget
library and Motif
window manager.<P>

Mach ten X Window Server software supports user configurable
X rooted
windows, as well as rootless Macintosh and Motif-style
windows with
individualized window settings.  Standard Mach ten cut-and-paste
desktop
operations conform to the X Consortium standard InterClient
Communications Conventions Manual (ICCCM) which align
X11 service
requests with Macintosh cut, paste, and copy operations.
The X server
conforms to X11R5 and supports networked font servers
as well as new X
font formats, such as Portable Compiled Font.  For more
information

<B>QNX Software Systems Announces QNX 4.2</B><P>

QNX Software Systems Ltd. has announced an update of
their POSIX,
real-time QNX Operating System.  QNX 4.2 includes an
ISO 9660
filesystem, Client-Side Caching, and additional network
connectivity. 
QNX 4.2 has also been optimized for the Intel Pentium
Processor.<P>

The ISO 9660 filesystem gives QNX 4.2 the ability to
bring another guest
filesystem to the QNX OS: besides supporting DOS files
and its native
filesystem, QNX can access media formatted according
to the ISO 9660
specification.  Another feature of QNX 4.2 is the Client-Side
Catching
(CSC).  Just as disk caching boosts a file server's
performance, CSC
boosts the performance of diskless workstation, by memorizing
the user's
working set of files for immediate access. Quoting Rob
Oakley, manager
of QNX Research and Development, &quot;This technique
is easier to use than a
RAM disk because the users doesn't have to do any special
setup or
maintenance.&quot;  QNX's fault-tolerant and load-balancing
technology (known
as FLEET) supports Arcnet, Ethernet, Token Ring, and
Xircom Pocket
Adapters.  In addition to being optimized for the Pentium,
QNX 4.2
provides both 16 and 32 bit operating environments.<P>

According to the company, the QNX OS offers executive-class
real-time
performance (8 microseconds per content switch on a
66 Mhz 80486) as
well as a UNIX development environment.  Each QNX development
system
includes a Watcom C ANSI C compiler.  DOS support is
available through
the Rundos package, which lets MS Windows applications
run in standard
mode.  For more information contact QNX Software Systems

<B>Hitachi Announces MOSAIC WORKS Directory Services</B><P>

Hitachi Computer Products (America), Inc. has introduced
MOSAIC WORKS
Directory Services, an e-mail directory synchronization
software product
line that uses the DX protocol, enhanced by Hitachi
to over the
Internet's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) MOSAIC
WORKS Directory
Services allows network administrators to maintain a
common e-mail
directory across most UNIX, Macintosh, and PC-based
local area networks.<P>

MOSAIC WORKS Directory Services uses a server/agent
architecture to
automatically propagate directories across a herogeneous
e-mail network.
The server maintains all addresses in X400 O/R name
format in the
Master Directory Database, receives changes from agents,
and routinely
propagates changes to all agents.  MOSAIC WORKS agents
monitor local
e-mail systems for directory changes, routinely converting
changes to
X400 O/R name format and sending the changes to the
server.  On
receiving changes from the server, each agent converts
the changes to
its native format and updates its local e-mail directory.
As a result,
all e-mail end-users have transparent access to all
e-mail addresses. 
Management capabilities include reporting, logging,
a graphical map of
the server and agents, access control, data recovery,
and the ability to
allow or deny address propagation.<P>

The MOSAIC WORKS Directory Server runs on SPARC UNIX
platforms and can
support up to 10 e-mail agents.  Directory agents are
currently
available for Novell's Message Handling Service (MHS),
the UNIX Send
Mail utility (SMTP), and Hitachi's X400 platform.  Support
for cc Mail,
Microsoft Mail, and QuickMail will be added in 1994.<P>

The MOSAIC WORKS Directory Server costs $2,495 for the
Entry level,
which supports 1,500 addresses; $4,995 for the Basic
level, which
supports 5,000 addresses; and $9,995 for the Enterprise
level, which
supports over 20,000 addresses.  Individual MOSAIC WORKS
agents cost
$995 each.  For more information, contact Hitachi's
