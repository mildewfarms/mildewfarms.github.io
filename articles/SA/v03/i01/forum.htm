<H1>Publisher's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
This is the first issue of our third year of publication.
With the New Year,
we thought we'd share with you some of the things we
want to celebrate.<P>

<B>UNIX</B> -- If you've ever tried working with Windows, you'll
know why. If not,
let me remind you that UNIX is a strong, infinitely
flexible system that puts
its power at the disposal of the user. I can say of
UNIX what someone once said of
democracy; it's not perfect, it's just better than any
of the alternatives.<P>

<B>The Internet</B> -- okay, this is getting a bit trivialized
in the press with all
the hype about the Information Highway, etc., but think
about it a minute (and
you can learn a bit about it in this issue): this is
an extraordinary tool for
communication. Every day at our office we receive email
from all over the world
-- readers with questions, readers proposing an article,
readers sharing 
something they've learned -- and this is only a small
part of what the system
offers. Readers download our code from a variety of
international sites (and,
yes, that sometimes gets complicated, but it always
beats typing the code in
by hand), and often when one has a problem, another
will have solved it (see
Jan Christiaan van Winkel's letter in this issue).<P>

<B>Our three columnists</B> -- Bjorn Satdeva, Betty Zinkann,
and Larry Reznick -- and
our most frequent contributor, Chris Hare. Bjorn, Betty,
and Larry came to us
from root, Bruce and Karen Hunter's fine journal, and
it's been a happy
inheritance. Chris heard about the magazine on the networks,
volunteered, and
has been a steady supplier of strong, technical information.
He also serves as
a resource for Rebecca Thomas's Wizard's Grabbag in
UNIXWorld.<P>

<B>Our readers and authors</B> -- we launched Sys Admin because
we felt UNIX system
administrators in search of practical technical information
were underserved
by extant publications. Your response more than confirmed
this perception --
I know of no other magazine that has been greeted with
such enthusiams and all-
around good will. We'll do our best to continue to earn
that response.<P>

On another subject: It's too late for Christmas, but
many of you had asked
how you could go about acquiring a Sys Admin t-shirt
(with its all too apt
motto: &quot;System Administration -- it's a dirty job
but somebody said I have to 
do it&quot;). They're now available here at R&amp;D
Publications, at a cost of $11.95,
plus $3.50 s&amp;h.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Robert Ward<br>
