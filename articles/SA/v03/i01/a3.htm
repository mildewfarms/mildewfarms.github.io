<H1>Internet Online Services: archie</H1><p>
<P>
Chris Bush<P>

<B>Introduction</B><P>

The Internet, begun two decades ago as an experimental
network of 
research and government agencies but later expanded
to include a significant 
number of commercial corporations, provides access to
an almost staggering 
amount of data and a wide range of information services.
In this article, 
I describe in detail one of these services, archie.
I outline the 
functionality of archie, explain how to use it, and
explore issues 
involved with getting and installing two popular archie
client programs 
on your system.<P>

If you're not already connected, read the sidebar &quot;Getting
Connected&quot; 
to find out how to get your system or systems connected
to the Internet 
at a level of service that's right for you. In a subsequent
article, 
I will discuss another Internet service that is rapidly
growing in 
popularity, gopher. For your reference, the sidebar
&quot;What's Out 
There?&quot; summarizes some of the most popular services
available 
to Internet users.<P>

<B>What Is archie?</B><P>

Information, including free software, on the Internet
exists primarily 
in the form of publicly accessible files made available
through the 
use of anonymous ftp. Anonymous ftp allows access to
files on particular 
systems without requiring logins or passwords. Finding
out which sites 
offer anonymous ftp and what files and software might
be downloaded 
from them is where archie comes in. <P>

Archie is a means of maintaining and searching indexes
of the files 
available from anonymous ftp sites on the Internet.
These indexes 
of files are maintained on designated sites on the Internet,
called 
archie servers. Numerous sites on the Internet operate
as official 
archie servers, each containing the same information.
Figure 1 lists 
these sites. <P>

The information provided by an archie server comes in
two forms. First, 
there is a database of filenames collected from all
registered anonymous 
ftp sites. This database is updated regularly, typically
once a month. 
The second type of information, called the &quot;whatis&quot;
database, 
contains additional data describing the subject or function
of the 
files. This is useful when the filename you are searching
for may 
bear no resemblance to its purpose, particularly if
it's software.<P>

Without archie, finding what you are looking for would
be worse than 
thumbing through every page of a book, frantically searching
for references 
to a particular topic. With it, a whole world of knowledge
and software 
is merely an ftp session away.<P>

<B>Using Archie</B><P>

You can retrieve information from an archie server through
one of 
several interfaces. The simplest interface requires
only that you 
have the capability of sending and receiving electronic
mail to one 
of the archie servers. You send an email message to
username archie 
at the server, issuing an archie command in the text
of your message. 
The results of your command will be mailed back to you.<P>

Once you have found what you are looking for, you must
find a way 
to access it. Many anonymous ftp sites offer access
via email for 
users who cannot use ftp to connect directly to that
site. This is 
usually accomplished by sending mail to username ftpmail
at the desired 
anonymous ftp site. Commands to ftpmail closely resemble
those of 
&quot;normal&quot; ftp, and are entered in the text
of your mail message.<P>

If you have the ability to use telnet to connect to
other sites on 
the Internet, you may choose the telnet interface to
establish a connection 
to an archie server, as in the following example:<P>
<PRE>
[2111:~ ]xanadu% telnet archie.rutgers.edu</pre><p>
<p>
When prompted for a login name, enter archie. You will

not be asked for a password, and will soon see the archie
server prompt:<P>
<PRE>
archie&gt;</pre><p>
<p>
At this point the archie server is ready to take your

commands. Figure 2 shows a summary of the commands available
using 
the telnet interface. Most of these are also available
using the email 
interface. A sample archie telnet session appears in
Figure 3. In 
this example, a telnet connection is established with
the archie server 
at Rutgers University. The maxhits variable is set to
a value 
of 4, to limit the search result to a maximum of four
entries. The 
search command, prog, is then used to search for file
names 
containing the substring &quot;xarchie&quot;. What is
returned are entries 
for ftp servers matching this search, along with the
pathnames of 
all files matching the search. From the abbreviated
output given in 
the figure, you can see that two sites contain what
appear to be compressed 
tar files of the xarchie software. One site has version
2.02 
of xarchie, the other has version 1.3. Once you have
a list of potential 
locations for the files you want, you can just fire
up ftp and go 
get them.<P>

<B>archie Client Programs</B><P>

Archie client programs connect to archie servers using
a special protocol 
known as Prospero. These clients allow you to query
an archie server 
without having to connect to it with telnet and log
in. This is typically 
the preferred method of accessing archie databases,
as it places less 
of a burden on the computers which act as archie servers.<P>

There are two primary archie client programs, archie
and xarchie. 
The former is a command-line archie client, with archie
commands passed 
as arguments to the command. The latter, xarchie, is
an X Window application, 
providing a graphical user interface to archie. Both
are available 
via anonymous ftp from several locations on the Internet.<P>

Using the telnet interface, I found several sources
for archie and 
xarchie. I used the anonymous ftp server ftp.cs.widener.edu

to get archie version 1.4.1 and xarchie version 1.3
(there's a more 
recent version of xarchie, version 2.0, which uses the
X11 R5 libraries; 
but, since this version of the X Window system is perhaps
not as widespread 
as X11 R4, I elected to use the earlier version of xarchie).
Both 
clients were in the form of a compressed tar file.<P>

Having acquired the two files with ftp, I set about
installing them 
on my Sun workstation. Each package consists of the
source code, makefiles, 
and various other support files to assist in compiling
and installing 
the software. On my Sun workstation, running SunOS 4.1.3,
I was able 
to build the command-line archie client with no modifications
to the 
makefile. You should check the value of the ARCHIE variable
in the 
makefile, and make sure it is set to an appropriate
archie server 
(the available servers are listed in the makefile).
Give some thought 
to this, as this will be the default server that the
archie client 
will connect to (it's a good idea to pick one that is
geographically 
close to you). After editing the makefile, simply run
the make command. 
If all goes well, you will have an executable file called
archie which 
you should then copy to a common directory found in
your users' PATH 
variable -- perhaps /usr/local/bin or something similar.

You can then copy a &quot;man page,&quot; archie.man,
to a common 
location on your system for online reference pages.
That's it, you 
have an archie client.<P>

Those of you with X Window-based workstations or terminals
will probably 
prefer the xarchie client. Compiling this gets a little
more complicated 
than the command-line client, but is still straightforward.
The software 
includes a file, called README, with detailed instructions
for getting 
xarchie up and running on your system. If you are familiar
with Imake 
and Imakefiles, you'll have no problem. <P>

The xarchie client has an intuitive graphical interface,
making archie 
queries much easier. Buttons and pull-down menus across
the top of 
the window give access to the settings and commands.
Three scrolling 
lists give the server names, directory names, and file
names returned 
by the archie server as a result of your query. Simply
enter your 
search term in the text field in the lower portion of
the window, 
click on the Query button at the top, and after (usually)
a short 
wait, the results of your query will display. Using
your mouse and 
the scroll bars, search through the list of results.
If you find what 
you are looking for, you may be able to get the file
automatically 
by clicking on the Ftp button at the top of the window.
<P>

Both archie clients are easy to use, and definitely
to be preferred 
over interactive telnet sessions by archie servers.
Neither client 
offers a way to query the &quot;whatis&quot; database,
however. I prefer 
the graphical user interface of xarchie; if you're a
little more adventurous, 
go out and find xarchie version 2.0.2, the interface
is much nicer 
than version 1.3.<P>

<B>Conclusion</B><P>

Archie has become an invaluable addition to my systems
administration 
&quot;toolbox.&quot; Using the xarchie client, I am
able to find and 
retrieve software and documents that I would otherwise
not even know 
about. As an example, I recently stumbled across a number
of documents 
relating to Solaris 2.2, the latest offering from Sun
Microsystems 
in the UNIX SVR4 arena. These documents proved to be
worth their transfer 
time in gold, as I had just struggled for several days
with many of 
the features of Solaris which they dealt with. I have
used xarchie 
to locate a number of software packages that have become
permanent 
additions to the computer systems I manage, including
the Perl programming 
language, the GNU project's compilers and other development
tools, 
the COPS security software, and more. All of these are
freely available, 
if only you know where to look.<P>

Archie can do a lot for you, even in the narrow scope
of information 
it covers. To really exploit the power of the Internet,
you'll want 
to explore some of the other services. In a subsequent
article, I'll 
discuss gopher in detail, including how you can use
gopher to provide 
information to the users of your systems.<P>
