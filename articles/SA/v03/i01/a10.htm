<B>SAGE Job Descriptions</B><P>

In the November/December issue, I mentioned the Job
Description models 
prepared by the SAGE Jobs Working group. At the time,
no decision 
had been made on whether, when, or how the material
would be distributed. 
Since then, the SAGE Board has agreed (by a 4-3 vote,
which is surprising) 
to publish the Job Description document.<P>

The SAGE Jobs publication is therefore now available
from the USENIX 
Office in Berkeley. It costs $5.00 for SAGE Members
and $7.50 for 
non-members. For copies, and for membership information
for either 
USENIX or SAGE, please contact: The USENIX Association,
2560 Ninth 
Street, Suite 215, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA; phone: (510)
528-8649; 
e-mail: office@usenix.org.<P>

The e-mail address of the editor, Tina Darmohray, is
tmd@eticket.llnl.gov.<P>

<B>LISA VII</B><P>

The yearly USENIX LISA System Administration conference
(November 
1-5) has also taken place since the last issue. This
year the attendance 
almost doubled, at about 1100. Since the LISA conference
is where 
the bleeding edge issues of UNIX System Administration
are defined 
and discussed, it's worth taking a little time to look
at some of 
the papers presented there.<P>

This year's conference differed from previous years'
in its focus 
on solutions to problems related to human issues and
several interesting 
papers tackled these issue. Rmy Evard's &quot;Collaborative
Networked 
Communications: MUD as Systems Tools&quot; discussed
experiences with 
using the computer game MUD as a communication tool
for the system 
administration staff. Sally Hambridge and Jeffrey Sedayao's
&quot;Horses 
and Barn Doors: Evolution of Corporate Guidelines for
Internet Usage&quot; 
dealt with some of the experiences and mistakes with
Internet access 
policies at Intel over the years. Laura de Leon, Mike
Rodriquez, and 
Brent Thompson's &quot;Our Users Have Root!&quot; described
an environment 
where the users all have the root password to their
own machines, 
but the system administrator does not.<P>

Technical issues were not ignored, however. Todd Miller,
Christoper 
Stirlin, and Evi Nemeth's &quot;satool -- A System Administrator's

Cockpit, An Implementation&quot; described a tool which
monitors a 
large number of machines in a distributed environment.
Stephen E. 
Hansen and E. Todd Atkins' &quot;Automated System Monitoring
with Swatch&quot; 
discussed another monitoring tool. Gary L Schaps and
Peter Bishop, 
in &quot;A Practical Approach to NFS Response Time Monitoring&quot;

reviewed available tools for researching NFS response
time. James 
da Silva and Olafur Gudmundson contributed &quot;The
Amamda Network 
Backup Manager,&quot; desribing a tool for network wide
backups. Finally, 
Karl L Swartz's &quot;Forecasting Disk Resource Requirements
for a 
Usenet Server&quot; presented a model which permits
forecasting of 
disk resource requirements for a full newsfeed.<P>

These are just a few of the very good papers presented
at the conference, 
and I include them here to give a general flavor of
the proceedings. 
In fact, this year, we received so many paper proposals
that we had 
to reject papers we really wanted to accept. While this
in some ways 
unfortunate, it helps to ensure that the papers which
make it into 
the conference are of very high quality. If you were
unable to attend, 
I recommend that you get the proceedings for the LISA
VII conference 
(and previous years' proceedings as well, at least since
LISA III 
or IV). I find that one of the outcomes of attending
a LISA conference 
is that I return with enough ideas to keep me busy for
the next couple 
of years -- the only problem is that I have just one
year until 
the next LISA!<P>

Next year's LISA conference will take place in San Diego,
in Southern 
California, sometime in the fall. The program chair
is Dinah McNutt 
(dinah@tivoli.com).<P>

LISA proceedings can be ordered from the USENIX conference

<B>The Firewall Tool Kit and S/Key</B><P>

The Fire Wall Tool Kit (fwtk), a new set of tools intended
to greatly 
simplify the process of building a Internet firewall,
has been released 
to the net. Written by Marcus J. Ranum, of Trusted Information
Systems, 
the kit consists of a number of individual tools which
can be used 
to increase security on existing firewall or to simplify
implementation 
of proxy service on firewalls that consist of just a
single bastion 
host. For a description of some of the major components
of the toolkit, 
see the sidebar, &quot;Overview of the Firewall Tool
Kit.&quot; The 
toolkit is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.tis.com;
and there 
is a mailing list where various issues in compiling,
configuring, 
and supporting the toolkit are discussed. To subscribe
to this mailing 
list, send a subscription request to fwall-users-request@tis.com.<P>

The Fire Wall Tool Kit's authentication server provides
support for 
some popular one-time password or challenge/response
systems, including 
Security Dynamics' SecurID, Digital Pathways' SNK004
Secure Net Key, 
and Bellcore's S/Key. The two former are commercial
packages using 
a challenge/response system, while the latter is a publicly
available 
one-time password-based system. While S/Key is perhaps
not suitable 
for larger sites, where many people are allowed to telnet
in from 
the Internet, it offers a cost-effective solution for
smaller sites 
and sites where the users only occasionally need to
telnet in. S/Key 
is available from thumper@belcore.com, and it also has
a mailing list. 
To subscribe to the S/Key users mailing list, send a
request to skey-users-request@bellcore.com.<P>

<B>New LISA Local Group</B><P>

A new local LISA Group, the EnglishBay LISA has been
formed in Vancouver, 
Canada. The group is planing to meet the third Wednesday
of the month 
at a place to be determined. The next meeting is scheduled
for 19 
January 1994 at 7 PM. For more information, contact
Peter Van Epp 
from Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada,
at vanepp@sfu.ca.<P>

And now to this month's questions.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I want to configure one of our Sun workstations to
use 
UUCP, allowing for both dial-in and dial-out connections.
I have configured 
the system as described in the Sun System Administration
Manual, and 
it works OK in the beginning, when the system is newly
re-booted. 
However, after a few hours, it is no longer possible
to dial in, and 
at times, the dial-out is also affected. What have I
done wrong? PS: 
It is running SunOS 4.1.1.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Probably nothing! Apply Sun's tty jumbo patch, and
the 
problem will in all likelihood go away.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 We are looking for a public domain work tracking system

for our system administration group. Any suggestions?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 One such system is Request, which was developed at
Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratories. It is described in
the LISA V Proceedings, 
and is available by anonymous ftp from s1.gov. An updated
version 
of this system is in the works, but there's no word
yet on when it 
will be released.<P>

The GNU people also have a tracking system. This system
is primarily 
used for bug tracking inside the GNU project, but according
to the 
GNU people, it should be adequate for a system administration
work 
tracking system. I haven't yet had time to check this
tool out, so 
I can't vouch for its suitability for this purpose.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 How can I use subnets at our site?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Subnets are a method of splitting one existing network

into a number of smaller networks by changing the network
mask. This 
is very common in large installations that have a class
B address, 
and is sometimes useful in small installations that
have only one 
class C address.<P>

Today's TCP/IP networks use three different kinds of
addresses, referred 
to as class A, B, and C addresses (there are actually
four, but the 
class D address does not belong in this discussion).
The main difference 
between the three classes of address has to do with
the number of 
bits used for the network address and host address,
respectively. 
All three types of addresses use 32 bits, but a class
A address uses 
8 bits for the network address and 24 for the host address,
a class 
B address uses 16 bits for each, and a class C address
uses 24 bits 
for the network and 8 bits for the host address. The
address classes 
can easily be distinguished by the TCP/IP software,
because a class 
A address always starts with a bit 0, a class B address
with the two 
bits 1 0, and a class C address with the three bits
1 1 0. In other 
words, if an IP address has a first byte less than 128,
it is a class 
A address; if it is in the range from 128 to 191, it
is a class B 
address; and if it is in the range from 192 to 223,
it is a class 
C address.<P>

If an organization has been assigned a network address
for the purpose 
of connecting to the Internet, but needs more than one
internal networks 
it can chose to split its host address space into several
networks. 
This is less complicated than it sounds: it actually
is just a matter 
of expanding the number of bits in the full address,
which is interpreted 
locally as part of the network address. <P>

I'll use a class C address as an example to clarify
some of the details 
(even though subnets are much more common in installations
using class 
B addresses, using a class C address here helps makes
the explanation 
clearer, as there will be no room for misunderstandings
based on the 
address type). In a class C address, the network address
takes 24 
bits, and the host address takes 8 bits. However, an
organization 
can decide internally to extend the number of network
bits, at the 
cost of the number of host addresses. Say, for example,
that you want 
to split the class C address into 16 subnets, each with
16 host addresses 
-- or, more specifically, the network address is 28
bits, and the 
host address is 4 bits, still at a total of 32 bits.<P>

You tell the computer that you're using a larger than
usual network 
address when you configure the network with the &quot;ifconfig&quot;

command. Normally, you would specify the subnet mask
as 225.225.225.0, 
which is the 24 bits of network address and 8 bits of
host address 
(with 225 being equal to FF hex, or all eight bits equal
to one). 
What you'll need to do to establish your subnets to
split the last 
byte (the zero) into the network part (the four most
significant bits) 
and the host part (the four least significant bits),
or in other words, 
a network mask of 255.255.255.240.<P>

The negative side of this of this is that subnet numbering
gets really 
ugly from a human perspective, as the network numbers
and broadcast 
addresses are no longer clean and easily recognizable.<P>

In a traditional network address, host address zero
is the address 
of the network itself, and address 225 is the broadcast
address: in 
other words, a host address of all zeros is the network,
and an address 
of all ones is the broadcast address. In the subnets
described above, 
the situation is similar, but the numbers don't come
out neatly.<P>

Figure 1 shows the subnetting of the class C address
195.237.119.0. 
If the networks are named after the least significant
byte, then network 
0 will have an address of 195.237.119.0 and a broadcast
address of 
195.237.119.15, while 195.237.119.1 to 195.237.119.14
will be available 
for host addresses. Similarly, network 16 will have
a network address 
of 195.237.119.16, host addresses 195.237.119.17 to
195.237.119.30, 
and a broadcast address of 195.237.119.31. While this
may sound complicated, 
if you look at Figure 1, it should become clear.<P>

You will need to specify the netmask everywhere you
are configuring 
the network, as in the ifconfig command, and in your
routing configuration. 
It is in fact good practice to do so, even if subnets
are not used.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I have been asked to protect our system from intruders

by changing the login program to disable an account
after a few login 
attempts with an incorrect password. Is there any publicly
available 
software which can do this?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Not to my knowledge, and I am sure that you do not
want 
to do it anyway. When considering a security issue,
you need to be 
very sure that the chosen solution doesn't make the
problem worse. 
A setup such as you describe will make you extremely
vulnerable to 
&quot;denial of service attacks.&quot; A cracker could
lock users, including 
root and the system administrator, out of their own
accounts by making 
the necessary faulty login attempts before attempting
other cracking 
activity.<P>

A better solution is to modify login to pause for about
five seconds 
after a bad login before printing the login banner again,
and to disconnect 
if the more than three to five unsuccessful login attempts.
This will 
not prevent brute force attacks, where a remote computer
is programmed 
to attempt logins as fast as possible, but will make
such attacks 
highly unpractical, without inconveniencing your legitimate
users 
too much. For more stringent security, you will need
to install some 
kind of a challenge/response system, as such a system
is very difficult, 
if not impossible, to break.<P>

If it's not otherwise available, you can get the login
program from 
the BSD Net2 distribution.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Is there any way of &quot;combining&quot; SunOS's screensaver,

so that we get screenblank's timer, but lockscreen's
activity. I am 
afraid screenblank looks a little like the machine is
off and someone 
(the janitor, maybe) might pull-the-plug or something.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Nothing of that kind exists to my knowledge. However,

if you've got someone going around and unplugging machines,
you have 
a problem that won't be resolved by a marriage of screenblank
and 
xlock. You should inform your maintenance people politely
but firmly 
that nothing should be unplugged anywhere. In the computer
room you 
might want to consider to have the junior sysadmin do
the cleaning. 
While this is probably not part of the SAGE job-description
for a 
junior sysadmin, it can save a significant amount of
headaches of 
all kinds -- from broken hardware to breached security.
