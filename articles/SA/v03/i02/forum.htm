<P>
This is a blatant, undisguised attempt to elicit some
free help. (Well, 
maybe not totally free.)<P>

I've been playing in my basement, trying to get NFS
and TCP/IP running 
using only public domain source code. I'd like to connect
several 
DOS/Windows stations to an AT-class machine running
Linux. I'd also 
like to get PPP running so that all the toys at home
can talk with 
the machines here at work. <P>

So far I've invested about four evenings into this project.
I've installed 
Linux, and succeeded in getting it to talk to commercial
TCP/IP packages 
running on the DOS machines. Or, at least, almost succeeded.
Ping, 
PCNFSD, and FTP appear to work, but when I run Telnet,
the Linux Telnet 
daemon hangs (with considerable regularity) in a select()
call. I 
suspect this bug is a product of my using an ethernet
card that's 
older than my oldest child, but I can't seem to get
the kernel configuration 
script to recognize any of my newer cards, and my initial
attempts 
to disable the auto-configuration failed. Given another
evening or 
so, I expect I can find a way around this bug, so I'm
pretty comfortable 
with the UNIX end. <P>

In all honesty, though, I don't know where to begin
on the PC end. 
I have several TCP/IP drivers and packet drivers copied
from various 
Internet sites, but my initial scan of the so-called
documentation 
left me totally unenlightened. I have a vague idea of
how these pieces 
are supposed to fit together, but sense that I'm missing
a lot of 
details that are going to be critical to getting it
to work. Moreover, 
I have no experience with PPP. <P>

Surely someone reading this magazine has installed a
public domain 
version of TCP/IP and PPP on a DOS station. Do me a
big favor and 
write a detailed account of how you did it. Where'd
you get the files? 
Which version did you use? What hardware are you running?
How did 
the finished configuration files look?<P>

I know this isn't a particularly hard task, but I don't
want to invest 
any more scarce evenings than absolutely necessary.
Life is too short 
to spend it doing this kind of detective work. Thus,
I'll make you 
a deal. You write the details, and I'll turn it into
a story and give 
you the byline (and the author's stipend). <P>

Help, please,<br>
