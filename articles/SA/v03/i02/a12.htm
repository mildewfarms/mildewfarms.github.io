<H1>RS/6000 Backup and Restore Scripts</H1><p>
<P>
Stephen Peterson<P>

Do you want to improve your AIX backup and restore capabilities
without 
buying software? If so, you may find the approach I
describe here 
useful. Most company's systems have IBM 8mm tapedrives,
either 2.3Gb 
or 5.0Gb. Some systems have additional 5.0Gb tapedrives.
Disk space 
varies from 1Gb up to as much as 20Gb. Some of the objectives
for 
our backup/restore system were:<P>

<li>the ability to automatically start the backup at night<P>

<li>the ability to manually start the backup at night<P>

<li>consistent file restore procedures for all systems<P>

<li>automatic next-day notification of backup problems,

such as tape write errors, unreadable files, tape not
loaded, etc.<P>

<li>the ability to determine quickly on which backups a

particular file may be found<P>

<li>a Bootable System backup, and also the ability to back-up

files outside of the root volume group.<P>

<B>AUTOBACK for Bootable System Backups</B><P>

You probably are familiar with smit mksysb. The script
in 
Listing 1, autoback, uses this as a starting point.
A shortcoming 
of smit mksysb is that smit.log does not show the 
output from the command. The idea here is to capture
the output from 
stdout and stderr when this command is executed, so

that you'll be able to start the backup automatically,
from crontab. 
(See the sidebar, &quot;Using crontab to Start Backups
Automatically.&quot;)<P>

The first section of autoback creates a subdirectory
in which 
to keep listings and errors generated during backups,
if the subdirectory 
has not already been created. Next, the tape devicename
is set as 
a variable. In our environment, this is done by a call
to a program 
that echoes the correct devicename. The listing shows
this as commented 
out. You can create your own version of the program
if you have different 
systems with various tapedrives you wish to use, and
still keep the 
script standardized across all systems.<P>

Notice the chdev command for setting the blocksize.
With the 
command provided here, you never have to guess at the
blocksize when 
you need to restore files from the tape (I once accidentally
set the 
blocksize to zero -- the resulting tapes were unreadable!).<P>

autoback generates output filenames based on the day
of the 
week. That way, the names are reused after seven days,
which limits 
the diskspace usage. This namery convention created
problems when 
backups started after midnight on one day, then before
midnight the 
second day: the second backup overwrote the files of
the previous 
backup. The dayofwk command shown in Listing 2 solves
this 
problem nicely.<P>

Next comes the requisite /bin/mkszfile -f command (the
-f 
option causes a forced increase of work area if required),
which creates 
the list of filesystems and their sizes in the root
volume-group. 
Then the mksysb command captures the listing files in
Ddd.listing 
and the error output in Ddd.err (where Ddd is the first
three 
letters of the day of the week).<P>

Finally, autoback ejects the tape from the drive. I
chose 
to do this for several reasons: (1) it is more convenient
to set up 
the next day's backup if the tape is already ejected,
and (2) if someone 
forgets to change the tape, then the backup from one
night will not 
be overwritten when the next night's backup is started.
Instead, someone 
will be notified the next day that the tape was not
ready when the 
backup tried to start. However, I sometimes work on
a weekend on a 
system in another city, over a modem, when no one is
in the remote 
office to load the tape. I like the safety net of having
a complete 
tape backup before I start, but I also like to be able
to restore 
files by modem, if needed, before people come in the
following Monday 
morning. So if I create a file /bin3/nounload, then
for one 
time only the tape eject does not occur.<P>

The autoback script in Listing 1 creates bootable backup
tapes 
reliably, and backs up all the files in the root volume
group. At 
a certain point, however, some of the systems needed
so much disk 
space that it became impossible to add all the disks
to rootvg.  
Since mksysb uses the tar command, a similar script,

shown in Listing 3, was developed. The script's name,
qbback, 
derives from the application we run on our systems,
QBridge (C) (trademark 
of Qantel/Decesion Data Inc).<P>

<B>QBBACK for Non-Root Volume Group Data</B><P>

qbback is similar to autoback, except that it uses 
the tar command instead of mksysb, and requires some

additional parameters. The tape devicename is set to
rmt0, 
but in the future the devicename could become a parameter,
which would 
allow us to back-up separate directory hierarchies to
multiple tapedrives 
simultaneously.<P>

The first parameter provides an additional qualifier
to specify the 
output listing and error files. I suggest starting the
parameter with 
a dot. For example, if the first parameter was .jack
and it 
was Monday, then the resulting files would be Mon.jack.listing

and Mon.jack.err. The second through fifth parameters
are 
pathnames for directories to be included in the backup.
For example, 
the command line:<P>
<PRE>
qbback .jack ./home/jack ./home/sally</pre><p>
<p>
would back-up everything under jack and sally 
directories.<P>

<B>Error Notification</B><P>

Error notification with Listing 4, bkpchk, scans the error files
by 
checking the file sizes. When no errors occur, the filesize will
be 
zero for the tar command. For the mksysb command, certain
messages 
are normally output to stderr, and with AIX release 3.4 the size

is always 181 bytes when nothing unusual occurs. If the user responds 
affirmatively to the prompt, the files are renamed to .sav to prevent
the message 
text from displaying at every login, but still are kept available for
later study.<P>

<B>Epilogue</B><P>

Since writing this article, I've encountered a situation

whereby the error output from the backup did not indicate
any problems 
during the backup, but several files came off the tape
with zero bytes. 
It seems that two of the commercial backup software
offerings advertised 
in Sys Admin magazine have a tape data verification
capability, 
which is something the tar and backup from IBM do 
not have. As a result I have placed orders for evaluation
copies of 
each package, with the expectation of purchasing one
of them in the 
near future. <P>
