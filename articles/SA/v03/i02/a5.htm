<H1>Improved Error Reporting in AIX</H1><p>

<B>Error Reporting in AIX</B><P>

AIX 3.2* logs all warnings and errors, both hardware-
and software-related, 
in the file /var/adm/ras/errlog. Entries are always
appended 
and are never deleted. All entries contain binary data.
The system 
administrator uses the command errpt to create a readable

output of this error log. No tools exist to automatically
highlight 
severe errors or to notify the system administrator
of new entries 
in the error log file. As a result, it's often the case
that the error 
log file gets completely ignored. This is unfortunate
because the 
error log file contains vital information, such as disk
drive failures 
and adapter problems, which can't be ignored.<P>

I present here two tools that I have developed to automate
error reporting. 
They can be invoked on the command line or by cron.
Their 
purpose is to notify the system administrator of new
entries in the 
error log file. The tools can be used for daily and
monthly error 
reporting and can mail the output to user root. Both
are shell scripts 
which can be executed by either the Bourne or Korn shell.<P>

<B>Existing Commands</B><P>

The following commands are supplied by the AIX operating
system and 
are used in the scripts below.<P>

<li><I>errpt</I> -- Prints binary entries from the system 
error log file /var/adm/ras/errlog to stdout. Various

flags select entries by different criteria, such as
time, error identifier, 
error type, device on which an error occurred.<P>

<li><I>errlogger</I> -- Appends command-line parameters 
to the error log file.<P>

<li><I>errclear &lt;days&gt;</I> -- Removes all entries in 
the error log file which are older than the number of
days supplied 
as the parameter. This command must be used to reduce
the size of 
the error log file.<P>

<B>Daily Error Reporting</B><P>

The shell script /var/adm/ras/daily (in Listing 1) generates

the daily error report. It is usually invoked by cron
but 
can also be invoked from the command line.<P>

This program mails all selected errors which occurred
today (flag 
-t), or since the last boot (default), to user root.
The last 
boot time is found in /etc/utmp and can be displayed
with 
the command who -b. The program uses the errpt command

to extract entries from the system's error log.<P>

Even if no errors occurred, daily mails its output to
root 
to indicate that the error report program was executed.
In this case 
the system administrator receives mail with an empty
message. A sample 
output of errpt is shown in Figure 1.<P>

As the figure shows, each line is a separate entry.
The first column 
is a unique error identification. The second column
specifies the 
time the entry was made, in the format mmddhhmmyy (month,
day, 
hour, minute, and year). The third column describes
the error type, 
which can be T (temporary), P (permanent), or U 
(unknown). The fourth column describes the class of
the error, which 
can be H (hardware), S (software), or O (entries 
made by the super-user using the errlogger command).
The fifth 
column is the resource name of the software product
which made the 
entry, and the last column is a verbose explanation
of the error.<P>

A powerful report generator, errpt can select entries
in the 
error log file by time, error identifier, type of error
(hardware, 
software), class of error (permanent, temporary), device
type for 
hardware errors, and product names for software errors.<P>

If a spare terminal is available, errpt can be invoked
in 
concurrent mode. All error log entries are reported
as soon as they 
have been added to the error log file.<P>

<B>Monthly Error Reports</B><P>

Daily reports are for system administrator notification.
If error 
logs are to be kept for a longer period of time, they
must be stored 
elsewhere. This is mandatory: if the system's error
log file is not 
reduced with the errclear command, the error log will
eat 
up all available disk space in that file system. The
script in Listing 2 
groups error reports by month and stores them in a
compressed file. 
It also cleans the system's error log file by deleting
all entries 
from the previous month. cron invokes the script the
first 
five days of each month.<P>

This script keeps monthly error reports for exactly
one year. The 
reports are stored in directory /var/adm/errors, which
has 
to be created by the system administrator.<P>

<B>cron Entries</B><P>

To automate the reporting, two entries are added to
the crontab 
file for user root. The first entry generates daily
error reports. 
The second entry invokes the monthly error reporting,
which also removes 
last month's error log entries. This script is invoked
the first five 
days each month, in case the system is shut down during
the weekend 
or bank holidays. The two crontab entries are as follows:<P>
<PRE>
59   23   *     *   *   /usr/bin/ksh   /var/adm/errors/daily -t
59   23   1-5   *   *   /usr/bin/ksh   /var/adm/errors/monthly</pre><p>
<p>
Now, when the system administrator logs in each day,

he or she will find a mail message containing a list
of the most recently 
reported errors.<P>
