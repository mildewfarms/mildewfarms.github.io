<B>UniPress Announces Microsoft LAN Manager V2.2 for UNIX</B><P>

UniPress Software, Inc. has announced LAN Manager for
UNIX (LMU) for 
SVR4.2 PCs. UniPress has ported LMU 2.2 to SVR4.2, allowing
Univel 
and Consensys 386/486 UNIX systems to act as servers
for PC client 
applications on MS DOS, MS Windows, Windows NT, Windows
for Workgroups, 
and OS/2 platforms.<P>

Microsoft LMU for SVR4.2 lets users access UNIX disks
and printers 
on the LAN Manager network. Windows users can log into
the network 
and manipulate data on UNIX servers and network resources
with the 
Windows File Manager. Microsoft LAN Manager also provides
extended 
interoperability with other LANs, as LAN Manager clients
can be connected 
to Novell NetWare servers on the same network.<P>

Microsoft LAN Manager for SVR4.2 supports NetBIOS over
TCP/IP or NetBEUI. 
Microsoft LMU also provides UNIX features such as access
to Network 
File System (NFS) and Remote File System (RFS), which
gives users 
access to all UNIX data on any other networked UNIX
computer. Extended 
TCP/IP features allow domains to span routers, connect
to WANs, and 
connect to the Internet.<P>

Microsoft LMU can be installed over the network and
administered from 
any computer on the network using the standard Microsoft
Net and NetAdmin 
programs. LMU's domain architecture allows several servers
to be set 
up simultaneously and heterogeneous servers can be grouped
and managed 
collectively, eliminating the need for individual server
updates for 
every network change.<P>

LAN Manager for SVR4.2, including Univel UnixWare and
Consensys, is 
priced at $1,995 for a 24-user server, $2,995 for a
48-user server, 
$4,995 for a 128-user server, and $7,995 for an unlimited
user server. 
LAN Manager clients are included free. For more information

<B>Chorus Systems and SCO Introduce CHORUS/Fusion</B><P>

Chorus Systems and The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. (SCO)
have introduced 
CHORUS/Fusion for SCO Open Systems Software. Through
its micro-kernel 
architecture, CHORUS/Fusion for SCO extends SCO systems
software to 
ease integration for complex real-time systems and allow
clustered 
computing. CHORUS/Fusion for SCO components support
POSIX 1003.1b/c 
(previously referred to as 1003.4/4a) standard real-time
and thread 
extensions to POSIX.1. CHORUS/Fusion also provides open
systems support 
and interoperability with UNIX, and includes the CHORUS
kernel-to-kernel 
transparent connectivity services, which let applications
interact 
in a consistent manner whether they run on the same
or different nodes 
in a network.<P>

CHORUS/Fusion for SCO Open Systems Software includes
three components. 
The CHORUS/Fusion Real-Time SCO Open Server supports
standard SCO 
systems software application binaries, standard POSIX
1003.1b/c real-time 
APIs, CHORUS transparent connectivity, TCP/IP interoperability
protocols, 
and X-Windows server and clients. The CHORUS/Fusion
Real-Time Node 
supports dedicated POSIX 1003.1b/c-based real-time processes,
which 
cooperate transparently with other real-time processes
or SCO system 
software standard applications on other CHORUS/Fusion
Real-Time nodes 
and servers. The CHORUS/Fusion Development System combines
a CHORUS/Fusion 
server, five CHORUS/Fusion nodes, a C development system,
and the 
CHORUS multi-thread and remote debugging extension to
GDB. The CHORUS/Fusion 
Development System supports development and testing
of real-time and 
distributed applications before deploying them on CHORUS/Fusion
servers 
and nodes.<P>

Prices for CHORUS/Fusion for SCO depend on volume. Typical
unit prices 
are: $29,950 for the CHORUS/Fusion Development System;
$1,118 for 
the CHORUS/Fusion Real-Time Server runtime (in 10 unit
quantities); 
and $400 for the CHORUS/Fusion Real-Time Node runtime
(in 100 unit 
quantities). For more information contact Chorus Systems,
Inc.,

<B>OPENService SJI Adds Applications to SYSTEMWatch AI-L</B><P>

OPENService SJI, Inc. has added four applications to
SYSTEMWatch AI-L. 
SYSTEMWatch AI-L can monitor printers, file systems,
mail queues, 
backups, system performance, security, user processes,
customer applications, 
and databases. SYSTEMWatch can alert the system administrator
to problems, 
make recommendations for remedial action, and take actions
such as 
automatically increasing swap space. With system management
consoles, 
a system administrator can monitor multiple hosts simultaneously.

Other features of SYSTEMWatch AI-L include: on-site
support, rules-based 
customization, and the ability to change responses over
time based 
on a behavior-model analysis of how the system administrator
has handled 
problems in the past.<P>

The applications added to SYSTEMWatch are: file system
and disk manager, 
swap and memory manager, CPU and resource manager, and
daemon manager. 
The file system and disk manager tracks files and disk
usage behavior, 
identifies potentially dangerous growth patterns and
takes action 
to avoid congestion. The swap and memory manager monitors
virtual 
memory and swap space and can increase swap space when
existing space 
approaches capacity. The CPU and resource manager identifies
runaway 
processes or other problems that may impede efficient
CPU operation, 
then initiates automated actions such as temporary stopping,
re-prioritizing, 
or killing processes to manage system load. The daemon
manger controls 
background processes and can avert electronic mail failure,
print 
queue slowdown, or communications breakdowns.<P>

The SYSTEMWatch AI-L client package is priced at $395
per host, and 
the system administrator's system management console
is priced at 
$7,995. The four new applications are shipped with the
core technology. 
Site licensing for system management consoles and runtime
versions 
is available. For more information contact OPENService
SJI, Inc., 
9428 Baymeadows Rd., Ste 132, Jacksonville, FL 32256,

<B>I-Kinetics Introduces I-Bridge</B><P>

I-Kinetics, Inc. has introduced I-Bridge, a family of
software products 
that lets Windows applications directly access databases,
programs, 
and files on UNIX servers. I-Bridge puts information
into a Windows 
application, such as a spreadsheet, without the user
having to manually 
locate, transfer, or convert it. I-Bridge Windows clients
communicate 
with different UNIX data sources, including different
databases, through 
a single driver with automatic data conversion. I-Bridge
gives Windows 
applications access to data in flat files, and can directly
output 
from UNIX programs without intermediate file storage.<P>

I-Bridge uses an organization's existing SQL to protect
the data sources 
from ad hoc queries. SQL and shell commands are developed
and distributed 
by the IS staff to I-Bridge desktop end-users, or maintained
as centrally 
managed stored procedures that are shared. They can
be entered via 
function calls in the application's macro language or
interactively 
through the I-Bridge Wizard, an interactive user interface
tool. I-Bridge 
executes in the background, giving the user access to
the application 
while data is being retrieved, and retrieves data from
different sources 
through a single communications driver.<P>

The initial release of I-Bridge includes adapters for
Excel, 
Ingres, Oracle, and Sybase SQL Server databases. UNIX
adapters are 
available for Sun and HP platforms. The I-Bridge starter
system, including 
a UNIX server module and two Windows client modules,
is priced at 
$995. For more information contact I-Kinetics, Inc.,

<B>proGIS Announces VMove</B><P>

proGIS has announced VMove, an implementation of PC
filesystems for 
UNIX systems. Features of VMove include accessing DOS
type media without 
system privileges and data retrieval from or to DOS
by inserting the 
disk and accessing the data with one command. For every
command there 
are several switches available. For example, the Text
switch provides 
special character and EOL conversions between UNIX and
the PC in both 
directions.<P>

VMove is available for VMS, DEC Ultrix, DEC Alpha, Sun
SPARC, RS/6000, 
GSI, and MIPS. VMOVE supports MS- and PC-DOS (2.0-5.0),
Atari, CP/M 
(on demand), MAC PC-Symbiot, and other filesystems.
VMove also supports 
floppy devices, rewritable optical disks, SyQuest disk
drives, and 
any other mountable device with DOS structure.<P>
