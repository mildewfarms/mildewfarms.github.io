<H1>Sidebar: Installable Device Programs</H1><p>
<P>
On my Esix SVR4 system, I have 13 installable device
programs, four 
of them with no man page documentation. I have no idea
what three 
of those four do, although I have some guesses. Those
13 files are:<P>

<DL>
<DT><I>idbuild(1M)</I>
<DD>This is the standard program 
to build a new UNIX kernel. After configuring any device
driver changes, 
installing new device drivers, or changing any of the
kernel's tunable 
parameters, you can run idbuild to build a new kernel.
Many 
kernel-changing scripts automatically run this program
for you. This 
program calls other &quot;id&quot; programs to get its
work done.<P>
<DT><I>idcheck(1M)</I>
<DD>You can use this program 
to discover specific information about installed device
drivers. It 
finds out whether a device is installed, or whether
a vector, a DMA 
channel, or an address is already used.<P>
<DT><I>idconfig(1M)</I>
<DD>This program takes configuration 
files for the devices, tunable parameters, and file
systems and produces 
kernel definition files.<P>
<DT><I>idinstall(1M)</I>
<DD>You can use this program 
to add, remove, or update any of the device driver files,
or to get 
the currently installed version of those files. Device
driver programmers 
use this program during development and installation
of new device 
drivers.<P>
<DT><I>idmaster</I>
<DD>Esix doesn't document this 
program and the standard UNIX man pages have nothing
to say either. 
I suspect it has something to do with a device driver's
master file. 
A device driver's master file information is placed
in the /etc/conf/cf.d/mdevice 
file. This program's command line usage is:<P>
<PRE>
idmaster (-a)|(-u)|(-d dev) [-i dir] [-o dir]</pre><p>
<p>If any reader knows what this or the other undocumented

programs listed in this sidebar do, please let me know.<P>
<DT><I>idmkenv</I>
<DD>This is another program that 
Esix doesn't document. The program doesn't show a command
line usage. 
I suspect it has something to do with the device driver
nodes.<P>
<DT><I>idmkinit(1M)</I>
<DD>As part of the kernel 
rebuilding procedure the /etc/inittab file is rebuilt.
This 
program takes init modules from /etc/conf/init.d and
combines 
them with /etc/conf/cf.d/init.base to reconstruct inittab.<P>
<DT><I>idmknod(1M)</I>
<DD>When init level 2 (multiuser) 
operation starts after a kernel remake, this program
executes. It 
removes all devices not listed as required in the /etc/conf/cf.d/mdevice

file's third field. Then it creates new device nodes
according to 
the specifications in the /etc/conf/node.d directory.<P>
<DT><I>idmkunix(1M)</I>
<DD>This program creates the 
UNIX kernel that boots. It builds the kernel from the
files in the 
/etc/conf/pack.d directory.<P>
<DT><I>idreboot</I>
<DD>This is another program that 
Esix doesn't document. It prompts to reboot the system,
offering ENTER 
to reboot and ESC to quit. If you request a reboot,
it runs shutdown(1M) 
bringing the system to init level 0. Installation scripts

could run this program after configuring and rebuilding
a new kernel.<P>
<DT><I>idspace(1M)</I>
<DD>This program tests whether 
enough space exists in the /, /usr, and /tmp 
directories, each of which could be separate file systems.
If the 
/ directory has enough space to store a larger kernel
and 
enough inodes remaining for the new devices, idspace
continues. 
It applies similar tests to /usr and /tmp only if 
they're filesystems.<P>
<DT><I>idtune(1M)</I>
<DD>Use this program to tune 
kernel parameters. You must know the name of a kernel
parameter and 
a meaningful value for it. All of the kernel parameters
are in the 
file /etc/conf/cf.d/mtune, while local system tunings
are 
in /etc/conf/cf.d/stune. Each line in the mtune file,

other than comment lines, is a record containing the
parameter name, 
the default, minimum, and maximum values for that parameter.
The stune 
file contains only the parameter name and desired value
to give that 
parameter.<P>
<DT><I>idval</I>
<DD>This is another program that 
Esix doesn't document. The program shows a command line
usage statement:<P>
<PRE>
compare: must specify two values to compare compare -l | -g value1 value2</pre><p>
<p>
Because the usage statement refers to the name &quot;compare,&quot;

I thought it might be a hard link to something else
named compare. 
But, it isn't hard linked and there's no man page for
compare. I suspect 
it may be used for comparing kernel parameters, but
I'm not sure.</DL>
