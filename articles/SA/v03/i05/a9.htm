<B><I>Tcl and the Tk Toolkit</I><br>
by John K. Ousterhout<br>
Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series<br>
ISBN 0-201-63337-X<br>
$36.75</B><P>

Ousterhout begins by introducing Tcl (pronounced tickle)
and Tk (pronounced 
tee-kay) as two distinct software packages. Tcl is an
embeddable scripting 
language "for controlling and extending applications;
its name 
stands for tool command language." Tk is an
X Window System toolkit. 
Both use libraries of C procedures; this allows them
to be used in 
different applications. Together they become a programming
environment 
for developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications.
The first 
two chapters provide an introduction and an overview
of Tcl and Tk. 
Ousterhout addresses their benefits, demonstrates how
to use them, 
and describes the book's format. He divides the book
into four sections: 
the Tcl language, the Tk toolkit, the Tcl C interface,
and the Tk 
C interface.<P>

Part I explains the Tcl language. In order to write
Tcl scripts, the 
user must understand its syntax and the built-in commands.
Chapter 
3 presents the syntax; chapters 4 through 14 describe
the built-in 
commands. The syntax chapter defines scripts, commands,
and words, 
along with Tcl's evaluation process. Also addressed
are variable, 
command, and backslash substitution, comments, quoting
with double 
quotes and braces, and normal and exceptional returns.
The author 
includes figures, examples, and even tips for new Tcl
users. Chapters 
4 through 14 discuss variables, expressions, lists,
control flow, 
procedures, string manipulation, accessing files, processes,
errors 
and exceptions, managing Tcl internals, and the history
capability. 
The logical order of these chapters progresses from
the most frequently 
used to the more optional commands.<P>

The second part of the book features the Tk toolkit
and Tk's Tcl commands. 
The introductory chapter in this section includes a
brief description 
of the X Window System and a very clear explanation
of widgets. Ousterhout 
discusses the components of a Tk application (a widget
hierarchy, 
an associated Tcl interpreter, and its commands). Two
kinds of Tcl 
scripts control a Tk application: initialization scripts
and event 
handlers. An initialization script performs any initialization
task 
the application may require. Following initialization,
the application 
is in a wait state (event loop), ready for user interaction.
When 
an event occurs, a Tcl script (event handler) processes
the event 
and acts accordingly. Tk features four main Tcl command
groups: creating 
and deleting widgets, arranging widgets, communicating
with existing 
widgets, and interconnecting widgets. Geometry managers
determine 
the sizes and locations of widgets on the screen. This
section concludes 
with two examples: a Tcl procedure that creates dialog
boxes and a 
script that invokes a remote control application. <P>

The remaining sections document "Writing Tcl
Applications in C" 
and "Tk's C Interfaces." After reading
parts 3 and 4, the 
reader can create new Tcl commands, write new Tcl applications
in 
C, and create new widgets and geometry managers in C.
The appendix 
tells how to retrieve, compile, and install Tcl and
Tk, how to discover 
available extensions, and where to find the Internet
newsgroup about 
Tcl and Tk.<P>

This is an extremely well-written book, containing many
figures, tables, 
examples, and scripts to illustrate the Tcl and Tk concepts.
Ousterhout 
recommends that the reader have some knowledge of the
ANSI C Standard, 
UNIX, and the X Window System in order to make best
use of the book. 
In the introduction, he identifies the chapters readers
will need 
to look at before attempting to craft Tcl and Tk scripts.
His presentation 
technique and expertise result in a superb text. I enjoyed
Tcl 
and the Tk Toolkit and recommend it highly
to anyone with any shell 
writing experience. Everyone who uses the X Window System
will find 
this book helpful. <P>

Addison-Wesley offered a t-shirt featuring Tcl
and the Tk Toolkit 
as a promotion. The shirts became so popular that Addison-Wesley
decided 
to sell them for $10.00 each and donate the profits
to the Literacy 
Volunteers of America, a national non-profit organization
that fights 
illiteracy through community volunteer literacy programs.
The attractive 
blue and white t-shirt displays the book cover on the
front and lists 
all of the titles in the Addison-Wesley Professional
Computing Series 
on the back. The t-shirts can be ordered by calling

<B><I>Cruising Online: Larry Magid's Guide 
to the New Digital Highways</I><br>
by Lawrence J. Magid<br>
Random House Electronic Publishing<br>
ISBN 0-679-75155-6 <br>
$25.00</B><P>

Magid focuses on the three major commercial online services:
America 
Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy. He addresses their
respective strengths, 
weaknesses, and costs. Although he examines many of
the features of 
each, this is not a catalog for the services. Instead,
Cruising 
Online attempts to match the user with the
appropriate online service. 
To encourage the reader to find the best service for
his or her needs, 
the book provides coupons for free online time for America
Online, 
CompuServe, Prodigy, and Netcom, an Internet service
provider.<P>

To demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of the
commercial 
services, Magid selects a topic and describes how America
Online, 
CompuServe, and Prodigy approach it. For example, all
three provide 
a mail capability, but each handles it differently.
One may add a 
charge, while another will only bill the user for the
time on the 
system. If the originator wants to track the message,
the status may 
be displayed automatically , or the sender may have
to request a receipt 
to track it. Magid makes liberal use of the respective
computer screen 
outputs for each feature that he discusses. He explores
many of the 
popular topics supported by all three services and shows
the differences 
among them. Some of the categories include: forums,
news and sports, 
reference, computing and software, travel and shopping,
health (as 
opposed to health care, which is found under government
or politics), 
leisure, entertainment and hobbies, politics, and business
and finance. 
Print media also appear as online media. (Although I
receive The 
Chicago Tribune daily, I subscribed to America
Online to access 
the Tribune online so that I can
read articles that were cross-referenced 
but not printed in the newspaper.)<P>

Cruising Online provides money-saving
tips, recommendations 
on how to better use a service, and warnings. Magid
also dedicates 
a chapter to the Internet. His easy-to-read style lets
the reader 
concentrate on the subject and decide which service
best addresses 
his or her needs. Venturing into cyberspace can be expensive,
especially 
for the uninitiated traveler. Larry Magid's preventive
navigation 
(know where you're going before you begin) will help
anyone, whether 
a beginner or experienced user. This book merits the
attention of 
every user; it demonstrates the proper techniques for
using an online 
service.<P>

<B><I>The Magic Garden Explained: The Internals 
of UNIX System V Release 4<br>
by Berny Goodheart and James Cox<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-098138-9 <br>
$38.00</B><P>

With the The Magic Garden Explained,
Goodheart and Cox have 
contributed to the essential UNIX library for UNIX professionals.

This book describes how UNIX System V Release 4 (SVR4)
functions. 
The authors begin with a history of UNIX, including
the differences 
among the various releases and versions and the new
features in UNIX 
SVR4. If you've read a bit about UNIX history in other
books, you 
may be tempted to bypass this discussion of history.
In this case, 
omitting the historical background would be a mistake
and the reader's 
loss. The Magic Garden Explained
explores the Australian connection 
to UNIX and provides some history that doesn't appear
in any other 
book. It also examines the attempts to define UNIX standards,
including 
SVID, POSIX, and X/Open. Some excellent tables and flowcharts
display 
recent kernel developments and features of UNIX SVR4.<P>

Following the introductory chapter is a foundation chapter
entitled 
"Concepts and facilities." The topics
explained in this chapter 
are necessary to an understanding of the rest of the
book. Here, Goodheart 
and Cox discuss the UNIX operating system basics in
some depth and 
supply brief introductions to STREAMS, how STREAMS works,
TCP/IP, 
the Transport level interface (TLI), Sockets, Remote
File Sharing 
(RFS), and the Networked file system (NFS). The explanation
of the 
UNIX kernel is organized in four sections: the memory
management subsystem, 
the process management subsystem, the I/O subsystem,
and the file 
management subsystem. Each of these subsystems, as well
as the properties 
attributed to it, is explained thoroughly in its respective
chapter.<P>

The book's final section addresses the STREAMS subsystem,
the interprocess 
communication system, and crash(1M). The chapter detailing
STREAMS 
includes different STREAMS functions, the algorithms
for the functions, 
the modules, drivers, utilities, memory management,
and diagrams and 
text displaying how the stream head operates. The chapter
on interprocess 
communication (IPC) features semaphores, message queues,
and shared 
memory. The final chapter describes a utility that allows
the administrator 
to inspect a core-image of the kernel, including processes,
the kernel 
stack, files, memory, and STREAMS.<P>

The Magic Garden Explained joins
an elite selection of classic 
UNIX books. It can be used either as a college textbook
(the authors 
include exercises at the ends of chapters for students)
or a professional's 
reference. Goodheart and Cox also provide enough detail
to satisfy 
the casual user. This book will benefit developers,
system engineers, 
administrators, and programmers, particularly those
who implement 
device drivers. The Magic Garden Explained
is one of the first 
books to receive the approval of the Novell, Inc. UNIX
Systems Group. 
Given the authors' different time zones (Australian
and English), 
it is amazing not only that the book was completed,
but also that 
the style is so coherent. The Magic Garden
Explained features 
a well-written and logical style, enlivened by a sense
of humor, displayed 
in the footnotes. The authors even reveal why it is
a magic garden. 
This is a superior book and should be added to any classic
UNIX library.<P>

<B><I>!%@:: A Directory of Electronic Mail Addressing
&amp; Networks Fourth Edition</I><br>
by Donnalyn Frey and Rick Adams<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc. <br>
ISBN 1-56592-046-5<br>
$9.95</B><P>

Frey and Adams provide a directory of networks for the
novice or experienced 
user. The latest version includes a basic introduction
to electronic 
mail (e-mail) addressing and a more specific explanation
of multiple 
network communication. The authors focus on approximately
190 networks 
in depth, describing the network, its services, the
formats used, 
and who to contact for further information.<P>

The appendices feature the domain names of networks
in 62 countries, 
from Argentina to Zimbabwe. The United States is divided
into four 
sections: commercial, educational, governmental, and
geographic. Frey 
and Adams also include a segment for the United States
containing 
network and organizational subdomains. These extensive
and informative 
lists can help users trying to contact colleagues on
different networks 
establish a connection successfully on the first try.
(The lists will 
also intrigue the bookworm for hours, particularly during
thunderstorms!)<P>

The authors have modified a very readable and extremely
well-organized 
book. For the fourth edition, O'Reilly &amp; Associates,
Inc. have reduced 
the price. The previous edition sold for $24.95; the
modified, expanded 
version is $9.95. Every book lover and online user will
want to take 
advantage of this bargain!<P>

<B><I>The Internet Unleashed</I><br>
Sams Publishing<br>
ISBN 0-672-30466-X<br>
$44.95, includes disk</B><P>

The writing of this book resembles the Internet itself.
Forty-five 
authors contributed to The Internet Unleashed,
each addressing 
his or her speciality. Different subjects are supported
by different 
visual aids. The introductory chapters use sidebars
to explain necessary 
topics, such as TCP/IP and bandwidth. Later chapters
employ notes, 
tips, and screen outputs to communicate ideas. Tables,
charts, diagrams, 
and figures augment the text throughout the book. The
Internet 
Unleashed consists of eleven parts plus the
Appendices. It discusses 
Internet history (past, present, and future), how it
works and how 
to participate in it, communication, finding information,
using the 
Internet for business, education and government, issues
regarding 
the Internet, and having fun.<P>

In presenting the history of the Internet, author Martin
Moore describes 
more than the facts detailing the beginning. He also
discusses the 
prevailing political climates that accompanied its generation
and 
development. Moore recounts what ideas were implemented,
and when 
and where; this approach resembles a written timeline
and is quite 
effective. <P>

The second section discusses network mediums, topologies,
protocols, 
and routing, followed by Internet addresses and domain
names. Each 
topic is presented in a clear and precise manner. The
third segment 
addresses accessing the Internet, whether as a user,
an organization, 
or through a local area network (LAN). It also considers
high-speed 
connections, security, and selecting a consultant or
trainer.<P>

Communications can refer to e-mail, Internet Relay Chat
(IRC), discussions, 
news, or mailing lists. Therefore, the contributers
to this section 
covered all of the possibilities. The authors begin
with an overview 
of Internet E-mail, provide information about E-mail
programs for 
DOS, Windows, and Macintosh platforms, and examine different
Internet 
gateways. They describe discussions through Listservs
and mailing 
lists, explaining how to use, create, and maintain them.
The authors 
also focus on acquiring news through Usenet and newsgroups,
emphasizing 
proper netiquette and comparing various newsreaders.
This section 
concludes with a discussion on live conversation and
how to participate.<P>

"Finding and Sharing Information"
is probably the most important 
segment in the book. Its collection of tools and instructions
on using 
them includes: finding people on the Internet, InterNIC,
FTP, Telnet, 
Archie, using, finding, and creating Gophers, Veronica,
WAIS, the 
World Wide Web, and Mosaic. With these and the other
tools presented 
in this section, the reader should be able to successfully
travel 
the Internet. <P>

The Internet Unleashed next focuses
on specific applications 
of the Internet. The section relating to business recounts
a history 
of business on the Internet, why anyone should conduct
business in 
cyberspace, the policies defining acceptable use, and
current practices. 
The authors also provide information about libraries
and discuss accessing 
different libraries through the Internet, enabling the
researcher 
to expand his or her resources. The Internet can also
furnish education. 
This feature is available for K-12 students or college
graduates, 
including distance education, which allows the instructor
and the 
students to reside in different geographic locations.<P>

The Internet Unleashed concludes
with segments on community 
and government, Internet controversies, diversions and
fun, and the 
appendices. Among topics including federal information
and Free-Nets, 
the government section identifies ten rules that the
user should consider 
before addressing a political issue. Internet controversies
describes 
crackers, viruses, privacy, copyrights, and censorship.
Diversion 
and fun explores multi-user dungeons (MUDs), the Internet
Hunt, and 
Virtual Reality. The appendices furnish the Public Dialup
Internet 
Access List (PDIAL), essential Internet tools, an introduction
to 
UNIX, Internet Domain Names, and Internet Resources.
The accompanying 
disk, for Windows, includes a Chameleon Sampler from
NetManage, Internet 
tools, Hgopher, UUCode, and directories of mailing lists,
newsgroups, 
and Listserv lists. (A Macintosh disk is available on
request.)<P>

This is an outstanding book. The examples employed throughout
allow 
the reader to understand the concepts, regardless of
his or her user 
level. This book belongs on every Internet user's bookshelf,
or in 
close proximity to his or her keyboard. It will be used
often. <P>

<B><I>Open Computing's Guide to the
Best Free UNIX Utilities</I><br>
by James Keogh and Remon Lapid<br>
Osborne McGraw-Hill<br>
ISBN 0-07-882046-4<br>
$34.95, includes CD-ROM</B><P>

The adjective "free" has many different
connotations. For 
purposes of this book, Keogh and Lapid required that
each "free" 
utility possess three qualifications: it must be the
best in its field; 
the source code, binaries, and documentation must be
on the Internet; 
and it must be available to anyone without restrictions.
The authors 
provide download instructions, the name and location
of the utility 
on the Internet, and the name of a netnews group for
users of that 
utility. They also provide e-mail addresses to report
bugs in the 
utility. To help readers who may be downloading and
building utilities 
for the first time, they include a chapter that recalls
their own 
initial endeavors and documents their errors.<P>

Keogh and Lapid divide the utilities into several categories:
general, 
text processing, games, communication, printing and
spreadsheet, software 
development, graphics, and electronic mail utilities.
They also include 
the best of the programming languages. Some of these
utilities seem 
unimportant until you encounter a terminal without them,
whereupon 
they become indispensable. The authors cover many of
my favorite utilities, 
as well as some newly developed tools. Among the general
utility software, 
Keogh and Lapid examine less,
paging software that allows 
the user to move both forward and backward; screen,
which 
monitors multiple sessions on your screen; ingres,
an interactive 
database; and bash, the
"GNU Project's Bourne Again Shell"

that combines the advantages of the Bourne, Korn, and
C shells. Text 
processing software contains TeX and emacs; communication
software 
features gzip (data compression), kermit (file transfer),
pcomm(telecommunications), 
and mosaic, the newest and brightest of the Internet
browsers. The 
chapter on software development includes Tcl, an embeddable
scripting 
language; the electronic mail section addresses Netfax;
and among 
the programming languages are Xfree86, an X Windows
Server, gcc, a 
C and C++ compiler, the NIH Class Library, a C++ library,
and the 
Perl programming language.<P>

Open Computing's Guide to the Best Free UNIX
Utilities includes 
a CD-ROM with the source in two formats. Since the source
must be 
compiled, the introduction of the book provides instructions
for the 
CD. <P>

In sum, Keogh and Lapid have identified the most useful
utilities 
and shown how to obtain and use them. To prevent any
errors and also 
to provide support, they detail the downloading process,
describe 
common mistakes and how to avoid them, and identify
groups dedicated 
to each utility. The result is an excellent book that
explains the 
procedures designed to benefit from the existing resources.<P>

<B><I>The UNIX Audit: Using UNIX to Audit UNIX</I><br>
by Michael G. Grottola<br>
McGraw-Hill, Inc.<br>
ISBN 0-07-025127-4<br>
$29.95</B><P>

Grottola describes three reasons for system audits:
to control, verify, 
or measure impact. The control audit analyzes the system
resources 
for someone unfamiliar with the system; the verification
audit confirms 
the operations of a system; and an audit that measures
impact examines 
the effects of an impending revision or change. <P>

In many cases, an audit becomes another task for the
system administrator. 
Grottola demonstrates how a UNIX professional can use
the UNIX operating 
system to produce a professional audit report. For the
auditor who 
is unfamiliar with UNIX, the author suggests recruiting
the assistance 
of a system administrator. In addition, he discusses
74 UNIX commands 
that can provide audit information. Grottola
categorizes these 
commands in six groups: administration, file systems,
network facilities, 
performance, security, and general utility tools. He
also presents 
the commands in alphabetical order and explains how
each can be used 
for auditing purposes. A later chapter shows how to
establish a baseline 
reference through the system resource files and how
to use the information 
to monitor the entire system.<P>

Through the procedures described by the author, the
system administrator 
or auditor can evaluate the UNIX file system, remote
access facilities, 
backup procedures, disaster recovery, and system security,
software, 
use, and performance. Grottola furnishes checklists
and questions 
that should be answered to complete the audit. He demonstrates
how 
to use UNIX to perform the audit and includes examples
of audit forms 
as part of the finished report. The UNIX Audit
is clearly written 
and logically presented, with flowcharts and screen
outputs displayed 
to aid the reader. If your job involves responsibility
for UNIX systems 
analysis and productivity, The UNIX Audit
is a valuable tool.<P>
