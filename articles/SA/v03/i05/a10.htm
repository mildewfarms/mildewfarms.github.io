<H1>Questions and Answers</H1><p>

The next LISA conference, LISA VIII, will begin soon.
This year it 
will take place September 19-23 in San Diego. The official
name for 
the conference is the 8th Usenix Systems Administration
Conference. 
The focus of this year's technical program is &quot;Automation:
Managing 
the Computer of the 90's.&quot; The conference itself
lasts three days, 
and is preceded by two days of tutorials. One of the
fun things at 
these conferences are the BOF (Birds of a Feather) sessions.
Unlike 
the more formal parts of the conference, the BOFs simply
bring people 
together to discuss a topic of common interest. BOFs
are scheduled 
on a first come, first served basis. The BOFs scheduled
at the time 
of this writing are: WWW Installation, Maintenance,
Administration, 
and Assorted Topics; Tools for Sysadmin Tasks; Silicon
Graphics Administration; 
Majordomo; Networking ATM style; Ohio St. Univ Backup
System; and 
Firewalls.<P>

With LISA just about to start, it is time to begin thinking
ahead 
to the next system administration conference -- the
Fourth System 

Administration, Networking, and Security Conference
(SANS IV), scheduled 
for April 24-29, 1995, in Washington, DC -- particularly
if you 
are interested in presenting a paper. The topic for
the SANS IV conference 
is &quot;Tools and Techniques You Can Use Immediately.&quot;
If you 
have a good idea for a paper, you can e-mail an abstract
(in plain 
text) to sans@fedunix.org before November 1, 1994.<P>

Alan Paller, the chair of the SANS IV, is working on
a salary survey 
for system administrators. I believe this will be the
most comprehensive 
survey of its kind ever. Assuming you are doing good
work for your 
organization, you may find such a survey useful in salary
discussions. 
The results of the survey will be presented at the SANS
conference, 
and I will also report some of the interesting highlights
here. However, 
the best way for you to get the survey result is to
participate in 
the survey, because everybody who participates will
get a personal 
copy. The survey is shown in the sidebar, but you can
save the work 
of retyping it by sending e-mail to survey@sysadmin.com,
where 
I have set up an automatic reply. The completed surveys
forms should 
be e-mailed to sans@fedunix.org. You can also send it
by traditional 
mail to SANS Salary Survey, 4610 Tournay Road, Bethesda,
MD 20816.<P>

In July yet another CERT advisory was issued for sendmail.
I think 
this should be seen as a clear warning to upgrade to
the latest version 
(8.6.9), which is available by ftp from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.

The version shipped by the vendors (anything prior to
8.6.8) is subject 
to this latest vulnerability, which applies to local
users rather 
than to connections from the Internet. So even if you
are not connected 
to the Internet, you are vulnerable to these bugs, which
are related 
to the &quot;d&quot; option (which allows local users
to gain root access) 
and the &quot;-oE&quot; option (which permits them to
read any file 
on the system). Details can be found in the July CERT
advisory, which 
is available by ftp from ftp.cert.org. If you are 
running an old version of sendmail, you will need to
be prepared to 
replace not only the sendmail program, but also the
sendmail configuration 
file (sendmail.cf). However, if you do so, you will
have the 
advantage of being able to use Eric Allman's high level
configuration 
system, based on m4. All in all, there are many good
reasons to get 
started on this as soon as possible.<P>

The latest and the last version of BSD UNIX is now available.
BSD 
4.4 Lite is the last release from the now dissolved
CSRG at UC Berkeley. 
Both a CD with the sources and a full set of printed
manuals are available 
from O'Reilly, which has published them in cooperation
with USENIX. 
The documentation is a five-book set, with both man
pages 
and supplemental documentation. The CD is available
in an additional 
companion book.<P>

A new ftp archive has come online at Purdue. The archive
is currently 
available via FTP, but the creators of the archive are
also planning 
to support gopher and WWW soon. The archive currently
contains software, 
standards, tools, and other material in 28 areas, from
access control, 
through cryptography, firewalls, and software forensics,
to the computer 
underground.<P>

The collection also contains a large set of site &quot;mirrors&quot;

of interesting collections, many of which are linked
by topic to the 
rest of the archive. You can connect to the archive
via standard ftp 
to coast.cs.purdue.edu. Information about the archive
structure 
and contents is in /pub/aux; you are encouraged to look
there, 
and to read the README* files located in the various
directories.<P>

And now for this month's questions.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Regarding the question in a recent Sys Admin about

copying between tape devices: on Suns, at least, the
tcopy 
command could be used:<P>
<PRE>
tcopy input_device output_device</pre><p>
<p>
Or am I missing something here? (We use this quite often

for making second copies of 8mm tapes.) <P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 tcopy is indeed a good substitute for the dd 
command I showed in the article because the parameters
are less cryptic. 
I did not discuss tcopy in the article, because I did
not know of 
it at the time. However, even the tcopy will not be
able to 
copy a tape, if you have only one tape drive, which
was the original 
question.<P>

Thanks to the reader for this input. It is always a
delight to learn 
something new, and I find that UNIX gives me that opportunity
quite 
often, even after more than 10 years of active system
administration 
work. <P>

If your system does not have tcopy and you would like
to get 
it, you can find it in the original BSD 4.3 distribution.
The sources 
can also be found on the BSD 4.4 lite distribution.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Could you please tell me where can I find a perl script

that converts a host file to dns format. The DNS and
BIND 
book (from O'Reilly and Associates) mentions a program
written in 
perl that does the conversion. Do you know where I can
get this program?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 The script is called h2n, and is available from 
ftp.uu.net. It works well as a first approximation,
but if you have 
more than one network, you may create problems by not
maintaining 
the DNS directly.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I recently became a system administrator for a school

system's Internet connection. I have begun subscribing
to various 
publications dealing with UNIX and the Internet, not
to mention a 
buying a stack of books about 3 feet high. I subscribe
to Sys 
Admin and ran across your column, so I decided to pose
my question 
to you. What I am looking for is a step-by-step approach
to learning 
system administration. I have nearly a dozen books on
system administration 
that tell what to do, but with one or two exceptions
they don't tell 
you how to do it. I have found two sources that offer
UNIX 
system administration training videos.<P>

Can you recommend one of the videos or suggest anyone
else who can 
provide the elementary approach that I need, at least
to start?<P>

By way of background, I'm a librarian for grades 6-8.
After I got 
our UNIX system up and running and discovered the tremendous
amount 
of information that could be found on the Internet,
I contacted the 
librarians and computer coordinators in the school systems
that were 
a local call from us and invited them to dial-in to
our system. Things 
appear to reaching a sort of critical mass in terms
of use and enthusiasm, 
so any help you can give me in better serving my growing,
growing 
practically daily, number of users would be appreciated.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I have not personally seen any UNIX system administration

training video that I would recommend, and neither have
I ever heard 
about any video that experienced sysadmin's found useful
(for example, 
for training new junior admins locally). In general,
you should look 
for material that is prepared and presented by people
who do system 
administration for a living. People who are primarily
programmers 
but have done a bit of system administration on the
side do not have 
the overall experience, and while they may be able to
help you out 
in a tight spot today, their solutions might very well
put you in 
hot water at a later time. What I can recommend is Evi
Nemeth's UNIX 
System Administration Handbook (Prentice-Hall, 1989)
and the tutorials 
at either LISA or SANS conferences. Evi's book is a
few years old, 
and is now a bit dated, but it is still by far the best
book on the 
market. The tutorials at LISA and SANS are probably
not as polished 
as what you will see from companies providing such tutorials
to the 
industry, but the instructors at LISA and SANS are people
who deal 
with the problems they teach about on a daily basis.
This makes these 
tutorials, at least in my opinion, superior to any commercial
tutorials 
I ever have heard about.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I read with interest your article on the LISA VI Conference

in the Jan/Feb issue of Sys Admin. How would I acquire
a copy 
of the Paper on &quot;Overhauling Rdist for the '90s&quot;?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 The paper was presented at the LISA VI conferences
by 
Michael A. Cooper (mcooper@usc.edu). Both the LISA paper
and the sources 
for the new rdist are available by annonyous ftp from

usc.edu, in the directory /pub/rdist.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 In your column in the January issue of Sys Admin, 
you described how to set up a split name server. Under
this method, 
however, the internal hosts are able to resolve addresses
to external 
hosts, but they are not able to reach them [directly,
i.e., without 
connecting explicitly to the bastion host first -- ED].<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 You state correctly the situation, and whether or not

you want to be able to resolve external names on an
inside host is 
a matter of preference. It is fairly simple to set up
the inside name 
servers to use an internal root to achieve the result
you desire (how 
to do this is described in detail in the DNS and BIND
book 
from O'Reilly). If your firewall is built by a combination
of filtering 
routers and UNIX bastion hosts, then you need to have
the internal 
hosts resolve external addresses anyway. Choose the
solution that 
works best for you. Neither of the two seems more correct
to me, and 
as always, the ultimate choice depends on local circumstances.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 We have just installed a number of new SVr4 UNIX systems

in our lab, and the ls command drives me crazy by listing

files in a single column, instead of multiple columns
as it does on 
our SunOS systems. How much work will it be to port
the Berkeley version 
to System V?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 On System V rel 4, you should be able to get the sources

and compile them using the BSD environment (you get
the BSD environment 
by having /usr/ucb first in your search path on most
Svr4 
systems). However, before you start to do this work,
check to see 
if you have the Berkeley version in /usr/ucb/ls. Also,
if 
you use an alias for /bin/ls which adds the &quot;-C&quot;
option 
(columns), your current version of ls will start to
behave 
the way you want it, at least most of the time.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Could you direct me to an FTP site that would have
the 
sources listed in your fine magazine?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 You can find Sys Admin sources at ftp.uu.net. <P>
