<H1>Publisher's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
I suppose one who publishes several magazines shouldn't
admit to
having a favorite, but in truth I think Sys Admin and
its readers are
special.<P>

First, I hold UNIX in high regard.  I'm a programmer
and UNIX is
a particularly nice home for programmers.  I also think
that system
administration tools (perhaps because they so often
involve shell
capabilities) very effectively showcase the elegance
of UNIX.<P>

Second, I probably don't really know as much as I should
about
UNIX.  Of course, there are lots of subjects about which
I should
probably know more.  Unfortunately, I already know as
much as I want to
know about many of them.  I enjoy learning more about
UNIX, so I enjoy
reading the material we receive for this magazine.<P>

Third and most important, I like the attitude of our
readers. 
Teachers often comment on how different classes have
different
&quot;personalities.&quot;  Well, in my experience,
different portions of the
technical community also seem to have different personalities.
Of the
subgroups I've worked with, I think System Administrators
are the least
contentious--at least when talking to each other.  It
sounds corny, but
I believe that's because System Administrators are genuinely
interested
in helping others.  It's particularly gratifying to
be helping such a
group help others.<P>

Which leads to a final point:  there's a happy symmetry
between
Sys Admin's goals and its readers' attitude.  Like other
R&amp;D
publications, Sys Admin serves as a forum for readers--a
place where
they can share ideas, answer each other's questions,
provide a bit of
code that turns out to be missing piece in someone else's
puzzle.  The
natural inclination of System Administrators to do exactly
these things
makes for a perfect fit.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>
