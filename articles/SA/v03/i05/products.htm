<B>O'Reilly Releases 4.4BSD CD-ROM</B><P>

The Computer Systems Research Group of the University
of California 
at Berkeley, in cooperation with the Usenix Association
and O'Reilly 
&amp; Associates, Inc., has published the final, definitive
release of 
the Berkeley version of UNIX. The source code for the
system is available 
on CD-ROM and is accompanied by a five-volume documentation
set.<P>

The University has prepared a &quot;Lite&quot; release
of the operating 
system, from which the source code for a small number
of utilities 
and files, including a few from the operating system,
has been removed 
so that the system can be freely distributed. The source
code included 
on the 4.4BSD-Lite CD-ROM Companion provides information
on the design 
of UNIX and UNIX-like systems, and the source code for
the utilities 
and support libraries can be used as part of a programmer's
toolkit. 
In addition to the source code, the CD includes the
manual pages, 
other documentation, and research papers for the University
of California, 
Berkeley's 4.4BSD-Lite distribution. The five-volume
documentation 
set is available from O'Reilly with or without the CD-ROM.
The documentation 
includes: 4.4BSD System Manager's Manual, 4.4BSD User's

Reference Manual, 4.4BSD User's Supplementary Documents,

4.4BSD Programmer's Reference Manual, and 4.4BSD Programmer's

Supplementary Documents.<P>

The CD-ROM plus the five documentation volumes is priced
at $150. 
The CD-ROM by itself costs $40. Without the CD-ROM,
the documentation 
costs $120. For more information, contact O'Reilly &amp;

<B>Xi Software Announces X-Windows MOTIF Versions of Xi-Batch and Xi-Text</B><P>

Xi Software has announced X-Windows MOTIF versions of
its UNIX system 
management products Xi-Batch and Xi-Text.<P>

Xi-Batch is a general purpopse job batch scheduler for
UNIX systems. 
Jobs can be set for particular times, or intervals,
subject to user 
defined constraints. Viewing a job's contents, setting
its status, 
running a job, and aborting a job can all be handled
using menu commands. 
Additionally, elaborate time controls can be specified
by clicking 
on a combination of calendar and time choices. <P>

Xi-Text combines print spooling facilities with interactive
screen-based 
queue management and user-configurable interfaces. A
flexible form 
handling mechanism provides control of the printing
process, including 
automatic pre- or post-processing invoked at the start
or end of the 
print run, form type, document, or page. You can view
a job and change 
its parameters graphically. You can also configure printers
using 
the menus.<P>

For both Xi-Batch and Xi-Text, the interactive User
Permission Editor 
allows administrators to control user permissions. Both
tools have 
networking facilities which provide for jobs, condition
variables, 
and printers to be shared across UNIX hosts, with centralized
or distributed 
control. <P>

(ODI) 
and Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS) support.
The AIR 
Series implements PC to UNIX, mainframe, and Internet
connectivity 
through the following applications: NFS; AIR Telnet;
AIR tn3270; NetWare 
Virtual Terminal (NVT); Network File Manager (ftp);
FTP/RCP Servers; 
Line Printer Redirector (LPR); AIR Mail; AIR News; AIR
Gopher; and 
AIR X.<P>

In Version 2.5, the Network File Manager provides new
host drivers 
for Sequent, VMS, and MVS systems and adds an alternative
command-line 
interface. AIR Telnet adds capabilities for customizing
host settings 
and enhanced keyboard mapping. AIR tn3270 includes a
tunable terminal 
negotiation string. AIR Gopher adds a graphical Tree
Control for viewing 
gopher menus. The FTP Server provides for multiple user
connections, 
and directory settings and access restrictions. <P>

The AIR Series modules are priced from $149 to $399.

<B>SYSTEMWatch AI-L Adds Support for Solaris 2.x and AIX 3.2.5</B><P>

OPENService, Inc., has added two new platforms for SYSTEMWatch
AI-L, 
Solaris 2.x and IBM AIX 3.2.5. SYSTEMWatch AI-L uses
expert system 
and behavior-modeling algorithms to automate tasks such
as monitoring 
printers, file systems, mail queues, backups, system
performance, 
security, customer applications, databases, and user
processes at 
the host level. <P>

When problems are detected, SYSTEMWatch AI-L can alert
the system 
administrator, make recommendations for remedial action,
and, for 
some instances, take action immediately. The swap and
memory manager, 
for example, automatically increases swap space when
existing space 
approaches capacity. The file system and disk manager
takes action 
to avoid critical file and disk congestion. The CPU
and resource manager 
can temporarily stop, reprioritize, or kill processes
to manage system 
load. The daemon manager averts such problems as electronic
mail failure, 
print queue slowdown, or communications breakdowns such
as the loss 
of a market data feed. OPENService claims that the increased
productivity 
will permit a systems administrator to manage 150 to
500 systems.<P>

For more information, contact OPENService Inc., Three
City Square, 
Albany, New York 12207; (518) 465-1400.<P>

<B>Human Designed Systems Announces X Terminals</B><P>

Human Designed Systems has announced a line of X terminals
designed 
to operate with IBM RS/6000 and mainframe environments,
in addition 
to mixed environments of Sun, HP, and DEC machines.
The product line, 
called the HDS ViewStation TR Series, includes the ability
to connect 
to Token Ring, Ethernet, and PPP networks simultaneously.
One HDS 
X terminal can have up to four IP addresses (one for
each network) 
and can act as a network router, passing information
from one network 
to the other. Additionally, each member of the ViewStation
TR Series 
includes IBM 3270 emulation for direct connection to
IBM mainframe 
applications. <P>

Every HDS ViewStation TR X terminal includes a set of
local X applications 
called HDSperx. These applications allow X clients to
run inside the 
HDS X terminal, offloading the host system. Local clients
include 
OSF/Motif and OPEN LOOK window managers, 3270 and DEC
VT320 terminal 
emulation, a PostScript display application, and productivity
tools 
such as alarms, clocks, calculators, and a screen saver
with a local 
screen lock. As a result, OSF/Motif applications can
run on an IBM 
mainframe using the terminal, but X isn't needed on
the mainframe.<P>

HDS ViewStation TR customers can port their own applications
to run 
locally inside the X terminal using HDS's Developer
Kit. The terminals 
also include support for full motion video (analog and
digital), for 
teleconferencing over token ring or Ethernet networks,
