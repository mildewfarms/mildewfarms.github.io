<H1>Books: A User's Report</H1><p>
<P>
Elizabeth Zinkann<P>

For this issue, I reviewed books on a variety of subjects.
I read 
Preventing Computer Injury: The Hand Book, by Stephanie
Brown 
(Ergonome, Inc.); The Elements of E-mail Style: Communicate
Effectively 
via Electronic Mail, by David Angell and Brent Heslop
(Addison-Wesley); 
The Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog, 2nd ed.,
by Ed 
Krol (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.); New Riders'
Official Internet 
Yellow Pages, by Christine Maxwell and Czeslaw Jan Grycz
(New Riders 
Publishing); Open Computing's Best UNIX Tips Ever, by
Kenneth 
H. Rosen, Richard R. Rosinski, and Douglas A. Host (Osborne
McGraw-Hill); 
Net Guide: Your Map to the Services, Information, and
Entertainment 
on the Electronic Highway, by Peter Rutten, Albert F.
Bayers III, 
and Kelly Maloni (Random House); and Making TEX Work,

by Norman Walsh (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.). I
hope that you enjoy 
this collection as much as I did.<P>

<B><I>Preventing Computer Injury: The Hand Book</I><br>
by Stephanie Brown<br>
Ergonome, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-884388-01-9</B><P>

Although computer keyboards do not come with a label,
&quot;Caution: 
This may be hazardous to your health,&quot; it becomes
true in many 
cases. Repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI) or Cumulative
Trauma Disorders 
(CTD), such as tendonitis and carpal tunnel syndrome,
affect over 
20% of computer keyboard users. Stephanie Brown, a concert
pianist, 
first encountered these symptoms in other pianists and
developed a 
method to help them avoid these injuries. When she bought
a computer, 
she noticed the same habits among computer users. <P>

The Hand Book contains two sections: At Your Keyboard

and Caring for Your Hands. The first part identifies
common 
positions that may damage your hands and wrists and
shows how to correct 
them. Each chapter demonstrates several incorrect ways
to type, then 
presents an exercise to help you find the best way to
position yourself 
while at the computer. Ms. Brown outlines the history
of the keyboard 
and explains why some well-known typing instructions
are not healthy. <P>

The second section of the book provides exercises, stretches,
and 

massages to relax your hands, wrists, arms, and back.
It is complemented 
by two appendices: Appendix A demonstrates how to adjust
your equipment 
and Appendix B provides the 12 Golden Rules. As I read
the book, I 
also tried the exercises presented in these chapters.
Some of the 
positions that cause problems hurt not only the hands,
but also the 
shoulders, back, and neck. The exercises are restful
and don't take 
more than a minute to complete. Ms. Brown presents 88
photographs 
displaying both correct and incorrect positions. The
12 Golden Rules 
consist of 24 photographs which are reproduced on a
color poster suitable 
for hanging by your workstation. An eight-page brochure
detailing 
how best to use The Hand Book is also included. In addition

to the exercises, the author also provides tips such
as: <P>

&quot;Wrist pads are great while you're resting your
hands, 
or reading over work, but not while you're typing.&quot;
<P>

Stephanie Brown has produced an excellent book focusing
on the potential 
harm in certain keyboard techniques. Ms. Brown describes
her topics 
well and in a readable style for the layperson. She
establishes some 
easily remembered connections to prevent computer injury.
For example, 
although a jogger wouldn't run without the benefit of
warm-up and 
cool-down exercises, he or she probably wouldn't apply
the same practices 
to keyboard entry. Thanks to Sister Eusebia, my grade-school
piano 
teacher, I try to warm-up before playing the piano.
However, until 
I read Ms. Brown's book, it didn't occur to me to transfer
these habits 
to my typewriter or computer keyboard. This book should
be read by 
everybody engaged in keyboard work, especially those
who are already 
bordering on some type of Repetitive Stress Injury.
The corrections 
to poor technique are easy to learn and will soon become
second nature. 
Stephanie Brown has offered an alternative to RSIs.
The Hand Book 
may be ordered from Ergonome, Inc., New York City, (212)
222-9600. <P>

<B><I>The Elements of E-mail Style: Communicate Effectively

via Electronic Mail</I><br>
by David Angell and Brent Heslop<br>
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company<br>
ISBN 0-201-62709-4</B><P>

Most e-mail messages resemble an impromptu speech; they
are hastily 
composed and dispatched, without the advantages of proofing
or editing. 
This spontaneity explains the many misspelled words,
poor sentence 
structure, and flaming in current e-mail messages. Individuals
known 
for their meticulous writing style in letters and reports
generate 
electronic mail with almost no technique and few standards.
Some users 
respond emotionally to e-mail, expressing thoughts online
that would 
go unspoken in a face-to-face encounter. Angell and
Heslop address 
these and other problems unique to e-mail communications.
Patterned 
after the classic The Elements of Style, by William
Strunk, 
Jr. and E.B. White, The Elements of E-mail Style describes

simple and straightforward techniques for writing effective
e-mail. <P>

Angell and Heslop recognize both the advantages and
the disadvantages 
of electronic mail, and they indentify points to consider
before writing 
an e-mail message, including etiquette, politics, and
privacy. For 
example, while all capital letters may attract attention
on a printed 
page, an e-mail message entirely in upper case (SHOUTING)
creates 
headaches for the reader. The authors show the user
how to structure 
an e-mail message for impact. Since the recipient may
be sent many 
messages, he or she may use a filter to prioritize incoming
e-mail. 
Angell and Heslop explain how to create a compelling
subject line 
and compose an effective e-mail message. This includes
not only good 
sentence and paragraph structure, but also the proper
tone, punctuation, 
formatting, and mechanics, such as spelling and abbreviations.
The 
book concludes with a glossary entitled English and
E-mail Jargon 
and an Appendix, Conventions for Posting on the Internet.&quot;
<P>

The Elements of E-mail Style addresses a previously
overlooked 
subject. Many books describe how to send e-mail, but
very few discuss 
how to compose it. Angell and Heslop not only tell the
reader what 
should be done, but also demonstrate how to do it. The
authors have 
presented guidelines for e-mail composition in a familiar,
friendly 
style. This book should be read and kept next to your
computer keyboard, 
where it will be referenced often. <P>

<B><I>The Whole Internet User's Guide &amp; Catalog<br>
Second Edition<br>
by Ed Krol<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-063-5</B><P>

Krol has updated the original edition to include new
Internet tools 
and to provide more information on existing topics.
One of the first 
new concepts discussed is Multi-purpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME). 
MIME allows its users to attach files to e-mail messages.
However, 
MIME's reputation focuses on its multimedia ability.
It can include 
images, recordings, and movies with an e-mail message
or permit the 
recipient to execute software on his or her system.
One of the software 
packages that can accept MIME messages is pine, which
has 
become popular because of its menu, its simplicity,
and its availability. <P>

Following the chapter on electronic mail, Krol examines
Network News, 
newsgroups, and newsreaders. Although he mentions all
of the different 
newsreaders, he uses nn to demonstrate how to install
and 
use a newsreader. However, at the end of the chapter,
Krol presents 
a thorough introduction to the tin newsreader. <P>

The chapter originally called &quot;Finding Software&quot;
has been 
changed to &quot;Finding Files&quot;; it includes an
updated table of 
available archie servers and additional sections on
controlling 
filename matching, controlling a search geographically,
and archie 
under the X Window System. Under the X Window System,
the user may 
access xarchie, which features a graphical user interface

to archie and a built-in FTP client. The chapters &quot;Finding

Someone, Tunneling Through the Internet:Gopher,&quot;
and &quot;Searching 
Indexed Databases: WAIS, The World Wide Web, and Other
Applications&quot; 
have been reorganized and rewritten to explain new features
within 
these topics. Krol addresses the changes in the &quot;white
pages&quot; 
and shows different ways of locating someone on the
Internet via finger, 
whois, and netfind.<P>

In addition to new information, tables, and figures
presented about 
gopher, Krol introduces Veronica and Jughead and details
how 
they work. The author also provides public WAIS clients
and discusses 
how to use the Mosaic browser in the World Wide Web.
Mosaic works 
with the Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and the X Window
System on 
UNIX (where it is xmosaic). Among the appendices, Krol
has added a 
brief introduction to UNIX and has updated &quot;The
Whole Internet 
Catalog&quot; and the lists of service providers.<P>

The first edition of this book was excellent; the second
edition, 
with its extensive modifications and additions, is superb.
Krol has 
done the impossible; he has produced a book which provides
precisely 
what the Internet user (beginning, intermediate, and
advanced) needs 
to know. His writing style remains logical, progressing
steadily from 
the least to the most complex concepts, and collegial
on tone, like 
a colleague discussing the information super highway.
As I read this 
new edition, I was impressed not only by Krol's considerable
knowledge, 
but also by his sense of humor. I recommend that you
purchase this 
book, read it, and keep it near your computer for reference.

<B><I>New Riders' Official Internet Yellow Pages</I><br>
by Christine Maxwell and Czeslaw Jan Grycz<br>
New Riders Publishing<br>
ISBN 1-56205-306-X</B><P>

The first few times a novice travels the Internet, he
or she may be 
awed by its enormity and diverseness. However, the more
familiar the 
user becomes, the more the Internet resembles a friendly
neighborhood. 
with the traveler concentrating on his or her specific
destinations, 
oblivious to the other resources available. Enter New
Riders' 
Official Internet Yellow Pages. This book provides so
much information, 
it could overwhelm the reader. However, magically, it
does not. Maxwell 
and Grycz present a resource, not unlike the yellow
pages in your 
local phone book, with over 10,000 entries.<P>

The authors preface the directory with information that
merits the 
reader's attention. They explain what a listing contains,
what the 
icons represent, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL),
and what the 
user should expect when accessing the resource. Maxwell
and Grycz 
have evaluated each entry as Standard, Major, or Turbo.
They not only 
define what each ranking means, but also demonstrate
how to identify 
each listing's ranking on sight. The authors briefly
discuss the most 
popular Internet tools, including Telnet, FTP, finger,
Newsreaders, 
gopher, and Mosaic. The appendices to the book feature
a keyword listing, 
an audience field listing, a list of Internet Service
Providers, a 
glossary, recommended further readings, and &quot;A
Whimsical Tour 
of the Internet&quot; by Eric Theis. <P>

A particularly valuable feature of this book is that
it helps readers 
find both general and highly specialized Internet resources.
The authors 
have provided not only the entries' locations, but also
helpful instructions 
for the user attempting to subscribe to a specific service.
The &quot;Keywords,&quot; 
&quot;Audience,&quot; and &quot;Profile&quot; sections
are particularly 
useful to the reader, since the names of some listings
can foster 
confusion. For example, ADA is a programming language
or the Americans 
with Disabilities Act, while the Bass Audience consists
of stereo 
enthusiasts, not fishermen or musicians. A given listing
may appear 
more than once if it would logically relate to more
than one keyword. 
This excellent directory helps the user find exactly
what he or she 
is seeking, particularly the more obscure resources.
If the Internet 
is the Information Highway, this book is the Atlas.
<P>

<B><I>Open Computing's Best UNIX Tips Ever</I><br>
by Kenneth H. Rosen, Richard R. Rosinski, and Douglas A. Host<br>
Osborne McGraw-Hill<br>
ISBN 0-07-881924-5</B><P>

Rosen, Rosinski, and Host address several topics which
typically generate 
questions or problems from UNIX users and system administrators.
Although 
the book's organization comprises chapters and subtopics,
the tips 
vary from a few sentences to a few paragraphs in length.
Due to this 
brevity, the answer to an isolated problem may be found,
read, and 
understood before your prompt returns. The tips are
located by tip 
number; no page numbers appear throughout the entire
book. This design 
puzzled me at first, since I had started browsing at
the back of the 
book. However, the Table of Contents lists chapter,
subtopic, and 
tip, including the tip number. The index also lists
the tip number. 
Since each page may contain from one to three tip numbers,
it is easy 
to locate a specific tip, which eliminates the need
for tip number 
to page number mapping. <P>

Open Computing's Best UNIX Tips Ever provides information
for 
novice, experienced, and advanced UNIX users. Beginners
should examine 
the first eight chapters, which focus on installing
and organizing 
a UNIX system, customizing the environment, mail, editors,
text formatting, 
shell programming, and UNIX tools. The more complex
chapters discuss 
communications and networking, the Internet, system
and network administration, 
using both DOS and UNIX, the X Window System, and C
programming. However, 
experienced UNIX users should not dismiss the introductory
chapters 
without first inspecting their contents. For example,
the first chapter 
contains two tips and a diagram on the Framed Access
Command Environment 
(FACE), plus a subtopic entitled &quot;Some Useful Resources&quot;
which 
includes periodicals and organizations.<P>

Rosen, Rosinski, and Host provide sources for software,
including 
Elm, mush, mh, and Mosaic; present assistance 
with sed, awk, and perl; discuss the ed, 
vi, and emacs editors; and demonstrate text formatting

with troff. In the chapter on DOS and UNIX, the authors
consider 
most combinations: DOS and UNIX, DOS under UNIX, networking
DOS and 
UNIX, using Macintosh PCs and UNIX, utilizing the MKS
toolkit, and 
implementing X Windows on DOS PCs.<P>

For each topic, the authors provide useful recommend
sources for further 
study, and explain where and how to obtain related software.
The progression 
from topic to topic is logical, the writing style is
clear and readable, 
and figures and examples are used to good effect. Rosen,
Rosinski, 
and Host display an extensive knowledge of UNIX through
the 1,014 
tips included here. Open Computing's Best UNIX Tips
Ever will 
complement your other UNIX books, enhancing their value
and increasing 
your understanding. This excellent book merits every
UNIX user's and 
administrator's attention. <P>

<B><I>Net Guide: Your Map to the Services, Information,
and Entertainment on the Electronic Highway</I><br>
A Michael Wolff Book<br>
by Peter Rutten, Albert F. Bayers III, and Kelly Maloni<br>
Random House Electronic Publishing<br>
ISBN 0-679-75106-8</B><P>

This well-organized handbook to online services focuses
not only on 
the Internet, but also on America Online, CompuServe,
Prodigy, Usenet, 
Delphi, Genie, Bix, Fidonet, and hundred of BBSs. Containing
over 
4,000 entries, Net Guide classifies the listings according

to topics such as Arts &amp; Entertainment, Computers
&amp; Software, Business 
&amp; Finance, Home, Hobbies, &amp; Shopping, Public
Affairs, and Politics 
&amp; the Media, to name only a few. Each entry consists
of the name of 
the item, a short profile, the location of the item,
and how to access 
it. As an introduction to the directory, the authors
answer 27 Frequently 
Asked Questions (FAQs), including how to use a Net Guide
entry, how 
to telnet and FTP, how to download a file and look at
a picture, and 
what to do when you forget the procedures. <P>

Throughout the book, sidebars called &quot;Cybernotes&quot;
appear. 
They may contain supplementary information about traveling
online, 
excerpts from different listings, and acceptable e-mail
abbreviations. 
Since each subject features several subtopics, an explanation
of the 
subject, and either sketches or pictures, the result
is visually pleasing. 
The use of bold fonts, plus a mixture of red and black
print, helps 
to provide visual cues to the reader (at 3 a.m., this
becomes very 
important, if not essential!). Net Guide features some
entries 
that aren't published anywhere else, as, for example,
listings on 
antiques, coins, dollhouses, postcards, Swatch watches,
trains, stamps, 
baseball cards, and a general group on all collectibles.
(I belong 
to CompuServe and America Online and still didn't know
about all these 
groups!) <P>

The Net Guide also offers free connect time to a new
online 
service, Net Guide Online. Although it is not currently
available, 
it should be fully operational by the time this column
is printed. 
(I received an update to the book only yesterday that
included 20 
modifications and five new sites.)<P>

This excellent text examines the best (and worst) aspects
of the commercial 
online services and gives the forums the credit they
deserve, but 
so seldom receive. It describes common problems on the
Internet and 
discusses ways to prevent them. The authors introduce
each topic with 
a brief explanation, which gives the reader a sense
of continuity 
throughout the book. The layout of the book is exceptional;
it contents 
are extensive and informative. <P>

<B><I>Making TEX Work</I><br>
by Norman Walsh<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-051-1</B><P>

When Donald Knuth needed a tool to typeset scientific
and mathematical 
text, he couldn't find one to meet his specifications,
so he developed 
several pieces of software that became the TEX typesetting

system. Approximately 20 years later, word-processing
software and 
desktop publishing software have changed drastically,
allowing users 
to create quality professional documents, but TEX remains
unrivaled 
in its ability to typeset equations. Versions of TEX
exist 
for every platform, and users are still frustrated by
the myriad of 
programs TEX needs to work. <P>

Norman Walsh wrote Making TEX Work to eliminate this

user frustration by showing clearly what programs are
necessary for 
TEX to run effectively. He presents the information
in three 
sections: Part I provides &quot;An Introduction to TEX,&quot;

Part II discusses the &quot;Elements of a Complex Document,&quot;
and 
Part III gives &quot;A Tools Overview.&quot; The first
chapter explains 
TEX for the beginner, proves that TEX can produce the

same results as a desktop publisher, if the user wishes,
and presents 
some informative flowcharts that demonstrate how TEX
works. 
Perhaps the most valuable item in the first chapter
is a detailed 
list of TEX advantages. Other topics in Part I include
&quot;Editing,&quot; 
&quot;Running TEX&quot; (including errors and interpreting
error 
messages), and &quot;Macro Packages.&quot;<P>

In the second section, Walsh examines fonts, graphics,
international 
considerations, printing, previewing, online documentation,
METAFONT, 
bibliographies, indexes, and glossaries. The third section
discusses 
non-commercial and commercial environments, TEX on the
Macintosh, 
and TEX Utilities. Among the appendices, Walsh provides
extensive 
METAFONT examples, resources, and a bibliography which
contains more 
sources than I realized existed on this topic. <P>

Making TEX Work presents a clear, understandable explanation

of TEX. O'Reilly &amp; Associates provide the ultimate
TEX 
example: Making TEX Work was typeset completely in 
TEX, and includes text in Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and
Japanese. 
Walsh displays an extensive knowledge of the topic,
and his style 
helps the reader to easily comprehend the concepts.
Many figures, 
tables, and examples complement the text. Anyone who
uses a version 
of TEX will enjoy this book; it tells you all about
the latest 
developments and provides sources for the latest software.
Anyone 
who has ever wanted to learn TEX was waiting for this
book. 
It is for all TEX users, whether beginning or advanced.
I recommend 
it highly. <P>
