and display 
them with OS/2 programs on a single PC screen.<P>

Features of XoftWare/32 for OS/2 include: Professional
Edition Utilities, 
a Network File Manager utility with file transfer and
local printing 
capabilities, a Concurrent Window Manager for simultaneous
use and 
display of both local and UNIX window managers, a interactive

includes support for TCP/IP network software.<P>

AGE also announced XoftWare/32 for Windows with XIE
Option, an image-enabled 
PC X Server which supports the X Image Extension (XIEv5.0).
XoftWare/32 
for Windows with XIE Option supports standard compression
formats 
such as TIFF, FAX, and JPEG. The compression provides
a twenty-fold 
improvement in performance for transmission of images.<P>

AGE has also announced Serial ConneXion, a serial-X
technology which 
transmits compressed data over Internet Protocol lines.
Serial ConneXion 
transmits UNIX applications over serial lines and supports
multiple 
ftp, telnet, and host login operations, as well as the

<B>Lone Star Upgrades and Ports Lone-Tar</B><P>

Lone Star Software has upgraded Lone-Tar, a backup and
restore utility 
for UNIX-DOS internetworks. According to the company,
Lone-Tar is 
100 percent tar compatible and can salvage data from
corrupted tar 
backups. Lone-Tar doesn't use tar; instead it uses Lone
Star's own 
proprietary programs, which allow for tar compatibility
in uncompressed 
format. Features of Lone-Tar include: Tape-Tell, which
monitors backup 
tapes, lets users know which tapes are being overwritten,
and includes 
backup abort option; and cron administration, which
lets users send 
reports to a terminal, printer, and mail during unattended
backups. 
Other features of Lone-Tar include: hardware independence;
maintenance 
of log files for archives, restores, and verifications;
a non-destructive 
restore option; override of file locking (backup while
using your 
software); and automated logoff of all users. Lone-Tar
can span multiple 
volumes and handle dual devices.<P>

Features of Lone-Tar 2.1 include: a menu interface;
cross-platform 
compatibility; ability to unmount/remount file systems
on-the-fly; 
wildcards support on backups/restores; simultaneous
use of wildcards; 
enhanced error logging; integration with Tape-Tell;
bit-level verification; 
and double buffering. Other features include: restoration
enhancements; 
flags for additional options; variables for configurability;
and flat 
file restore. Lone-Tar also works with Cactus DOS-TAR.<P>

Lone-Star has recently ported Lone-Tar to DEC OSF-1.
In addition to 
DEC OSF-1, Lone-Tar supports SCO UNIX and Xenix platforms
and is available 
for 30 versions and releases of UNIX. The company also
plans to release 
Lone-Tar for Sun, HP, and RS/6000 platforms.<P>

Existing Lone-Tar customers can upgraded to Lone-Tar
2.1 for $85. 
Licensing for Lone-Tar 2.1 is on a per-CPU basis; however,
sites are 
not charged for using Lone-Tar with additional nodes
attached via 
NFS. Lone-Tar for DEC OSF-1 is priced at $495. For more
information

<B>OSIware Upgrades X.500 Directory Services Software</B><P>

OSIware has upgraded its X.500 directory services software,
Messenger 
500. Messenger 500 provides address lookup and yellow-pages
services 
across dissimilar messaging systems. The Messenger 500
directory search 
can be installed on a server as a standalone directory
to be queried 
via e-mail, or it can be integrated with a messaging
system to automate 
directory queries and synchronize multiple directories.
Messenger 
500 can also be integrated with an application such
as a scheduling 
program that uses a message system to set meetings.
Messenger 500's 
open interfaces allow future support for X.400 mail
systems, as well 
as for proprietary LAN-based or host-based mail systems.<P>

Built on an open, extensible database, Messenger 500
can be configured 
to provide a central repository for corporate information
in addition 
to e-mail addresses. The database can also store network
management 
information. X.500 provides access controls to restrict
the database 
to authorized requests for information.<P>

Messenger 500 conforms to the ITU 1988 specifications
for directory 
services with additional 1993 extensions. It supports
the Directory 
Access Protocol (DAP), which provides access to an X.500
directory, 
and the Directory System Protocol (DSP), which handles
communications 
among distributed X.500 servers. Messenger 500 also
supports the XAPIA's 
application program interfaces X/Open Directory Services
and X/Open 
Object Management. The upgraded software supports communications
over 
both X.25 and TCP/IP.<P>

Messenger 500 is now in beta testing. Prices for Messenger
500 start 
at $4,000 depending on platform. For more information

<B>PDC Introduces DiskInfo and FreezeFrame</B><P>

Peripheral Devices Corporation has introduced DiskInfo
and FreezeFrame. 
DiskInfo 1.1 analyses disk usage across heterogeneous
UNIX networks. 
Operating under Sun, HP, Auspex, and IBM platforms,
DiskInfo graphically 
categorizes files by owner, size, access time, and file
type to help 
determine what data should be archived or migrated to
near-line or 
off-line storage. DiskInfo provides a graphical user
interface with 
graphs and charts to illustrate disk usage. A system
administrator 
can allocate or shift storage resources based on the
usage patterns.<P>

The second product, FreezeFrame 2.0, is a non-proprietary
software 
product the permits live backup across heterogeneous
UNIX networks, 
even while users continue to modify files. By capturing
a view of 
the disk at a particular time, FreezeFrame lets backup
utilities write 
the original version of an active file to a tape through
a caching 
mechanism. Writes to a disk that occur during backup
are updated on 
the file. In addition to working with standard UNIX
backup utilities, 
FreezeFrame integrates with BudTool. Another feature
of FreezeFrame 
is its loadable device driver. FreezeFrame supports
Sun and Auspex 
platforms. Also FreezeFrame is designed for installation
of each of 
the system administrator's servers.<P>

DiskInfo costs $795 per network. FreezeFrame 2.0 costs
$295 for the 
first node, or $1,995 for a 10-node pack. For more information

Puzzle Systems Corporation has ported its SoftNet Utilities
Novell 
server emulation software to the DEC Alpha AXP platform
running OSF-1. 
SoftNet Utilities is designed to integrate UNIX-based

file system 
without disk partitioning, reconfiguring the OSF-1 kernel,
or adding 
drivers to the PC NetWare clients, In addition to full
file access, 
bi-directional OSF-1/UNIX/Novell printer sharing is
also included.<P>

Licenses for SoftNet Utilities for DEC Alpha range from
$1,299 to
