The first book dedicated to firewall configuration is
now available. 
It is Firewalls and Internet Security by William R.
Cheswick 
and Steven M. Bellowin, and is published by Addison-Wesley
in the 
Professional Computing Series. The book is generally
well written 
and gives many good tips on setting up and maintaining
a firewall, 
though practical examples are relatively sparse. If
you are responsible 
for a firewall, this book will be a good investment.<P>

USENIX is sponsoring a symposium on high-speed networking,
August 
1-3, 1994, at Berkeley. Judging from the preliminary
program, the 
symposium appears to be aimed at the people developing
the next generation 
of networks, but if your site is moving in that direction,
it might 
be worth checking out. What looks most interesting to
me are the two 
keynote talks, to be given by Craig Partridge and Van
Jacobson.<P>

I have received many requests for more information about
SAGE. Unfortunately, 
there is not much good news to report, as many of the
SAGE working 
groups have become inactive. While this may be in part
because many 
system administrators are very busy, it has in my opinion
largely 
been brought on by the SAGE board itself. There appears
to have been 
very little real support from the board, and of the
two working groups 
who did complete the tasks set forth in their charters,
the SAGE-Locals 
working groups proposal has been completely ignored,
while the result 
produced by the SAGE Job Description working group was
barely passed 
by the board on a four-to-three vote. The unfortunate
fact is that 
most of the successful activities SAGE is associated
with have been 
undertaken by individual members, often in spite of
the action of 
the board. If you think I am wrong, please get in touch
with me, as 
I would be glad to learn that my interpretation is all
wrong. Enough 
said -- let's get on to more useful matters.<P>

I have received several requests for information about
where to get 
the proceedings from the LISA and SANS conferences.
All LISA proceedings, 
as well as the SANS III proceedings, are available from
the USENIX 
conference office:<P>

<I>USENIX Conference Office
22672 Lambert Street, Suite 613
El Toro, CA 92630 USA
(714) 588-8649; FAX: (714) 588-9706
E-mail: conference@usenix.org</I><P>

LISA is the USENIX System Administration Conference
(formerly known 
as the Large Installation System Administration Conference),
and SANS 
is the System Administration, Networking and Security
Conference. 
If you have not checked out these proceedings, I suggest
you do so 
at your first opportunity. They contain much information
that can 
be applied to your daily work.<P>

And now to the questions for this issue:<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Excuse me if this is a stupid question: What is the
difference 
between downsizing and rightsizing?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 There are no stupid questions. If one person is asking

about a topic, there will be plenty of others who have
wondered about 
the same thing, but who have not dared to ask, because
it could be 
a &quot;stupid question.&quot; In this case, there is
no difference 
at all. The &quot;rightsizing&quot; phrase was thought
up by some UNIX 
vendor's marketing people, because they thought that
the &quot;down&quot; 
in &quot;downsizing&quot; had a negative influence on
their product. 
Go figure.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I have followed your advice from the January issue
and 
have installed the Firewall Toolkit from tis.com on
our gateway. 
However, many of our users wants to be able to use xmosaic,
and there 
is no proxy server included for this. What can be done?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 The Firewall Toolkit does not support any proxies for

xmosaic and lynx, or any of the similar clients, because
the people 
at TIS do not think it can be done in a secure manner.
However, in 
the real world, we are faced with users who demand tools
such as Mosaic, 
and we will therefore often be forced to support them,
even though 
it is not advisable from a security standpoint. One
possible solution 
is to use the WWW server httpd from info.cern.ch configured

as a proxy server. <P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I need to make changes to our e-mail configuration,
and 
wondered if I should try to learn sendmail, or if it
would 
be better to switch to smail3.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 As your question did not include any site-specific
information, 
it's difficult to give a specific answer. However, if
you are mainly 
a UUCP site, smail3 might work very well for you, as
smail 
integrates better with UUCP than does sendmail. At a
larger 
site, or a site which has a direct Internet connection,
you are probably 
much better off learning to work with sendmail. I recommend

that you get Bryan Costales' book, sendmail, from O'Reilly

and Associates, if you have not already done so. The
book gives a 
very thorough introduction to sendmail, and if you are
using 
the latest version (currently sendmail 8.6.9, available
from 
ftp.cs.berkeley.edu in the ucb/sendmail directory),

you can take advantage of the m4 configuration Eric
Allman has put 
together for people who do not want to delve too deeply
into the sendmail.cf 
file.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I need to establish some kind of inexpensive call-back

facility for our modem lines. DO you know of any software
which does 
this?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 No freely distributable software exists, to my knowledge.

If you are setting up a new facility, you can purchase
modems with 
the call-back feature built in. Another alternative,
if your version 
of UNIX supports a working ct command (several examples
of 
vendors ship the ct command without testing it). The
ct 
command is kind of a marriage between cu/tip and getty,

allowing you to dial out to a remote modem, and then
spawn a getty 
when you get the connection. If neither dial-back modems
nor the ct 
command are available, then a last resort could be to
get the sources 
for tip and getty from the BSD Net2 or 4.4-lite distributions,

and use them to hack your own ct-like command.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I understand that it is important to monitor my system,

but what should I be looking for?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Some of the most important things to look for include

how busy the disks are (shown by the iostat command),
whether 
or not the system is swapping (shown by the vmstat command),

and, overall, what kind of processes are running on
the machine (shown 
by the ps command, or top if you have it). In addition,

if the System V accounting package is available, I encourage
you to 
use it to get overall statistics on system usage. The
goal here is 
to develop an understanding of how the system works
and where the 
possible bottlenecks are. If you know how your system
behaves normally, 
it is much easier to locate the source of trouble when
the system 
does not perform as expected. Other things to look out
for include, 
of course, disks filling up (use df) and network congestion

(use netstat). In addition, you should read the various
log 
files generated by the system every day. While it can
be very boring 
to sift through thousands of lines of logging information,
of which 
much is useful only as input for statistical programs,
you must do 
this to look for critical messages, such as a disk drive
starting 
to fail, or a program running out of critical resources.
Way too often, 
I come out to a new client, where a system has &quot;suddenly&quot;

started to fail, only to find a long trail of warning
messages from 
the system which have  been ignored because nobody has
read the logs. 
Doing all of this is part of pro-active system administration,
which 
will help you avoid getting into situations where you
have to fight 
fires.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I suppose (by your definition in Nov/Dec 1993 issue
of 
Sys Admin), I'm a Novice System Administrator. Well,
I won't 
bore you with the details, except to tell you that I
use an RS6000 
running AIX 3.2.3 which has a 150Mb tape drive (IBM
model 7207). My 
question is this: I want to make backup copies of tapes
(I suppose 
it's the equivalent of DOS's diskcopy command) -- will

the command<P>
<PRE>
cpio -i &lt; /dev/rst0 | cpio -o &gt; /dev/rst0</pre><p>
<p>
work ?<P>

Also, in your column in the same issue, you use the
acronym SAGE. 
What does this stand for? (I can figure out the &quot;Systems
Administrator&quot; 
part.)<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Your cpio pipe will not work for you, as the 
first part will restore the content of the tape to disk,
and the second 
part will attempt to write an End-Of-Tape, effectively
erasing the 
tape. You can do one of two things: if you have plenty
of disk space, 
you can restore the tape in an otherwise empty partition,
and then 
back it up again. This is the safest way of doing it,
but also the 
most cumbersome. An alternative, which will require
two tape drives, 
is to use dd something like this (you will need to specify

the correct blocking factor):<P>
<PRE>
dd if=/dev/rst0 of=/dev/rst1 bs=$BLOCKFACTOR</pre><p>
<p>
however, this method will only work if both tapes are

perfect (and you will not necessarily learn about problems
until you 
want to restore the tape). To be able to do something
like the MS-DOS 
diskcopy command, you would have to switch the tapes
between 
each read and write operation, which will not work well
with a streaming 
tape device, and for 150 Mb, could take hours.<P>

As for your question about the SAGE acronym, we did
it backwards in 
the working group that developed the original proposal
for the SAGE 
organization. Several members really liked the name
SAGE, and we spent 
a lot of time trying to find something the acronym would
fit. We finally 
came up with System Administrators Guild, but that left
the &quot;E&quot; 
unaccounted for. My proposal was that the &quot;E&quot;
in SAGE is the 
&quot;E&quot; that Denis Ritchie left off in the creat
system 
call so many years ago. In an interview some years back,
he was asked 
if there were anything he would do differently if he
were to implement 
UNIX all over again, and he replied that he would not
leave the &quot;e&quot; 
off in the create system call. Well, we have not been
able 
to fix the creat, but we have at least balanced it,
by adding 
an &quot;E&quot; to SAGE (and who would like the organization
to be 
called SAG?).<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I want to keep better track of how I use my time in
administrating 
our systems. Is there any software which can do this?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 If you're looking for something more or less automatic,

I think the answer is no. However, you might check out
timecard, 
from ftp.cs.colorado.edu. It is a perl script which

allows you to keep track of the time used on various
projects. <P>
