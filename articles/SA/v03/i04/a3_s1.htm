<H1>Sidebar: About the SecureNet Key</H1><p>
<P>
The SecureNet Key (SNK) is a challenge/response personal
identification 
token that resembles a small, pocket-size calculator.
The SNK was 
originally designed for use with Digital Pathway's line
of SecureNet 
access control devices, but it is now available as a
separate product.<P>

The SNK has an electronic chip that implements a public
key cryptographic 
algorithm using DES as the encryption scheme. (Public-key
cryptography 
was invented in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin
Hellman [1] in 
order to solve the problem of key management.) Each
participant gets 
a pair of keys, the public key and the private key.
Each participant's 
public key is published while the private key is kept
secret. The 
need for sender and receiver to share secret information
is eliminated: 
all communications involve only public keys, and no
private key is 
ever transmitted or shared.<P>

Before the SNK can be used, the system administrator
must prime the 
SNK with the public key. The public key is a 24-bit
random number 
unique for each and every SNK. After the SNK has been
primed with 
the public key, it is handed over to the user, who then
finishes the 
programming of the SNK by entering the private key --
a four-digit 
personal identification number (PIN). The SNK cannot
be used until 
this step has been completed. Once it is primed and
ready, only the 
user to whom the SNK was issued can unlock the device
for use, by 
using the PIN.<P>

In use, the computer will calculate a challenge string
based upon 
the public key. The calculated challenges are always
unique. The user 
will &quot;open&quot; the SNK using the PIN and enter
the challenge 
number. The SNK will use the challenge number and public
key to calculate 
a response string. The computer also uses the challenge
number and 
public key to calculate its expected response. If the
response that 
the user enters to the challenge string matches the
response calculated 
by the computer, the computer allows access. <P>
