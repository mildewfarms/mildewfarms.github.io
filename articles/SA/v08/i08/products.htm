<B>FairCom Releases Database Server</b><p>FairCom Corp. has released its FairCom database server, which has security-file encryption. Files encrypted with FairCom Server's encryption algorithm can be decrypted only by the FairCom Server. This feature prevents stand alone applications from gaining access to sensitive data.<p>
The server includes mirrored-file features, including re-acquisition of a lost, mirrored start file. Mirrored files are copied automatically during a rebuild with automatic recovery and dynamic dump restore. Thus, even if a mirrored copy fails, the rebuild will continue. The servers also offer a conditional index-support feature that allows indexes to be defined at the data-content level, rather than at just the field level. Dynamic index (select/omit) filtering can be performed on c-tree Plus index files by using an expression parser/analyzer. This provides smaller, faster indexes that meet developers' specific data-content-level needs.<p>
This version of the FairCom Server includes new support for FreeBSD, IRIX, and UnixWare. The FairCom Server retails from $445 to $6,795, depending on the number of users. It is licensed on a per-server basis.
