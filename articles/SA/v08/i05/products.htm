</I><B>Coyote Point Releases Envoy in Conjunction with Equalizer 3.0</B><p>
Coyote Point Systems has simultaneously released Equalizer 3.0, an upgrade of its load balancing appliance, and Envoy, a software add-on that enables Equalizer to direct online traffic across multiple server clusters located anywhere in the world.<p>
Envoy groups servers at remote locations into a "geographical cluster" under a single site name. An Envoy-enabled Equalizer routes incoming traffic among the widely distributed servers using multiple criteria, including network topology, to determine which server is best equipped to take the next hit.<p>
Equalizer 3.0 incorporates the following features: higher capacity, enhanced manageability, and more efficient load balancing. Equalizer's browser-based interface now provides more fine-grained data in an at-a-glance format. Users can drill down to event data for a time period as small as two minutes, allowing for fine-grained trend analysis and pre-emptive troubleshooting.<p>
Envoy-enabled Equalizer 250, priced at $3995, balances up to 64 virtual clusters of eight servers each, handles up to 64,000 simultaneous active connections, and is targeted at sites with T1 bandwidth. Equalizer 350, priced at $9995, balances an unlimited number of 16-server virtual clusters, handles up to 2 million simultaneous active connections, and is targeted at sites with T3 bandwidth. Equalizer 450, priced at $14,995, balances an unlimited number of 64-server clusters at up to 100 Mb/s, and handles up to 4 million simultaneous active connections.<p>

</I><B>Overland Announces Web-TLC Software Technology</B><p>
Overland Data, Inc. has announced a new software technology that enables remote operation and management of its automated tape libraries and autochangers from anywhere in the world via a standard Web browser. This new technology, called Web-TLC (total library control), will be available in a thin Web server also developed by Overland.<p>
Web-TLC's technology is platform independent and allows a central administrator to remotely configure, monitor, and control Overland's LibraryXpress and Loader Xpress DLTtape-based automated storage solutions. Web-TLC supports real-time alerts with TapeAlert-compatible backup software and SNMP-compliant network management consoles. It also allows remote operators to configure, control, and diagnose the libraries instead of just supporting activity and receiving error notifications. If an error message is received, the administrator can access the library through the Web-TLC to review activity and check error logs to track down the problem. Additionally, the administrator can remotely issue commands, such as cleaning the heads of DLT tape drive, or contact the on-site operator to make repairs.<p>
Web-TLC operates with all the leading Web browsers and does not utilize the host server connected to the tape library; thus, it is compatible with a variety of UNIX and Windows NT platforms. For more information, contact <I>Overland Data, 8975 Balboa Ave., San Diego, CA 92123-1599; (619) 571-5555; Fax: (619) 571-0982; WWW: http://www.overlanddata.com.<p>
