</I><B>UniTrends Announces PC ParaChute</B><p>
UniTrends Software Corporation has released PC ParaChute, a complete crash recovery product for Intel-based PCs. PC ParaChute backup up every PC on the network to the central server through a TCP/IP connection. Backups are performed manually or as part of an automated schedule. When a PC crashes and after the hardware is repaired, the administrator boots the machine from a generated bootable disk, which then connects to the server and restores all data. Once restored, the machine is rebooted and runs Windows as before.<p>
PC ParaChute saves administrators time spent re-installing Windows and its patches, upgrades, and configuration considerations. The centralized backup management and control of each PC allows the company to have customized PCs that are easily recoverable. Because PC Parachute backups are performed from a bootable floppy that is generated on the fly, there are no open files, no locked files, and all registry entries are fully backed up. Information inside and outside of the filesystem is also backed up, including the partition table.<p>
PC ParaChute offers such technology as Bit-Level-Verification of the backup, software compression (reduces network traffic), DynaScan backup verification weeks to months later, and a free space optimizer. The product requires Backup Professional, and the PC must be connected through a TCP/IP connection. The PC must also contain a 1.44 floppy disk. PC Parachute is priced at $35 per PC.<p>
For more information, contact <I>UniTrends Software Corporation, 1601 Oak St., #201, Myrtle Beach, SC 29577; (800) 648-648-2827 or (843) 626-2878; Fax: (843-626-5202; WWW: http://www.unitrends.com.<p>
