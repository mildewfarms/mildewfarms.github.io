<B>EIS Computers Rolls Out Linux for UltraSPARC</b><p>EIS Computers, an original equipment manufacturer of Solaris-centric UltraSPARC and Pentium II hardware and software products, has announced their rollout of Linux for UltraSPARC platforms. The UltraSPARC version of Linux is a 64-bit operating system that includes symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support. UltraLinux also supports the PCI expansion bus found on EIS Fusion series of UltraSPARC-PCI computers. The fusion series of UltraSPARC computers is built on Sun Microsystems' line of PCI-based motherboards, and the UltraSPARC Iis and Iii processors.<p>
EIS pre-installs UltraLinux on all three Fusion platforms, including the new Quad processor Fusion-MX. In addition to the Linux kernel, EIS pre-installs a suite of applications including development tools from GNU, Internet tools such as DNS and Apache Web server, the Xfree86 Web server, and others.<p>
Based on growing user demand for UltraSPARC, EIS has made a strategic decision to support Linux across its entire Fusion line. To date, there have been more then one million UltraSPARC CPUs shipped by Sun. Previously, SPARC Linux had only been supported on microSPARC and SuperSPARC CPU platforms.<p>
According to EIS Computers, the next release, UltraLinux 1.1, is expected to be bundled on CD-ROM and supported by Red Hat. EIS offers the same level of customization for the Fusion-Linux platforms as offered for the Fusion series of UltraSPARC computers running Solaris.<p>

</I><B>ARCO Introduces DupliDisk-Direct</b><p>ARCO Computer Products, Inc. has introduced DupliDisk-Direct, a realtime backup device designed for PC users who want the security of duplicate hard drives but not the cost of a SCSI RAID system. DupliDisk-Direct is a RAID 1 device capable of mirroring two pairs of IDE, E-IDE, or U/DMA drives of any capacity. If a hardware failure disables the mirrored drives, the DupliDisk automatically shifts operation to the functioning drive. LEDs on the unit's external panel change color to indicate a failed drive, and an audible alarm alerts the users of the drive failure without service interruption. Users have the option of either a bay-mounted or rear-mounted external panel for the visual display.<p>
DupliDisk-Direct includes ARCO's intermediate controller technology, which provides continuous automatic hard disk backup and disk fault tolerance. Once plugged into an onboard IDE controller and attached to the primary and mirror drives with cables provided by ARCO, the DupliDisk operates transparently. All data sent from the PC to the primary drive is automatically duplicated to the mirroring drive.<p>
DupliDisk-Direct plugs directly into one of the computers' onboard IDE controllers, and does not require a PCI or ISA bus slot. Also DupliDisk-Direct uses no jumper settings and requires no drivers or TSRs. DupliDisk-Direct is operating system independent and has been tested with systems running UNIX, Linux, Solaris 386, BSDI, NetWare, Windows 3.x, 95/98, NT, and OS/2.<p>
DupliDisk-Direct is priced at $250. For more information, contact <I>ARCO Computer Products, Inc., 2750 N. 29th Ave., Hollywood, FL 33020, (954) 925-2688; Fax: (954) 925-2889; Internet: arco@arcoide.com; WWW: http://www.arcoide.com.<p>
</I><B>UniPress Upgrades FootPrints</b><p>UniPress Software Inc. has upgraded FootPrints, its Web-based helpdesk. FootPrints uses the Internet to track problems and solutions and makes that information available to users over the Internet or intranet. FootPrints version 2.2 features automatic problem escalation. Designated problem tickets automatically "escalate" in importance if they are not handled in a pre-determined amount of time. Escalation results in email or beeper pages being sent to the administrator as the priority of the ticket is raised. Additionally, escalated tickets are displayed in color on the screen. Also FootPrints 2.2 includes an enhanced email interface. With this facility, FootPrints Helpdesk is available to users who are either Web-enabled or email-enabled. FootPrints can be used as an email-based helpdesk tool even if the users do not have Web access.<p>
In both the UNIX and NT versions, FootPrints 2.2 looks for incoming FootPrints email and determines whether the email is creating a new entry or updating an existing entry. Also FootPrints 2.2 includes features that automatically send outgoing email. FootPrint 2.2 also includes a Web forms-based Data Import facility, which lets existing data be imported into FootPrints projects.<p>
FootPrints 2.2 runs on a Web server and supports UNIX-based Web server, Windows NT Server, Windows NT workstation and all Web browsers. ODBC versions are also available for NT. The FootPrints Starter Pack (including 3 licenses) is priced at $1,995. Additional individual or group licenses are priced at $495. Free evaluation copies are available at http://www.unipress.com/footprints. For more information, contact <I>UniPress Software, Inc., 2025 Lincoln Hwy., Edison, NJ 08817; (800) 222-0550 or (732) 287-2100; Fax: (732) 287-4929; Internet: info@unipress.com; WWW: http://www.unipress.com.<p>
</I><B>SCO and Intel Team to Encourage Intel-based UNIX Systems</b><p>SCO announced its support of Intel Corporation's adoption of the Uniform Driver Interface (UDI) as a standard device interface. Additionally, Intel will work with SCO and Project UDI to port UDI to the Linux operating system and distribute as freeware.<p>
UDI allows device drivers to be portable across both hardware platforms and operating systems without any changes to the driver source. This significantly lowers the cost of driver development, speeds time-to-market of new devices, and allows manufacturers to allocate development resources on improving device performance, features, and functionality. SCO held the first public demonstration of this technology at SCO Forum98, running the same driver under the SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare 2, UnixWare 7, and the Hewlett-Packard HP-UX operating systems.<p>
UDI is a specification backed by multiple UNIX system providers, including Compaq, HP, IBM, NCR, SCO, and Sun Microsystems, as well as companies such as Adaptec, Interphase Corporation, and Lockheed Martin. A multi-company, joint development effort has produced a UDI prototype with working implementations on seven different operating systems.<p>
"Accelerating the deployment of UNIX on Intel-based servers is an important element in the growth of the standard high volume server model and in bringing price/performance advantages to the reliable, available and scalable benefits of UNIX," said John Miner, Intel vice president and general manager, Enterprise Systems Group.<p>
UDI isolates drivers from operating system policies, as well as platform and I/O bus dependencies. This allows driver development to be totally independent of OS development. The UDI architecture also insulates drivers from platform specifics such as byte-ordering, DMA implications, multi-processing, interrupt implementations, and I/O bus topologies. More information on Project UDI is available at <B>http://www.sco.com/UDI</B>.
