CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer Description ("PPD")-based printing options to support applications under UNIX.<P>
CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript (currently based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that can be used to support non-PostScript printers. For additional information on CUPS, see: <I>http://www.cups.org/overview.html</I>.<P>
<B>bCandid Announces Content Neutral Spam Filter Tool</B><P>
bCandid Corporation has announced a content neutral filtering tool to help ISPs control mass postings to discussion newsgroups. The posting filter is being introduced as an enhancement to bCandid's Typhoon NewsReader software.<P>
Typhoon's posting filer is applied before mass postings are distributed by their originating ISP. This is a content neutral approach that recognizes that spammers are attempting to send as many postings as possible in the least amount of time. The configurable posting filter built into Typhoon allows the originating ISP to limit the number of postings an individual can send during a specific time period. Upon passing the threshold, the filter dramatically slows the rate at which the individual's postings are accepted.<P>
For more information, contact: <I>bCandid Corporation, 5744 Central Avenue, Suite 100, Boulder, CO, 80301; (303) 545-5550; Fax: (303) 545-5551; WWW: http://www.bcandid.com</I>.<P>
