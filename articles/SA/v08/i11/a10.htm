<P>Jim McKinstry
<P>
</I><img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Who is Jim McKinstry?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I was born and raised in Poughkeepsie, NY. I graduated from Spackenkill High School in 1984 and from SUNY Potsdam in 1988 with a double major in Math and Computer Science. I worked four years at IBM as a micro-code developer for the 3174 Token Ring gateway product and then spent two years in an IBM Open Systems Lab. This is where I started learning UNIX (all kinds of neat toys). I spent two years at Rite Aid as the UNIX admin (Sun OS 4.1.3, HP-UX 9.x and 10.x, and AIX 3.2.5), then a year and a half at EDS as an admin of NCR UNIX. I am now a UNIX consultant for Sprint Paranet, somewhat well versed in Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, SCO, Linux, and other BSD and svr4 UNIXes. I also moderate the Q&amp;A Web site for this magazine, and I have written four articles with <I>Sys Admin</I>. I'm married, and my wife and I have a nine-month-old girl, a dog, and a cat. Now, on to the real questions.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I have an UltraSparc clone (Axil machine) with Solaris 2.5.1 installed. This machine doesn't boot from CD-ROM. I've set the CD-ROM's SCSI ID to six and still the <B>boot CD-ROM</B> command says "Rebooting with command CD-ROM" and just hangs until I hit <B>L1-A</B>. Any suggestions?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I know that on SPARC systems, from the "ok" prompt you can type <B>devalias</B> and check if "cdrom" is defined. If not, find the full device name of the CD-ROM by doing a <B>ls -l</B> on the CD-ROMs device (something like <B>ls -l /dev/dsk/c0t6d0s0</B>). You will get something like:<P>
<PRE>
/sbus@two,0/SUNW,soc@d,10000/SUNW,pln@b0000000,901f38/ssd@6,0:a.
</PRE>
<P>
Use this to define "cdrom" from the "ok" prompt by typing: <B>nvalias cdrom</B><P>
<PRE>
/sbus@two,0/SUNW,soc@d,10000/SUNW,pln@b0000000,901f38/ssd@6,0:a
</PRE>
<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> How do I know if my UNIX server needs to be upgraded? How can I check the CPU utilization, network, etc.?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> There is no one answer as to when a UNIX server needs to be upgraded. If the system is over-taxed or nearing its capacity, you should consider upgrading. Buy a copy of <I>System Performance Tuning</I> by Mike Loukides and read it. It will be worth the time and money (especially if you are new to this). Check out the <B>sar</B> command (should be on all UNIX systems), <B>vmstat </B>(on some UNIX), <B>iostat</B> (on some UNIX), <B>glance</B> (if you have it), <B>netstat </B>(should be on all UNIX), <B>top</B>, etc.. Look at the man pages for these commands for all the flags. Also look at the "See also" section of these man pages to find more tools to use.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> When using Solaris 2.6 <B>ufsdump</B>, how can I redirect the text output from the <B>dump</B> command to a file? It seems that just redirecting the stdio doesn't work anymore ( i.e., &gt; or &gt;&gt; ).<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Using <B>sh</B> or <B>ksh</B> try:<P>
<PRE>
ufsdump (ufsdump stuff here) &gt; /tmp/output.file two&gt;&amp;1
</PRE>
<P>
This says "send all standard output to <B>/tmp/output.file </B>and send all standard error to standard output". You can save standard error and standard output in different files by doing:<P>
<PRE>
ufsdump (ufsdump stuff here)  1&gt; /tmp/output.file \<BR>
  two&gt;/tmp/outputtwo.file
</PRE>
<P>
For <B>csh</B> use:<P>
<PRE>
ufsdump (ufsdump stuff here) &gt;&amp; /dev/null
</PRE>
<P>
This does (from <B>man csh</B>) "The &amp; forms redirect both standard output and the standard error (diagnostic output) to the file".<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I've inherited a large software source code that has a number of Makefiles spread out in a number of directories. All the Makefiles need to be modified the same way by changing one directory address to another. Let's say I collect all the directory paths for these Makefiles with <B>find</B> into a single text file, such as <B>all_paths</B>. How do I write a script to read one filename at a time from this listing and carry out the necessary changes, such as changing <B>old/directory</B> in all the makefiles to <B>new/directory</B>?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Let's assume that you have the list of files in <B>/tmp/file.list</B>. Here's a simple script that will do what you want:<P>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
</PRE>
<P>
for FILE in <B>cat /tmp/file.list</B>, do:<P>
<PRE>
sed 's/\/old\/directory/\/new\/directory/g' \
  &lt; $FILE &gt; /tmp/temp.file mv /tmp/temp.file $FILE
</PRE>
<P>
This loops through the list of files in <B>/tmp/file.list</B>. For each file, it executes the <B>sed</B> command. The <B>sed</B> command does a <B>s/regular expression/replacement/flags</B>. From <B>man sed</B>: "Substitute the replacement string for instances of the regular expression in the pattern space. Any character other than backslash or newline can be used instead of a slash to delimit the [regular expression] and the replacement. Within the [regular expression] and the replacement, the [regular expression] delimiter itself can be used as a literal character if it is preceded by a backslash." In this case, we are searching for <B>/old/directory</B> and replacing it with <B>/new/directory</B>. Note: In order for the <B>/</B> in <B>/old/directory</B> and <B>/new/directory </B>to be treated as a literal and not the regular expression delimiter, all occurances of <B>/ </B>must be preceded by <B>\</B>. That is why <B>/old/directory</B> looks like <B>\/old\/directory </B>and <B>/new/directory </B>looks like <B>\/new\/directory</B>. The flag in this example is <B>g</B>. <B>g</B> means (again, from the man pages) "Global. Substitute for all nonoverlapping instances of the regular expression rather than just the first one." As always, <B>sed</B> syntax is clear as mud to understand!<P>
For more on <B>sed</B>, get the <I>Sed &amp; Awk</I> book by Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins from O'Reilly and Associates. (<B>http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/sedtwo/</B>).<P>
Please test before using.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I am trying to send the <B>ftp</B> command <B>cr</B> to the <B>ftp</B> program in a shell script. I need to transfer files and have <B>ftp</B> add the windows line feeds as they do it. Is there any way to get this command into <B>ftp</B>? Or is there an <B>.ftprc</B>-like file that I can configure for a specific account?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> To script it, try:<P>
<PRE>
ftp -n -v 10.10.10.two  &gt;&gt; LOG_FILE &lt;&lt;  EOL
user ftpid   ftppass
bin
cr
put /tmp/crap
quit
EOL
</PRE>
<P>
Note that it is a very bad practice to have a password in a readable file.  You can also check out what a <B>.netrc</B> file is (<B>man netrc</B>). It is the <B>.ftprc-like </B>file you asked about.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I need to write a small script that I can put into cron to automatically kill some processes on a nightly basis at a certain time. How can I do this and what type of scripting should I use?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Here's a quick/crude Bourne shell script that should do what you want (please test before using it!). I always use Bourne because it's very portable across UNIX flavors. (I'll call the script <B>/usr/local/scripts/killit.sh</B>.):<P>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
# This script will find the process ID of the process passed in $1 
# and do a kill -9 on it.  It assumes that there will be only one 
# instance of the process running.

PID='ps -ef | grep $1 | awk '{ print $two }''

kill -9 $PID

exit
# END OF SCRIPT
</PRE>
<P>
Now, let's add it to cron (assume that the process we are killing is <B>dog_food</B>) to run nightly at midnight:<P>
<PRE>
crontab -e
</PRE>
<P>
Add the following line:<P>
<PRE>
00 00 * * * /usr/local/scripts/killit.sh dog_food
</PRE>
<P>
That should do it!<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I would like to make a Web-based system that allows the capability to add and remove users. Is there a safe and secure way of doing this? Because you need to be root to execute this command, should I just use a simple shell script to execute from a php3 script, or is there something better?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Check out Webmin (<B>http://www.webmin.com</B>). This can be built with SSL enabled to make it more secure. Webmin is very flexible and customizable (and free). I installed it and tested it in an afternoon with no problems.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I have a customer that wants to learn how to become a Linux- certified sys admin. Any ideas?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Go to:<P>

</PRE>
<P>
I can't state it any better than that! <P>
