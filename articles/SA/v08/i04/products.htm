<B>Fastlane Unveils Xni Network Analyzer for SunOS/Solaris</b><p>Fastlane Software Systems, Inc. has announced the release of its Xni network analysis, security, and accounting package on the SunOS and Solaris 2.x platforms. Xni is a comprehensive, software-only solution that monitors network traffic in real-time. Xni provides a graphical view of network usage and traffic flow without the need for SNMP/ARMON tools or dedicated hardware.<p>
First released in an IRIX version for SGI environments, Xni installs on any client workstation. Xni records network traffic information on a continuous basis. Administrators can easily identify high-bandwidth users, pinpoint causes of network slowdowns, spot network intruders, and collect data needed for chargebacks. A compact data format supports 24x7 reporting. Xni provides a conversation-based technology that records each protocol interaction between computers. Each record contains a number of fields characterizing the conversation, rather than recording details of packets exchanged. According to Fastlane, typical corporate networks using Xni can record eight months of 24-hour-a-day data on a 2Gb drive.<p>
Xni uses DNS/Yellow Pages to monitor DNS/BIND entries for all hosts and reports on devices without DNS entries or which result in timeouts. Applications can be tracked individually or as groups. Monitoring and alarms can be as fine grained as a second. Graphs, charts, and lists are used to represent the network status. Real-time data can be viewed locally or from a remote machine running an X Window Server. A Java interface is currently under development. Xni operates passively, enhancing its utility for capturing evidence of malicious attacks. Xni's ability to gather data on network activity (such as Web usage, email, and file transfers) can support network accounting based on data assembled into reports.<p>
Xni is available for SunOS and Solaris 2.x as well as IRIX 2.0. Versions for HP-UX 9.x/10.x, Linux 2.x, AIX, OSF/1, and FreeBSD are under development. System requirements include 64Mb Ram and 10Mb disk space. Xni functions passively (unless configured to resolve domain names), creating minimal demands on the system or network. Xni works with a variety of IP interfaces, including 10/100baseT, FDDI, and FORE ATM cards. For more information, contact <I>Fastlane Software Systems, Inc., 1028 West Maude, Suite 401, Sunnyvale, CA. 94086; (408) 733-1483; Fax: (408) 733-1481; WWW: http://www.inetd.com.<p>
</I><B>SuSE Announces Corporate Support and Training Program for Linux</B></b><p>SuSE, Inc. has announced the SuSE Linux Corporate Support Program, scheduled to begin in North America in early 1999. SuSE has offered support and service contracts in Europe since 1995, and is bringing its corporate support program to North America. SuSE will offer a two-tiered support program: SuSE Linux Premium Support, SuSE's in-house corporate tech support program; and SuSE Linux Partner Support through third-party organizations. SuSE is working with a number of Linux support organizations, including LinuxCare, based in San Francisco, California.<p>
SuSE will also offer corporate training programs on Linux through Muster Learning Architects (MLA) in Berkeley, California. MLA is headed by John Muster, the author of <I>UNIX Made Easy</I>, who has taught UNIX courses since 1980.<p>
For more information, contact <I>SuSE Inc., 458 Santa Clara Avenue, Oakland, CA 94610; (888) 875-4689; Internet: info@suse.com; WWW: http://www.suse.com.<p>
</I><B>Trend Micro Announces Approach to Java and ActiveX Security</B></b><p>Trend Micro, Inc. has announced a product addressing security concerns such as malicious Java applets, JavaScript, and ActiveX objects. According to the company, the product stops such risks at the Internet Gateway, while solving management and administration issues associated with such security. Trend Micro's InterScan AppletTrap allows network administrators to centrally manage Java, ActiveX, and JavaScript code security from a Web proxy server with policy-based software. AppletTrap provides real-time behavior analysis of Java applets and includes updating, which recognizes new threats and automatically adds them to a "block" list of undersirable applets.<p>
Trend Micro's approach allows AppletTrap to be installed at the Web proxy server level, but for analysis of applets to occur at the desktop, minimizing server performance degradation. While a Java applet is at the server, AppletTrap attaches code to each applet that instructs the client computer of behavior restrictions for the applet. The applets are "wrapped" to prevent malicious code from doing damage. If malicious behavior is attempted, the "wrapped" applet is shut down, protecting the desktop. No software is installed on the desktop. All policy instructions are managed from the sever.<p>
The product provides localized installation and administration while distributing the processing demands to provide real-time behavior analysis with minimal performance cost for the server.<p>
AppletTrap provides three levels of security: Certificate Validation, filtering applets and objects by identifying the sender as a trusted partner or by the certifying organization, such as VeriSign; Known Malicious Code Filter, similar to traditional virus checking methods, with regular updates for its malicious code list from Trend Micro's Web site; and Unknown Applet Filter, constraining applet behavior based on pre-written or custom policies. The Unknown Applet Filter shuts down an applet breaking the policy and adds patterns identifying the applet to the list of blocked applets. AppletTrap can be configured to forward information about policy-breaking applets to Trend Micro for analysis and possible inclusion in the known malicious applets list.<p>
InterScan AppletTrap pricing starts at $600 for a 25-user license. Version 1.0 of AppletTrap is designed for Windows NT 4.0 and requires a Java-enabled browser. For more information, contact <I>Trend Micro, Inc., 10101 N. DeAnza Blvd. Suite 400, Cupertino, CA 95014; (408) 257-1500 or (800) 228-5651, Fax: (408) 257-2003; WWW: http://www.antivirus.com.<p>
</I><B>Progressive Systems Announces Phoenix Adaptive Firewall for Linux</B></b><p>Progressive Systems, Inc. has announced the Phoenix Adaptive Firewall software for the Linux Operating System. The Phoenix Adaptive Firewall provides a granular level of security, protecting networks by performing an inspection of incoming packets and distributing them according to administrator-determined rules. Inbound data with unacceptable contents is not transmitted on to the protected network. This provides a fine-grained security, compared to the majority of firewalls. Users can control access to their networks to a very precise degree. The technology also includes anti-attach features, disabling network probing attacks used by crackers.<p>
The Phoenix Adaptive Firewall also provides Secure Remote Administration via a Java GUI. This interface provides strong authentication and encryption to the firewall server from a Web browser.<p>
The Phoenix Adaptive Firewall is available for Linux, SCO Open Server, and as a network appliance. Pricing is $2995 and $3495, for the software or the appliance, respectively, for unlimited users. For more information, contact <I>Progressive Systems, Inc., 2000 West Henderson Rd. Suite 400, Columbus, OH 43220; (800)558-7827; Internet: info@progressive-systems.com; WWW: http://www.progressive-systems.com.<p>
</I><B>J. River Releases ICE.PPN for Windows to UNIX Portable Private Networking</B></b><p>J. River, Inc. has released ICE.PPN for use by desktop users on a LAN, remote offices, or "road warriors" who need secure access to UNIX corporate servers. Unlike a VPN, ICE.PPN can secure data inside the LAN and from end to end (from the client to the individual server, not just to the firewall). It can secure the connection regardless of whether a firewall is in place.<p>
ICE.PPN uses SSL with DSS certificates to authenticate the server, Diffie-Helman key exchange to prevent "man-in-the-middle" attacks, and 3DES (with DES optional) to encrypt the data. <B>telnet</B> and <B>ftp</B> sessions (including logins and passwrds) are fully encrypted so that they cannot be viewed through use of a sniffer. Initially, ICE.PPN will support Solaris, Linux, AIX, SCO UNIX, and UnixWare servers; and Windows 95, Windows98, and Windows NT clients. Support for additional UNIX servers and Windows NT servers is planned.<p>
A full-featured 30-day trialware version of ICE.PPN can be downloaded from J. River's Web site. Suggested list price for a server license with five clients is $480. Reseller pricing is available. For more information, contact <I>J. River, Inc., 125 North First Street, Minneapolis, MN; (612) 677-8200; Internet: info@jriver.com; WWW: http://www.jriver.com.<p>
</I><B>Lares Technology Announces iNETanywhere Bridge</B></b><p>Lares Technology, Inc. has announced the iNETanywhere Bridge. This plug-in interface enables remote iButtons, or other 1-Wire data collectors, to communicate with a network computer via a standard TCP/IP Ethernet network. Applications include network-based temperature monitoring, access control, time, attendance, guard tour, and facility maintenance.<p>
iNETanywhere makes adding devices to a network comparable to adding an answering machine to a phone. There are two cables, a power cord, and a phone plug. Some low-power devices don't require a separate power cord. The bridge is small, 3 x 3 x 1, but packs a micro-controller, 32Kb code and data space, two iButton 1-wire interfaces, an RS232 serial interface, and an 10BaseT Ethernet interface.<p>
An example of application devices is the iNETmonitor temperature system. A temperature probe and client-server application software provide temperature monitoring, logging, notification, and alarms. The probes connect to the bridge via twisted-pair wire and RJ-11 jacks. The software is Java-based and can run under UNIX (Linux or Sun Solaris), MacOS, or Windows 98/NT.<p>
For more information, contact <I>Lares Technology; 1505 E. Houston Street, San Antonio, Texas 78202; (210) 354-4658; Fax:(210) 354-4075; Internet: info@lares.com; WWW: http://www.lares.com.<p>
</I><B>Raritan Announces Cat5 Reach - Extending Computer Access</B></b><p>Raritan Computer, Inc. has announced its Cat5 Reach - a transmitter and receiver pair that provides long-distance keyboard, monitor, and mouse access to standalone Suns, Macs, or PCs or to multiple computers using Raritan's KVM switch products. With Cat5 Reach, keyboard, video, and mouse (KVM) signals are transmitted over a single, standard Cat5 UTP cable up to distances of 650 feet. Computers can be accessed via the standard Cat5 cabling over longer distances, rather than requiring proprietary or coaxial cabling.<p>
In addition to the remote access to single or multiple computers, Cat5 Reach provides ports of local connection so the same input devices and monitor can be used for both local and remote machines. Cat5 Reach supports all Raritan's KVM switches, including the new Master Console II and MX - a matrix KVM switch that enables up to four simultaneous users to control up to 256 computers (Sun, Dec Alpha, RS/6000, HP9000, Silicon Graphics, Mac, or PC), each from a single keyboard, monitor, and mouse.<p>
Raritan's plans called for Cat5 Reach to begin shipping in December 1998, with a suggested retail price of $545. Cat5 Reach will support high-resolution video and is recommended for use at 1280x1024 resolution to distances up to 325 feet and at 1024x768 resolution up to 650 feet. It can work with any UTP Category 5 cable, but Raritan cautions its customers that cable quality can vary.<p>
