<B>Xi Graphics Packages Accelerated-X, Motif for Linux</B><P>
Xi Graphics, Inc., has announced their maXimum cde for Linux. The graphical user interface is already an industry standard for UNIX workstations offered by IBM, HP, Digital, Sun, and others. The fully integrated package includes Motif and CDE built on the Accelerated-X Display Server and running on the Linux operating system.<P>
The common desktop look for Linux comes from the Common Desktop Environment, or CDE, a commercial, proprietary GUI developed, maintained, and licensed by a consortium of companies called the OpenGroup (<B>www.opengroup.org</B>). These companies, including Hewlett Packard, IBM, Microsoft, Sun, and Digital, pooled their technologies to develop the Motif window manager, which contains most of the elements of the CDE graphical user interface. Together, Motif and CDE represent the target for applications developers.<P>
Other maXimum cde for Linux features include: fully integrated utilities -- Netscape, Acrobat, Postscript viewer, image viewer; autodetection of graphics hardware at install; English, German, French, and Italian language desktop support; graphical session and login manager; and overlay support on capable hardware.<P>
maXimum cde for Linux Executive Edition is available for $199.95 within the U.S.; the Developer's Edition is $349.95. Laptop versions and international pricing are slightly higher. Quantity discounts are available. Linux can be included at no extra charge. maXimum cde works on Red Hat, Debian, Caldera, SuSE, Delix, and Slackware Linux. Xi Graphics offers free, unlimited support for maXimum CDE. Linux OS technical support is sold in "ServicePacs." For more information, contact: <I>Xi Graphics Inc., 1801 Broadway, Suite 1710, Denver, CO, 80202; (800) 946-7433; WWW: http://www.xig.com.</I><P>
<B>Data Commander 2.3 Adds XML Support</B><P>
Blackstone &amp; Cullen, Inc. (BAC) have announced the addition of legacy-to-XML file conversion to their Data Commander 2.3 data management tool. Data Commander 2.3 is an automated data testing utility which handles data aging, analysis, comparison, and conversion for Y2K compliance, euro conversion, and data migration projects moving non-relational legacy data to relational forms. By adding support for XML 1.0, it provides a mechanism for moving legacy archives to the emerging XML format.<P>
According to the company, seventy percent of corporate data worldwide still resides in legacy archives and has evolved into thousands of proprietary formats over the years. Recent Y2K survival shortcuts like date windowing, scaling, and split-dates have only compounded the problem. Data Commander 2.3 can be used to cleanse the data of glitches and proprietary formatting, after digging it out of complex structures. Afterwards, the data can be fed into a "pipeline", converted into XML, or used as "data island."<P>
Data Commander supports over 220 date formats and will handle data processed by mainframe and midrange systems, as well as UNIX-based servers. Supported platforms include IBM MVS, VSE, VM, OS/390, and AS/400, and Data Commander will run on any system with a resident COBOL compiler. For more information, contact: <I>Blackstone and Cullen, 2000 RiverEdge Parkway, Suite 750, Atlanta, GA, 30328; (770) 612-1550; FAX: (770) 612-1471; WWW: http://www.bac-atl.com.</I><P>
<B>Winternals Software Releases Remote Recover for Windows NT</B><P>
Winternals Software LLC has released Remote Recover, a product providing systems administrators a way to repair NTFS-based systems through an NT enterprise. With Remote Recover, administrators gain access to NTFS and FAT drives across a network, enabling them to easily configure, repair, or reinstall any disk connected to the network.<P>
Users boot a PC using a floppy disk and the drives, regardless of NTFS or FAT formatting, become accessible from a remote Windows NT system. Hard disk administration software that normally operates locally can be used over a network to maniuplate a system that doesn't have an OS installed. It can be used to restore systems from scratch or accessing files on completely unbootable systems.<P>
Remote Recover functions include: edit, copy, or delete files; copy files or entire partitions; repair damaged file systems with chkdsk; partition and format drives with NTFS or FAT; and restore entire disks from tape backup.<P>
For more information, contact: <I>Winternals Software LLC, 3101 Bee Caves Rd., Suite 150, Austin, TX, 78746; (800) 408-8415; WWW: http://www.winternals.com.</I><P>
<B>Zeh Graphics Systems Releases NetPlot</B><P>
Zeh Graphic Systems, Inc. (ZEH) has announced NetPlot, a complete turnkey plot managment system. NetPlot includes all applicable hardware and software. Users simply connect NetPlot directly to a plotter or to an existing network and can immediately plot CGM, Postscript, HPGL/2, and raster files.<P>
NetPlot users can submit jobs via the NetPlot User Tools Web page, from a UNIX lp queue, by using FTP, by "Drop-N-Plot" (wherein users can set up a print folder on their desktops and plot by moving the file to be printed into the folder), or from Windows applications via the File/Print feature. Users can track the status of their jobs by viewing the Queue Monitor. NetPlot processes large and complex files, offloading that task from the plotter and increasing throughput. NetPlot is application, file, and plotter independent, and is pre-configured to drive one plotter from a selection of different plotter manufacturers such as Hewlett Packard, Oc&eacute;, Versatec, Xerox, and others.<P>
Systems administrators have access to the basic NetPlot functions such as starting and stopping the system and scheduling tasks for NetPlot to run. NetPlot's server hardware specifications include a 300A MHz Celeron Processor, 64 Mb RAM, and a 4.2 Gb disk. For more information, contact: <I>Zeh Graphic Systems, Inc., 1155 Dairy Ashford, Suite 105, Houston, TX, 77057; (281) 589-7757; WWW: http://www.zeh.com.</I><P>
<B>Hitachi Data Systems Announces Hitachi Freedom Storage NanoCopy</B><P>
Hitachi Data Systems has announced Hitachi Freedom Storage NanoCopy and other data-movement solutions based on the Hitachi Asynchronous Remote Copy function for the Hitachi Freedom Storage 7700E. NanoCopy is a hardware-based solution allowing customers to make point-in-time copies without disrupting the application or end users. NanoCopy copies data between any number of primary subsystems and any number of secondary subsystems. The copies may be of any type or amount of data and may be recorded on subsystems anywhere. NanoCopy supports such services as application testing, business intelligence, and disaster recovery. For disaster recovery, NanoCopy will maintain a duplicate of critical data, so that production can proceed at a backup location after an outage.<P>
Hitachi Freedom Storage NanoCopy is based on Hitachi Asynchronous Remote Copy, which is capable of moving large amounts of data over any distance while maintaining data integrity with minimal impact on performance. Data duplication is done directly from primary subsystems to secondary subsystems without using server processor cycles.<P>
Asynchronous Remove Copy with Hitachi NanoCopy support will be offered as an extension to Hitachi Data Systems' data-movement options under its Copy, Availability, Resource, and Exchange (CARE) umbrella of software solutions for use with the Freedom Storage 7700E. Hitachi ShadowImage, currently available with the Copy suite of CARE, can operate in conjunction with Asynchronous Remote Copy to provide volume-level backup. Hitachi also announced that Remote Copy would support IBM's Geographically Dispersed Parallel SysplexR (GDPS). NanoCopy will be released starting in the fourth quarter of 1999, with initial support for S/390-compatible processors. Hitachi plans to extend NanoCopy to UNIX-based and Windows NT-based servers next year. For more information, contact: <I>Hitachi Data Systems, 750 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA, 95056; WWW: http://www.hds.com.</I><P>
