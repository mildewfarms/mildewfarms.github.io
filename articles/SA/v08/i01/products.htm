<H1>New Products</H1><P><B>Heroix Corporation Releases RoboMon NT V7.0</b><p>Heroix Corporation has released version 7.0 of RoboMon, their rule-based systems management software. RoboMon NT V7.0 includes several new enhancements for monitoring, problem detection, simplifying correction ,and improving robustness of applications, databases, servers, and networks across the enterprise.<p>
Heroix describes version 7.0 of RoboMon as "100% fault tolerant and able to scale efficiently from the single department to the global enterprise." A new user interface provides access from anywhere on the network.<p>
RoboMon NT V7.0 is driven by a rule-based engine, which allows users to adapt RoboMon to site-specific requirements. The system discovers and configures all the objects to be monitored, including new objects as they are added. The rule-based system provides greater flexibility than do scripting-based solutions, and RoboMon can deal with a wider variety of problems and unanticipated situations.<p>
RoboMon can be configured to diagnose a problem, correct a problem, try several alternative solutions to a problem, or notify the administrator. RoboMon NT V7.0 also integrates with help desks and framework packages from HP, Tivoli, and Computer Associates.<p>
Version 7.0 includes enhancements in the following areas: reporting and graphics, with automatic archival of key performance data for reports and graphs; solutions management, allowing users to modify rule settings on a global basis for built-in as well as user-defined rules; event server configuration, providing control over event routing through the network and guaranteeing event delivery with multiple event databases supporting automatic failover. Licensing and configuration managers simplify installation and configuration of RoboMon throughout the enterprise.<p>
RoboMon NT V7.0 is priced at $1,000 per unit for the first 10 units, $900 per unit for 11th through 50th unit and $800 per unit for orders totaling more than 50 units. For more information, contact <I>Heroix Corporation, (800) 229-6500; WWW: http://www.heroix.com.<p>
</I><B>SCO and Intel Team to Encourage Intel-based UNIX Systems</b><p>SCO announced its support of Intel Corporation's adoption of the Uniform Driver Interface (UDI) as a standard device interface. Additionally, Intel will work with SCO and Project UDI to port UDI to the Linux operating system and distribute it as freeware.<p>
UDI allows device drivers to be portable across both hardware platforms and operating systems without any changes to the driver source. This significantly lowers the cost of driver development, speeds time-to-market of new devices, and allows manufacturers to allocate development resources on improving device performance, features, and functionality. SCO held the first public demonstration of this technology at SCO Forum98, running the same driver under the SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare 2, UnixWare 7, and HP-UX operating systems.<p>
UDI is a specification backed by multiple UNIX system providers, including Compaq, HP, IBM, NCR, SCO, and Sun Microsystems, as well as companies such as Adaptec, Interphase Corporation, and Lockheed Martin. A multi-company, joint development effort has produced a UDI prototype with working implementations on seven different operating systems.<p>
UDI isolates drivers from operating system policies, as well as platform and I/O bus dependencies. This allows driver development to be totally independent of OS development. The UDI architecture also insulates drivers from platform specifics such as byte ordering, DMA implications, multi-processing, interrupt implementations, and I/O bus topologies. More information on Project UDI is available at <I>http://www.sco.com/UDI</I>.<p>
<B>AVS Releases Linux Version of Visualization Software</b><p>Advanced Visual Systems (AVS) has announced the release of AVS5.4 for PCs running the Linux operating system.

AVS5 has been applied in applications such as defense, telecommunications, medical imaging, energy exploration, and scientific research.<p>
AVS5.4 provides support for the Linux operating system distribution available from Red Hat Software using the standard GNU compilers. Red Hat Linux is a POSIX-based operating system allowing a PC to function as a UNIX workstation, providing an effective and reliable foundation for complex computing tasks, such as visualization applications developed with AVS 5.<p>
