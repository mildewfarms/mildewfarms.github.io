<H1>Use the 'Net to Secure Your Nete</H1><p>
<P>James W. Meritt
<P>
</I>As you have no doubt seen in the popular media, security throughout the 'Net is almost a lost cause. There are three obvious reasons for this: "Don't care", "Don't know", and "Don't have the resources" to secure the network even if you did care and did know. Reading this article somewhat belies the "don't care" part, and I hope to furnish information to help the "don't know". Since there is much you can do for little or no money, there may be some help here for the "don't have", too. The following sites are ones that I have found to be most informative and most stable (they have been there and up every time I've checked for years). There are many, many other security-related resources on the 'Net, but these should furnish a good start.<P>
<B>Official Sites</b><p>There is an assortment of official sites with a great deal of information on network security. Among them is the Computer Security Institute, which is the oldest international membership organization offering training specifically targeted to information security professionals at:<P>

<B>Plans, Policy, and Procedures</b><p>The organizational policies are necessary to provide a security architecture for all of a company's operations. The policies undergo normal review procedures, and then are approved by agency management for implementation. Planning network security -- what needs to be done and what documents and policies need to be established -- are described in:<P>
