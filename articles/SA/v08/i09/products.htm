<H1>New Products</H1><p>
</b><p><P>
<B>OpenBSD 2.5 is "Secure By Default"</b><p>The OpenBSD team announced the release of OpenBSD 2.5, which ships with a "secure by default" configuration. The configuration adopts the principle of "that which is not expressly enabled is disabled", providing a default security stance. OpenBSD is a free, open source, proactively secure, UNIX-like operating system designed to protect itself and its users against network-based attacks. OpenBSD runs on Intel and compatible PCs, SPARC, Alpha, and other workstation-class hardware.<P>
A typical OpenBSD installation can run in 30 minutes. The administrator selectively enables services and controls the configuration through a small set of configuration files. OpenBSD also integrates strong cryptography. The as-shipped configuration of the Apache WWW server includes SSL support (one extra file must be downloaded and the system rebooted). OpenBSD tracks the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocols and interoperates with other standard-compliant implementations.<P>
OpenBSD is based on the University of California Berkeley 4.4BSD-Lite operating system and is the product of volunteer programmers world-wide. It is distributed from Canada and can be downloaded free from the Internet or purchased on CD-ROM to raise funds for the project. Users communicate and support each other through mailing lists. Commercial installations and support are available from third parties. For more information, visit the project Web site at: <I>http://www.OpenBSD.org</I>.<P>
<B>Network Instruments Provides Analysis Tools for Switched Environments</b><p>Network Instruments, LLS has released Observer 6.1, a protocol analyzer, traffic manager, and troubleshooting tool for switched environments. Observer 6.1 uses a technology to bridge the gap between shared and switched networks. The Observer 6.1 Suite provides management options including: Observer Expert Extension, Observer Web Extension, Observer SNMP and RMON Extensions.<P>
Observer 6.1 uses the following three methods for switch management:<P>
<P>
&#149;  port-looping with statistical sampling technology, which lets the administrator see all ports on the switch (included in Observer and Distributed Observer)<P>
&#149;  RMON console functionality for switches with embedded RMON (requires the RMON Extension for Distributed Observer)<P>
&#149;  SNMP console monitoring for switches with embedded SNMP agents (requires the SNMP extension for Observer).<P>
<P>
Because Observer 6.1 can manage the ports on a switch, it is also possible to use packet capture for any port, or groups of ports without first configuring the switch ouside of the Observer environment.<P>
Observer 6.1 provides a new Internet Observer mode, which monitors Web site traffic and the duration of visits. For switches that include an SNMP agent in the switch hardware, Observer 6.1's SNMP Extensions allows users to query and view any SNMP data the switch collects, including traffic and device-specific information. Observer 6.1 also includes SNMP-based scripting to support a wider range of switch vendors (including 3Com and Nortel/Bay). The SNMP Extension also includes a Walker utility for troubleshooting SNMP-managed devices. Observer 6.1 also offers an internal RMON Extension to provide RMON1 or RMON2 statistics and capture functions within the hardware of the switch. The new release adds RMON triggers and alarms.<P>
For switches that support port mirroring, Observer 6.1 offers port-looping, the ability to have a Probe "loop" through all ports on the switch and collect statistics on the switch as a whole, or port capture. Port-looping provides a view of the switch, including information on individual port usage, total broadcast, cross-port jabber, and total data throughput. Observer provides modes for switched environments: Internet Observer, Trending, Packet Capture, Bandwidth Utilization, Utilization History, Top Talkers, Size Distribution Statistics, Errors-by-Station, Protocol Distribution, IPSubProtocols, IPXSubProtocols, Triggers and Alarms, and Discover Network Names.<P>
Observer is a 32-bit PC application for Windows 95/98/NT environments and supports multiple protocols over Ethernet, Token-Ring, and FDDI LANs. Observer 6.1 is priced at $995. The SNMP Extension is priced at $495, and the RMON Extension is $495. Distributed Observer is priced at $1,290, and Observer Suite is priced at $2,995.
