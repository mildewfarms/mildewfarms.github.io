<H1>New Products</H1><P>
<B>Trend Micro Introduces eManager</b><p>Trend Micro, Inc., has introduced eManager, a set of Internet email controls designed to protect intellectual property, enhance employee productivity, and improve network traffic flow. A key element of eManager is the "spam" filter, designed to prevent junk email from clogging a corporate network. eManager is being introduced in conjunction with InterScan VirusWall 3.x, Trend Micro's Internet gateway virus scanning software.<p>
In addition to providing products that block unwanted viruses, Trend Micro now offers a product that guards against unwanted content. The move to content filtering is an extension of Trend Micro's Internet gateway virus scanning technology. eManager scans email content for particular keywords, domains, and email addresses.<p>
eManager provides a rule-based spam filter, with self-updating lists of common spam sources and a customizable list of sources. The filter checks message headers (to, from, cc, and subject fields) for routing domain, inbound/outbound status, and message size, and checks the message body for designated keywords and phrases. eManager also provides a rule-based email manager that conserves network bandwidth by managing the delivery time of email with large attachments.<p>
Initially, eManager is being offered as an option with version 3.x of InterScan. InterScan VirusWall detects and blocks malicious code in SMTP, HTTP, and FTP traffice, preventing the inadvertent downloading of viruses. InterScan VirusWall can block all Java applets and ActiveX objects, malicious applets and objects, or can allow only applets and objects from trusted sources.<p>
InterScan VirusWall 3.x is available now and starts at $725 for a 25-seat user license. eManager, used in conjunction with InterScan, is available now and starts at $181.25 for a 25-seat user license. Purchased as a suite, the price is $816.25 for a 25-seat user license. For more information, contact <I>Trend Micro, Inc., 0101 N. DeAnza Blvd. Suite 400, Cupertino, CA 95014; (408) 257-1500 or (800) 228-5651; Fax: (408) 257-2003; WWW: http://www.antivirus.com.<p>
</I><B>O'Reilly Announces Open Source Conferences</b><p>O'Reilly &amp; Associates announced that it is expanding its support of Open Source software by presenting the O'Reilly Open Source Conferences - Perl Conference 3.0 plus several new technical conferences on mission critical Open Source software - on August 21-24, 1999 at the Monterey Convention Center in Monterey, CA.<p>
The O'Reilly conferences on Perl, Linux, FreeBSD, Apache, Sendmail, and other technologies permit attendees to move freely between conferences, attending sessions of interest. Each conference is preceded by tutorials.<p>
Open Source software has achieved dramatic gains in credibility and market share in the seven months since Tim O'Reilly, President and CEO of O'Reilly &amp; Associates, hosted the Open Source Summit that brought together the creators of Linux, Perl, Apache, Sendmail, Tcl, Python, and Netscape's mozilla. It was at this meeting that these leaders agreed to adopt Eric Raymond's term "Open Source" for the development methodology their products share, and to work together to promote the value and importance of the software developed by the Open Source community.<p>
Bob Young, CEO of Red Hat Software, said, "O'Reilly's Linux Conference is a welcome addition to the resources available to the growing Linux technical community. We're glad to see them bring their independent, authoritative approach to the conference arena."  <p>
