<B>XIOtech Releases Magnitude XL-2800</b><p>XIOtech Corporation has announced the latest implementation of its REDI Data architecture, the Magnitude XL-2800. According to the company, the Magnitude XL-2800 is a storage area network in a box that is significantly faster and less expensive than other solutions.<p>
The Magnitude XL-2800 is an advanced network storage system that is more than 15 percent faster than XIOtech's previous product offerings. The system integrates an upgradeable Fibre Channel switch, a high-performance intelligent RAID controller, and a sophisticated logical volume manager to deliver performance in excess of 100,000 IOPS - more than 10 times faster than traditional RAID designs.<p>
The performance of Magnitude XL-2800 is based on X1Otech's REDI (Real-Time Data Intelligence) storage architecture. REDI storage architecture accumulates the performance of many individual disk drives and shares the total performance with every attached server. REDI storage architecture uses Intelligent Virtual Disks (IVD) to map data across the total number of physical drives in a system, and Queue Management Technology (QMT) to optimize and manage large queues.<p>
By virtualizing the available disk capacity, the Magnitude XL-2800 allows administrators to add capacity and change the configuration of existing volumes without interrupting data access. All capacity requirements are managed through a single GUI, eliminating the need to re-cable or re-assign drives to logical units. The Magnitude XL-2800 is an upgradeable solution, allowing users to expand the base drive capacity of 288 GB to more than 1.6 TB in a single cabinet and double the Fibre Channel connectivity from four to eight ports.<p>
The XL-2800.is available at less than $0.29/MB, with configurations as low as $0.09/MB. For more information, contact <I>XIOtech Corporation, 6509 Flying Cloud Drive, Suite 200, Eden Prairie, MN 55344; (612) 828-5980; Fax: (612) 828-5990; WWW: http://www.xiotech.com.</I><p>

<B>Innosoft Enhances LDAP Proxy Server</b><p>Innosoft International, Inc. has announced enhancements to the Innosoft LDAP Proxy Server (ILPS) to provide automatic load balancing among multiple LDAP servers and transparent failover for high-availability directory services.<p>
Innosoft LDAP Proxy Server version 2.0 provides automatic server load balancing among a group of LDAP servers to provide system managers with the ability to distribute directory searches across two or more "mirror" servers. Additionally, the Proxy Server can detect the failure or removal of an LDAP server from a directory server group and transparently map searches to other servers in the group. When a server recovers, the Proxy Server will transparently reintegrate the recovered server into the directory server group.<p>
ILPS is currently deployed to deliver LDAP application level filtering. Features include control of the attributes that can be searched, the content that is returned, and limiting "aggressive" applications from trolling the directory.<p>
Innosoft Directory Service products are available for Windows NT on Intel and Alpha, Solaris 2.6 and Solaris 7 (SPARC and Intel), Digital UNIX 4.Ob on Alpha, AIX 4.3 on PowerPC, Red Hat Linux 5.1 on Intel, HP-UX, and OpenVMS for Alpha and VAX. Prices for the Innosoft LDAP Proxy Server are $4,800 for up to 15 concurrent connections and $12,000 for an unlimited number of connections. For more information, contact <I>Innosoft International, 1050 Lakes Drive, West Covina, CA 91790; (626) 919-3600; Fax: (626) 919-3614; WWW: http://www.innosoft.com.</I><p>
<B>Network Instruments Releases Observer 6.0</b><p>Network Instruments, LLC has announced the release of Observer 6.0, a robust, low-cost protocol analyzer and the first traffic management and troubleshooting tool for switched environments. The Observer 6.0 Suite offers administrators a complete set of management options with Observer Expert Extension, Observer Web Extension, and now Observer SNMP and RMON Extensions.<p>
Observer 6.0 uses the following three methods for switch management: 1) port-looping with statistical sampling technology, which lets the administrator see all ports on the switch; 2) RMON console functionality for switches with embedded RMON; and 3) SNMP console monitoring functionality for switches with embedded SNMP agents. Additionally, because Observer 6.0 can manage the ports on a switch, it is also possible to use packet capture for any port, or groups of ports without first configuring the switch outside of the Observer environment.<p>
For switches that include an SNMP agent in the switch hardware, Observer 6.0's SNMP Extension enables the user to query and view any or all SNMP data the switch collects, including traffic and device-specific information. Observer 6.0 also offers an internal RMON Extension to provide RMON I or RMON2 statistics and capture functions within the hardware of the switch.<p>
For switches that support port mirroring, Observer 6.0 offers port looping, or the ability to have a Probe "loop" through all ports on the switch and collect statistics on the switch as a whole, or port capture. According to the company, the port-looping functionality is unprecedented in the world of protocol analyzers and, for the first time, provides a complete view of the switch, including information on which ports are being used and to what extent. Observer offers multiple modes for switched environments, and all modes except Packet Capture display data by port.<p>
Observer 6.0 is priced at $995. Distributed Observer is priced at $1,290 for one local and one remote Probe; additional Probes are priced at $295 per Probe. The Observer Suite, which includes Expert, Web, SNMP, and RMON Extensions, is priced at $2,995.

With MaxStat 2.85, systems administrators can view, sort, and log critical user information including customer data such as username, elapsed time, modem connect rates, IP address, and service type. MaxStat has an extremely customizable user interface and any column of data can be displayed or disabled. Using the MultiMax option, administrators can also work with defined groups of RAS systems. Two or more MaxStat session windows can be opened side-by-side to monitor many different groups of systems in real time.<p>
MaxStat 2.85 can help administrators determine what sort of use their RAS system undergoes. MaxStat currently supports the Ascend Communications Max/TNTA, Lucent Technologies Portmaster4, and Patton Electronics Model 2800 Remote Access Concentrator products.<p>
Priced at $99, MaxStat runs best on an Intel Pentium 90 or greater, Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT platforms, 32 Mb RAM, 3 Mb hard drive space, and TCP/IP network connectivity. Quantity discounts are also available starting at $95 per license for 2-9 computers all the way up to $83 per license for 25-49 computers. Special pricing is available for 50+ computers.

<B>StraightLine Releases Harrier Series AIT Tape Library</b><p>StraightLine, manufacturer of automated tape library systems, has announced the addition of the Harrier Series. According to the company, the three new models combine the StraightLine's SoftDrive robotics and Sony's AIT-2 tape drive technology to achieve capacities up to 15 TB and 432 GB per hour data transfer rate.<p>
The Harrier Series sets standards for usability that distinguish it from other tape storage solutions. Convenient tape drawers allow all tapes to be loaded or unloaded within minutes, a feature that can save operators many hours per week. With standard Ethernet connectivity, StraightLine's Virtual Console allows library monitoring and control over the Internet.<p>
The Harrier Series libraries fit into dynamic storage architecture with performance configurations suitable for departmental, multiple workgroups, and enterprise applications. The Harrier 830 (30 tapes; 1 to 3 drives), the Harrier 850 (50 tapes; 1 to 5 drives), and the Harrier 8150 (150 tapes; 1 to 10 drives) are pre-wired to accept the maximum number of drives. Performance can be increased by connecting off the-shelf AIT drives without the need for a field upgrade kit. Harrier libraries will support all Sony AIT drives.<p>
