<B>Advanced Systems Concepts  Adds Sun Solaris Support to RemoteSHADOW</b><p>Advanced Systems Concepts has announced an extension to its RemoteSHADOW product to support the Sun Solaris platform. RemoteSHADOW transparently and continuously protects an organization's data by maintaining a copy at a remote site.<P>
RemoteSHADOW for Sun Solaris includes both local and remote shadowing capabilities for partitions or volumes in the event of a disk drive, controller, system, or data center failure. RemoteSHADOW supports a variety of connections for shadowing over links regardless of distance or bandwidth requirements. Bandwidth can be managed during specific periods through RemoteSHADOW's technology for smoothing data peaks.<P>
With its Network Restart feature, RemoteSHADOW also assists in the preservation of information following a network failure. Network Restart sends information to a queue when a connection is lost. The information continues to build in the queue until the connection is reestablished. Network Restart also sends only the delta information, reducing system demands.<P>
RemoteSHADOW is available for the Open VMS, UNIX, and Sun Solaris platforms. For more information, contact: <I>Advanced Systems Concepts, (800) 229-2724; WWW: http://www.advsyscon.com.</I><P>
