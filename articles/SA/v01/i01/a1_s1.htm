<H1>Sidebar: The Basics</H1><p>
<P>
While this article focuses on the dkmap script as an
aid in 
system restoration, any discussion of disaster recovery
would be remiss 
if it didn't discuss the basics, however briefly.<P>

All system administrators, whether tender novice or
wizened expert, 
should consider these issues:<P>

<li>Plan your backup so that no more than four or five volume

sets are required for the complete recovery of a file
system.  Just 
reading tapes can be the most time-consuming part of
any recovery 
process. Keep backup media well-labeled and if multiple
images are 
saved to a single tape, keep track of that, too. Keep
a certain number 
of full backups at a separate location in case of fire
or similar 
catastrophe.<P>

<li>Make sure you have a current bootable tape (or CD) for

each architecture you support. If the media is tape,
try to keep two 
copies per architecture. Tapes sometimes die, and their
favorite time 
to die is 2:00 A.M., particularly if they sense desperation

in the air.<P>

<li>Assess your vulnerability. What are your single points

of failure? Is there any equipment in your configuration
that users 
absolutely require to continue their work? If so, do
you have the 
coverage you need, either in the form of spare parts
or a maintenance 
contract?<P>

If you keep these points in mind, your disaster will

be a kinder, gentler one.<P>
