We ask that letters with code listings be submitted
in an ASCII text
file on an MS-DOS formatted disk or via email. Our net
address is
saed@rdpub.com (&quot;...!uunet!bdsoft!rdpub!saed&quot;).<P>



Please, if you're going to write about the X Window
System for public
consumption, *remember* that it is &quot;X&quot; or
&quot;the X Window System&quot;.
There's no such thing as &quot;X Windows&quot;. Microsoft
has a product called
&quot;Microsoft Windows&quot;, and it'd be a shame for
the people of the X
Consortium to be placed head-to-head with them.<P>

<I>Oops. I hadn't noticed the distinction and we've come
across the plural
form in a variety of UNIX publications, but I checked
the titles of
several X books and found they all agree with you. I've
made a note in
the style book our copy editors use. Thanks for the
kind correction. --rlw</I><P>



Some things I'd like to see you cover in SysAdmin:<P>

1. Rebuilding and partitioning hard disks (physical
and logical
configurations, commands, partition schemes vs maintainability
or
performance)<P>

2. sendmail -- basics, mixed UNIX environment, debugging,
sendmail
config files<P>

3. site policy and procedure (w/example excerpts, outlines,
topics to
cover)<P>

4. X-Window information -- determining specific hardware
and software
requirements to run X, requirements for specific X applications
(e.g.,
FrameMaker), installing and debugging, dependencies
on certain system
services (XDM-&gt;DNS)<P>

5. Disaster planning<P>

6. Printers and print spoolers (installing new hardware,
configuring
remote printers, remote printing with ATT print spooler)<P>

7. Moving computer rooms -- to another room, to another
building<P>

8. Domain Name Service -- installing, usage, configuring,
debugging,
issues for future developments, mixed UNIX environment<P>

9. Name Information Service (Yellow Pages) -- same issues
as above<P>

10. Backup logs -- suggested forms and format, copies
of scripts in log,
&quot;README&quot; describing how backkups done/managed
for specific platform,
detailed restoration instructions, security of backup
logs, pros/cons
for backup utilities &amp; packages<P>

11. Backups -- offsite storage (how to find appropriate
services),
incorporating total backup plan with disaster recovery
plan, backing up
user data vs. OS file systems, strengths and weaknesses
of UNIX backup
utilities and commercial products, backup tocs on disk,
redundant disks
or servers as backups<P>

12. Distributed systems -- designing the physical layuout,
resource
loading, heterogeneous environment, quantity of users
that can access a
server at the same time, how lmuch traffic a subnet
can handle, quantity
of users allocated to a printer, how lmuch filespace
a user needs, etc.<P>

13. Hooking up modems -- PEP, PPP, SLIP, CSLIP, security,
dial-in/dial-out, brands, models, configuring files,
troubleshooting,
types of lines (dedicated, pbx, netblazer, T1, T3, etc.),
services which
can make use of a modem, how to figure workloads for
a modem or
phoneline, hooking up to the internet, physical security
of phone lines,
encryption, callback security<P>

14. Evaluating/Hiring System Administrators -- Degrees/educational
background, experience applicable to the position, people
skills,
problem-solving capabilities, adaptability and &quot;grace
under pressure,&quot;
technical capabilities, background with platforms and
network design at
your site, what the rest of the system administration
staff thinkgs of
the candidate, etc.<P>

15. Job Search for System Administrators -- Determining
target job or
&quot;wish list,&quot; evaluating a company after research

of employers that
require beepers, working hours and stress levels, exposure

<I>What a great list! Out of 15 topics, there are only
three that I
don't think we'll cover: moving computer rooms, evaluating
potential
employees, and job search. Why not? Because other magazines
already cover these topics well. I'd like for SysAdmin
to 
add to, rather than duplicate, the available coverage.<P>

As for the other 12 topics, they're exactly what we're
looking
for. Are all you would-be authors listening? --rlw</I><P>
