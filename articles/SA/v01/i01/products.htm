<B>USL Releases UNIX SVR4 for MIPS RISC Platform</B><P>

UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. has announced UNIX SVR4
for MIPS RISC 
microprocessor systems. The MIPS hardware reference
platform is the 
Sony Microsystems NEWS 3200 Series Laptop workstation.
At a recent 
meeting, the MIPS SVR4 Interest Group (MSIG) steering
committee approved 
the new reference product and platform. <P>

The reference port is compatible with the &quot;big
endian&quot; MIPS 
SVR4 Applications Binary Interface, supported by AT&amp;T,
NEC, Olivetti, 
Prime, Pyramid, Siemens-Nixdoft, Sony Microsystems,
and Tandem. All 
have committed to MIPS-based computer systems compliant
with this 
SVR4 MIPS ABI. SVR4 MIPS ABI compliant applications
should run on 
systems from all these corporations in binary form without
recompilation. <P>

The MIPS SVR4 reference product and a MIPS SVR4 application
binary 
interface (ABI) are key steps for the MIPS chip as an
architecture 
for open computing. The MIPS UNIX SVR4 reference port
was developed 
by Pyramid Technology with contributions from Sony Microsystems.
<P>

For more information contact UNIX System Laboratories,
Inc., 190 
River Road, Summit, NJ 07901-1400, (908) 522-6264.<P>

<B>Baseline Software Announces Password Screening Package</B><P>

Baseline Software's Password Coach subjects user-chosen
passwords 
to 45 different strength tests. When users select difficult-to-guess

passwords, the software is user-transparent; if users
select easy-to-guess 
passwords, the package engages them in a password construction
dialog 
until a strong password is created.<P>

Password Coach ensures that users avoid passwords from
its 140,000 
word &quot;weak password&quot; dictionary, as well as
other weak passwords, 
such as common names, biographical and place names,
medical, legal, 
and technical terms. Password Coach also screens for
passwords vulnerable 
to context-sensitive and brute force password guessing,
such as anagrams 
of the user-ID, reversed dictionary words, and alphabetical
sequences.<P>

The weak password dictionary can be customized and source
code is 
available. Turn- key licenses range from $795 to $2,500,
while source 
licenses range from $5,000 to $27,000. For information
contact BASELINE 
Software, P.O. Box 1219, Sausalito, CA 94966, (800)
829-9955; FAX 
(415) 332-8032.<P>

<B>UNIX System V Roadmap Provides Planning Schedules and Requirements</B><P>

UNIX International (UI) has released the UNIX System
V Roadmap which

(a parallelized 
multiprocessing implementation of UNIX System V with
a high-level 
API, based on UNIX SVR4.1 Enhanced Security Base), and
add-ons in 
transaction processing, distributed computing, and system
management 
(a complete object-based Distributed System Management
Framework with 
management applications: Backup and Restore, Print Services,
Software 
Installation, Startup and Shutdown, User and Group Management).<P>
