<H1>Installing AIX</H1><p>
<P>
Bruce H. Hunter<P>

IBM's AIX operating system is making its presence known
on RISC/6000 
systems around the country, and UNIX administrators
need to learn 
about it.<P>

AIX is &quot;POSIX compliant,&quot; which means that
it looks like UNIX 
to the user, but underneath that user interface are
several major 
differences and a lot of extensions. These differences
are hidden 
from the user; for example, where the user sees an lp
or lpr 
command, these commands are actually controlled by another
spooler 
entirely, a versatile AIX spooler.<P>

It's easier to describe AIX to UNIX administrators by
identifying 
what it is not: it is neither UNIX System V nor BSD.
However, it is 
innovative and many parts of AIX resemble UNIX. For
instance, unique 
AIX configuration files maintain a certain consistency
through the 
use of structures called stanzas, which are somewhat
reminiscent 
of termcap and printcap.<P>

This article describes a setup for a network installation
of AIX and 
talks about some of its differences and strong points,
such as smit 
(the administrator's front end), LVM (the logical volume
manager), 
and ODM (the object data manager).<P>

<B>Installing AIX</B><P>

The first step in RISC/6000 ownership is installing
AIX, by copying 
off the OEM distribution. You may install by tape or
diskette, but 
since a diskette installation takes a very long time,
a tape installation 
works better for the first installation. The smaller
RISC/6000 systems, 
like the 530s, are typically purchased without tape
drives, but it's 
worth your while to have at least one with a QIC drive.<P>

After the first installation is done, network installation
is the 
quickest method. Although this method takes some care
in setup and 
execution, it allows you to install a RISC/6000 system
in one and 
a half to two hours.<P>

To prepare for a network installation, you must take
an image of a 
working system. The image doesn't have to be from an
identical machine 
-- a 550 will do for a 530 image -- but the image must
be small 
enough to fit. Most useful would be an image of the
most typical machine.<P>

<B>Creating an Image</B><P>

To avoid replicating trash from machine to machine,
you want the cleanest 
image possible. Therefore, ready the donor system by
cleaning out 
all its trash -- /tmp, lost and found directories, the
log 
files, printer and uucp spools, mail, and /var/spool/cron/crontabs.<P>

Keeping in mind that you will be creating an image of
the entire system, 
cut the system down to only the files needed (taking
an image from 
a 560 to fit on a series of 530s, for example, will
require quite 
a bit of pruning). To begin, remove all NFS-mounted
file systems. 
If you have local user work areas, remove those as well.
Do a df 
or a du to see if you have the image down to a size
that will 
fit on donor systems.<P>

Before taking the image, ask all users to log off and
tell them that 
the system will be unavailable for an hour or so. When
everyone has 
logged off, edit the rc file that controls nfs, /etc/rc.nfs,

by inserting a comment before the mount command. This
prevents 
the system from mounting its NFS files.<P>
<PRE>
#
#else
# mount -t nfs
#fi
sleep 5</pre><p>
<p>
As you spend time with AIX, rc.nfs will become 
an old friend, so get to know its contents.<P>

AIX shutdown is similar to a BSD 4.X shutdown (and unlike
a XENIX 
or System V shutdown). Bring it down with a shutdown
-h for 
a halt or a shutdown -r to reboot. The -F flag will

save more time by omitting shutdown messages.<P>

If you brought the system down using the -h, -x, or

halt option, reboot using the yellow restart button
with the 
front panel key in normal or run position. Those new

to RISC/6000 systems wil find this key disconcerting
at first, but 
it's simply like the key to an automobile -- each position
has 
a different meaning. Getting the key position right
is critical, as 
you'll quickly discover if you try to boot a newly built
system from 
the maintenance or the run position.<P>

To prepare to create the image, clear out any pre-existing
image from 
the area<P>
<PRE>
/usr/work/inst.images/risc_sys6000/3.1</pre><p>
<p>
Here 3.1 is the current revision number. If an old image

file exists, it will be called bos.obj.backup. With
NFS mounts 
disabled and the image area cleared, you are ready to
start. Initiate 
smit with the startup option (not found on the regular

smit menu).<P>
<PRE>
smit Startup</pre><p>
<p>
Moving through the menu options, take the backup 
option and enter the path and file name<P>
<PRE>
/usr/work/inst.images/
risc_sys6000/3.1/bos.obj.backup</pre><p>
<p>
The screen menu will display a message to back up the

system. Type or select the appropriate values in entry
fields, entering 
a string at square brackets and toggling for yes/no
arrangements. 
You toggle some smit items merely by selecting them;
others 
you select with a tab. When you have made all necessary
changes, press 
Enter.<P>

It will take about 20 minutes for the command to execute
and create 
the system image on disk. If it fails for lack of space,
it will tell 
you to mount vol 1 on the /usr/work/inst.images/risc_sys6000/3.1/bos.obj.backup.

If all goes well, the command finishes and quits. You
then scroll 
to the bottom of the smit screen to check all the messages.<P>

Inexperience can trap you here, because smit writes
all sorts 
of things at the bottom of its menus, assuming that
you know to scroll 
to the bottom when you're done. Leave smit when you're
certain 
all is well, uncomment your work in rc.net, and reboot
your 
system.<P>

You should now have an image you can use both for a
full system backup 
and for a network installation.<P>

<B>The Installation</B><P>

Gather the primary information that will be needed to
set up and complete 
the net installation, such as the system's new name
and Internet number 
and the Internet number of the system that will serve
the image; if 
you have to go through a gateway, you also need the
Internet address 
of that gateway or router.<P>

As an example, this article sets up a machine called
tiger at 
129.243.40.25. This system is on one of several subnets.
The 
immediately necessary information for this image install
is:<P>
<PRE>
image server: lion
internet #: 129 243.75.33
mask: 255.255.255.0
router: 129.243.29.100</pre><p>
<p>
Note that the mask is for a class B network with a subnetwork

part.<P>

This is the information needed to get the new system
going. With the 
infant 6000 wired and on the network, boot from the
special installation 
set of diskettes. There will be two start diskettes
in addition to 
the regular repair diskette. Boot to the first diskette
with the key 
in maintenance mode.<P>

Remember to switch full clockwise to service position
and then 
power on. The RISC/6000 systems have a set of diagnostic
lights on 
the front panel that give you direct alphanumeric messages,
but these 
messages will be a bit confusing until you understand
the ODM. The 
C messages will make a little more sense: two common
ones are are 
C09 for reading and C07 for &quot;load next floppy.&quot;<P>

To start, insert the first floppy and wait for the C07
to tell 
you to load the second diskette. The first two diskettes
will run 
silently, with no screen display. When diskette 2 has
been read, the 
system will tell you that you can now go interactive
and see what 
you are doing. Hit the F1 function key, then an Enter,

and install the third (maintenance) diskette.<P>

<B>BIOS Installation</B><P>

The third diskette loads the memory-resident BIOS, the
basic input 
output system. The menu displayed at this point allows
you to do some 
basic setup and prepare to read the image over the net.
First, however, 
you must check the system's date from another system,
because you 
will have to reset the system's date. Select menu option
3 (&gt;&gt;&gt;3 
settings) and you are ready to set up. Start by setting
the time 
(option [7] set TZ), including time zone and DST/no-DST
option. 
Next, use option [4] to set installation from the diskette

drive to network.<P>

Fill in the host name and Internet number, the master's
Internet number, 
and the router's Internet number. Once done with this,
select the 
image file and path you set up when you created the
image in the first 
place. The menu will walk you through, but it does so
circuitously.<P>

If you have completed everything satisfactorily, the
image will read 
in. Full path names and basenames will scroll up the
screen for an 
hour. When scrolling stops, the screen will say that
you can boot. 
Don't believe that message. You still have more work
to do, starting 
with moving the key to normal so that you actually can
boot.<P>

<B>Post-Net Installation Customization</B><P>

The new system needs to be brought up to something close
to single-user 
mode. However, if it processes through the network part
of the installation, 
it will become unhinged and go off into never-never
land. To prevent 
this, halt rc's part of the boot with a Control-C. You

must act quickly to short-circuit the process before
the network services 
can be activated, so hit Control-C as soon as the daemon
message 
for TCP/IP and NFS displays.<P>

Remember to key over to normal from service before booting.

After cancelling rc, you will get a login. Because you
now 
have the full system image taken from the donor system,
log on as 
root using the root password of the donor.<P>

<B>Edit Critical System Files</B><P>

Since the system's working image is a copy, the next
step entails 
providing unique system identifiers. As with any UNIX
system installation, 
you must be ensure that the system has its correct hostname,
Internet 
number, and route information. These are hidden in different
places, 
but they must all be found and changed. Use smit to
change 
the hosts and rc.net files' information and thereby
update 
the ODM.<P>

<B>Hosts</B><P>

If you are using NIS, any good hosts file is just a
two-liner, so 
add the new system's name and Inet number, keep loopback,
and delete 
all others. If you like easy readability, remove all
the comments. 
If you don't use YP, edit the very long hosts file by
entering your 
system's name and Internet number as the second line,
just after the 
loopback address.<P>

<B>rc.net</B><P>

Administrators who have previously been exposed only
to BSD systems 
must prepare themselves for a shock. The convenience
of having only 
a few rc files, like rc.boot, rc, and rc.local, 
is gone; in their place are dozens of rc files and rc

directories. The network initiation files, /etc/rc.net
and 
rc.nfs, set the hostname and hostid, add routing 
information, and open the Ethernet port. The files contain
a number 
of lines, many of them comments; for customization purposes,
find 
the lines for hostname, route, and ifconfig. 
Let's set up tiger:<P>
<PRE>
/bin/hostname tiger &gt;&gt;$LOGFILE 2&gt;&amp;1
/etc/route add 0 129.243.70.100 &gt;&gt; $lLOGFILE 2&gt;$1

/etc/ifconfig en0 inet 'hostname up &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE 2&gt;&amp;1</pre><p>
<p>

All of these lines must be uncommented and changed.
This 
part of the installation is critical; if you make a
mistake here, 
you won't be able to boot successfully. Instead, the
system will fail 
and will display a misleading message, &quot;YP master
not found,&quot; 
which will cause you to look in the wrong place to troubleshoot
the 
problem. The system needs an Internet number, good routing
information, 
and its hostname, and it has to bring up its Ethernet
port. 
Otherwise there will be no network and no system. If
you can't get 
the hostid check back on, see if anything is wrong with
the 
hostname line. hostid is set near the bottom of rc.net

and is a function of hostname. If hostname is not set,

neither is hostid. The trick is to find the hostid command,

and if you get back an answer like 0xf, you haven't
succeeded. 
You must get this part right, because a lot of your
software licenses 
will key off the hostid.<P>

If you neglected to clean out the cron directory or
any other 
trash collection directories when you created the image,
do it now 
and resolve to be more careful the next time you create
an image. 
Move to /var/spool/cron/crontabs and remove all but
root's 
cron file. These are the most important files, but there
may 
be others, like /etc/filesystems, AIX's answer to BSD
fstab. 
If your file systems are unique, customize them now.<P>

You can put your custom files on your own diskette and
use tar 
to read them in. If you do, the device is /dev/fd0 as
in<P>
<PRE>
#tar xvf /dev/fd0</pre><p>
<p>
The high-density diskette is fd0h, but this isn't 
required for single file transfers.<P>

<B>Make Some Room and Then Create New Partitions</B><P>

The as-shipped system may not have enough room. If your
/usr/work 
partition is too large to allow for adequate swap space,
shrink the 
partition by removing it (that's as small as it can
get).<P>

Mount /usr/work and then remove the entire logical volume
by 
playing with LVM through<P>
<PRE>
smit (rmfs /usr/work or rmlv /dev/lv00)</pre><p>
<p>
To create the file system again also requires using
smit. 
Follow this menu path<P>
<PRE>
smit -&gt; phys -&gt; file sys -&gt;
add/change/show.. -&gt;JFS -&gt; add a JFS</pre><p>
<p>
which moves you from smit's first window to physical

storage to file systems to add/change/show -- 
and on through to journaled file systems. Select the
add 
option. You will get a brief root message, then you
will be asked 
the size of the file system and its name:<P>
<PRE>
size of [50]
mount point [/usr/work]
mount auto</pre><p>
<p>
Questions like<P>
<PRE>
mount automatically no</pre><p>
<p>
can be toggled to &quot;yes&quot; by using the Tab 
key. If you succeed, smit will confirm that the job
is done. 
Press F10 to exit and go on to more useful work.<P>

<B>Increase Paging Size</B><P>

chps changes the attributes of the paging space and
can be 
used to provide the larger amount of page space required
by engineering 
and scientific systems. The -s option specifies the
number 
of logical partitions to add. For example,<P>
<PRE>
chps -s4 myvg</pre><p>
<p>
adds four logical paritions to the myvg paging 
space. Using quotation marks helps even more, as in
the following 
fragment that sets two paging areas:<P>
<PRE>
chps -s'8' hd6
chps -s'8' hd61</pre><p>
<p>
<B>Change Protections</B><P>

Typically, you will have to change some protections
like /etc/swcons 
to /dev/kmem. kmem is always shipped with excessive

protection, but since some of your applications need
to read from 
it, you'll need to reset it:<P>
<PRE>
chmod 644 /dev/kmem</pre><p>
<p>
<B>Post-Custom and Debug</B><P>

As noted earlier, if anything goes wrong with the network
portion 
of the installation, your boot will hang and display
messages like 
&quot;YP server not responding.&quot; The recovery is
to backtrack your 
customization starting with /etc/rc.net, looking for
missing 
comments and typos. <P>

A good debugging technique is to run smit to get its


version 
of what the net interface looks like. Use the following
menu path:<P>
<PRE>
smit -&gt;communications... -&gt; \
TCP/IP -&gt;minimum config -&gt; \
ne0 -&gt; -&gt;NFS -&gt; NFS -&gt; conf</pre><p>
<p>
If you find that the gateway (router) address has not

been entered,  provide the required information including
mask, host 
number, and hostname, and smit will write it to the

AIX system's database. You may have a few odds and ends
of your own; 
do them.<P>

Now you are ready to boot all the way to multi-user
mode. Try a shutdown 
-r and celebrate, or go back in again and see where
you went wrong. <P>
