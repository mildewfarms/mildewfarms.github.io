<H1>Books: A User's Report</H1><p>
<P>
Elizabeth Zinkann<P>

Documentation for the Internet has been available online
for some 
time. Now, however, several new books explain the Internet
and how 
it works, at levels suitable for both the experienced
user and the 
beginner. This month I look at four such books.<P>

<B><I>The Whole Internet User's Guide &amp; Catalog<br>
by Ed Krol<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.</B><P>

Unlike most O'Reilly books, which are intended for computer
professionals, 
Ed Krol's text addresses a more general professional
audience. For 
Krol's purposes, the reader may be a teacher, lawyer,
or an auditor 
so long as he/she possesses the following three prerequisites:
1) 
a &quot;desire for information&quot;; 2) the ability
to use a computer; 
and 3) access to the Internet.<P>

The author provides a short history of personal computers
that covers 
the development of networking and the expansion of power
due to networking. 
He also stresses that although most of the examples
in the book are 
implemented in UNIX, neither the book nor Internet should
be seen 
as a UNIX utility.<P>

In several sections, Krol gives the reader the option
of skipping 
over the more technical content. He does, however, include
the technical 
information for those who are interested in it. When
discussing TCP/IP, 
for example, the author fully describes protocols, packet
switching, 
and circuit switching, but allows the reader the choice
of bypassing 
these discussions.<P>

Some of the issues addressed seem more properly the
concern of the 
business world than of the technical realm, but in fact
both communities 
must deal with such matters as &quot;Legal Implications,&quot;
patents, 
and copyrights. Krol also examines politics and the
Internet, network 
ethics, and security. In the security section, he not
only points 
out what issues to monitor, but also explains how to
resolve problems 
arising from these issues.<P>

The most important chapters for the user describe telnet,
File Transfer 
Protocol (FTP), Electronic Mail, and USENET. For system
administrators, 
there are chapters that include gopher, the Wide Area
Information 
Servers (WAIS), archie, plus a section on the X Window
System.<P>

The Whole Internet User's Guide &amp; Catalog provides
information 
for the user, not just the beginner or the system administrator.
The 
documentation on the Internet has often been either
too simple or 
too difficult. If you have been browsing around the
Internet for some 
time, an introductory book is too easy -- on the other
hand, you 
may not want to set up your own Internet node. For an
experienced 
user who wants to know more about the Internet, this
book is just 
right. The examples presented are thoroughly explained,
occasionally 
in a different operating system. Despite the fact that
Krol uses UNIX 
most of the time, he often presents examples in both
UNIX and DOS, 
or even for the MAC. Krol's analogies are well-chosen
and very easy 
to comprehend, and his sense of humor shines through
-- even the 
footnotes are well worth reading. Put this book on the
shelf by your 
computer. It will make the Internet a lot simpler to
use.<P>

<B><I>Zen and the Art of the Internet<br>
A Beginner's Guide<br>
by Brendan P. Kehoe<br>
Prentice Hall</B><P>

Brendan Kehoe's book explains what the Internet is,
what information 
it contains, and how to access it in terms that a novice
can easily 
understand. The author describes email addresses, domain
names, and 
Internet numbers, as well as how to communicate using
electronic mail. 
In the latter section, Kehoe discusses the correct layout
of an email 
message and &quot;netiquette,&quot; the accepted etiquette
for the Internet. <P>

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the normal method
used for transferring 
files from one geographic location on the Internet to
another, but 
it often requires either logins on both systems or a
privileged configuration 
initiated by the system administrator. A simple method
of accessing 
files uses the anonymous FTP. In his discussion, Kehoe
presents examples 
of the anonymous FTP and the responses to the logins.<P>

One of the divisions of the Internet, Usenet, remains
widely misunderstood. 
To clear up the confusion, the author not only defines
Usenet, but 
also describes what it isn't. He also discusses telnet,
the primary 
Internet protocol that uses a connection with a remote
machine or 
system. <P>

Various tools available to the Internet user provide
information about 
the user (finger), another system (ping), and an easier

way to provide email messages (talk or ntalk). The author

lists the tools and also examines the different uses
of the WHOIS 
database.<P>

Kehoe devotes the rest of the book to &quot;Commercial
Services,&quot; 
&quot;Things You'll Hear About,&quot; and &quot;Finding
Out More.&quot; 
&quot;Commercial Services&quot; provides information
about some of the 
organizations available through the Internet plus their
addresses. 
&quot;Things You'll Hear About&quot; includes some of
the historical 
events and anecdotes that have occurred on the Internet,
as well as 
the names and addresses of some of the groups that have
been on the 
Internet for some time. The final chapter, &quot;Finding
Out More,&quot; 
identifies three primary sources and tells where to
expand your network 
education.<P>

The author also presents five appendices, including
one on newsgroup 
creation, one on items available for FTP, a glossary,
a bibliography, 
and an index.<P>

This small book contains a lot of information. Kehoe's
writing style 
is clear, and he assumes that his readers have no prior
knowledge 
of the Internet. I particularly enjoyed the author's
presentations 
concerning the Cleveland Freenet, a Net Mail Sites database,
and the 
Internet Society. I would recommend this book for any
beginner who 
wants to learn about the Internet.<P>

<B><I>Internet: Getting Started<br>
The Internet Information Series</I><br>
April Marine, Editor<br>
Susan Kirkpatrick, Vivian Niou,
Carol Ward, Contributors<br>
SRI International<br>
Network Information Systems Center</B><P>

This book introduces the Internet to both the beginning
and the intermediate 
user. In Part 1 of Internet: Getting Started, the staff
presents 
Internet basics: definition, types of access, and costs.
Particularly 
useful information includes an explanation of how to
join the Internet, 
a discussion of the costs of joining, and a list of
service providers, 
both alphabetically and by area. A small but valuable
section 
lists several questions, entitled &quot;Factors to Consider,&quot;

that help you to select a provider who is right for
your needs.<P>

The staff of SRI addresses both ways of joining the
Internet. Whether 
you are becoming a member through site access and need
a dedicated 
line or connecting as an individual through dialup mode,
you'll find 
information that you need. Part 1 also includes a chapter
devoted 
to non-U.S. sites and their addresses.<P>

Part 2 of Internet: Getting Started discusses the Internet

itself: its history, security, protocol, addressing,
and applications. 
As the book recounts, Internet's history and its security
are linked 
closely together. The very thing that tested the security
of the Internet 
brought its members closer together in their attempts
to solve the 
problem.<P>

One of the most important services of the Internet is
electronic mail 
(email). The staff of SRI describes the format of a
message header 
and the body as it will appear, the ethics of email,
and some examples 
of address formats that different networks use. This
chapter also 
includes news groups and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
The book concludes 
with a Bibliography and References, along with ten appendices,
including 
an acronym list, a Request For Comments (RFC) Table
of Contents, and 
an RFC Index.<P>

The structure of the book follows the evolution of the
Internet. It 
introduces each subject simply, so that any novice can
understand 
it, then addresses the same subject two paragraphs later
in intermediate 
terms. New and archaic acronyms are gradually intertwined
with explanations. 
In this way, the reader encounters the problems that
the Internet 
faced and learns how they were resolved. One of the
best features 
of the book, though, is its documentation; when the
text mentions 
contacting someone or someplace, the complete address
always follows 
immediately.<P>

This book is an excellent resource for either an individual
or a network 
user. The levels escalate from beginner to intermediate,
and even 
the advanced user will find something useful. I would
recommend this 
book for anyone using the Internet.<P>

<B><I>Internet: Mailing Lists<br>
The Internet Information Series</I><br>
Edward T. L. Hardie, Vivian Neou, Editors<br>
SRI International<br>
Network Information Systems Center</B><P>

Mailing lists enable those with a common interest to
share news, problems, 
and answers with one another. Internet, BITNET, and
USENET have become 
the three major networks for these mailing lists. In
this book, the 
types of mailing lists are examined, as well as the
etiquette for 
using mailing lists. There are also intructions for
creating 
your own list. However, the majority of the book is
devoted to the 
descriptions of over 800 Internet mailing lists and
their 
formats (one could get lost for days perusing these
lists). Anyone 
who belongs to the Internet will certainly enjoy this
book. <P>
