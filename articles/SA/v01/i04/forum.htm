<H1>Publisher's Forum</H1><p>

I've just returned from two weeks of trade shows. I
stopped first 
in Boston for Software Development Fall '92, where I
taught sessions 
on debugging and on C coding techniques. From there
I went to UNIX 
Expo to help staff our Sys Admin booth. <P>

I was a little apprehensive about taking Sys Admin to
UNIX 
Expo; I was afraid the show would be dominated by end
users (&quot;system 
what? Can I use that with my wordprocessor?&quot;).
I was pleasantly 
surprised. We gave away over 3,000 sample copies to
potential readers 
and found that nearly everyone who passed the booth
admitted to doing 
at least a little system administration. We met a significant
number 
of people who already subscribe and were able to get
some firsthand 
feedback about the magazine -- nearly all positive.
We also met 
some potential authors and advertisers. All in all,
a very productive 
trip.<P>

Not remarkably, very few of those who admitted to doing
system administration 
claimed it as their first love. (When we print a Sys
Admin
t-shirt, it should bear a slogan like: &quot;I'm a System
Administrator: 
it's dirty work but someone has to do it.&quot;) Invariably
attendees 
told us they did system administration only because
they couldn't 
avoid it or because no one else at their site knew how.
(There's a 
message in there somewhere.) Even so, most seemed intrigued
with the 
idea of a magazine just about system administration.
That was gratifying. <P>

Aside from the positive reception for Sys Admin, I was
most 
taken with an AlphaWindow demonstration. Clark Brown
of Structured 
Software Solutions Inc. (and one of our authors) demonstrated
an AlphaWindow 
version of their FacetTerm session manager. I liked
the combination 
-- I liked it a lot. The alpha standard provides virtually
all 
the functionality of the typical graphical windowing
environment (complete 
with mouse and with icons for suspended and background
processes) 
without all the processor and communications overhead
associated with 
a full graphics implementation. Perhaps Bill Gates can
afford to put 
a graphics competent workstation on everyone's desk,
but I can't. 
AlphaWindow terminals coupled to a good session manager
looks like 
a very reasonable compromise. I only hope the marketplace
comes to 
the same conclusion. <P>

Sincerely yours,<br>
