<B>MachTen X Software Turns Macintosh into X Terminal</B><P>

Tenon Intersystems has begun shipping MachTen, Release
2.0  for 
Macintosh, and MachTen X Client and X Server. MachTen

is Berkeley  4.3BSD UNIX, built on a Carnegie Mellon
Mach foundation, 
licensed  AT&amp;T software. MachTen runs on every Macintosh
from 
Powerbooks to  Quadras. MachTen allows you  to run off-the-shelf

Macintosh programs while simultaneously running  UNIX
programs.<P>

Tenon's MachTen X Server software, release 1.4.0, conforms

to X11R4 of MIT's X Window system, links MachTen users
to X 
Window applications, and runs in conjunction with MachTen
and 
MacOS. The MachTen Server has a built-in window manager
which 
supports up to six independently configurable X screens,
with three 
styles available: rooted screens, Macintosh style rootless
windows, 
and Motif style rootless windows. The MachTen X Window
Client, 
release 1.5.0, is an X11 development environment based
on S11R5, and 
is designed to be used in conjunction with MachTen and
the 
MachTen Development System. The package includes X programming

libraries, Athena widgets and utilities, configuration
files, documentation 
for the X11R5 adaptation to MachTen, and sample sources
for 
X client applications (e.g., xterm, twm, and xbiff).
Motif libraries 
are an option.<P>

<B>Mark Williams' COHERENT Enters 32-Bit Operating System Race</B><P>

Mark Williams Company describes COHERENT 4.0, the newest
release of 
their UNIX-like operating system, as &quot;only the
third 32-bit operating 
system [for PC compatibles] ... to be released.&quot;
The others are 
IBM's OS/2 and SCO UNIX System V/386 release 3.2. COHERENT's
design 
aimed at a &quot;plug and play&quot; UNIX. COHERENT
installs into a 
10Mb hard disk partition in less than an hour, and requires
only 1Mb 
RAM and a 16MHz 386SX computer.<P>

COHERENT 4.0 provides a multi-user, multitasking operating
system 
that runs many unmodified UNIX programs. COHERENT bundles
development 
tools including an optimizing C compiler, a new optimizing
linker, 
a documented macro-assembler, and versions of lex, yacc,
awk, and 
make, as well as termcap, terminfo, and curses.<P>

COHERENT comes with one 1,200 page manual, a single
unlimited user 
license, and free technical support. COHERENT 4.0 costs

<B>Archipel and Chorus Systems Announce Transputer-Based Distributed UNIX</B><P>

Archipel SA (France) and Chorus Systems SA have announced
a transputer-based 
distributed UNIX system. Built on the Chorus microkernel
technology, 
Archipel's VOLVOX-TS family was to have been made available
in September 
1992. The new system is the result of integrating the
Chorus operating 
system, CHORUS/MiX SVR4, into Archipel's VOLVOX MIMD
(Multiple Instruction 
Multiple Data) machines. Designed as a MIMD operating
system, Chorus 
is also UNIX System V compatible. The VOLVOX-TS system
makes parallel 
processing power available in the UNIX Open Systems
environment.<P>

The VOLVOX-TS line is built on transputer technology,
using the INMOS 
T805 processor. Later versions will employ the T9000.
Each processor 
has its own memory and communicates with other processors
using on-chip 
communication facilities. The Chorus microkernel interprocess
communication 
is mapped directly on to T805 communications, yielding
high performance. 
Applications can be distributed across processors to
increase performance 
while the peripherals and functionality of each processor
are made 
available transparently to the programs on all the other
processors.<P>

For more information, contact Chorus Systems, Inc.,
15262 NW Greenbrier 
Parkway, Beaverton, OR 97006, (503) 690-2300; FAX: (503)
690-2320.<P>

<B>UNIX International Delivers Second Early Access Version of UNIX SVR4 ES/MP</B><P>

UNIX International (UI) has provided members with early
access to 
a second development version of UNIX System V Release
4 Enhanced Security/Multiprocessing 
(ES/MP), which is in development at UNIX System Laboratories,
Inc.

technology requirements 
defined in UI's 1992 Roadmap for UNIX System V and Related
Technologies, 
and it builds on the first version (EA1) by providing
a multithreaded 
kernel. This release merges the features of UNIX SVR4.1
Enhanced Security 
and UNIX SVR4.2, and adds other features and performance
enhancements, 
such as enhanced scalability to support up to 30 CPUs,
a compilation 
environment that can build both uniprocessor and multiprocessor
versions, 
installable reference binaries for the Intel platform,
system management 
commands for multiprocessing, and APIs for multithreaded
security 
features. <P>
