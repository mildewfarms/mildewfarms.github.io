Subject: Frozen Terminals<P>

I would just like to add something to Mr. Brown's article
on trouble-shooting 
terminal lockup. The problem of &quot;receive flow control
lock,&quot; 
which was cited as one of the most common causes of
frozen terminals, 
can be completely avoided by making sure that ixany
is set 
as one of the line control options for all terminals.
<P>

Having this parameter set by the stty command tells
the computer 
that any character sent from the keyboard, not just
a Control-Q, 
can be used as the signal to restart output once it
has been stopped 
by typing a Control-S. This restart character could
even be 
another Control-S. <P>

The ixany option could be set up globally either by
putting 
the line &quot;stty ixany&quot; in the file /etc/profile,

or by including IXANY in the &quot;final-flags&quot;
field (the 
third field as separated by the # sign) in the /etc/gettydefs

file. You can include this in all entries in the gettydefs

file or just in selected ones. <P>

If you don't wish to make it global then you can just
include the 
&quot;stty ixany&quot; line in selected users' .profiles.

<I>Good point. However, even though we use ixany on all

our lines, we still encounter some flow control problems.
I suspect 
that whether ixany is totally effective depends on how
well 
the driver is implemented and how other communications
equipment in 
the link responds. --rlw</I><P>

Subject: Foobar<P>

I have a question which has been bugging me ever since
I started with 
UNIX -- what is the significance of &quot;foobar&quot;?
I would be 
eternally grateful to be enlightened in this respect!<P>

<I>As the story came to me, &quot;foobar&quot; originated
in 
the military. Allegedly it is a corruption of a straightforward
acronym 
for a scatological phrase ending with the words &quot;beyond
all recognition.&quot; 
More than that I won't print. --rlw</I><P>

Dear Sys Admin Staff,<P>

I just received your second issue, (my first look at
your magazine), 
and I must say that I am impressed. I subscribe to various
trade mags, 
and all too often the articles lack the specifics that
I need to help 
me with my daily tasks. There are exceptions to this,
of course, but 
so far, it looks like your magazine will be a valued
reference. <P>

It is with this in mind that I am writing to ask you
to please not 
make too many assumptions regarding your subscribers'
knowledge base. 
I read the letter written by Russ Hill in issue 2, and
while I will 
agree with some of his points, it was his last paragraph
which concerned 
me. In it, he states: &quot;If this mag is going to
be for sysadms 
then realize your readers are SYSADMS! and they know
all about shell 
scripts and they know how to port programs. Please in
your articles 
talk about real sysadm issues!!!!&quot;<P>

I have worked with various platforms such as Sun, Harris,
SCO, and 
NBI, and have worked with UNIX (BSD and SYSV) for about
6 or 7 years. 
In that time, however, it has never once been required
of me to port 
a program. I would find an article on this to be very
interesting 
and informative. Also, while I have worked with shell
scripts, I am 
always interested in seeing what other people are doing.
<P>

Please keep your magazine a technical one, but please,
don't assume 
that because a technique has been around for a while
that everyone 
knows it inside and out. I'm sure there are other individuals
out 
there who share my opinion, and would like articles
on not only the 
latest and greatest, but also the tried and true.<P>

Thank you for your time, and for a great magazine. <P>

Sincerely,<br>

James V. Wojno<br>

<I>Thanks for the kind words. I want even the most advanced

and sophisticated system administrators to find something
useful in 
this magazine, but I think I can accomplish that without
being elitist. 
Whenever possible, we place related background and tutorial
material 
in a sidebar so that it's available, but so that you
aren't forced 
to read material with which you are already familiar.
Excepting material 
appearing in a sidebar, I try to keep each individual
story targeted 
for a single level of sophistication. I don't want readers
to invest 
20 minutes in reading the first part of a story only
to find out that 
they don't have the background to absorb some key concept
presented 
later in the story. I don't believe, though, that every
story should 
be aimed only at the most sophisticated reader -- no
one is 
an expert in everything. -- rlw</I><P>
