<H1>Questions and Answers</H1><p>

<B>The World Sysadmin Conference</B><P>

The First World Conference on System Administration
and Security, 
organized by FedUNIX, was held in Washington DC, July
20-23. This 
was FedUNIX's first attempt at a major system administration
conference, 
I was pleasantly surprised by its quality, which was
quite good, even 
if perhaps not up to what would be expected from a LISA
conference. 
However, since the USENIX LISA conference has been in
place for a 
number of years, this is to be expected, and will probably
change 
as the World System Administration conference matures.
Currently, 
a second conference in planned in April of 1993, possibly
sponsored 
in cooperation with SAGE, the System Administrators
Guild (see the 
September/October issue of Sys Admin for information
on SAGE).<P>

A disconcerting note emerged in the round-table discussion
that followed 
the keynote address by Jon Gossels, Area Manager for
DCE and DME, 
Open Software Foundation (OSF). The address had focused
essentially 
on OSF's work on DCE and DME; when asked whether any
experienced, 
real-life system administrators had participated in
the design and 
development of the DME, Mr. Gossels indicated that system
administrators 
had been included in the membership of an advisory panel
but did not 
confirm that system administrators had actually been
involved in the 
design and development.<P>

If this is the case, I find it a scary thought! If the
DME really 
has been designed and implemented without involvement
from the people 
who today are solving the problems that this software
will supposedly 
be solving tomorrow, how well could that software be
expected to perform?<P>

On a more positive note, Frank Moss, president of Tivoli
and a panelist, 
stated that Tivoli has hired Rob Kolstad (of USENIX
and LISA fame), 
as a consultant for their project. <P>

<B>The Security Symposium</B><P>

Another recent conference was the Security Symposium,
a joint conference 
between USENIX and CERT. Several very good papers was
presented, my 
personal favorite being Michelle and David Koblas's
paper on SOCKS, 
a proxy ftp and telnet service. SOCKS is now available
by ftp 
from st.gov (128.15.32.7) as /pub/socks.tar.Z. There

will be another Security Symposium in 1993, currently
scheduled for 
sometime in August, in San Jose, California. Contact
Edward DeHart, 
who can be reached at (412) 268-6179 or by e-mail at
ecd@cert.sei.cmu.edu, 
for further information. <P>

<B>Upcoming LISA Conference</B><P>

The next conference with a UNIX system administration
target is LISA 
VI, the USENIX Large Installation System Administration
Conference 
in Long Beach, October 19th through 23rd. While this
conference was 
originally targeted exclusively towards large sites,
it now includes 
topics of interest to all UNIX system administrators.
For further 
information, contact the USENIX conference office, phone
(714) 588-8649, 
or send e-mail to Judith DesHarnais at judy@usenix.org.<P>

<B>New LISA User Group in the Boston Area</B><P>

System administrators in the Boston area have created
Back Bay LISA, 
a local user group for UNIX system administrators inspired
by Bay-LISA, 
in the San Francisco Bay Area. The group plans regular,
monthly meetings, 
to consist of a speaker, product demonstrations, general
discussions, 
or other activities of general interest. There are currently
no dues, 
and all system administrators are invited. The group
meets on the 
last Wednesday of every month, except December, at a
location in the 
Greater Boston area. There is a mailing list, bblisa@inset.com,

which will carry announcements and discussions. To join
the mailing 
list, send email to bblisa-request@inset.com. Contact
Jim Oldroyd 
at (617) 890-4930 or email jr@unset.com for further
information.<P>

<B>Questions</B><P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 My question relates to anonymous ftp. I understand

that lots of programs are available by anonymous ftp.
How do 
you get anonymous ftp if you are not in the Internet?<P>

Obviously, I have access to uucp mail -- will that help?
If I have 
a modem, can I use anonymous ftp to get some of those
programs? If 
that is the case, what would the command line look like
(for ftp, 
that is)?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 FTP is an abbreviation of File Transfer Protocol. Originally

developed for use on local TCP/IP networks, it is today
mainly used 
on the Internet to transfer files from various archive
sites. In this 
context, it is often referred to as anonymous ftp. If
you are 
not on the Internet, you are out of luck. However, it
is now much 
easier to get Internet access, through service providers
such as Netcom 
here in California, which makes user accounts available
on machines 
with Internet connection for a very reasonable monthly
fee. Also, 
uucp sites who subscribe to UUNET (and probably most
other similar 
service providers) can ask to get the package made accessible
by uucp.<P>

The only other alternative is to use an ftp mail server,
if 
you can find one. The problem is that such servers tend
to be very 
unpopular with their uucp neighbors, as they can generate
very large 
amounts of e-mail in response to incoming requests.
The ones I was 
aware of are no longer in service, possibly for this
reason. If any 
of our readers know of an ftp mail server currently
in operation, 
please send me the information and I will print it in
a future issue 
of Sys Admin. I suggest anybody using an ftp mail server

to use it in moderation. Attempting to download X11
release 5 in this 
manner will certainly make you prime contender for winning
this year's 
unpopularity contest at the uucp sites located between
you and the 
server site.<P>

<B>Using ftp</B><P>

Depending on the specific setup at your site, you may
need to login 
to your Internet gateway or use a special command to
get beyond your 
gateway. In the discussion that follows, I assume that
you are on 
an Internet gateway machine or are otherwise able to
issue the ftp 
command directly. <P>

1. To connect to the remote system, issue the ftp command,

with the name (or IP address) of the remote system.
<P>

2. At the login prompt, login as ftp, and at the password
prompt 
give your e-mail address. In the old days, the password
was also ftp, 
but today, when the Internet must be considered a rough
neighborhood 
to live in, most archive sites ask for your user name
or e-mail address. 
Even when this is not required, it is considered good
behavior to 
provide it.<P>

3. When you get the prompt, you can issue commands to
the ftp 
program. You will recognize some of the commands, as
they are traditional 
UNIX commands, such as ls and cd, while others are specific

to ftp, such as get and binary. See Figure 1 
for a list of common ftp commands.<P>

By default, the ftp program is set up to transfer text
files only. 
Since the files have probably been compressed in the
archive, you 
will need to instruct the transfer program to do the
extra work necessary 
to safely transfer binary files. <P>

You can accomplish this with the command binary or image.

Some ftp programs will accept with just the command
i. <P>

Each file you need to transfer can then be downloaded
with the get 
command (or mget, if many files are to be downloaded).<P>

Most archive sites have a file named ls-lR.Z, which
is a compressed 
version of the output of the ls -lR command. You can
download 
this file to see what the archive has to offer. <P>

4. To end the session, enter the command bye, which
will log 
you out from the remote site. <P>

Figure 2 shows a typical ftp session.<P>

One last word on ftp: some older systems use the word
anonymous 
as login and password. If ftp does not work, try anonymous

instead. <P>

<B>Using Archie</B><P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I frequently see references on USENET to a program
called 
Archie. Can you provide some information?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Archie is an information server that can list the content

of many of the archive sites accessible through the
Internet. It can 
be very useful when you are trying to find a certain
package but don't 
know where it is stored.<P>

To use Archie, you do a telnet to the site where Archie
is available 
(see Figure 3). For help information, type the word
&quot;help.&quot; 
Figure 4 shows an example session I did for this column,
looking for 
Matt Bishop's Passwd+ package.<P>

If you are not on the Internet, you can still use Archie
through e-mail. 
Send e-mail to Archie at any of the addresses listed
in Figure 3, 
with the single line content of &quot;help&quot; for
other information.<P>

<B>Interviewing a System Administration Candidate</B><P>

A recent question asked what to look for in hiring a
new system administrator. 
When I interview a candidate, the first thing I look
for is a good 
attitude. I think we all know at least one person who
has the technical 
skills to be a good system administrator, but who has
a personality 
problem that makes it difficult for him/her to work
with peers, users, 
or management. I am not interested in having such a
person on my team, 
whether I have actually been called in to run the site
for a time 
or have just been asked to help find the right person
for a client 
site's staff. A good attitude, in this context, means
easy to work 
with.<P>

Given a candidate with a good attitude, I assess skill
levels, looking 
for three different qualities:<P>

1. An understanding of what is required of a system
administrator 
-- specifically, which issues are important (e.g., backups
and 
uptimes) and how to interact with users. A candidate
who sees system 
administration as simply a matter of doing whatever
the users ask 
will not make it beyond this step.<P>

2. A willingness to acknowledge limitations -- specifically,
I 
try to gauge how difficult it is for the candidate to
say &quot;I don't 
know,&quot; and I will continue to probe with increasingly
difficult 
questions until I get that answer. What want here is
a person who 
will readily acknowledge when he/she does not know the
answer, and 
some indication of how that person would find a solution
to the question.<P>

People who have difficulty in admitting that they don't
have an answer 
or who try to hide mistakes they have made are too dangerous
to be 
let loose on my network of machines. Since the fail-safe
system administrator 
has not yet been invented, I at least want one who can
admit that 
a mistake has been committed and who can clean up the
mess afterwards.<P>

Also, in my experience a person who can readily say
&quot;I don't know&quot; 
or admit a mistake is, typically, sufficiently secure
in his/her own 
skills and knowledge about the system to make fewer
mistakes in the 
first place. Moreover, when such people make a mistake,
they take 
it as an opportunity to learn as much as possible in
order to avoid 
repeating it in the future.<P>

3. Good technical skills and a good overall understanding
of UNIX. 
In summarizing my impressions after the interview, I
place more emphasis 
on the person's attitude, general skill level, and ability
to fit 
in with the rest of the staff than on any specific skills
or knowledge.<P>

This approach has been successful for me. I will not
necessarily get 
the most skillful candidate, but the person I hire will
fit in, and 
will be able to learn quickly in areas where his/her
experience may 
be a little thin. Specific questions, such as what xargs
does, 
or what the effect of -v option to cat will be (no --

it does not mean verbose), can be used to gauge the
candidate's technical 
skill level, but an interview mainly based on such questions
will 
not really tell you what you need to know. <P>
