<H1>Publisher's Forum</H1><p>

Shortly after our first issue came out, I received
some email from 
an SCO employee complaining that we weren't covering
SCO. He felt 
that since SCO accounts for a significant part of the
market, we should 
devote some significant coverage to SCO. In addition
to our other 
sins, he pointed out, we had even published some code
that was just 
flat wrong under SCO.<P>

I'm confused. I thought we were giving significant coverage
to SCO. 
In fact I was concerned that I'd be accused of giving
other variants 
short shrift. The largest piece of code in that first
issue was Leor 
Zolman's overnight spooler, which was developed here
under SCO Xenix 
-- the only variant we run in house. A significant portion
of the 
machines in the network Bruce Hunter administers run
under SCO -- 
even though in that issue he chose to write about AIX.
<P>

Thus, my unhappy correspondent is both right and wrong.
Right: we 
should give SCO considerable coverage. Wrong: we haven't
been shorting 
SCO. But I'm not willing to dismiss his complaint so
easily. What 
about the larger questions: &quot;How do we balance
coverage of various 
variants? Must we label each article SCO, SUN, etc.,


for readers to 
recognize it's relevance?&quot;<P>

I intend to answer the first part by following the market,
i.e., covering 
the systems our readers are using in a mix that reflects
the relative 
prevalence of those systems. Right now that means greatest
emphasis 
on SCO (both UNIX Sys V and XENIX), Sun, AIX, and HP/UX,
with special 
emphasis on System V independent of platform.<P>

That last part -- &quot;independent of platform&quot;
-- underlies 
my answer to the second question. I don't want to label
each story 
as specific to a certain platform because I expect the
System V and 
Open Systems definitions to significantly reduce the
variation among 
platforms. Besides that, like many self-taught system
administrators, 
I only have significant experience with one platform
-- how can 
I or authors with a similar background reliably label
stories that 
might be applicable to other platforms?<P>

Enough.<P>

If you attend UNIX Expo (New York, NY, Sept. 22 - 24),
please stop 
by and say hello. I'll be in booth #1873, handing out
magazines and 
listening to your ideas. So come by, and let us know
what you think 
of the magazine and what you'd like to see us cover
in future issues.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>
