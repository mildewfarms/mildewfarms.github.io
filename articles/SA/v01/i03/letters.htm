Subject: Password taboos<br>

I have two comments on password protection.<P>

First, it's easy to tell people what not to do with
passwords; helping 
them come up with good passwords is not much more difficult,
but articles 
on password security (including Chris Hare's article
on _How UNIX 
Password Controls Work_) seldom touch on this topic.
<P>

Instead, we are told, &quot;don't pick any real word
or other 
easily remembered combination of printable characters,&quot;
yet we 
are to pick something we can easily remember so we don't
have to write 
it down!<P>

There are a few simple tricks to aid with password generation
that 
meet both the above goals. Naturally, they work best
with passwords 
that are obscure to begin with, but they will help with
even simple 
passwords.<P>

Mixing alphabetics and non-alphabetics in some fashion
which makes 
sense to you usually provides enough security. Systems
which allow 
all printable (or even nonprintable) characters lend
themselves best 
to this, but even using numbers will help quite a bit.<P>

The simplest case is to tack a number on at the beginning
or end of 
a word. This is marginally more secure than the word
itself. Better 
yet is to use a number or other non-alphabetic character
in a mnemonic 
fashion. Consider the following table of substitutions
(use your imagination!)<P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TH WIDTH=75 ALIGN=LEFT><B>This</B></TH>
<TH WIDTH=175 ALIGN=LEFT><B>Can replace</B></TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>0</TD>

<TR>
<TD>8</TD>
<TD>B</TD>

<TR>
<TD>9</TD>
<TD>g</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
These are only what I consider the most obvious ones.
But these (if 
used judiciously) increase the password &quot;alphabet.&quot;
Passwords 
like 5har0n, k0mquat, or 5en1l3 are tougher to crack
than their regular 
spellings (sharon, kumquat, senile).<P>

Creative spellings and mnemonics help, also. Coworkers
and I have 
successfully (in cracker-filled environments) used the
following: 
3lobyte (trilobite), sharf1sh (sharon likes fish), timbukE
(reverse 
substitution of 3 in the name of the group timbuk3).<P>

Similarly, made-up words can work well. Simply pick
some syllables 
you like, or some sounds, and make a word. Use an obscure
word from 
another language, perhaps spelled phonetically. Mix
in the alternate 
characters as you like, and &quot;voila!&quot; (literally,
&quot;you 
will look like a fool if you say this aloud&quot;).<P>

I have used a bogus word from the net which caught my
eye, with substitutions 
as suggested above, for quite a while. Despite life
amongst some very 
good pranksters, it has worked well. I interchange it
occasionally 
with a few other similar passwords. About the only way
these can be 
cracked is by testing every (or random) passwords -
and nothing is 
protection against that.<P>

Second, I'm tired of hearing how dangerous password
cracking programs 
are. People who want to crack your passwords *are* going
to have them! 
You had better have programs as good as theirs to catch
sloppy users. 
Really secure sites use password programs such as SecureWare
provides 
in their trusted system - which won't even allow a user
to set a password 
to something easily cracked. Without such a tool, however,
you should 
be prepared to run the COPS (or some other) cracker
on a regular basis. 
My experience is that even with educated users, COPS
will uncover 
that 10% to 20% of your users will have unsafe passwords
until confronted 
-- and that's without testing against the system dictionary!

Encouraging system administrators to avoid password
crackers is like 
suggesting the police go out to face drug dealers without
guns.<P>

<I>The substitution trick is neat, and easy to teach. Thanks

for sending it. <P>

As for password crackers, I agree, the bright and diligent

intruders will have them. All the same, I don't have
to make things 
easy for the dumber would-be intruders by publishing
the code here.

Subject: comment...<P>

I got my first issue of Sys Admin, and it looks nice.
I'll miss the 
root dragon however.<P>

I especially enjoyed G. Clark Brown's article.<P>

But there is one thing missing. It's simple to fix,
though.<P>

Where's the ftp address for the code from the articles???<P>

David Lesher<br>

scl.cwru.edu!wb8fox@uunet.uu.net<P>

<I>In the U.S. you can access the code using uunet as a
bridge. <P>

Host: ftp.uu.net<P>

Location: /published/sysadmin/1992<P>

We've been told that other sites are routinely archiving

this directory, but we don't have any addresses.<P>

In the U.K. you can find the code at<P>


Host: src.doc.ic.ac.uk<P>

Location: /published/sysadmin/1992<P>

I hope this helps. And thanks to David J. Young for
the 
addresses and ftp information. --rlw</I><P>

Subject: Subscription<P>

Our relationship has gotten off to a bad start. When
I first saw your 
advertisements for Sys Admin, I was excited about the
new magazine. 
I sent in my subscription request. I waited to see the
first issue 
but all I got were several bills saying I must be enjoying
my first 
issue and asking me to send in money. After getting
several such notices 
I called and asked when the first issue was due to be
sent out. I 
was told it already had been sent and you would send
me another right 
away. I got one. The postmark on the envelope was dated
July 1. A 
day or two latter I got a notice postmarked July 2nd
saying:<P>

&quot;We've cancelled your subscription to Sys Admin.
Our records indicate 
that we have not yet received a subscription payment
from you.&quot;<P>

You are right, I have not yet sent in a payment. I was
not sure you 
even had a magazine to sell. You might give me a few
days to look 
it over before sending such a negative notice. At this
point in time, 
your subscription service seems very questionable. Will
you be able 
to maintain a magazine? If I send you a subscription
payment, will 
the money just disappear into a bit bucket of your bank
account and 
I never see another magazine? Several of my co-workers
are interested 
in my experience before they request subscriptions.
Will service improve?<P>

Regards,<br>

<I>Please accept my sincerest apologies. I don't blame
you 
a bit. If I were on the receiving end of this sequence,
I'd be miffed 
too. If it makes any difference, you weren't alone --
we sent the 
same inappropriate sequence of letters to several hundred
other subscribers.<P>

For what it's worth, though, it was never our intent
to 
introduce you to the magazine in this way, and you needn't
worry about 
our disappearing with your money. We've been publishing
technical 
information since 1981 and have been described by one
of our competing 
publishers as &quot;the most ethical publisher&quot;
in the industry.<P>

This problem is the result of not properly synchronizing

the mailing of this issue with the generation of the
billing sequence. 
Your magazine arrived, it just arrived very late. During
the last 
few weeks, our printer has been moving to a new plant
(they have a 
couple of city blocks worth of plant to move!). Because
they were 
unable to bring a new press on-line as planned, they
wound up seriously 
behind. One of our magazines was jobbed to a sister
plant in another 
state. SA was just delayed by about two weeks. <P>

Unfortunately we didn't coordinate well enough between
the 
fulfillment and editorial departments. As a result,
the automated 
letter series went out as originally scheduled. In most
cases this 
wouldn't create a great problem, as only one or two
letters would 
arrive before the magazine. Unfortunately, since the
publication is 
mailed third class, the post office may also insert
an additional 
delay that can vary by as much as two to three weeks
from subscriber 
to subscriber. <P>

The bottom line: feel free to ignore these letters till

you get a magazine. You WILL receive at least one. --rlw</I><P>

Subject: Source listing for July Sys Admin<P>

I just downloaded the source listings for the July issue
from ftp.uu.net. 
Two things come to mind.<P>

1) Consider publishing the internet address for uunet

archives in 
your magazine. Most universities are able to ftp directly
to uunet, 
but many users may not be aware of it. It's not clear
to me whether 
uunet would be fond of having their addr published,
or whether they 
would prefer that folks use the 900 number, but if uunet
is game, 
its sure a lot easier for those with internet ties.<P>

2) The first source listing I looked at, King Able's
&quot;rts&quot; 
script, has been corrupted. It looks like lines have
been truncated 
at something like 70 char wide. Actually, the lines
aren't truncated, 
but the remainder is tacked on as a new line. Consider
line 11, in 
the comments section. This one is easy to spot, since
it has no # 
in col 1. But then consider line 72, which reads &quot;&lt;$TMP&quot;.

This line is actually supposed to be at the end of the
line above 
it, and of course the script itself fouls out pretty
badly if it's 
not fixed. There are several other examples of the same
problem throughout 
the script. For someone like me (hate typing code, don't
mind debugging 
short scripts too much) this is still better than hand-keying
the 
thing from the start. Others may be less charitable...<P>

Anyway, if you are able to fix the files on uunet, let
me know and 
I'll get the corrected ones.<P>

By the way, the magazine is great! Both issues I've
seen have had 
very useful things in them. A density of one-useful-item-per-issue

is higher than most any other magazine I receive; yours
has been a 
good deal higher on each one so far. Keep 'em coming!<P>

<I>Thanks for the feedback. See the earlier letter for
the 
ftp information. I apologize for the code -- the new
lines do not 
appear in the magazine and since the files on uunet
are copies of 
the files used in the magazine, there seems to be no
rational explanation. 
We've fixed the uunet files now. Thanks for not flaming
over the inconvenience.
