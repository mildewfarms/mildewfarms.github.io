<H1>Questions and Answers</H1><p>
<P>
Bjorn Satdeva<P>

As usual, I start out with major events in the UNIX
system administration 
world. This time, however, so much has happened that
is of great significance 
in the daily lives of UNIX system administrators that
there is no 
space left for questions. With the next issue, however,
I return to 
answering questions as usual.<P>

During Summer USENIX, which took place in San Antonio,
Texas, from 
June 8 to 12, the USENIX Association made two announcements.
The first 
was that USENIX will now have Local Technical Groups
(LTCs) and Special 
Technical Groups (STGs), a goal that a number of people
have looked 
toward for quite some time. The second announcement,
however, is of 
much greater importance to all system administrators:
USENIX announced 
the launching of SAGE, the Systems Administrators' Guild,
as the first 
USENIX Special Technical Group. SAGE is devoted to the
advancement 
of Systems Administration as a profession. USENIX and
SAGE will work 
jointly to publish technical information and sponsor
conferences, 
workshops, tutorials, and local groups in the Systems
Administration 
field. Do you wonder what the `E' in SAGE stands for?
This `E' is 
the one Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie left off the
`creat' UNIX 
system call.<P>

An interim board was appointed by the USENIX Association
(see sidebar), 
and elections will be held later this year to elect
a new board, which 
will take office at the Winter USENIX conference in
San Diego in January, 
1993. Nominations for the SAGE board will be accepted
until the LISA 
(Large Installation Systems Administration) conference
in October.<P>

As I have been involved with the development of SAGE
from the very 
beginning, I can give you an overview of the events
which lead to 
its creation.<P>

The idea of a national professional society for systems
administrators 
was originally proposed during a BayLISA (The San Francisco
Bay Large 
Installation System Administration) board meeting in
January of 1992. 
It was immediately clear that such an organization would
be beyond 
the scope of BayLISA, which is a local organization.
Those of us who 
were interested therefore decided to start a series
of meetings completely 
separate from BayLISA.<P>

During this time, we contacted a number of organizations
for advice, 
including USENIX, who suggested that SAGE should become
a USENIX Special 
Technical Group. Since this proposal was beneficial
for both USENIX 
and SAGE, negotiations progressed rapidly, and USENIX
made the announcement 
in San Antonio.<P>

Since SAGE is still in its infancy, there remain many
questions concerning 
what the organization can do to improve the working
situation for 
system administrators. To debate these issues, a small
number of working 
groups have been created. In the end, each small working
group will 
put together a proposal to the SAGE Board, of possible
ways to pursue 
the work. (It is also possible that one or more of the
groups will 
report to the board that their charter topic is unrealistic
and should 
not be pursued any further.)<P>

Therefore, if you have strong opinions for or against
an item being 
debated by a small working group, you should join the
discussion. 
For the moment, all such discussion is done by e-mail
through a number 
of mailing lists set up for this purpose. To join a
group, simply 
send e-mail to listserv@usenix.org, with a body message
of 
&quot;help,&quot; and you will receive the necessary
information.<P>

If you feel that there is an additional topic that SAGE
should pursue, 
send e-mail to sage-board@usenix.org describing what
you think 
should be added, and why.<P>

At this time, membership in SAGE is not a prerequisite
to participation 
in a small working group. However, since SAGE is intended
to serve 
the system administration professional, membership is
something you 
should consider. Membership forms can be obtained from
the USENIX 
office (510 528-8649). The membership fee for the remainder
of 1992 
is $25 (which entitles you to a $25 rebate of the LISA
VI registration 
fee).<P>

Below is a list of the small working groups as they
exist on June 
25th. It is entirely possible that new groups will be
added, or existing 
groups will be split or joined together.<P>

<B>SAGE Working Groups</B><P>

<B>Publications</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Bryan McDonald
(bigmac@erg.sri.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-pubs@usenix.org<P>

The publications group puts together a series of proposals

related to the publications that SAGE wants to see established.
In 
the immediate future the group will be asked to assist
in the publication 
of the first issues of newsletter segments within login:.
Long-term 
goals include proposals for an independent newsletter,
a technical 
journal, software tool collections, and any other ideas
the committee 
can collect.<P>

<B>Electronic Information Distribution</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Mark Verber
(verber@parc.xerox.com)<P>

The electronic information distribution working group

will identify existing information sources that would
be of use to 
SAGE members and new types of information that should
be gathered/produced, 
and will make proposals for the effective distribution
of this information. 
Existing sources should include reprints of papers/articles
and mailing-list/USENET 
news archives. New information sources might include
specially written 
technical/positional papers and custom databases such
as vendor-neutral 
lists of bugs. Distribution methods will include WAIS
or other information 
servers, anonymous ftp/uucp, and CD-ROM.<P>

<B>Education</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Pat Wilson
(paw@northstar.dartmouth.edu)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-edu@usenix.org<P>

The education working group's initial goal is to outline

possible plans for institutional and continuing education
of the community 
through the development of model curricula, the identification
and 
promotion of useful tutorial programs, and the construction
of guides 
for self-study.<P>

<B>Certification</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Paul Moriarty
(pmm@cisco.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-certify@usenix.org<P>

The purpose of the certification working group is to

address the issues surrounding certification and discuss
the various 
approaches that might be taken. The working group will
present the 
model along with their recommendations to the board
of directors.<P>

<B>Job Descriptions</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Tina Darmohray (tmd@s1.gov)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-jobs@usenix.org<P>

The job description group will evaluate SAGE's role

in assisting system administrators in defining job descriptions.
If 
the group agrees that SAGE should pursue this topic,
the focus will 
be on creating multiple system administration job description
suites 
that can be used as templates for those who are writing
position descriptions 
for hiring purposes at their own site.<P>

<B>Awards</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: John Detke (jfd@octel.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-robbies@usenix.org<P>

The awards working group will focus on how SAGE can

best recognize outstanding system administrators and
their achievements. 
Initial suggestions include a &quot;Best of LISA&quot;
award and an 
annual outstanding sysadmin award.<P>

<B>Public Relations</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Paul Evans (ple@maspar.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-pr@usenix.org<P>

This committee will examine the role that SAGE, as 
a professional society, should play in representing
the profession 
to industry and/or government. The committee will examine
the issues, 
set guidelines to SAGE's involvement in this area, and
if appropriate, 
propose a plan for the guild to evaluate and pursue
(or not pursue). 
This group will also serve to direct any future public
relations issues 
that may arise.<P>

<B>Local Groups</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Bjorn Satdeva
(bjorn@sysadmin.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-locals@usenix.org<P>

This group will have the task of exploring how the 
creation of new local groups can be made easier, how
SAGE and USENIX 
can assist in their formation, and how SAGE can support
existing local 
groups.<P>

<B>Ethics</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Ed Gould
(ed@pa.dec.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-ethics@usenix.org<P>

This group is charged with determining SAGE's role 
in developing a set of guidelines or codes of ethics
for the system 
administrator. These guidelines or codes would have
at least two purposes, 
namely, guiding the administrator in the performance
of his/her system 
administration tasks, and informing the administrator's
employer and 
co-workers of the proper bounds of system administration.<P>

<B>Policies</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Lee Damon
(nomad@watson.ibm.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-policies@usenix.org<P>

The focus of the policies working group is the development

of one or more documents for system/network administrators
to use 
as guidelines or boilerplates in setting up site policies
and procedures. 
The group will also work with the education and ethics
working groups 
to help systems administrators understand what policies
are and why 
they can be important.<P>

<B>Vendors</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Terry Bartlett
(bartlett@rmtc.central.sun.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-vendors@usenix.org<P>

The vendors working group will evaluate SAGE's role

in establishing a consensus on the types of tools we'd
like vendors 
to provide for system and network administration. The
group may also 
act as a lobbying organization to convince the various
manufacturers 
to &quot;do the right thing&quot; when it comes to system
administration.<P>

<B>Standards</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Janet Frazer (janet@usl.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-stds@usenix.org<P>

The standards working group will evaluate whether (and,

if yes, how) SAGE might monitor and affect the various
standards bodies 
that are now or will in the future be setting standards
for system 
administration.<P>

<B>Non-UNIX</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: John Detke (jfd@octel.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-outreach@usenix.org<P>

The non-UNIX outreach working group will focus on how

SAGE can remain pertinent to people who manage computing
systems and 
networks, addressing the issues that cross operating
and network system 
boundaries.<P>

<B>Part-Time Admins</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair: Peg Schafer (peg@bbn.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-pt@usenix.org<P>

The part-time working group is concerned that the proposed

SAGE charter did not mention the large number of people
who administer 
systems on a less than full-time basis (e.g., there
are chemists who 
fulfill system administration roles some portion of
each working day; 
they view themselves as chemists, not system administrators).
The 
group will consider how SAGE could address the needs
of such individuals 
and suggest changes to the proposed SAGE charter which
address this 
&quot;dual-role&quot; reality.<P>

<B>Security</B><P>

Small Working Group Chair:
Laura de Leon (deleon@hpl.hp.com) and
Arnold de Leon (arnold@synopsys.com)<P>

E-mail Address: sage-security@usenix.org<P>

Security is a growing concern for system administrators.

This group will examine ways of helping system administrators
assess 
their security needs and policies and will investigate
ways of educating 
system administrators on security issues. The group
will consider 
soliciting or developing sample policies and tools in
this arena. <P>
