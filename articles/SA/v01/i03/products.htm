<B>Quantum Announces Major Update for QNX</B><P>

Quantum Software Systems, Ltd. has announced a major
update for QNX, 
its POSIX-compliant, real-time, distributed operating
system for Intel-based 
PCs. QNX 4.1 features greater functionality, Ethernet
support, network 
fault-tolerance, enhanced disk I/O, and improved real-time
performance. <P>

QNX 4.1 includes a dedicated Pipe Manager that can implement
high-speed 
pipes without the presence of a filesystem. In addition,
QNX 4.1 comes 
standard with a network-distributed make utility and
the VEDIT Programmer's 
Editor. The new release introduces FLEET networking
technology (Fault-tolerant, 
Load-balancing, Efficient, Extensible, and Transparent).
The Network 
Manager supports multiple networks (both Arcnet and
Ethernet) simultaneously, 
and will automatically reroute data from one network
to another in 
the event of hardware failure. The Network Manager will
also dynamically 
load balance data transmission. QNX 4.1 is based on
a microkernel 
architecture -- the microkernel occupies only 7Kb of
memory, and 
uses message passing for interprocess communication.

<B>UNIX International Finalizes System Management Requirements and Notes Desktop UNIX SVR4.2</B><P>

UNIX International (UI) noted UNIX System Laboratories'
launch of 
UNIX System V Release 4.2 (SVR4.2) and &quot;celebrated
the release 
of technology which fulfills UI's requirements for a
standardized 
UNIX System V desktop implementation.&quot; The requirements
for SVR4.2 
were provided to USL and the industry in May 1991, and
resulted from 
the efforts of UI's Desktop Work Group -- including
Apple, AT&amp;T, 
Fuji Xerox, ICL, Intel, Interactive, Motorola, NCR,
SCO, SPARC International, 
Unisoft, and USL. UI has designated 1992 as the &quot;Year
of the Desktop&quot; 
and plans to promote desktop implementations of UNIX
System V through 
programs for end users and Independent Software Vendors
(ISVs). <P>

UI has finalized its system and network management requirements
(which 
allow users to manage heterogeneous distributed networks
as a simple 
unified system), and announced that its approach will
be compatible 
and interoperable with the Open Software Foundation's
(OSF) Distributed 
Management Environment. UI plans to provide early access
through USL 
to an object-oriented framework for distributed system
and network 
management. The framework, outlined in UI's 1992 Roadmap
for System 
V and Related Technologies, and integrated by USL, is
expected to 
be generally available in early 1993. The requirements
call for an 
object-oriented framework that supports applications
including network 
management, printer service and management, backup,
archive and restore, 
and user and group management; and, eventually, storage
device management, 
software installation and distribution, system initialization
and 
shutdown, and license management. <P>
