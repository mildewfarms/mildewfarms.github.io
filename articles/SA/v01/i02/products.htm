these features 
and adds features compatible with UNIX systems: data
compression and 
verification, prevention of accidental overwrite, full
TCP/IP support,

automatic backup 
scheduling (weekly, monthly, daily, specific days, etc.),
and provisions

eight years. Data 
General purchased the product and distributes it as

<B>Sixth USENIX Systems Administration Conference</B><P>

The 6th annual USENIX Systems Administration Conference
(LISA) will 
be held October 19-23 at the Sheraton Hotel, Long Beach,
CA. The only 
conference which specifically provides a forum for system
administrators, 
LISA has historically targeted large system, but this
year the scope 
is extended to include system administrators from all
UNIX sites. 
The first two days include a dual-track tutorial program
that addresses 
both introductory and advanced system administration.
A three-day 
technical conference follows the tutorials.<P>

The program committee plans to include papers which
&quot;provide freely 
available or fully described solutions to existing problems&quot;
and, 
&quot;in some way, advance the state of the art.&quot;
Planned topics 
include: tools for real-time system troubleshooting,
remote/off-site 
system administration, distributed system administration,
network 
growth and performance management, system security monitoring,
heterogeneous 
system administration, and system archiving and backups.
The conference 
proceedings will be distributed to attendees and also
will be available 
after the conference from the USENIX Association.<P>

In addition to tutorials and regular technical sessions,
the program 
may include special panels, work-in-progress reports,
birds-of-a-feather 
(BOF) sessions, and invited talks. For information contact
