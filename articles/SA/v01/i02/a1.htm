<H1>Joining USENET</H1><p>
<P>
Sydney Weinstein<P>

If you follow my column in The C Users Journal, &quot;On
the 
Networks,&quot; you have seen there is a vast amount
of useful software 
available via USENET. In addition, exchanging electronic
mail is an 
inexpensive and reliable method of staying in touch
with a large number 
of contacts. As an added bonus, there are several mailing
lists just 
for Systems Administrators. Since you are administering
a UNIX system, 
you have the software needed (UUCP) to connect to USENET.
So, how 
do you join?<P>

USENET is just a cooperative network of connected computers.
UUCP 
is one common connection method. To connect to USENET
via UUCP, all 
you need to do is find a site that is already a member
of USENET and 
is willing to provide you with a connection. What they
do is allow 
you to call their system, and/or have their system call
your system, 
via UUCP to exchange electronic mail and perhaps USENET
Network News.<P>

The problem is finding a site that is already a member
of USENET and 
is not overburdened with other connections. The solution
to this problem 
is either perseverance or money.<P>

<B>Perseverance</B><P>

In the beginning, USENET was a purely volunteer, cooperative
network. 
Each site agreed to carry the traffic of its neighbors.
As the net 
expanded, this got to be overwhelming. However, at the
&quot;leaves&quot; 
(sites near the end of the tree that don't have many
other connections), 
there still can be found sites that are willing to provide
a connection 
for free. How free that really is depends on several
factors. The 
site itself may not charge you anything, but you might
have to pay 
a phone company toll call charge to reach it.<P>

The first place to look is via the published maps of
existing UUCP 
sites. Most UUCP sites register their connections with
the UUCP Mapping 
Project, which then publishes the maps in the USENET
news group comp.mail.maps. 
This allows the pathalias program to be used to automatically

compute the path from your site to any other site, and
for other sites 
to figure the path from their site to your site. This
routing information 
is used by the electronic mail system on USENET sites.
Map entries 
contain a lot of information beyond just the site connections.
In 
Listing 1 is a copy of the map information for my system,
dsinc. 
The map entry contains two sections. The first is comment
information 
in a special format. These comments contain all the
information about 
the site for human use. The second part is the connection
information, 
which is in the format for pathalias to use. Of particular

interest are two fields: #C, the contact person for
the site, 
and #T, their telephone number.<P>

If you acquire the map file(s) for your state, you can
search them 
for sites that are local phone calls from your site.
Then perhaps 
one of those site administrators will be willing to
provide a connection 
for your site. If you are only looking for electronic
mail, then any 
site will work. If, however, you also want USENET Network
News, then 
only call those sites with a #U entry. Those sites exchange

USENET Network news, and the names listed on those lines
are the sites 
with which they exchange news.<P>

If you are not connected to USENET, it might seem difficult
to obtain 
the map entry. UUNET Communication Services comes to
the rescue on 
this front. They provide a pay-per-call access to their
storehouse 
of archived files via a 1-900 number. They keep the
current map files 
as published in comp.mail.maps in their archives. Using
UUCP, 
at $.50/minute, you can retrieve the map file(s) for
your state and 
start calling those site contacts. The map files are
broken down by 
state, and reside in the ~/uumap directory. For the
US files 
the names are u.usa.ST.n, where ST is the two-letter

postal abbreviation for the state and n is a number
starting 
at 1 and running upwards by 1. Each map file is, at
most, approximately 
50Kb. Listing 2 gives a sample L.sys/Systems file entry
for 
connecting to UUNET via the 1-900 number. The UUCP command:<P>
<PRE>
uucp 'uunet:~/uumap/u.usa.pa.*' ~</pre><p>
<p>
will transfer all of the Pennsylvania map files from

UUNET to the uucppublic directory of your system.<P>

<B>Money</B><P>

If you cannot find a site willing to provide a connection
for free, 
or if you want faster service or a larger USENET Network
News feed 
than other sites are willing to provide, consider one
of the many 
services that sell UUCP services for a fee.<P>

The largest of these is UUNET Communications Services,
mentioned earlier. 
This service runs a large data center in Virginia and
provides around-the-clock 
connections, access to their large archive of files,
and as large 
a news feed as you are willing to pay for. UUNET charges
can range 
from about $25/month for a very lightly used electronic
mail connection 
to several hundred dollars a month for a large USENET
feed. They charge 
by the hour, with the lowest hourly charge for calling
Virginia directly, 
a slightly higher charge for access via a packet switched
network 
(but that gives you a local call), and higher still
if you use their 
800 number (but this might still be cheaper than calling
them on your 
own account). Transmission rates can vary, but customers
report that 
600-800cps using Telebit PEP modems is typical. UUNET
can be reached 
at (703) 204-8000.<P>

A smaller national vendor, Performance Systems International,
Inc. 
of Troy, New York, runs their own packet switched network
and offers 
competitive rates, but a limited number of cities with
local phone 
numbers. They offer a flat rate per month for a UUCP
connection, with 
the restriction that your site does not feed any other
sites (for 
a somewhat higher fee, they will waive that restriction).
Performance 
Systems International can be reached at (518) 283-8860.<P>

A number of small companies offer connections regionally.
Datacomp 
Systems, Inc. is one of those, and we can be reached
at (215) 947-9900. 
If you are in the western part of the US, another regional
company 
is Portal Communications Company (408) 973-9111.<P>

<B>Spread the Word</B><P>

Once connected, it is wise to register your system with
the UUCP Mapping 
Project. This helps to ensure that mail will reach your
site and also 
reserves your site's UUCP name to prevent conflicts.
Registration 
does impose at least one constraint, however: the UUCP
system name 
you choose for your site must also be unique within
the maps, and, 
as many have lamented, all the good ones are taken.<P>

To register your site, you send a mail message to rutgers!uucpmap

(or uucpmap@rutgers.edu) containing information in the
format 
shown in Listing 1. The lines should appear in the order
shown in 
the listing, but you do not need to include lines that
do not apply.<P>

The first line, #N, is the name of your site. If you
do not 
have a registered domain name with the NIC, just include
the UUCP 
name of your site on this line. If you do have a registered
domain 
name with the NIC, list the FQDN of the Internet site
that 
is acting as your MX forwarder on the #F line. On the
#S 
line list the type of system and operating system software
you are 
running.<P>

The #O through #P lines identify yourself/company. The

#O line is the Organization (or Owner) of the system.
#C 
is the contact person(s) name(s). #E is the electronic
mail 
address for the person listed in #C and is usually just
site!postmaster. 
#T is the telephone number of the contact person. Note
the 
format. Telephone numbers are listed as a &quot;+&quot;
followed by 
the country code, and then the number (the country code
for North 
America is 1). The postal address makes up the #P line.<P>

The #L line is special and is used by automatic mapping
software 
to produce maps showing the locations of USENET sites.
It contains 
the latitude and longitude of your site in hours, minutes,
seconds 
format. If you do not know the values for the location
of your site, 
you can list the values for a nearby city and place
the word &quot;(city)&quot; 
after the values.<P>

Any remarks are listed on the #R lines. Try to keep
them short 
as the maps are distributed and stored on a large number
of systems. 
All USENET Network News feeds are listed on the #U lines.
The 
last line, the #W line, is the person who filed the
entry and 
the date of the entry.<P>

What follows is connection information for pathalias.
First 
any aliases for your site are listed as:<P>
<PRE>
site= alias</pre><p>
<p>
Then the other sites your site communicates with via

UUCP are listed, along with their connection frequency.
Valid frequencies 
are in Listing 3 along with their relative weightings.
These frequencies 
are used to build the paths used by the routing software.<P>

<B>In Summary</B><P>

There is a lot out there on USENET. If you administer
a UNIX system 
it will be worth the trouble to find a site and connect
up. Many sites 
even think it's worth paying for. I am looking forward
to meeting 
you, &quot;On the Networks.&quot; <P>
