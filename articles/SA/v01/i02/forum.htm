<H1>Publisher's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
For something over a year, Karen and Bruce Hunter have
been producing
a small journal named root, also designed to address
the needs of
system administrators. Many of you will recognize the
Hunters as authors
of UNIX Systems: Advanced Administration and Management
Handbook
(MacMillan: 1991). Bruce also coauthored the best selling
Hayden title
UNIX Sytem Administration.<P>

For various reasons (not the least of which is that
they would like to
focus more on writing and less on publishing and business
management),
Bruce and Karen decided to sell root. I'm pleased to
announce that they
chose to allow us to combine it with SysAdmin. Thus,
beginning with this
issue we welcome a new contingent of readers and authors
to the pages of
SysAdmin. I'm excited to have these new readers and
potential contributors
and hope that they will find SysAdmin a worthy successor.<P>

I think you'll find that the fruits of this union are
quite readily visible in
this issue. Of course Bruce Hunter's column is here.
(In anticipation of the
merger, Bruce also wrote a piece for our premier issue.)
Three other root
regulars also appear in this issue. Bjorn Satdeva contributes
his expertise in
a very informative question and answer column and Elizabeth
Zinkann
shares her experience with related books in her book
review column. Larry
Reznick, root's C specialist, delivers a handy C qualifier
for a UNIX utility.<P>

Welcome root readers and contributors, we're please
we can be of service.<P>

Before I close, I would like to thank all our readers
for their kind words
of encouragement and appreciation. The reaction to our
premier issue has
been extremely gratifying and encouraging. For me nothing
satisfies better
than producing something that others find useful. Keep
letting us know when we're
on target and when we miss the mark.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>
Robert Ward<br>
