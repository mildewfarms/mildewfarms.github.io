<B>Tivoli Upgrades Management Environment</B><P>

Tivoli Systems has upgraded its Management Environment
software. Tivoli 
Management Environment Release 1.6 includes configuration,
change 
automation, and scheduling services. With the configuration
definition 
database, system managers can develop and store &quot;templates&quot;

of key configuration information. Templates eliminate
the need to 
recreate configuration information each time a change
is required. 
The configuration definition database helps centralize
control for 
large networks of clients and servers. Using the change
automation 
service and configuration templates, system administrators
can, in 
a few steps, make consistent changes to large numbers
of workstations. 
Managers select a template, identify the target workstation,
and apply 
the template. The template updates the target resources
with the new 
configuration information. The scheduling service gives
managers control 
over the timing of changes.<P>

Another feature of Tivoli Management Environment Release
1.6 is Tivoli/FSM, 
which manages UNIX client/server file sharing mechanisms.
Tivoli/FMS 
supports a graphical interface, and automates the various
tasks required 
to maintain file systems. Systems managers can group
related sets 
of workstations and manipulate their network file system
configurations 
as a single unit; define the files and directories they
want to make 
available, and export them to the network and designated
workstations; 
make changes in file systems and propagate them throughout
the network, 
eliminating inconsistent file sharing relationships
and failures of 
key servers.<P>

Release 1.6 also includes tools for basic configuration
management, 
software distribution, and remote systems monitoring,
as well as toolkits 
for customizing Tivoli applications and building compatible
applications.

<B>Solbourne Enhances AOA Server Offering</B><P>

Solbourne Computer, Inc. has announced two products,
PerfMon and X.25, 
which support the Application Optimized Architecture
(AOA). PerfMon 
is a networked, client/server-based systems management
package which 
recognizes, diagnoses, and optimizes a range of system
performance 
metrics such as symmetric multiprocessing. X.25 is a
data communications 
option supporting connectivity to public or private
packet-switched 
data networks (PSDNs). PerfMon consists of a &quot;Statistics
Gatherer&quot; 
and a &quot;Viewer.&quot; A Gatherer is installed on
each server and 
probes the kernel to collect performance data. The Viewer
is the graphical 
user interface (GUI) used to display the information.
The components 
can be licensed separately and installed on Solbourne
systems throughout 
a network. Statistics gathered from multiple systems
can be displayed 
simultaneously on a single graphics display, with output
as text, 
gauges, line charts, or bar charts.<P>

In addition to standard kernel, disk, and processor
monitoring functions, 
PerfMon allows for customer-defined, installation-specific
monitoring. 
Other features include user-defined triggers which alert
only on an 
exception basis; logging of statistics to the disk with
playback at 
any time; and analyzing of results by spreadsheet or
other display, 
reporting, or analysis programs.<P>

Solbourne's X.25 data communications option meets CCITT
standards 
for interoperablity and certification. X.25's controller
board and 
outboard software combination lets users configure Solbourne
servers 
as X.25 hosts, so terminal users throughout the network
can access 
the data and applications residing on these hosts. Also
the Network 
Service Interface lets programmers write client/server
programs.<P>

PerfMon is priced at $4,880 for a complete initial client/server
license. 
Each additional license is priced at $1,080. X.25 is
priced at $8,000.

<B>IXI Announces Panorama and Motif Developer's Kit</B><P>

IXI Corporation has announced IXI Panorama, an extension
for the standard 
OSF/Motif Window Manager which provides a virtual workspace
facility.<P>

For users who have screens crowded with overlapping
windows, or who 
have to iconify running programs for additional screen
space, Panorama 
supports panning around the virtual screen, bringing
new workspaces 
into view. Features include the ability to split up
screens, a &quot;sticky 
window&quot; facility so windows can be glued to the
front or back 
screen and move with the user, and the ability to support
more than 
100 windows in the virtual workspace.<P>

IXI Panorama is a Motif-compliant application, and by
using the standard 
Motif Window Manager resource names and files, Panorama
behaves like 
the standard Motif Window manager. Users can switch
to basic Motif 
Window Manager mode while running IXI Panorama. IXI
Panorama can also 
communicate with IXI's X.desktop. For example, icons
can be placed 
on the virtual screen and moved around the workspace
like windows 
containing running programs. IXI Panorama will initially
ship on Sun 
SPARC workstations and the company plans to ship on
RISC and Intel 
platforms by the end of the year. <P>

IXI also announced an agreement to supply SunSoft developers
with 
OSF/Motif windowing technology. The agreement lets SunSoft
developers 
comply with the Common Open Software Environment (COSE),
which specifies 
Motif as its toolkit for graphical application development.
Under 
the terms of the agreement, SunSoft will make the Motif
Developer's 
Kit from IXI available for Solaris SPARC platforms.
According to IXI, 
SunSoft will issue the Developer's Kit for Solaris Intel
x86 platforms 
later this year. In addition, SunSoft intends to incorporate
IXI's 
OSF/Motif technology in the graphical user interface
in the next release 
of the Solaris operating system for both SPARC and Intel
platforms.
