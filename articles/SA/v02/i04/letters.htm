Subject: inline SQL with isql (again) :-)<br>
To: leor@bdsoft.com<P>

Hi Leor,<br>

A friend recently brought to my attention that the mail
I sent to 
you previously about how to do in-line SQL with Informix's
isql program 
was published in the latest release of _SysAdmin_ (Vol.
2, No. 2).<P>

Well, looks like the typesetting has a few bugs to be
worked out over 
there. :-)  In the article on pg. 110 it shows the following
line:<P>
<PRE>
isql phone - &lt; EOF 2&amp;1 | more</pre><p>
<p>
Actually it should read:<P>
<PRE>
isql phone - &lt;&lt; EOF 2&gt;&amp;1 | more</pre><p>
<p>
Could you ensure that something gets sent out in the

next issue showing the line as it should read?<P>

Thanks.<br>

Michael Faurot<P>

<I>Leor responds: Thanks for writing. Ventura sometimes
does 
this to us.</I><P>

Hi, I just picked up a copy of Sys Admin yesterday,
and have some 
comments (mostly nits to pick) Larry Reznick's article.<P>

First, a nit to pick... in the sidebar on '[' vs 'test',
I thought 
it kind of odd that the article stated that the two
were linked. While 
it's true that older versions of the Bourne Shell had
test as a separate 
program, _all_ modern implementations have it as a built-in,
so it 
would have been better just to say that they are synonyms.<P>

The other nits I have have to do with the 'which' script.<P>

The first and most obvious problem with this script
to me is that 
it bothers to convert the ':'s to ' 's, when the IFS
variable could 
do the job even better. Not only that, but it is _possible_
that one 
of the directory names could contain a ' ', making the
script incorrect.<P>

The other one is that I'm appalled each time I see something
like<P>
<PRE>
if [ &quot;x$1&quot; = &quot;x&quot; ]</pre><p>
<p>
This is _much_ easier to understand as either<P>
<PRE>
if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ]</pre><p>
<p>
or even<P>
<PRE>
if [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;&quot; ]</pre><p>
<p>
Well, at least the script didn't use<P>
<PRE>
if [ x$1 = x ]</pre><p>
<p>
which I've seen all to often.<P>

In this case, there's also the problem of the script
aborting early 
if one of the arguments is blank.<P>

For instance, in the case of<P>
<PRE>
which '' id</pre><p>
<p>
id will never be gotton to because the program does
tries 
to find the last argument by noting that it's ''. Using
$# is clearly 
the right way to go.<P>

Finally, the program merely checks that the files it's
looking at 
are executable, but doesn't check that they might be
executable directories.<P>

My revised version is below.<P>

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
#
# which
#
# based on which by Lawrence S Reznick (Copyright 1990) as printed in
# SysAdmin magazine.
# revised by Christopher J. Calabrese (cjc@ulysses.att.com)

if [ $# = 0 ]
then    echo &quot;usage:\t$0 program [program] ...&quot;
exit 1
fi

dirs=`echo $PATH | sed '
s/^:/\.:/
s/:$/:\./
s/::/:\;:/'`

unset notfound

while [ $# != 0 ]
do      unset found

oIFS=&quot;$IFS&quot;
IFS=&quot;:&quot;
for dir in $dirs
do      if [ -x &quot;$dir/$1&quot; -a ! -d &quot;$dir/$1&quot; ]
then    echo &quot;$dir/$1&quot;
found=true
break
fi
done

if [ -z &quot;$found&quot; ]
then    notfound=&quot;$notfound $1&quot;
fi

shift
done

if [ -n &quot;$notfound&quot; ]
then    echo &quot;No $notfound in &quot; `echo $dirs | sed 's/:/ /g'`
fi</pre><p>
<p>
Christopher Calabrese<br>

<I>Larry Reznick responds: Thanks for writing. I like your

version of the code.<p>

There are versions of test internal to sh, csh, &amp;
ksh, all 
with essentially the same test features, but with differing
syntax. 
I have also seen [ as a hard link to the external test
program. To 
give you an idea of how varied this can be just on two
systems, on 
SCO SVR3.2v4, there are two unlinked files for [ and
test. Each is 
a Bourne shell script that manually starts the internal
test program 
named for the script. On Esix SVR4 there is no [, and
test is a Bourne 
shell script invoking the internal test program. But,
it invokes it 
by using `basename $0`, so if a [ hard link was there,
it would use 
the internal test or [ synonyms according to the name
used to execute 
it. I imagine that the external test program still hangs
around to 
support old scripts that want it that way. I've seen
it implemented 
too many different ways. The sidebar mentions one way
I've seen it 
that takes up the least space yet still has the external
program.<P>

Your IFS solution is more elegant for the loop, but
I notice 
that you still need to convert the colons to spaces
for the error 
message. While you have deferred the conversion until
it can't be 
avoided, which is commendable for efficiency, you still
have to launch 
sed to do it. I decided to just launch sed and get everything
over 
with at once. (I noticed you have a semicolon typo in
the third sed 
expression. It should be a period.) As for directory
names containing 
a space, that sin is not easy to commit by the average
user. If I 
ever saw that actually happen, I'd track down the owner,
find out 
why and what depends on it, and rename the offending
directory as 
soon as I can. By the way, you don't need to store the
oIFS since 
the IFS change won't affect scripts that aren't children
to the which 
program. Notice that you don't restore from oIFS.<P>

Your other comments are correct. The test techniques
were 
holdovers from a very old version of this script when
I knew less 
and was probably in an unreasonable hurry. I neglected
to update them 
when I rewrote this for SCO. Not checking for directories
with the 
executable bit set was an important oversight pointed
out by another 
reader. I plead only that the dirs in my path haven't
had executable 
directories with the same name as the program I was
looking for, so 
I never caught the problem. Thanks for your version
of the code. --lsr</I><P>



Sys Admin staff,<br>

I recently bought 2 Wyse 150 terminals in order to use
the multi-screen 
facility. I am presently using &quot;Symulprint&quot;
from Arnet Corp. 
The problem is that it is not multi-tasking. When you
are processing 
a job on one screen and try to switch over to the other
one, the processing 
stops. I called Wyse Technologies and they said that
this was Arnet's 
problem. I called Arnet and they do not offer a solution.
They said 
that since the programs write to the screen they must
have the screen 
in order to process. Well, this just makes it impossible
to have multi-tasking. 
Maybe someone has written an article to write to file
and delete the 
&quot;processed file&quot; at the end od the day.<P>

I would appreciate your help as I have two brand new
terminals and 
cannot use them for multitasking.<P>

Joe Cao<br>
Data Manager<br>
Pronto Cargo Corp<P>

<I>Contributor Larry Reznick responds: SCO provides multiscreen

for the console, and mscreen for serial lines. Esix
supports virtual 
terminals only on the console. SVR4 doesn't support
virtual terminals 
at all. Therefore, I don't believe the problem has anything
to do 
with Wyse. It must be related to the particular implementation
you're 
using.<P>

I'm not familiar with the Arnet software. The virtual
terminals 
I've set up require respawn entries in the /etc/inittab
for the virtual 
terminals. The entries put a getty on each virtual terminal
device 
entry I want to enable. Furthermore, the kernel may
need to be remade 
to support them. A total-used count is given to the
appropriate device 
drivers. Once the virtual terminals are set up, I've
never had a problem 
with switching between screens. Tasks left in other
screens continue 
to run, including output on the switched-out screen.
Switch back to 
that screen and it looks exactly as if you'd never switched
it out. 
If Arnet's implementation requires the output screen
to be active, 
they've effectively eliminated the usefulness of multiscreens.<P>

If you can't get Arnet's multiscreens working properly,

you could have a script run the program that creates
the output file, 
then enqueues an &quot;at&quot; job that will kill the
file at some 
later time. --Larry</I><P>

I recently received my first issue, and it looks to
be worth its weight 
in 486 chips. The Publisher's Forum note say that this
is an anniversary 
issue. That means there are 6 issues of it I haven't
seen yet. Where 
can I get them, and what will they cost me?<P>

David<br>

<I>Back issues are available for 1.3 (Sept/Oct '92), 1.4
(Nov./Dec. 
'92), and 2.2 (March/April '93). They can be ordered
from R&amp;D at a 
cost of $11.00 per issue (US).</I><P>



From: Chris Hare &lt;unilabs.org!chare@uunet.uu.net&gt;<br>
Subject: SCO UNIX Version Numbering<P>

Dear Robert:<br>

I just happened to be home sick today when my copy of
this month's 
Sys Admin arrived. After I read your column, I felt
that as 
the Technical Services Manager for one of SCO's largest
Canadian Advanced 
Product Centers, I needed to explain the version numbering
scheme.<P>

The current release of SCO UNIX is release 3.2 Version
4, not 4.2. 
Yes, you are correct that it is still based upon version
3.2, which 
is the first USL release which was meant to incorporate
binary compatibility 
between Intel UNIX versions.<P>

The Version 4 is SCO's attempt to show the lifeline
of the product. 
It initially started as 3.2, and then 3.2 Version 2,
and now Version 
4.<P>

The reasoning behind this is simple. When you look at
SCO's product 
line right now, they have integrated UNIX, Security,
Multiprocessing 
Extensions, X windows and the Desktop, and Networking.
In fact, SCO 
has been doing Multiprocessor UNIX on Intel platforms
longer than 
anyone else, and their latest MPX software provides
for true symmetrical 
multiprocessing.<P>

At the time Release 4.0 was announced from USL, there
was a separate 
source code tree for each of these which would have
to have been re-integrated 
by SCO. Their thought at the time, rightly or wrongly,
was to stay 
with the 3.2 release until USL had integrated all of
these components.<P>

You are quite correct that the version numbering has
confused a lot 
of people, but then it is all marketing. Take a look
at how many people 
will be buying Windows NT when it hits the streets,
and no one has 
seen it yet! This is true for Release 4.0. So much effort
was put 
into the marketing, that people were persuaded to get
it even before 
it was a product. <P>

We all have to remember that USL desgins technology,
not products. 
Those are for the vendors like SCO to assemble from
USL based technology.<P>

In addition, Veritas does have volume management software
for SCO 
UNIX, and we have put some of it into some customer
sites, most notably 
at Bell Cellular, which is one of the Cellular telephone
networks 
here in Canada. They are using SCO UNIX and Veritas
for voice-mail 
storage, call-record storage, communications with the
mainframe where 
the costing routines are run, and the actual cell switches.<P>

I would be happy to send you a copy of the information
which I have 
on it.<P>

Finally, congratulations on your anniversary. I feel
proud to be associated 
with your organization, both as a subscriber, and an
author. Keep 
up the good work!<P>

<B>A Few Descriptions</B><P>

<B>sage-certify</B><P>

Welcome to the SAGE certification working group.<P>

The purpose of the certification working group is to
develop a model 
for the certification of system administrators.  The
model will address 
the issues surrounding certification and discuss the
various approaches 
that might be taken. The working group will present
the model along 
with their recommendations to the board of directors.<P>

<B>sage-conf</B><P>

Welcome to the Sage-Conferences discussion list. This
mailing list 
is for the SAGE members (or potential members) who are
interested 
in conferences and workshops to be run by or in association
with SAGE.<P>

<B>sage-edu</B><P>

The Education working group's initial goal is to outline
SAGE's plan 
for institutional and continuing education of the community
through 
the development of model curricula, the identification
and promotion 
of useful tutorial programs, and the construction of
guides for self-study.<P>

<B>sage-ethics</B><P>

This group is charged with determining SAGE's role in
developing a 
set of guidelines or codes of ethics for the system
administrator. 
We see these guidelines or codes as having at least
two purposes, 
namely, guiding one's self in the performance of system
administration 
tasks, and informing one's employer and co-workers of
the proper bounds 
of system administration.<P>

<B>sage-jobs</B><P>

Welcome to the SAGE Job Descriptions Working group!<P>

The job description group will evaluate SAGE's role
in assisting system 
administrators with defining job descriptions. If it
is determined 
that this is an area that SAGE should pursue, the focus
of the group 
will be to create multiple system administration job
description suites 
that can be used as templates for those who are writing
position descriptions 
for hiring purposes at their own site.<P>

<B>info sage-locals</B><P>

Welcome to sage-locals.<P>

Users can be friend of the system administrator, but
will never be 
able to be a peer. Therefore many system administrators
are working 
without contact to their peers. SAGE local groups is
intended to give 
system administrators to meet on a regular basis.<P>

The purpose sage-local small working group is to define
relation ship 
between local groups and SAGE. As SAGE is a USENIX STG,
this will 
include relationship to USENIX.<P>

The group will also have the task of explore how creation
of new local 
groups can be made easier, and how SAGE can support
existing local 
groups, like Bay-LISA and BackBayLisa.<P>

<B>sage-managers</B><P>

Welcome to the sage-managers mailing list!<P>

While the complete new-subscribers information is currently
under 
construction -this brief is available.<P>

Sage-managers mail list was put together to provide
a forum for those 
people wishing to address the issues of systems administration
and 
managin or being managed thereto.<P>

This includes, but is not limited to (in true management
wording fashion): 
how to provide the right kind of supporting information
to management; 
how to explain systems administration so as to get what
you need and 
not bore your boss; can someone talk to my manager and
explain to 
him whatinhell is going on . . . and others.<P>

All the details of what this means or what we-all have
energy for 
have not been hammered out. I will have a one-liner
(or thereabouts) 
charter in place after Turkey day. Then we can free
for all.<P>

<B>sage-online</B><P>

The electronic information distribution working group
will identify 
existing information sources that would be of use to
SAGE members, 
new types of information that should be gathered/produced,
and make 
proposals for the effective distribution of this information.
Existing 
sources should include reprints of papers/articles and
mailing-list/USENET 
news archives. New information sources might include
specially written 
technical/positional papers and custom databases such
as vendor neutral 
list of bugs. Distribution methods will include WAIS
or other information 
servers, anonymous ftp/uucp, and CDrom.<P>

<B>sage-outreach</B><P>

This mailing list is for discussions pertaining to the
sage-outreach 
working group. This group will make a proposal to the
SAGE board on 
how SAGE can address the needs of system administrators
who deal with 
heterogeneous environments, which include systems running
many different 
OS's. Additional items may include how SAGE can best
contact these 
people, who may not be plugged into the traditional
UNIX(tm) oriented 
communication channels.<P>

<B>sage-pt</B><P>

The Part Time working group is concerned that the proposed
SAGE charter 
did not mention the large number of people who do system
administration 
less than 100% of the time. (e.g. There are chemists
who fulfill system 
administration roles some portion of each working day.
Yet, view themselves 
as chemists, not system administrators. Hence, part
time system administration.) 
We will consider how SAGE could address the needs of
such individuals 
and propose changes to the proposed SAGE charter which
addresses this 
&quot;dual-role&quot; reality.<P>

<B>sage-pubs</B><P>

The publications group is chartered to put together
a series of proposals 
related to the various publications that SAGE wants
established. In 
the immediate future the pubs group will be asked to
assist in the 
publication of the first issues of newsletter segments
within &quot;login:&quot;. 
Long term goals include proposals concerning an independent
newsletter, 
a technical journal, software tool collections, and
any other ideas 
the committee can collect.<P>

<B>sage-stds</B><P>

This is the USENIX SAGE Standards Working Group mail
reflector (sage-stds).<P>

The purpose of sage-stds is to provide a forum for discussion
about 
system management standards in the following areas:<P>

Communication: Provide a central point of contact for
information 
regarding system management standardization efforts.<P>

Education: Educate system administrators about the standards
process 
in general. What can active administrators do to progress
standards.<P>

Participation: Provide a conduit for the solicitation
of input from 
active system administrators. Most standards participants
represent 
OEMs. More input from active system administrators is
needed. 		 Summaries 
will be posted to the mailing list of the IEEE POSIX
activities, OSF 
ManSig activities, UI SMWG activities, as well as X/Open
and NM Forum 
activities as they are publicized. If you would like
to sign-up as 
the &quot;official&quot; reporter for a standards working
group, please 
post to sage-stds@usenix.org, and we'll sign you up.<P>

<B>sage-vendors</B><P>

Welcome to SAGE vendors working group! The purpose of
this list is 
to discuss ways in which we, the members of the system
administration 
community, can encourage vendors to recognize the importance
of system 
administration and the need to develop tools to facilitate
this. Often 
times a single vendors' &quot;solution&quot; to system
administration 
has no application in the real world, where many of
us employ the 
hardware and software of several different companies.
It is hoped 
that SAGE can provide sufficient leverage to get vendors
to provide 
real world solutions that we would actually want and
could actually 
use.<P>

Initially the purpose of the list will be to discuss
the feasibility 
of this course of action, and make a recommendation
to the SAGE board. 
The board will then decide whether or not to pursue
any sort of interaction 
with hardware and software vendors. However, the list
is not limited 
to the purposes stated above, or to my personal view
of what the vendor 
group should focus upon. You, as a member of the group,
have a great 
deal of say in the matter. If the members of the list
feel the group 
should take a different direction, that's what the group
will do, 
provided it remains within the scope of our charter.
