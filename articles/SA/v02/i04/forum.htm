<H1>Publisher's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
If you are like many of our readers, one of the first
things 
you'll turn to is our New Messages section, where your
peers write 
about problems they've solved, problems they haven't
solved, improvements 
they've made to source code from the magazine, corrections
or amendments 
to other magazine materials, and, generally, items of
interest to 
all of us. This month's edition is particularly interesting:
along 
with a discussion of code from one of Larry Reznick's
articles, you'll 
find a message from Chris Hare (one of our regular contributors)
explaining 
SCO's version numbering system; a request for help from
one of our 
readers; a correction to code published in an earlier
issue; and a 
long message from Randy Holt with information about
the USENIX System 
Administrators Guild (SAGE) and its mailing lists. What
you won't 
find is the &quot;flaming&quot; that characterizes the
letters columns 
of some computing magazines.<P>

We have a theory about this: we think System Administrators

may be a different breed -- more patient, less convinced
that they 
know all the answers, more open to hearing from others
about how they've 
done it. These qualities are also evident in the letters
we don't 
publish -- letters that accompany subscription or information
requests, 
email that requests Author Guidelines, and so forth.
The tone is pretty 
much uniformly cordial and appreciative of what Sys
Admin is 
trying to do. <P>

All of which spurs us on to try harder: so some of you
will 
be receiving questionnaires, asking about what we can
do to become 
more useful to you. We'll also be developing an editorial
calendar 
for 1994 (yes, it'll be here before you know it!). You
may have noticed 
that one or two of our issues have presented several
articles on a 
particular subject, the subject identified on the spine.
Once we have 
the survey results in hand, we'll identify the subjects
you're most 
interested in and target particular 1994 issues to those
topics.<P>

Though it may not show up on the questionnaire, we're
curious 
about what role you think Windows NT may eventually
play in your universe. 
The trade magazines seem to run alternate headlines
-- &quot;UNIX 
World Running Scared&quot; and &quot;UNIX Vendors Talking
with Microsoft&quot; 
-- but that's coming from the corporate level. We'd
like to hear 
the view from the trenches.<P>

So, keep writing to us -- and if you haven't written,
but 
feel prompted to do so by this month's issue, get started.
You'll 
have a hand in shaping the magazine.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Robert Ward<br>
