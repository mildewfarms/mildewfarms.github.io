<H1>Publisher's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
This month's issue represents one of our more successful
efforts 
at presenting a group of articles on a particular subject.
The theme 
for the issue was originally &quot;Filesystems: Tuning,
Maintenance, 
and Backup&quot;: as it happened, we had a bumper crop
of articles 
concerning backups, so you'll find here just about all
you could want 
to know on that topic (not really, of course, but there
is a great 
deal of useful information). To help trigger your writing
instincts, 
here's our editorial calendar for 1994:<P>

<B>3.1 (January/February) -- Communications</B>
Proposals due: 1 October 1993
Manuscripts due: 	1 November 1993<P>

<B>3.2 (March/April) -- Performance/Kernel Tuning</B>
Proposals due 1: December 1993
Manuscripts due: 	1 January 1994<P>

<B>3.3 (May/June) -- Connectivity</B>
Proposals due: 1 February 1994
Manuscripts due: 	1 March 1994<P>

<B>3.4 (July/August) -- File System Maintenance</B>
Proposals due: 1 April 1994
Manuscripts due: 	1 May 1994<P>

<B>3.5 (September/October) -- X Window Configuration and Management</B>
Proposals due: 1 June 1994
Manuscripts due: 	1 July 1994<P>

<B>3.6 (November/December) -- Security</B>
Proposals due: 1 August 1994
Manuscripts due: 	1 September 1994<P>

In this month's Call for Papers you'll find a few suggested

topics for the January issue, but if you have other
ideas, please 
feel free to send them in. These are merely suggestions
and are certainly 
not exhaustive.<P>

If you've read Sys Admin over time, you'll have noticed

that new names appear regularly in the Table of Contents.
Most of 
those new names are readers of the magazine who've come
up with something 
they think is worth sharing. Once bitten by the writing
bug, such 
readers often become regular contributors. We invite
you to try it.<P>

FYI -- we recently held an in-house contest for a slogan

for Sys Admin. The winner? System Administration: It's
a dirty 
job but somebody said I have to do it! You'll be seeing
this on Sys 
Admin t-shirts at the conferences we attend.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Robert Ward<br>
