<H1>Sidebar: Restoring the Operating System from Dump Tape</H1><p>
<P>
Note: The following instructions are specific to Sun
systems.<P>

<B>Preparing for Restoration</B><P>

If the disk has already crashed, get out your plans
on disaster recovery 
for the system. If you don't have plans, you will need
to restore 
every incremental dump of the / and /usr partition since

the most recent level 0 dump. Now get the tapes that
you will need, 
starting with a level 0.<P>

If the disk is having problems but is still readable,
do a level 0 
dump of every disk partition, and use that dump for
restoration.<P>

Connect a local CD-ROM unit and tape drive if the system
does not 
normally have one. You cannot restore the OS from a
remote tape device. 
Boot the system with the miniroot. This process copies
a &quot;mini-unix&quot; 
operating system to the b partition (swap) of the system
disk. 
Once the system is up, make sure you don't have a corrupted
/ 
or /usr partition by running newfs and fsck. 
The examples below use /dev/sd0a for the / partition,

and /dev/sd0g for the /usr partition:<P>
<PRE>
# newfs /dev/rsd0a
# fsck /dev/rsd0a
# newfs /dev/rsd0g
# fsck /dev/rsd0g</pre><p>
<p>
<B>Avoiding Pitfalls</B><P>

Do not use verbose mode with the restore command when

restoring / or /usr, but do use interactive mode. 
If restore complains that some directories do not contain
. 
or .., or that it expected one file and found another,
there 
is not enough room in /tmp for the scratch files restore

needs.<P>

Although restore will continue under these circumstances,
the 
resulting restored file system may have directories
with incorrect 
file permissions, ownerships, and so on. Entire directories
may also 
be missing. This situation is most likely to happen
on systems with 
relatively large /usr partitions. Since the miniroot
is contained 
in the b partition, which is normally used for swap,
there 
is little room to spare unless the system was configured
with a larger 
than usual swap partition.<P>

The best thing to do is to move /tmp to an unused disk
partition, 
perhaps one normally used for additional swap. If you
do not have 
an unused partition, an alternative is to restore /usr
first, 
using the former / partition for /tmp, then go back

to using the default /tmp when restoring the / partition.<P>

<B>Moving /tmp</B><P>

First, make a mount point for the new /tmp partition.
The example 
below calls it /new_tmp. Next, mount the disk partition
you 
want to use on /new_tmp (the example uses disk sd1,

partition d), and change the ownership and permissions:
<P>
<PRE>
# mkdir /new_tmp
# mount /dev/sd1d /new_tmp
# chown bin.staff /new_tmp
# chmod 1777 /new_tmp
# chmod g+s /new_tmp</pre><p>
<p>
The permissions should now be: drwxrwsrwt. Next, 
rename the /tmp directory and replace it with the /new_tmp

partition: <P>
<PRE>
# mv /tmp /old_tmp; mv /new_tmp /tmp</pre><p>
<p>
<B>Restoring the / Partition</B><P>

Mount /dev/sd0a to /a, and cd to /a. Position 
the backup tape to the dump of / and restore the / partition.

When the restore completes, make sure you don't have
a corrupted boot 
file by copying the one from the miniroot:<P>
<PRE>
# cp /boot.&lt;arch&gt; /a/boot</pre><p>
<p>
where &lt;arch&gt; is the architecture of the system

as obtained by the arch command:<P>
<PRE>
# arch -k</pre><p>
<p>
For example, if arch -k returns sun4c use:<P>
<PRE>
# cp /boot.sun4c /a/boot</pre><p>
<p>
<B>Running installboot</B><P>

You need to run the installboot utility whenever / is

restored or moved. This is because installboot puts
a list 
of block locations into the boot track, and this information
changes 
when a restore of / occurs. The syntax to use for the
installboot 
command is:<P>
<PRE>
installboot -vl &lt;bf&gt; &lt;dev&gt; &lt;dskpar&gt;</pre><p>
<p>
where &lt;bf&gt; is the boot file, &lt;dev&gt; is either

bootsd, bootxy, bootxd, or bootid, according 
to what type of disk is being used, and &lt;dskpar&gt;
is the raw 
disk partition that contains the root file system. To
run installboot 
for our example:<P>
<PRE>
# cd /usr/kvm/mdec
# installboot -vl /a/boot bootsd /dev/rsd0a</pre><p>
<p>
Remove the scratch files created by restore in 
/tmp (/tmp/rstdir and /tmp/rstmode), then umount 
/a and fsck /dev/rsd0a again.<P>

<B>Restoring the /usr Partition</B><P>

Mount /dev/sd0g to /a, cd to /a, reposition 
the tape to the dump of /usr, and restore the /usr partition.

Once the /usr restoration is complete, umount /a, and

fsck /dev/rsd0g again.<P>

Now reboot the system. If you were not able to do a
level 0 dump at 
the beginning of these procedures, you need to recover
files from 
incremental tapes that have changed since the level
0 dump used for 
restoration. If you have disaster recovery plans, restore
only the 
most recent copy of each file on your list.<P>

<B>Doing a Baseline</B><P>

It is very important that a level 0 dump be run as soon
as possible 
after restoring. Doing so will ensure that your dump
schedule gets 
back on track. Otherwise, incrementals may not be done
correctly. <P>
