<H1>Books: A User's Report</H1><p>
<P>
Elizabeth Zinkann<P>

This month I review a different type of UNIX book by
Ziff-Davis Press, 
two new networking books -- one from Prentice Hall and
one from 
Addison-Wesley -- and a new system administration book
on SCO UNIX 
from Prentice Hall.<P>

<B><I>Networking Applications on UNIX System V<br>
Release 4</I><br>
by Michael Padovano<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-613555-2</B><P>

Michael Padovano's book explores the networking concepts
currently 
implemented in UNIX System V Release 4 (UNIX SVR4) and
UNIX SVR4-based 
systems, including Solaris 2.0, Solaris 2.1, and UNIX
SVR4.2. The 
author assumes that the reader understands UNIX, can
read and write 
shell scripts, and is familiar with C. <P>

Padovano begins with a thorough discussion of networking,
including 
an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of networking.
Although 
he does not assume prior knowledge of networking concepts,
he explains 
the terms so that the experienced user will also learn
from the definitions. 
He presents an example of a layered architecture, then
describes the 
OSI Reference Model and the purpose of each layer. As
an example of 
a networking relationship, Padovano focuses on the client/server
model 
and describes how it functions. He also discusses transport
providers, 
transport modes of service, plus ports and port monitors.
The introductory 
chapter contains a section not only on UNIX networking
history, but 
also how UNIX SVR4 networking differs from other UNIX
variants.<P>

The next topic is the STREAMS framework. Padovano defines
STREAMS 
as &quot;a replacement of the traditional UNIX communications
system.&quot; 
He further analyzes the STREAMS mechanism by demonstrating
the structure 
of a stream and explaining how it is implemented. Using
C system calls 
and statements, supplemented by a graphic representation
of what is 
happening, Padovano shows how to modify a stream by
either adding 
or removing modules. He also explains the STREAMS multiplexing
capability 
and its importance to networking.<P>

The book progresses from STREAMS concepts to the networking
protocols 
that use the STREAMS framework. Padovano defines TCP/IP,
and provides 
an overview of the TCP/IP protocol suite. He includes
an excellent 
diagram displaying the TCP/IP and the OSI Reference
Model structures. <P>

In addition to the topics already mentioned, Padovano
also addresses 
UUCP, Remote File Sharing (RFS), the Network File System
(NFS), Remote 
Procedure Calls (RPC), the Transport Level Interface
(TLI), and sockets, 
as well as a chapter entitled &quot;Network Selection
and Name-to-Address 
Mapping.&quot; In each case he not only defines the
topic, but also 
discusses when it should be used and its applications.
For example, 
when discussing the UNIX SVR4 Transport Level Interface
(TLI), Padovano 
describes the states of the transport endpoint from
both the client 
and the server views, presenting them step-by-step along
with diagrams 
to explain the procedures.<P>

Networking Applications on UNIX System V Release 4 is
an ideal 
book for learning about UNIX networking. The writing
style is clear, 
and Padovano provides many useful diagram and examples.
Each chapter 
includes both a &quot;For Further Reading&quot; and
an &quot;Exercises&quot; 
section; depending on the topic covered, the chapter
may also include 
a summary. Although the book is written for the reader
without any 
networking knowledge, it will also appeal to the experienced
user. 
It should be read prior to the UNIX manuals, as it clarifies
many 
of the ideas presented in the manuals. This is a book
that should 
rate a place on every UNIX user's bookshelf.<P>

<B><I>UNIX System V Network Programming</I><br>
by Stephen A. Rago<br>
Addison-Wesley<br>
Professional Computing Series<br>
ISBN 0-201-56318-5</B><P>

This book was written primarily for programmers interested
in the 
UNIX System V Release 4 (UNIX SVR4) networking interfaces,
and Rago 
expects the reader to be familiar with both UNIX and
the C programming 
language. Also useful, but not mandatory is some knowledge
of data 
structures and algorithms. The preface contains a list
of five UNIX 
manuals that will help the reader understand the subject.<P>

The book is divided into four main sections: &quot;Background
Material,&quot; 
&quot;User-level Network Programming,&quot; &quot;Kernel-level
Network 
Programming,&quot; and a &quot;Design Project.&quot;
The first section 
introduces networks and UNIX programming. Network coverage
includes 
networking terms, network characteristics, and network
models, including 
the OSI Reference Model. Coverage of UNIX programming
includes a number 
of useful examples.<P>

The second section addresses topics that programmers
encounter at 
the user level. Rago explains what the programmer needs
to know to 
implement these concepts. This section explores STREAMS,
the Transport 
Level Interface (TLI), &quot;Selecting Networks and
Addresses,&quot; 
&quot;The Network Listener Facility,&quot; &quot;Sockets,&quot;
and &quot;Remote 
Procedure Calls&quot; (RPCs). In the chapter devoted
to sockets, Rago 
describes the socket interface which originally resided
in BSD UNIX, 
but is now employed by UNIX SVR4 and provides a comparison
between 
the socket interface and the Transport Level Interface
(TLI).<P>

Through the first two sections, the only references
to the kernel 
are either theoretical or used in a description of the
UNIX architecture. 
The third section, however, addresses programmers who
produce kernel-level 
code. Rago divides this segment into four chapters:
&quot;The STREAMS 
Subsystem,&quot; &quot;STREAMS Drivers,&quot; &quot;STREAMS
Modules,&quot; 
and &quot;STREAMS Multiplexors.&quot; The first of these
chapters examines 
the kernel environment and provides the foundation for
the next three 
chapters. &quot;STREAMS Drivers&quot; continues by discussing
the purpose 
of a driver, introducing the Data Link Provider Interface
(DLPI), 
and analyzing the design of a STREAMS Ethernet driver.
Rago next describes 
&quot;STREAMS Modules&quot; and their differences from
driver implementations. 
He also discusses the terminal interface before studying
a network 
terminal emulator example. The final chapter in this
section, &quot;STREAMS 
Multiplexors,&quot; describes what a multiplexor is
and how to use 
and implement a multiplexor. The example that the author
uses displays 
a Transport Provider Interface.<P>

The final segment is a &quot;Design Project: Implementing
SLIP.&quot; 
SLIP, which is defined as a serial line IP, is a protocol
describing 
how IP packets &quot;are framed to allow their transmission
over point-to-point 
serial connections.&quot; Many of the concepts previously
explained 
are implemented in this design, and both the user-level
and kernel-level 
components are examined in this project.<P>

UNIX System V Network Programming can be used as a standalone

book or as a textbook for a class. Each chapter contains
an introduction, 
summary, exercises, and a bibliography. Throughout,
the author refers 
to his examples and builds upon them. His writing style
is concise 
and clear. Anyone interested in UNIX networking will
find this book 
a worthwhile addition to their resources. <P>

<B><I>Running UNIX So It Doesn't Run You</I><br>
by Don Crabb<br>
Ziff-Davis Press<br>
ISBN 1-56276-061-0</B><P>

This book addresses UNIX users and, UNIX system managers,
and tries 
to take into account the different backgrounds these
readers may have. 
In &quot;An Overview of UNIX,&quot; Crabb examines why
many businesses 
are converting to UNIX and what they will gain from
the move. The 
author draws comparisons among operating systems by
means of a table 
that lists operations and shows the corresponding UNIX
System V Release 
4, DOS 5.0, and Mac System 7 commands. Chapters 2 and
3 explore the 
file system and UNIX customization, respectively. Chapter
4 is devoted 
to GUIs. In it, the author explains the graphical user
interface (GUI), 
its components, and each component's purpose(s). He
describes how 
to evaluate different GUIs and how GUIs interact with
UNIX shells. 
Crabb also discusses X servers, X clients, and their
separate functions. 
While presenting his evaluation criteria, the author
focuses on the 
following GUIs: Open Desktop, X.Desktop, Open Look,
Motif, A/UX, and 
NeXTStep.<P>

Crabb next examines UNIX &quot;Communications and Shared
Resources,&quot; 
&quot;UNIX LANs,&quot; and &quot;UNIX LAN Backup Technologies.&quot;
Also 
included is a valuable chapter entitled &quot;UNIX Software
Development.&quot; 
This section will help anyone who needs to know the
programming capabilities 
of UNIX. Here, Crabb begins by defining a five-step
software development 
process consisting of discovery, recovery, invention,
presentation, 
and systemization. The author also delves into the topic
of object-oriented 
programming. He examines the differences among the variant
UNIX programming 
systems, particularly UNIX System V Release 4 (UNIX
SVR4) and NeXTStep. 
Crabb also analyzes when a UNIX manager should hire
a consultant and 
what the manager should know before approaching a consultant.<P>

The author also presents some strategies relating to
UNIX hardware 
and how to efficiently manage UNIX, including security
issues, emission 
standards, and system performance. In a chapter devoted
to &quot;Training 
and Supporting UNIX Users,&quot; Crabb not only stresses
the importance 
of allowing users uninterrupted training time, but also
presents the 
different types of training available. The final chapter
addresses 
&quot;The Art and Science of Troubleshooting UNIX&quot;
and provides 
information on hardware problems, possible reasons why
UNIX won't 
start, and some error and warning messages. The book
concludes with 
a command reference, a glossary, and a comprehensive
index.<P>

Each chapter is well-organized, beginning with a bullet
list of the 
chapter contents and a brief summary, and concluding
with a &quot;Crabb's 
Unix Quiz&quot; for each chapter. The author always
includes information 
on where the reader may obtain something that he has
referenced. He 
also provides other sources for topics that he has mentioned,
but 
has not dealt with in depth. Don Crabb writes from a
different perspective, 
coming more from a Mac background than most UNIX authors.
As a result, 
he includes subjects that most authors tend to overlook,
particularly 
in the software development process, as well as some
surprising tips 
to the reader. His writing sytle is crisp, friendly,
and very readable. 
The chapters on GUIs, software development, and troubleshooting
are 
among the most informative sections. This book is an
excellent choice 
for new users, users who need to review the most recent
concepts, 
managers, and evaluators of UNIX systems.<P>

<B><I>SCO UNIX System V<br>
System Administrator's Guide</I><br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-012568-7</B><P>

This book was intended for UNIX system administrators
running SCO 
UNIX System V. The contributors to the book define a
system administrator 
as the individual &quot;in charge of system maintenance
and operation.&quot; 
The tasks that this manual addresses include the simple,
intermediate, 
and difficult jobs associated with the position of UNIX
system administrator.<P>

The book is organized in three major sections: &quot;System
Configuration 
and Maintenance,&quot; &quot;Performance and Troubleshooting,&quot;
and 
the Appendices. The first section focuses on topics
ranging from using 
the system administration shell (sysadmsh) through managing

filesystems, including adding new filesystems and mounting
and unmounting 
filesystems, to using different peripherals, such as
printers, floppy 
disks, tape drives, and modems. The first section also
covers using 
DOS operating systems, how to maintain system security,
building a 
remote network using UUCP, installing electronic mail,
and how to 
backup filesystems.<P>

The &quot;Performance and Troubleshooting&quot; section
discusses different 
ways to improve your system's performance. It helps
you become more 
familiar with your system and tells you how to configure
the system 
so your users will have optimal performance. This section
also provides 
a Troubleshooting overview that can help system administrators
figure 
out how to recover quickly from a system failure. One
of the most 
informative chapters here is the &quot;Troubleshooting
Reference,&quot; 
which  presents information about system problems that
may occur. 
It is organized alphabetically and also, where appropriate,
grouped 
by related subjects.<P>

The appendices deal with the following topics: &quot;Customizing
System 
Startup,&quot; &quot;Authorizing the Use of Job Scheduling
Commands,&quot; 
&quot;Using the System Console and Color Displays,&quot;
and &quot;UNIX 
Directories and Special Device Files.&quot; Following
the index for 
the &quot;SCO UNIX System V System Administrator's Guide&quot;
is the 
most recent release of the &quot;SCO UNIX Hardware Configuration
Guide.&quot; 
This manual will aid the system administrator in the
installation 
and configuration of hard drives, tape drives, controllers,
CD-ROM 
drives, printers, modems, and network cards, to name
a few.<P>

Through the concatenation of the two books, there are
helpful notes 
and warnings, with the heading in bold plus a vertical
line so that 
the reader will not overlook it. The authors and editors
also use 
diagrams and screen displays to represent what system
administrators 
would encounter at their terminals. The topics are developed
in a 
logical order and the procedures are presented step-by-step.
This 
documentation is well-written and would be an excellent
addition to 
any SCO system administrator's library. <P>
