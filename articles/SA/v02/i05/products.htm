<B>ASi Ships PKZIP MultiPlatform Compression Software</B><P>

Ascent Solutions Inc. has begun shipping PKZIP and PKZIP
Data Compression 
Library products for MVS and AS/400. UNIX versions for
SUN Solaris 
1.1 and later, SCO UNIX, SCO Xenix, AT&amp;T System
5, Interactive, AIX, 
HP/UX, Ultrix, and DG Aviion are also available.<P>

PKZIP MultiPlatform uses the advanced deflation algorithm
for fast 
operation while still yielding compression ratios in
excess of 90 
percent. The PKZIP Data Compression Library (DCL) lets
software developers 
incorporate data compression into their software application
programs. 
The Data Compression Library supports generic compression
and extraction 
to and from any location, and supports 14 different
platforms. Data 
compressed on one system may be decompressed on another
using the 
comparable library. I/O is handled by the application
routines, making 
the DCL flexible. <P>

In 1992, ASi obtained the rights from PKWARE to develop
and market 
non-DOS PKZIP compression products. No runtime royalties
are required 
for use of DCL. For more information contact Ascent
Solutions Inc.,

<B>UniPress Announces SoftNet</B><P>

UniPress has announced SoftNet, which allows UNIX workstation
to become 
integrated Novell NetWare servers or clients. SoftNet
has three parts: 
SoftNet Utilities, SoftNet Client, and SoftNet Term.
It requires no 
additional hardware or software.<P>

The first part, SoftNet Utilities, lets Sun, HP, IBM,
SGI, and SCO 
workstations be Novell NetWare 2.2 or 3.1 servers, providing
file 
and print sharing capabilities. No disk partitioning
is necessary 
and NetWare client PCs map UNIX directories. SoftNet
supports file 
exchange between UNIX workstations and PCs while retaining
the security 
features of UNIX and NetWare. The UNIX system running
SoftNet has 
the same interface and is administered the same way
as a NetWare server, 
and Novell's administrative utilities are functional
on the UNIX server. 
SoftNet utilities also include a DOS terminal emulator,
allowing users 
access to the UNIX host with the IPX protocol.<P>

The second component, SoftNet Client, lets UNIX workstation
run as 
NetWare Clients. UNIX users mount NetWare servers, access
files, and 
use the NetWare disk and printing resources. Standard
UNIX commands 
and procedures are used. SoftNet Client does not require
disk partitioning 
and does not interfere with TCP/IP activities.<P>

The third part, SoftNet Term, allows a PC NetWare client
to conduct 
a remote UNIX terminal session using IPX as a transport.
No additional 
purchase of TCP/IP is required. The DOS terminal emulation
is carried 
by the IPX protocol that has been established when both
PC and UNIX 
components are running. The SoftNet Term host side requires
no disk 
partitioning and can be used as a standalone product.<P>

SoftNet Utilities is priced from $1,299 for 16 concurrent
NetWare 
connections. SoftNet Client is priced at $399 for a
single user and 
$1,499 for a five-pack. SoftNet Term requires the purchase
of both 
UNIX host and PC sides. Prices are $399 per UNIX host,
and $99 for 
the PC side. For more information contact UniPress Software,
