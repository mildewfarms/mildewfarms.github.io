<H1>newping Revisited</H1><p>
<P>
Eric Horne<P>

<I>[Editor's Note: In the July/August issue of Sys Admin,
we published 
an article by Eric Horne entitled &quot;newping: Remote
Host 
Downtime Detection.&quot; The article proved very interesting
to readers, 
several of whom contacted us to mention a problem with
the code and 
to offer both solutions to the problem and enhancements
of the program. 
We are printing Eric's corrected code here, along with
a submission 
from Adam Zell. We'd be interested in hearing from other
readers who've 
worked with the newping code.]</I><P>

It would seem that, in spite of the errors I introduced

into the newping code, people really found newping a

useful utility. An overwhelming number of readers sent
in their comments 
about how useful the application was, or how they were
going to use 
it. One particular reader went on to suggest that newping
be 
called tcping. His logic was that when the next version
of 
newping comes out, the older version won't be new anymore.

So I have adopted the new name, tcping, for my application.

Just goes to show that I learned as much from the readers,
as (I hope) 
the readers did from me. Thank you!!<P>

Dear SA:<P>

The newping article by Eric Horne in the July/August

issue of SysAdmin was very informative, but unfortunately
the implementation 
was flawed.<P>

The major problem area of the program is in its signal

handling. It uses the earlier signal() call, which is
unreliable. 
If the alarm() goes off while inside the alarm signal
handler, 
the handler itself may by interrupted. This could lead
to inconsistent 
output.<P>

By using System V's sigaction, this can be avoided.

All alarm signals generated while in an alarm signal
handler are blocked 
until the handler exits.<P>

Another potential problem area in newping.c 
is the definitions of global variables. All of the global
variables 
are accessed from the signal handlers, and thus should
be declared 
volatile. Labeling a variable volatile tells the compiler
not to optimize, 
and should be used on all variables accessed from a
signal handler 
or goto.<P>

Otherwise, the compiler may keep a variable's value

in a register, not storing it immediately back into
memory. Since 
a signal may occur at any time, if the value is not
written back, 
the signal handler may be left with an old value.<P>

There are also some minor bugs dealt with, in 
terms of option processing, K&amp;R C, and older BSD
constants. Also, 
extraneous variables were taken out and generally cleaned
up. 
The resultant program (Listing 2) is ANSI and SVR4 compliant.<P>
