<B>Programmed Logic Introduces High Performance File System</B><P>

Programmed Logic Corporation has upgraded its High Performance
File 
System (HPFS) for Intel-based PCs running UNIX System
V Release 4 
or Univel's UNIXWare. Programmed Logic describes HPFS
as an SVR4-compatible 
file system that can double system throughput, as measured
using SPEC's 
SDET benchmark. HPFS maintains plug-compatibility and
media-compatibility 
with the UFS file system, USL's version of the University
of California 
at Berkeley's Fast File System. Users don't have to
back up and restore 
their files, they only need to plug in the new HPFS
software module. 
When using HPFS, various critical file system resources
are tuned 
automatically. HPFS incorporates meta-data management
and enhancements 
to SVR4's file system algorithms that address the bottleneck
problem 
caused by CPUs waiting for I/O.<P>

Users can power off after exiting applications without
checking file 
systems when the system is rebooted. The majority of
crashes and powerfails 
will not result in lengthy reboot procedures.<P>

HPFS runs on versions of UNIX based on USL's SVR4. This
includes UNIXWare 
and versions of SVR4 from Consensys, Dell, ESIX, Microport,
and UHC. 
A multi-processor version is also available for systems
based on the
