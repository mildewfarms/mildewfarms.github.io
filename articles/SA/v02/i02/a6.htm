This issue's reviews include a look at a compact book
on the Internet 
by Tracy LaQuey and Jeanne C. Ryer, entitled The Internet
Companion; 
an intriguing book, Modern UNIX, by Alan Southerton;
and the 
first guide in the Prentice Hall Open Systems Library,
the UNIX 
System V Print Service Administration, edited by Sally
Browning.<P>

<B><I>The Internet Companion<br>
A Beginner's Guide to Global Networking</I><br>
by Tracy LaQuey with Jeanne C. Ryer<br>
Foreword by Senator Al Gore<br>
Addison-Wesley</B><P>

This new book by LaQuey and Ryer, written for the beginner
as an introduction 
to the Internet, provides some information overlooked
by other Internet 
books. The authors begin with a description of the Internet.
After 
the description, they focus on the reasons for Internet's
success 
and discuss how this particular network functions. They
also identify 
concepts and acronyms that the user needs to know.<P>

In addition to chapters on sending electronic mail,
researching information, 
and some advanced Internet topics, there is also a chapter
on different 
ways to get connected to the Internet. An excellent


bibliography follows 
the text, along with an appendix that lists available
resources.<P>

I liked The Internet Companion for several reasons.
It is a 
compact, almost pocket-sized, volume and it discusses
several Internet 
commands, such as reply, that are not covered in many
of the 
other Internet books available. It includes many historical
asides 
that describe events related to the Internet and gives
the reader 
a sense of how long contributors have been working on
the Internet 
to have come this far. The Foreword by then-Senator,
now Vice-President 
Al Gore is in itself a nice historical touch. In all,
LaQuey and Ryer 
have produced a readable book which progresses in an
orderly fashion.<P>

<B><I>Modern UNIX</I><br>
by Alan Southerton<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</B><P>

Modern UNIX has evolved as a mixture of UNIX's original
style and 
its newer applications. In this book, Alan Southerton
traces the transition 
from early UNIX through the beginning of UNIX commands

and on to the 
X Window System.<P>

Southerton begins with an historical perspective on
the development 
of UNIX drawn from several different sources. He includes
a table 
which outlines the evolution of UNIX as well as the
major UNIX vendors.<P>

The author assumes that the reader has some knowledge
of basic UNIX. 
To help the beginner, however, he covers several of
the more complex 
subjects, such as startup files, file systems, and inodes.
As he explains 
these topics, Southerton includes examples of the more
recent developments 
in the UNIX world, such as the dfspace program, the
OpenWindows 
file system, and X.desktop's File Properties Window.<P>

The subject of shells often gives rise to some confusion,
even at 
so basic a level as the proper name (in addition to
the variation 
in shell terms, shell programs have also been called
scripts). Southerton 
addresses both the types of shells and when the programmer
might want 
to use which shell. He provides examples of each type
of shell and 
includes excellent descriptions of the examples.<P>

The author goes on to explain networking and X. He presents
these 
topics in modules that allow the UNIX user without X
to focus on networking 
and the X user on a standalone system to focus on X.<P>

With UNIX, as with Apple and MS-DOS, the most modern
look is windows. 
However, where Apple and MS-DOS have a standard for
windows, UNIX 
does not. Whether the windowing environment is OpenWindows,
Desqview/X, 
or OSF Motif does make a difference, depending on the
user's purpose. 
In Modern UNIX, Southerton lists the different products
that 
comprise the X market and explains the procedures used
to customize 
the individual X product.<P>

Still in the windows area, the UNIX user can choose
from more than 
one interface. Southerton describes what he considers
to be the basic 
components of a window manager. He clarifies the differences
between 
Motif and Open Look GUIs by examining the basics of
both. After reading 
this chapter, the user will know the strengths and weaknesses
of OSF 
Motif and Open Look and which GUI he/she would prefer.<P>

Southerton also raises the question of the &quot;obsoleting&quot;
of 
previous UNIX knowledge. If the user updates to a new
type of application 
in UNIX, does that necessarily void any previous knowledge?
In other 
words, are the older shell scripts (and the manner in
which they were 
coded) now extinct? Southerton maintains that older
UNIX tools are 
needed in order to customize a desktop manager, and
he lists the minimum 
tools required to become a &quot;power desktop manager
user.&quot;<P>

Southerton also introduces the reader to MetaCard, a
&quot;scripting 
language,&quot; that is object-oriented, portable, and
also supportive 
of GUI methods. The author illustrates MetaCard by providing
several 
examples, and includes an email address for more information
about 
it.<P>

The last section of Modern UNIX covers system administration.

While much of this material has been covered in other
system administration 
texts, the advent of &quot;modern UNIX&quot; means that
names and even 
procedures may have changed. In any case, different
systems have different 
names for the same command. Southerton's chapter on
system administration 
is well-written and comprehensive -- perhaps especially
for 
the user who has never had to be a system administrator.<P>

Southerton supplements Modern UNIX with five appendices.
The 
first covers man and Xman pages; the second is a &quot;Beginner's

Guide to Perl,&quot; a mixture of &quot;awk, sed and
the C shell&quot;; 
the third and fourth are references for vi and emacs,

respectively; and the fifth is a collection of commands
and their 
descriptions.<P>

When I opened this book, I expected an introductory
to intermediate 
book on UNIX. What I discovered was a unique guide to
the variant 
types of UNIX available in the 90s. Southerton has written
a superb 
book for all levels of UNIX users.<P>

<B><I>UNIX System V Print Service Administration<br>
Prentice Hall Open Systems Library</I><br>
Edited by Sally A. Browning<br>
Prentice Hall</B><P>

This book, the first volume in the Prentice Hall Open
Systems Library, 
focuses on the &quot;installation, configuration, and
administration&quot; 
of the UNIX System V LP print services. It addresses
the novice 
administrator, as well as intermediate and advanced
administrators 
and system programmers.<P>

Browning begins with an overview of the LP print service,
describing 
what the print service hardware and software are and
what the software 
does. She also considers different types of printing
configurations, 
such as distributed, print server, and network printing.
She then 
provides installation information and tells how to support
the varied 
configurations.<P>

Particularly valuable is the section on printer configuration.
This 
section defines both optional and required parameters,
treating each 
individually in its introductory overview, which also
tells where 
the full discussion of each parameter can be found.
The definition 
for each parameter includes pertinent &quot;Notes&quot;
intended to 
help you decide whether or not the parameter is needed.
Related topics 
-- including how to enable and disable printers and
further information 
about the lpadmin -- are also covered. Finally, Browning

shows how to configure printers by using menus.<P>

In most instances, the LP print service provides enough
support 
for users' printing needs. In the cases where it is
not sufficient, 
it is possible to customize the print service. Browning
presents several 
ways to accomplish this, including altering the &quot;printer
port 
characteristics,&quot; using terminfo, creating an interface

program, and using a filter. Her discussion of the different
means 
of customizing the print service is complemented by
an informative 
diagram explaining &quot;How LP Processes the Print
Request.&quot;<P>


As with most software and hardware, there are related
housekeeping 
chores and troubleshooting techniques. Browning  explains
when the 
LP print service may have to be disabled and why, and
what 
the administrator can do in the meantime to avoid the
wrath of users.<P>

The book provides a comprehensive discussion of the
use of preprinted 
forms with the LP print service. Topics include how
to change 
or add a form, whether through commands or menu selection;
how to 
remove a form; how to display the form description;
and how to restrict 
access to the form, through either user or printer access.<P>

Although the concept of filters is well-known in UNIX
programming, 
it is not always defined in terms of printer faults.
Browning focuses 
on three uses of filters -- data conversion, varied
print options, 
and the detection of printer faults, plus the resulting
alert -- 
providing examples, filter guidelines, and templates.
She also devotes 
a section to displaying, modifying, removing, and creating
filters.<P>

With the increasing emphasis on fonts, PostScript printers
are more 
in demand. And, since PostScript is a programming language,
it permits 
the programmer to &quot;specify the appearance of both
text and graphics 
on a page.&quot; Browning describes the installation
of a PostScript 
printer, what the administrator's responsibilities are,
and how to 
use filters with PostScript printers to produce the
optimum output.<P>

The last chapter -- my favorite -- deals with troubleshooting.

It describes a problem with the printer, then presents
several possible 
solutions. The book doesn't answer every question, nor
does it claim 
that it can. However, it does identify enough issues
to start the 
administrator thinking in the right direction.<P>

As I read this book, I realized that it was written
in a sort of chronological 
order. A beginner could follow it from start to finish,
while a more 
experienced user could use the chapter descriptions
in the preface, 
along with the quick reference card at the end, to pick
and choose. 
Browning's writing style is clear and very readable,
and she documents 
her sources as she uses them. This book would be a worthwhile
addition 
to any UNIX user's library and an excellent complement
to the UNIX 
System Laboratories volumes. <P>
