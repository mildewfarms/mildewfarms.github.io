Hi Leor,<br>

I just read your article &quot;In-Line Input or Bust&quot;
from the 
November/December issue of Sys Admin and thought you
might 
be interested in knowing that it is in fact possible
to do in-line 
SQL scripts to isql. For example, this is one I use
for doing queries 
on my phone database to allow me to quickly locate information
on 
someone:<P>
<PRE>
:

DBPATH=&quot;/u2/mfaurot/db/phone
export DBPATH

isql phone - &lt; EOF 2&amp;1 | more
select  	*
from   	ph_work
where   	name_last matches &quot;*$1*&quot;
order by 	name_last;
EOF</pre><p>
<p>
The key is an undocumented (at least it was the last

time I remember looking for this in a manual) switch:
the &quot;-&quot; 
after the database name and before the &lt;&lt; redirection.<P>

You can also get a command line driven version of isql
by doing:<P>
<PRE>
isql - -</pre><p>
<p>
Just send an EOF (^d) when you're ready to return to

your shell or calling program.<P>

<I>Yes, several folks have pointed this out, but yours
is the 
most detailed explanation. I'm relieved to hear this
feature is indeed 
undocumented, because I know I tried to look it up in
the manual at 
one point. All I can say is that somewhere, out there,
must be an 
application that really doesn't accept standard input
to which 
one might apply my technique . . . Thanks, --lz</I><P>

Laurie,<br>

I agree with much of what you have written in your article,
&quot;UNIX 
Security in a Networked Environment&quot; from the Jan/Feb
issue of 
Sys Admin. I've worked on the security of our Sun systems
here 
at GMI and many of the holes you mentioned are almost
second nature 
to me.<P>

I do have one small improvement on searching for setuid
and setgid 
files. In SunOS 4.1.2, the manpages for find describe
the -perm operator 
this way:<P>
<PRE>
-perm onum</pre><p>
<p>
True if the file permission flags exactly match the
octal 
number onum (see chmod(1V)). If onum is prefixed by
a minus sign, 
more flag bits (017777, see chmod(1V)) become significant
and the  flags 
are compared:
(flags&amp;onum)==onum.<P>

If the specified permissions are prefixed by a minus
sign, you can 
search for files with permissions that match what you're
looking for, 
but may also have other permissions set. For example,
this is how 
I search for setuid files:<P>
<PRE>
find / -perm -4000 -print</pre><p>
<p>
For setgid files:<P>
<PRE>
find / -perm -6000 -print</pre><p>
<p>
Those commands will find any setuid or setgid file regardless

of how the user, group, or other permissions are set.<P>

Also, on redirecting the output to a file, I find it
more convenient 
to pipe it through mail:<P>
<PRE>
find / -perm -4000 -print | mail
lsloan &amp;</pre><p>
<p>
I liked your article and I would recommend to anybody
that they keep 
a copy of it around for reference.<P>

<I>We've forwarded your message to Laurie Sefton but wanted

to share it with our readers also. Thank you for writing.

Hello, Sys Admin mag:<br>

Love your magazine so far (2 issues). Hope to see future
articles 
specific to MIT X administration install/upgrades or
user support 
from admin point of view. I am user support person at
a supercomputer 
site running UNIX (crays and Sun minicomputers over
ultranet) where 
X11R5 and X11R4 is available.<P>

However, I've just entered a subscription and the expiration
date 
on my mailer label is: May 93.<P>

My question is: I just subscribed to Sys Admin in Oct,
1992. 
If the subscription ends May 93 I only receive 1/2 year
of your most 
excellent publication. Hoping for email reply (if this
is possible 
) to skinman@pops.navo.navy.mil<P>

Best Wishes for Success<br>

John Skinner<br>
popshelp@pops.navo.navy.mil<P>

<I>Thanks for the nice words -- we'll try to cover some

of the subjects you mention in upcoming issues. As for
the misleading 
information included on your mailing label: it seems
that our label 
program forgot that Sys Admin was a bimonthly magazine
-- thus 
interpreted 2.5 (your actual expiration issue) as May
rather than 
September/October. The actual data concerning your account
is all 
in order, and I believe we've fixed the label problem.
Our apologies 
to you and all others who were inconvenienced by this
glitch! --mm</I><P>

Congratulations on the new magazine. If your first issues
are any 
measure, you folks look to have a winner on your hands.
It would be 
nice if there was more coverage of stuff for Data Genera
AViiONs, 
but I expect you can only print what someone's submitted.
Maybe this'll 
nudge someone into writing something. <P>

Have you ever considered running a regular feature that
covers system 
management tools that are available over the Internet?
It looks like 
there's a lot of useful public domain/freely redistributable
stuff 
floating out there -- unfortunately, not only is it
all scattered 
around and difficult to find out about, there are a
lot of us who 
only have access via UUCP through UUNet. Even one-paragraph
descriptions, 
along with file names and locations, would be a real
help. <P>

<I>I think that's a good idea. In fact, it seems I've seen

a summary somewhere in one of the news feeds. Perhaps
one of our readers 
can help me find it, or write one? --rlw</I><P>

Hi,<br>

I picked up your Nov/Dec 92 issue (my first) at a bookstore
and am 
impressed. I would like to cast my vote for _NOT_ succumbing
to the 
attitude voiced in the Russ Hill letter referenced by
J. Wojno. We 
are all novices in some area of UNIX, and I feel the
level of writing 
and the presentation of your magazine is excellent.
For instance, 
I'm pretty good with BSD, but have little exposure to
System V unique 
problems (I don't even want to hear about SCO). So don't
change anything!<P>

<I>Gee, I'll invite you to all my evaluations. Thanks.

Subject: Article suggestion<br>
Status: RO <P>

I'd like to see an article (or six) on how NetNews works.
I'm thinking 
of topics such as nntp protocol, how news servers work,
what's involved 
in setting up a server served by dialup, what's involved
in maintaining 
a server. I realize that some of this is covered by
O'Reilly books, 
but I'd like to see a capsule summary of these topics
to de-mystify 
them for the sysadmin who's considering adding news
to a machine. 
I've used nn a little, so I know what the user sees.
What I want to 
know is what goes on under the hood.<P>

Kenneth Porter<br>
uunet!well.sf.ca.us!shiva<P>

<I>Another good suggestion, at least I'd certainly like
to 
know more about how this stuff works. So, do we have
an author out 
there? You write it, I'll print it. --rlw</I><P>

Hi:<br>

Assuming some (many? all?) of the programs in Sys Admin
are 
of use to readers, could they perhaps be dumped into
some generally 
available location, like ftp.uu.net? Or are they copyright
and thereby 
not freely available?<P>

Like the journal....keep the good stuff coming!<P>

<I>All the code is already available on uunet. For our
reader's 
convenience, we run a small &quot;house ad&quot; in
every issue which 
includes more details about network access. This ad
is indexed in 
the &quot;Departments&quot; section of the table of
contents (on the 
cover) under &quot;Source Code Availability&quot;. --rlw</I><P>
