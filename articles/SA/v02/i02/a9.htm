<H1>Questions and Answers</H1><p>
<P>
Bjorn Satdeva<P>

I need to start by completing some unfinished business.
In the November/December 
1992 issue (vol.1, no.4) I explained how to use Archie.
However, I 
did not mention which password to use. There is a good
reason for 
this, as Archie does not require a password -- just
log in on the 
server as Archie, and you are in business.<P>

<B>Sun User Group</B><P>

In December, the Sun User Group held its trade show
and conference 
in San Jose, California. I visited the show floor briefly,
but did 
not see much in the way of interesting new hardware
or software. The 
exception was a fast Terra Byte tape archive from Metrum
Information 
Storage presented by Highland Digital. Unlike existing
tape libraries, 
which use Exabyte or DAT tape drives, this server is
based on drives 
that use large tape formats (they looked like VHS video
tapes) and 
provide a much greater transfer rate than an Exabyte
drive. At the 
time of the show, there was no software to make this
tape library 
useful, but I was told that several vendors who have
backup programs 
on the market were in the process of evaluating the
tape library.<P>

<B>USL Bought by Novell</B><P>

It has been reported that AT&amp;T has sold its shares
in UNIX System 
Laboratories (USL) to Novell, though the sale must still
be approved 
by the stockholders of the two companies. It is far
too early to speculate 
on what effect this development will have on UNIX System
V Release 
4 in the future, but one may hope that it will result
in a much needed 
boost in software quality. One may further hope that
the silly lawsuit 
against UC Berkeley and BSDI will be dropped.<P>

And now to this month's questions.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Our organization is preparing to overhaul its news
installation 
and there has been a lot of discussion about which news
software we 
should be using. We wonder if you have any thoughts
on the subject.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 News software consists of two separate and distinct
parts: 
the news delivery agent and the news reader.<P>

There are a number of news delivery agents, the oldest
being B-News, 
which is still used in many installations. B-News is
probably the 
easiest to install in a vanilla configuration but, because
of its 
complexity can be difficult to troubleshoot if it is
used in an unusual 
configuration. A newer delivery agent is C-News, which,
though in 
some ways still a bit rough around the edges, nevertheless
delivers 
a significantly better performance than does B-News.
If you are connected 
to the Internet, there is a new delivery system available;
it's called 
INN, and it uses nntp (News Network Transfer Protocol).
My 
choice has been to use C-News, and we have just completed
installing 
the newest version, the C-News performance release (which
to my knowledge 
has no version number).<P>

There are a number of basic design issues you must consider
when designing 
your news system. If your users will be reading news
from more than 
one host, you will need to make it available on every
host where a 
user might want to read news (or at least on a reasonable
subset of 
such hosts, as, for example, all file servers). There
are two ways 
to do this (apart from the traditional USENET transport,
which is 
out of the question because of low performance): you
can either NFS-mount 
the directory to all hosts supporting the news, or you
can use nntp 
to connect to a single news server. C-News will support
either method, 
while B-News would not, (at least not when I stopped
using it a few 
years back).<P>

If you are NFS-mounting the news directory, then your
news reader 
will work almost as if it had been installed directly
on the news 
server (with a bit of complication in posting the news).
However, 
if your news reader supports nntp, you will not need
the NFS 
mounts. Most modern news reader will support both NFS-mounting
and 
nntp; however, if you have more than a few systems,
I suggest 
that you go with the nntp scheme. Some of the available
news 
reader which can use nntp are trn and nn (and 
on a larger site you will probably have to support both,
as users 
want the news reader they are familiar with).<P>

Another issue you will need to consider is the growing
volume of news 
articles. If you want a full newsfeed, not only will
you need a large 
capacity disk (500Mb or more), but within a a few years
you will no 
longer be able to receive a day's news using a high
speed within a 
24-hour period. (This is amusing to me, considering
that the first 
USENET connection I set up in the early 1980s was able
to receive 
a full newsfeed, using a 1200-baud modem, in just two
hours. A sign 
of progress maybe?<P>

Further information about nntp can be found in rfc977.<P>

The GNU people also offer some news software; however,
I have never 
used it, and do not know much about it.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 How many users can a system administrator support?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 It depends on the skill level of the users, and the
level 
of required support. Sites differ greatly, not only
between but also 
within such categories as educational or commercial.<P>

Users who need a lot of support will require additional
manpower. 
Support at a high level for an extended period of time
-- say 7:00 
AM to 9:00 PM seven days a week -- would require 
several people. On the other hand, if users can solve
most problems 
on their own, fewer people will be needed. At one extreme,
I once 
supported a site consisting of 24 file servers and a
little over 300 
workstations singlehandedly for about three months.
This was OK for 
a short period of time, but did not leave much time
for user support. <P>

Rob Kolstad (kolstad@bsdi,com) has been collecting data
on 
the size of the user populations system administrators
are supporting 
in various settings. This data has been posted to USENET,
but if you 
send him e-mail, he will properly be willing to send
you a copy. The 
material is very interesting, as it shows very large
differences in 
the user-to-administration ratios found in real life.<P>

In my judgement, a reasonable ratio in most cases would
be something 
like five system administrators per one hundred users,
dropping off 
for very large installations (if run properly, a large
installation 
can be more efficient than a smaller one).<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 At our site we use the automounter to mount the users'

home directories. As a result, the mechanism for naming
the users' 
home directories is somewhat messy and unsystematic.
How can we improve 
this?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 In addition to the symbolic links already used by the

automounter, you can add one more level of indirection,
in the form 
of a symbolic link from /user/&lt;username&gt; to where
the user's home 
directory exists on that machine (through the automounter
mount-point 
or on the home machine, directly to where the directory
is hard mounted). 
This will allow users and programs always to refer to
a user's home 
directory as /user/&lt;username&gt;. Since this method
is independent 
of where and how the user's home directory is mounted,
not only gives 
users the advantage of a consistent naming scheme, but
also gives 
the system administrator the advantages of being able
to move users 
from one machine to another in a manner that is (almost)
transparent. 
The drawback to this method is that, in order for it
to work well, 
you will need to write a shell or Perl script that creates
the links 
to a central table maintained by the system administrator.
Otherwise, 
the links will, over time, become incorrect (and different
from machine 
to machine), which in turn will cause serious login
problems.<P>

In a paper delivered at the LISA V conference, Arch
Mott described 
in much more detail a similar method used at MIPS Computer
Systems.
