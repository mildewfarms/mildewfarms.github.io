<H1>Publisher's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
Welcome to our one-year anniversary issue. No, there's
no 
boisterous banner on the cover, and no million-dollar
contest to celebrate, 
but we're excited about it anyway. <P>

This magazine has been lots of fun. It's fun because
we're 
meeting a genuine need -- both for our readers and advertisers.

It's fun because every issue is still a new challenge.
(For one thing, 
we never dreamed we'd be printing over 100 pages before
the end of 
the first year.) Finally, its fun because I'm getting
to learn more 
about my favorite operating system. <P>

Recently our staff sat down to review our first year.
We looked 
afresh at what we actually did, and at what we wrote
a year ago as 
our mission. Finally, we asked if the original statement
of mission 
had been on target. With a few exceptions, we concluded
that we had 
done what we set out to do and that we should keep doing
more of the 
same. <P>

The most significant exceptions were our coverage of
network 
and distributed computing and platform specific coverage.
We'd like 
more stories that address the really thorny issues involved
in administering 
large networks, and we'd like more stories that are
specific to the 
Sun and AIX platforms.<P>

So, if you are knowledgeable about any of those subjects,

write something. We'd like to improve our balance in
those areas. 
If you don't want to write about those areas, write
something. Our 
best stories come from our readers -- from working administrators.<P>

Thank you for reading, subscribing, advertising, writing,

and for being supportive and encouraging. Thanks.<P>

Now, on to a different subject . . .<P>

I have just returned from my first UniForum. (I finally
have 
a good rationalization for spending the money!) UniForum
is large 
-- the trade show filled two large exhibit halls. And,
in part 
because it is large and well-established, many of the
booths are more 
showmanship than useful information. (Anymore, the same
is true at 
all large, well-established shows.) Even so, I found
it quite interesting.<P>

First, several vendors were exhibiting various file-system

enhancements for release 4.2. These products let you
add transparent 
file compression, file system hardening (no fsck), volume
management, 
and other, more specialized features to UNIX. Many of
these (especially 
volume management) can really make an administrator's
life much easier.<P>

Unfortunately, we can't take advantage of these neat
products 
because we aren't running a release 4.2 product -- even
though, 
I'm embarrassed to say, I thought we were. We recently
installed SCO 
UNIX ver. 4.2. Without doing any real research, I just
assumed the 
&quot;ver. 4.2&quot; meant that it was based on release
4.2. Not true! 
The SCO release is still based on release 3. Arrgh!
I can't say that 
I'm pleased with SCO's version numbering strategy. You
can bet that 
if we can find a release 4.2 UNIX that will let us salvage
our key 
applications at a reasonable cost, we'll be changing
OS vendors.<P>

Finally, I was pleased to see not one, but several vendors

exhibiting Alphaterminal products -- both terminals
and supporting 
software. In fact, we bought a bunch of alphaterminals.
I sure hope 
they arrive soon.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>
Robert Ward<br>
