<H1>Sidebar: How rc Scripts Work</H1><p>
<P>
All rc scripts should reside in the directory /etc/init.d.

The scripts should then be linked to a file in /etc/rc2.d
or 
/etc/rc3.d, and /etc/rc0.d. These directories correspond

with the run levels 2, 3, and 0. init() will read inittab
and 
execute the scripts associated with the run level it
is about to enter. 
When executing the rc scripts, init passes along an

argument to the script. The argument will either be
&quot;start&quot; 
or &quot;stop.&quot; Therefore, the same script should
be written for 
starting and stopping a process.<P>

Scripts are executed in alphanumeric order. Scripts
to be executed 
while the system is coming up will usually be linked
to files in /etc/rc2.d 
and will begin with the letter S (for &quot;Start&quot;)
followed 
by a number and a name related to the operation, such
as inet, 
cron, or lp. Lower numbers will be executed first. Scripts

to be executed while the system is going down should
be linked to 
files in /etc/rc0.d and begin with a K (for &quot;Kill&quot;),

followed by a number and a name. Once again, lower numbers
will be 
executed first. S files and K files may be in the same

rc directories. The S files are run when init 
starts the run level; the K files in the same directory
are 
run just before init kills that run level. init then

moves on to the next run level, which has its own S
and 
K files. This is how the system controls the order of
events 
upon boot and shutdown. <P>
