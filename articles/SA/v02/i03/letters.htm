Dear Editor:<br>

The article &quot;UNIX Security in a Networked Environment&quot;
by 
Ms. Laurie Sefton provided an excellent summary of UNIX
security issues. 
Ms. Sefton correctly noted that network security problems
and solutions 
are arrayed along a continuum from mundane to the critical.<P>

We would point out an important omission in the article.
The article 
discussed public domain software that addressed certain
security issues. 
Many sys admins in the commercial environment would
prefer to use 
software that is developed by a company with technical
support and 
long-term commitment to customer satisfaction. Los Altos
Technologies 
co-developed a program called Fortress (TM) that checks
for viruses, 
worms, Trojan horses and unsecure passwords in UNIX.
Los Altos Technologies 
has also developed UniShred Pro (TM), a government approved
security 
data remnant remover and TermServ (TM), a modem pool
management and 
security dialback program. Information on this and other
UNIX security 
products can be obtained by contacting Los Altos Technologies
at 1-800-999-UNIX 
or any large UNIX reseller such as the Qualix Group,
Inc..<P>

Respectfully,<br>

<I>Thank you for writing, and for the additional information.

Subject: foobar<P>

In response to your response to Gary Perratt's letter
in Vol. 1, Issue 
4: The term &quot;foobar,&quot; I believe, is a variant
on the military 
acronym &quot;fubar,&quot; which, in very mild terms,
stands for &quot;fouled 
up beyond all recognition,&quot; (a close relative of
&quot;snafu&quot; 
-- &quot;situation normal, all fouled up&quot;). I think
the terms 
&quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; were originally
used in UNIX as common, 
nondescript names for temporary variables, usually seen
in C code 
examples. Does anybody know where &quot;foo,&quot; &quot;bar,&quot;
and 
&quot;foobar&quot; were first used in UNIX? Can we get
to the &quot;root&quot; 
of this?<P>

<I>World War II started a lot of technical and sarcastic
acronyms. 
I have never been able to trace fubar earlier than WWII,
although 
I haven't spent much time searching. Larry Reznick tells
me he has 
seen some dictionaries list fubar with unabridged, unabashed

definitions. However, Morris Dictionary of Word and
Phrase Origins, 
by William &amp; Mary Morris, makes only a passing reference
to fubar 
and snafu. My favorite dictionary, The American Heritage

Dictionary, really let me down. It doesn't even list
fubar 
(in any form), but it does give an unabashed explanation
of snafu's 
roots.<P>

As for the first use in UNIX, I can't claim any knowledge.

Anyone care to nominate a document as candidate for
&quot;first usage&quot;?

Subject: Disaster Recovery<P>

In this month's &quot;Publisher's Forum&quot; you write:<P>

&gt;Third, it's not enough to &quot;know&quot; how to
recover from a serious 
failure. You must practice the procedure. ...<P>

&gt;From now on we practice major recoveries on a regular
schedule.<P>

That's an important point, unfortunately it's not necessary
for all 
of us. I admin enough different machines in different
labs that disaster 
recovery is a fairly common occurrence. As a result
I find that I 
take a &quot;defensive posture&quot; from system setup
time.<P>

Most of my labs are diskful Suns with 2+ machines big
enough to handle 
at least some server duties. I establish at least 1
slave yp server, 
keep 2 copies of common directories (i.e., /usr/local)
on two different 
machines, and spread the user accounts over 2 or more
of the machines. 
This way, if a disk goes south, at most half of the
users will be 
dead and the time to bring common system tools back
is minimized. 
I also keep fairly up-to-date copies of the output from
commands like 
dkinfo, dmesg and df offline to aid in recovery.<P>

It's not enough to just know how to recover, a little
effort ahead 
of time can drastically minimize the effort spent after
the disaster.<P>

<I>You're right, of course. Admins who manage a large number

of machines probably don't need to make a special effort
to keep their 
recover skills honed. We do. It occurs to me that practice
is simply 
one part of the &quot;little effort ahead of time&quot;
that reduces 
the pain. Practice, unlike planning, is just a little
less cerebral.<P>

I'd certainly like to have an article that gives detailed

information about how to configure for, and accomplish,
recoveries 
in a distributed environment. Perhaps you'd like to
write something?

Subject: UNIX VIRI<br>

Hello,<br>

Say, I just wanted to drop a line to say how much I
enjoy your magazines. 
I am wondering if you might put the index, or even some
articles on 
the Usenet. Also, I am trying to find some info on UNIX
virus scanners. 
Do you have any leads? Keep up the good work. We here
in the trenches 
appreciate . . .<P>

<I>Thanks for writing. The code listings are available
via 
uucp and ftp. I don't think the articles will be available
for downloading 
-- how would we pay our bills?! How about the virus
scanners? Does 
anyone out there have some leads? --rlw</I><P>



Hi, Robert<br>

I'm one of your many happy subscribers. Fortunately,
I had a chance 
to talk to you at UniForum in SF. At the time, I asked
if I can post 
a question to you for help and you agreed. Thanks for
your help in 
advance. Here it is: I'm trying to set up a HP Laserjet
II printer 
on my Sparc 2's ttyb port. The printer has 2 meg of
RAM and configuration 
seemed to be correct (according to the user's menu).
The printer works 
fine if there is only one page to print but displays
&quot;protocol 
error&quot; if there is more than 1 page. The serial
cable that I used 
is 50 feet long. The printcap file on my Sparc 2 is
as follows:<P>
<PRE>
lp|HPLaser jet II-ttyb:lp=/dev/ttyb:br#9600:\
:ms=-parity,cs8,-cstopb,-tabs,clocal,cread,-echo,ixon,-opost:\
:pw#80:lf=/var/spool/hp/error_log:sd=/var/spool/hp:\
:of=/usr/lib/hplaserjet:</pre><p>
<p>
Would you be able to help me on this? I'd like to set
it up so people 
on the network can share the printer also. Thanks again,<br>

David Yang<P>

<I>This sounds like a flow control problem. An &quot;stty
-a&quot; 
report would be more informative than the printcap entry.
The main 
question is: have you enabled xon/xoff flow control?
At both the printer 
and the host? Have you disabled hardware flow control
(RTS, CTS, DTR, 
DSR, CD)? If so, is the reverse signal channel properly
cabled? (Both 
pin 2 and pin 3 must connect appropriately to pin 2
and pin 3 at the 
host.) <P>

It wouldn't hurt to put a breakout box on each side
of the 
cable and watch the signals during a print job. Pins
2 and 3 (and 
7 for ground) are usually all you need for the data,
but to disable 
hardware flow control you may need to short several
pins in the connectors 
on each end of the comm link. Specifically, you should
short pin 4 
to pin 5, and, separately, short pins 6, 8, and 20.<P>

That's my best guess. Anyone else care to contribute?

Dear Robert:<br>

I have received a number of questions from people asking
about programs 
like u386mon for DEC RISC Ultrix machines. I only know
of one program, 
which is also freely available, called monitor. This
monitor and other 
tools are available via anonymous ftp from gatekeeper.dec.com<P>

<I>Thanks for sharing the pointer. I'm certain many will
appreciate 
the information. --rlw</I><P>
