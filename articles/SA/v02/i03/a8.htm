<H1>The Sentinel</H1><p>
<P>
William Genosa<P>

System administrators are responsible for ensuring the
availability 
of their machines to users. When servers crash or backups
fail, the 
users are inconvenienced, which will most likely result
in trouble 
for the system administrator. If you are a sys admin
for more than 
one machine and your machines are networked together
with TCP/IP, 
then you may want to set up a Sentinel to watch over
your network 
and inform you of a system crash or backup failure.
A modem and a 
beeper would also be required.<P>

My network consists of eight 3B2 hosts running AT&amp;T
System V Rel 3.2.2 
networked together with TCP/IP over ethernet. The Sentinel
is cpu4 
and the two servers I am concerned with are cpu5 and
cpu8. 
My servers reboot each weeknight and run unattended
level zero backups 
to back up the entire system. A failure on a server
would result in 
downtime the next morning that would cost my company
thousands of 
dollars. If a server crashes at night, the Sentinel
alerts me so that 
I can take corrective action before my users arrive
in the morning. 
This makes my boss very happy.<P>

The program makes use of the ruptime command, which
displays 
the status of hosts on a local area network. Output
of the command 
uses the following format:<P>
<PRE>
cpu1    up     9:40,    5 users,   load 0.04, 0.08, 0.05
cpu2    up  2+04:25,    8 users,   load 0.08, 1.23, 0.40
cpu3    up     8:35,    5 users,   load 1.00, 1.01, 1.06
cpu4    up     8:43,    6 users,   load 1.04, 1.00, 0.95
cpu5    up     8:47,   75 users,   load 4.60, 3.90, 4.65
cpu6    up  5+07:50,    0 users,   load 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
cpu7  down     0:20
cpu8    up     8:45,   65 users,   load 4.70, 4.20, 3.85</pre><p>
<p>
The first field represents the name of the host. The

second field displays the status of the host. The third
field shows 
how long the host has been up and running in days, hours,
and minutes. 
The fourth and fifth fields tell how many users are
currently logged 
in. The last four fields display the system load or
average number 
of processes over the last one, five, and fifteen minutes.<P>

The program also makes use of uucp. My backup scripts
have 
been modified to test for the exit status of cpio because
I 
use cpio to create backups. If the backup is successful
on 
the server, I send a file to cpu4, the Sentinel, using
the 
following commands:<P>
<PRE>
cpio -Obv -O/dev/RSA/qtape2 &lt; /tmp/backup.list


if [ &quot;$?&quot; -ne 0 ]
then
echo The backup failed on `hostname` at `date`. | mail root

else
echo The backup was successful on `hostname` at `date`. | mail root

&gt;/tmp/backup.ok
uuto /tmp/backup.ok cpu4!bill
fi     </pre><p>
<p>
The routine tests for a successful backup by testing

the exit status of cpio. The if conditional checks $?,

the exit status. If the exit status is zero, I create
a zero-length 
file called backup.ok and send it to cpu4 using the

uuto utility. If sent from the server cpu5, this file

would be sent to cpu4 and be placed in the directory
/usr/spool/uucppublic/receive/bill/cpu5. 
If the Sentinel doesn't find the file
/usr/spool/uucppublic/receive/bill/cpu5/backup.ok, it
will 
use the cu utility to page me on my beeper.<P>

The sample entries here have been appended to the uucp
configuration 
file, /usr/lib/uucp/Systems. Similar entries would be
required 
on your Sentinel host. The first field of the Systems
file 
usually represents a hostname. I have created bogus
hostnames to allow 
the Sentinel host the ability to dial a beeper number
and transmit 
a code which briefly describes the problem.<P>

The entries that follow are called with cu; they are
used to 
notify the system administrator by sending a code on
his or her beeper.<P>
<PRE>
### The server called cpu5 has crashed.
cpu5down Any ACU 9600 93631448,,,,,5551111


### The server called cpu8 has crashed.
cpu8down Any ACU 9600 93631448,,,,,8881111

### The backup has failed on cpu5.
badback5 Any ACU 9600 93631448,,,,,5552222

### The backup has failed on cpu8.
badback8 Any ACU 9600 93631448,,,,,8882222</pre><p>
<p>
The next entry is a sample entry for those of you who

have a SkyPager Beeper. Notice the use of the pound
key and the trailing 
comma.<P>
<PRE>
Any ACU 9600 918007597243,,,,,6182093#,,,,5551111#,</pre><p>
<p>
The Sentinel program should run constantly to keep watch

over the critical hosts. For this reason I start the
program from 
an rc script which runs at boot time. (See the sidebar
for 
a brief explanation of how rc scripts work.)<P>

The rc script I use (see Listing 1) is called sentinel

and is located in the directory /etc/init.d. It is then

linked to /etc/rc2.d/S99sentinel. No action will be
needed 
upon shutdown. If there were a need to take action,
the same file 
would also be linked to /etc/rc0.d/K99sentinel.<P>

The Sentinel program (Listing 2) can be modified to
monitor other 
critical events on your network. This is an example
of pro-active 
system administration. Systems will crash and backups
will fail but 
you can still attempt to minimize the effect this will
have on you 
user community. <P>
