<B>Sea Change Announces SCSI Navigator Software and ESD Subsystems Kits</B><P>

Sea Change Corporation has announced SCSI NAVIGATOR,
a suite of integrated 
functions supporting installation and operation of SCSI
storage devices 
on SCO UNIX based systems. SCSI NAVIGATOR utilities
are divided into 
two groups: On-line Utilities and Off-line Utilities.
The On-line 
Utilities run as a privileged application under SCO
UNIX and replace 
several command-line-oriented programs. Functions are
provided for 
disk formatting, device testing, partitioning, performance
profiling, 
and data backup/restore. Full support is provided for
partitioning 
disk drives for both UNIX and DOS operation.<P>

The Off-line Utilities run directly on the system hardware,
with no 
host operating system required. This capability is provided
by software 
which interacts directly with the system's SCSI controller,
and lets 
systems backup tapes be accessed even if the main system
disk has 
failed. Both programs use the same user interface, with
color, menus, 
and context sensitive help.<P>

Sea Change describes a &quot;MISSION CRITICAL backup/restore
function,&quot; 
which allows users to perform a partial or full system
image backup 
using the On-line utilities, and in the event of a system
disk failure, 
restore the entire UNIX system using the Off-line utilities
&quot;in 
as little as 10 minutes.&quot; <P>

SCSI NAVIGATOR supports SCSI disks or tape drives conforming
to SCSI-1 
or SCSI-2 standards, and high capacity tape devices
including QIC-150, 
QIC-525, 4mm DAT drives, 8mm helical scan drives, and
traditional 
9 track drives. <P>

Sea Change also announced the External SCSI Disk (ESD)
subsystem kit 
for UNIX systems. Ranging in capacity from 480 Mb to
2 Gb the ESD 
kit lets the system support a range of application solutions.
The 
kits include SCSI Navigator, an external SCSI disk with
cables, a 
preformatted disk drive, and (optionally) an Adaptec
SCSI controller.<P>

In addition to the ESD kits, several SCSI tape storage
kits (525 Mb 
Streaming, 2.5 Gb Exabyte, 5.0 Gb Exabyte, and 1.3 Gb
DAT) and mainframe 
level SCSI disk kits are also available as &quot;plug
and play&quot; 
products. For more information, contact Sea Change Corporation,

<B>Advanced Archival Products Introduces AMASS 4.0</B><P>

Advanced Archival Products, Inc. has introduced AMASS
4.0, a UNIX 
filesystem and driver for jukeboxes. AMASS 4.0 is a
direct-access 
filesystem which supports a single filesystem view of
jukeboxes of 
varied sizes and media types.<P>

The jukebox is available through a single local or NFS
mount point. 
Files and directories can span media, letting the filesystem
and directories 
be of unlimited size, and files can be the full size
supported by 
the host operating system. AMASS 4.0 is compatible with
existing applications, 
UNIX utilities, and network protocols, so application
programs which 
normally access files on magnetic disks can operate
with the optical 
or tape jukebox without modification. AMASS 4.0 maintains
an online 
index of jukebox directories and files, providing magnetic
disk equivalent 
performance without having to load optical or tape media,
and magnetic 
disk caching, which supports multi-user/multi-tasking
access and high-speed 
magnetic disk access of the most recently used file
data. AMASS provides 
multifunction drive support for erasable optical, WORM,
and magnetic 
tape media in the same jukebox. AMASS can also provide
a single mount 
point, a single filesystem interface for daisy-chained
jukeboxes on 
a single platform. AMASS 4.0 supports the most common
UNIX platforms, 
and over 42 jukebox models from 12 manufacturers, with
capacities 
ranging from 3 Gigabytes to many Terabytes.<P>

Prices for AMASS 4.0 start at $6,000. For more information,
contact 
Advanced Archival Products, Inc. 6595 S. Dayton St.,

<B>Puzzle Systems Introduces SoftNet Client</B><P>

Puzzle Systems Corporation has introduced SoftNet Client,
NetWare 
Client emulation for UNIX platforms. SoftNet Client
lets users of 
HP 9000, Silicon Graphics, and SPARC platforms act as
Novell NetWare 
clients and directly access Intel-based NetWare file
servers. The 
UNIX workstation user can log onto and mount the drivers
of NetWare 
file servers without the need for NFS support on the
NetWare server. 
IPX support is provided to the workstation without interfering
with 
its native TCP/IP capabilities.<P>

SoftNet Client does not require UNIX kernel reconfiguration
or disk 
partitioning. In addition to NetWare server file access,
the workstation 
user can send print jobs to NetWare printers. At present,
NetWare 
2.2 and 3.11 server types are supported by SoftNet Client.
According 
to Puzzle Systems, &quot;SoftNet Client further adds
to the interoperability 
option available to users of mixed NetWare/UNIX environments.
If you 
would like to have your UNIX platforms also act as fast
NetWare compatible 
file servers, consider SoftNet Utilities; if you prefer
to have your 
UNIX platforms act as NetWare compatible clients, SoftNet
Client is 
the correct product.&quot;<P>

SoftNet Client is priced at $395 for a single user license
and $1,495 
for a five-user license regardless of UNIX platform
type. For more 
information, contact Puzzle Systems Corporation, 16360

<B>Interstream Releases eNFS/PFS</B><P>

Interstream, Inc., has released eNFS/PFS (Personal File
Server), an 
eNFS implementation that resides on client workstations
and provides 
continued access to NFS data during interruptions due
to NFS server 
failures or overloading. Built on Interstream's eNFS/Cache,
eNFS/PFS 
loads transparently into the client workstation and
is positioned 
between the application environment and the workstation's
TCP/IP communications 
software, where it monitors NFS requests during normal
operations. 
eNFS/PFS monitors the combination of server-client NFS
requests and 
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) responses and activates
whenever either 
of these operations requires intervention due to a non-responding

NFS server.<P>

Systems administrators can give developers isolation
from temporary 
interruptions in a server's availability through eNFS/PFS's
disconnected 
NFS write subsystem. This feature allows the client's
own disk to 
act as a personal NFS server when the mounted NFS server
is not responding. 
eNFS/PFS also supports reconnection services that update
the appropriate 
NFS server when communications are restored. eNFS/PFS
lets portable 
UNIX NFS clients operate disconnected from an NFS server.
No modifications 
are necessary to NFS server or NFS clients not using
eNFS/PFS.<P>

eNFS/PFS, including eNFS/Cache, is priced at $495 per
NFS client. 
Upgrades from eNFS/Cache are $300 per client. For more
information, 
contact Interstream, Inc., 1501 Reedsdale St., Pittsburgh,
PA 15233-2329; 
(412) 323-8000; FAX: (412) 323-1930.<P>

uses the National 
Semiconductor two-chip FDDI chip set. Performance Technologies
describes 
the PT-VME600 as easily maintaining a sustained data
throughput of 
over 90% of the LAN media bandwidth. The dual-attached
(DAS) version 
of the PT-VME600 is designed for front-end network applications
such 
as image processing, multimedia, and CAD/CAM; but it
is also well 
suited as a backbone network to tie together the main
components of 
a distributed system. The FDDI interface conforms to
ANSI (X3T9.5) 
standards and has been optimized for network control
and protocol 
processing. PMD options include ST and MIC Multimode
fiber and SDDI 
copper. The controller can be configured as either a
single or dual 
attach. Extension via a P2 connector provides concentrator
support 
with a dual path interface to an 8-port copper media
master port card 
or a 4-port copper or optical master port card. The
PT-VME340 is a 
VMEbus Serial I/O module for T1/E1 rates - a four-port
wide area network 
controller designed to sustain serial I/O rates up to
10 Mb/sec. The 
PT-VME340 is build around the Zilog 16C32 ISCC, based
on the Z8530 
SCC, but including an eight-channel 16-bit I/O DMA controller
with 
&quot;chained Link List capabilities&quot; for high-speed
data movement. 
The SIO throughput of the PT-VME340 is in excess of
4 Mb/sec on all 
four ports (full duplex) and up to 10Mb/sec on one port
(full duplex). 
Physical interfaces are supplied via the PTI Line Adapter
Boards (LABs), 
providing RS-232C, RS-422, RS-485, Mil Std 188C/114,
