<B>Advanced Archival Products Introduces AMASS-Migrator</B><P>

Advanced Archival Products, Inc. has introduced AMASS-Migrator,
hierarchical storage management software.  AMASS-Migrator
provides both
transparent file migration and the ability to directly
access optical
disk and tape libraries.  During file migration, AMASS-Migrator
automatically makes space available when a magnetic
disk's filesystem
begins to fill or when user-defined migration criteria
are met. 
AMASS-Migrator assesses the status of files and, based
on the system
administrator's criteria, transparently moves the identified
files to
less costly storage, such as optical jukeboxes or tape
libraries.  To
the application, migrated files still appear to be present
and are
transparently retrieved when accessed.<P>

AMASS-Migrator may be configured for server or client/server
operation
and runs as a layered product on AAP's AMASS filesystem.
AMASS is a
direct access jukebox file system that provides a single-device,
