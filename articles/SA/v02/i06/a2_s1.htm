<H1>Sidebar: Excerpt from the SAGE Job Description Document</H1><p>
<P>
Organizations that rely on computing resources to carry
out their 
mission have always depended on systems administration
and systems 
administrators. The dramatic increase in the number
and size of distributed 
networks of workstations in recent years has created
a tremendous 
demand for more, and better trained, systems administrators.
Understanding 
of the profession of systems administration on the part
of employers, 
however, has not kept pace with the growth in the number
of systems 
administrators or with the growth in complexity of system
administration 
tasks. Both at sites with a long history of using computing
resources 
and at sites into which computers have only recently
been introduced, 
systems administrators face perception problems that
present serious 
obstacles to their successfully carrying out their duties.
Systems 
administration is a widely varied task. The best systems
administrators 
are generalists: they can wire and repair cables, install
new software, 
repair bugs, train users, offer tips for increased productivity
across 
areas from word processing to CAD tools, evaluate new
hardware and 
software, automate a myriad of mundane tasks, and increase
work flow 
at their site. In general, systems administrators enable
people to 
exploit computers at a level which gains leverage for
the entire organization. <P>

Employers frequently fail to understand the background
that systems 
administrators bring to their task. Because systems
administration 
draws on knowledge from many fields, and because it
has only recently 
begun to be taught at a few institutions of higher learning,
systems 
administrators may come from a wide range of academic
backgrounds. 
Most get their skills through on-the-job training by
apprenticing 
themselves to a more experienced mentor. Although the
system of informal 
education by apprenticeship has been extremely effective
in producing 
skilled systems administrators, it is poorly understood
by employers 
and hiring managers, who tend to focus on credentials
to the exclusion 
of other factors when making personnel decisions. Understanding
system 
administrators' background, training, and the kind of
job performance 
to be expected is challenging; too often, employers
fall back into 
(mis)using the job classifications with which they are
familiar. These 
job classification problems are exacerbated by the scarcity
of job 
descriptions for systems administrators. One frequently
used misclassification 
is that of programmer or software engineer. Although
the primary responsibility 
of the systems administrator is not to produce code,
that is the metric 
by which programmers are evaluated, and systems administrators
thus 
classified often receive poor evaluations for not being
&quot;productive&quot; 
enough. Another common misclassification is the confusion
of systems 
administrators with operators. Especially at smaller
sites, where 
systems administrators themselves have to perform many
of the functions 
normally assigned (at larger sites) to operators, systems
administrators 
are forced to contend with the false assumption they
are non-professional 
technicians. This, in turn, makes it very difficult
for systems 
administrators to be compensated commensurate with their
skill and 
experience. <P>
