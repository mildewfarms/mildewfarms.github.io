<B>LISA VI Conference</B><P>

The USENIX LISA VI system administration conference
is now over. A 
number of good papers were presented, but, as always,


many of the 
highlights of the conference came in the course of social
contacts 
between system administration peers in the hallways
and bars of the 
conference hotel. Except for those at very large sites,
system administrators 
usually have no peers at work. Users may be friends,
but they cannot 
be peers, because their perspectives and needs are so
different from 
the system administrator's.<P>

Among the interesting papers presented were Paul Anderson's
&quot;Effective 
Use of Local Workstation Disks in an NFS Network,&quot;
Peg Shafer's 
&quot;Is Centralized System Administration the Answer?&quot;
Carol Kubicki's 
&quot;Customer Satisfaction, Metrics and Measurement,&quot;
and Richard 
Elling and Matthew Long's &quot;user-setup: A System
for Custom Configuration 
of User Environments, or Helping Users Help Themselves.&quot;
Most 
interesting to me was Michael A. Cooper's &quot;Overhauling
Rdist 
for the '90s,&quot; a description of a new version of
rdist, 
which was first introduced in 4.3 BSD UNIX. This version
promises 
to fix many of the problems in the original rdist that
had 
to do with large-scale distribution.<P>

<B>LISA VII in 1993</B><P>

Although LISA VI is barely over, the work on next year's
LISA conference, 
to take place November 1-5 in Monterey, California,
is already underway. 
The Call for Papers will be out before the USENIX Winter
conference 
in January, but in the meantime, here's a little taste
of what we 
are working on. The topic, &quot;The Human Aspect of
UNIX System Administration,&quot; 
reflects the fact that system administrators have come
to recognize 
that providing good support is not only a technical
task, but also 
one which requires dealing with human beings. This is
not to say that 
LISA will become an amateur psychology gathering. What
we hope for 
is submissions that deal practically with management
of the human 
aspect -- through policies, procedures, and improved
forms of communication. 
Of course, traditional technical papers will be welcomed
in the usual 
fashion. <P>

<B>The Interop Exhibition</B><P>

The Interop exhibition, one of the major tradeshows
in the UNIX community, 
took place in San Francisco the week after LISA VI.
The fact that 
this show has grown so much must be proof of the commercial
success 
of UNIX. This year was the first in San Francisco --
the show had 
been in San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley, in
previous years.<P>

The size of the show is now almost intimidating, and
it's packed with 
vendors who claim to have all the solutions to one's
problems, if 
one will only purchase their application. While many
vendors did indeed 
have good solutions to some of the problems, the oft-repeated
claim 
of having the one and only solution served to heighten
my natural 
skepticim. Taken in moderation, however, the show is
a very good source 
of information. I decided ahead of time to focus on
low-priced routers, 
and was able to obtain some good information in this
area.<P>

The routers provided by well-known companies such as
Cisco and Wallfleet 
are all of the high-performance kind and are priced
accordingly. I 
was looking for alternatives, capable of performing
well enough for 
a slip connection or a 56Kbit lease line and priced
within reason 
for smaller companies. I found a couple of possible
solutions.<P>

One of the most facinating possibilities was a T1 radio-wave
solution 
from Cylink. Using this kind of technology, you pay
only the setup 
cost and the cost to the Internet service provider,
but no cost for 
leased lines from the phone company. Cylink claims that
this technology 
works up to a distance of 10 miles, with very slight
deterioration 
in bad weather.<P>

Network Application Technology showed an IP router,
the LANB/290 Remote 
IP Router, which seems to qualify as one as the lowest-priced
routers 
on the market. Each router comes with a LAN connection,
one console 
port, and a data link connection for RS-232, RS-449/422,
V.35, or 
X.21. It uses the PPP over the serial link, and will
support SNMP.<P>

CMC Network Products unit of Rockwell International
presented 
the Net Hopper, a dialup TCP/IP router, which seems
to be positioned 
as competiton to the NetBlazer from Telebit. With the
modem(s) built 
in, the Net Hopper is very competitively priced at $2,000
with one 
modem and one LAN connection, or $3,500 with one LAN
and three modems. 
CMC claims that the Net Hopper is easier to set up than
a stereo system 
(I find this hard to believe, especially since the Net
Hopper 
seems to support package filtering).<P>

<B>Defense Fund for Berkeley UNIX</B><P>

Berry Shein, president of Software Tool &amp; Die, is
working on creating 
a defense fund for the University of California in the
UNIX System 
Laboratories copyright suit against BSDI and the University
of California 
at Berkeley.<P>

And now to this month's questions.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 What is the ARPANET?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 The ARPANET no longer exists, so the question must

be rephrased as &quot;What was the ARPANET?&quot; However,

since the ARPANET had a very significant influence on
the 
development of the Internet as it exists today, the
question is worth 
answering.<P>

The ARPANET was funded by the US Department of Defense
Advanced Research 
Projects Agency, ARPA (later DARPA) in the late 1960s.
It was an experimental 
network that spanned the United States, and was used
by the goverment 
to share computer resources across the continent. During
the early 
1980s, the TCP/IP protocol family was developed, and
made generally 
available through the University of California at Berkeley.
TCP/IP 
made it easier for many organizations, such as universities,
to connect 
to the ARPANET. In just a few years, ARPANET grew from
connecting 
relatively few machines to become the backbone of a
large number of 
local networks. And the Internet was born. In the 1980s
the ARPA network 
experiment was terminated by DARPA, and the NFS network,
provided 
by the National Science Foundation took over. Today,
the Internet 
is made up of many wide area networks, such as NFSNET,
and in fact 
covers the entire world.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 You often emphasize in your writing and talks the need

for system administrators to be able to deal with people.
Are there 
any books or tutorials you can recommend to help me
with this?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Unfortunately, I know of no books or courses that address

these issues. Over the years, I've learned from practical
experience 
and mistakes made in the process. The books I've found
useful have 
been various books on management, even though the form
of management 
practiced by a system administrator in dealing with
users and daily 
management is in a somewhat different category. If I
had to recommend 
one book, it would probably be Tom DeMarco's People
Ware. This 
book deals mainly with software development, but it
also contains 
good deal of common sense on how to work with people.<P>

Changes have been slow in coming about. In the beginning,
when I encouraged 
people to work on this area, many administrators were
still completely 
caught up in the technical issues of the profession.
Now a number 
of people have told me they are excited about the theme
of the next 
LISA conference, and in just the last few weeks, an
additional SAGE 
working group has been created. The new group, sage-managers,
will 
explore how, from the system administrator's perspective,
to manage 
management.<P>

Your best bet, however, is still to use common sense,
and to be able 
to listen to users' and management's wishes and requirements.
<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 In articles on USENET, I often see references to something

called a &quot;firewall.&quot; It seems to be something
you need when 
you are connecting to the Internet. Could you explain
a bit more?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 A firewall is a security tool that you can use to protect

your site from unwanted access from the Internet. Strictly
speaking, 
it is not necessary, but it is very much recommended.
<P>

The firewall serves two purposes. One is to give you
very high degree 
of control over who and what can access your site; the
second is to 
limit this control only to the point where your site
connects to the 
Internet. Your site is then rather like a shellfish,
hard on the outside 
and soft on the inside.<P>

The firewall itself consist of two items, a router and
a computer, 
the latter often referred to as the gateway (as it is
the single point 
of access to the Internet). The router, sometimes also
called the 
choke, must be set up to ensure that any network packet
it lets through 
must come from, or be destined to, the gateway machine.
This makes 
it impossible to connect to or from any other machine
on your network 
other than the gateway. In turn, the gateway must be
set up to forward 
any package to or from the Internet in a reasonable
manner -- otherwise, 
users will have to log on to the gateway machine itself,
which could 
all too easily compromise the security of both the gateway
and your 
system. The problems this strategy creates for e-mail
can fairly easily 
be resolved through use of aliases and MX records. Problems
with other 
services, like ftp, are more difficult, but can be resolved
through 
use of a proxy mechanism, such as SOCKS (written by
Michelle and David 
Koblas). SOCKS is available by anonymous ftp from s1.gov.<P>

In the above example, the router must be configured
to reject all 
traffic, except the one fulfilling certain requirements.
It is also 
possible to set up a firewall with a different filtering
mechanism, 
where traffic is let through by default and specific
configurations 
are denied. I believe this approach to be somewhat less
secure, however, 
and a lot more difficult to make functional.<P>

The above explanation is somewhat simplified due to
space constraint. 
For more information, I recommend two good books from
O'Reilly and 
Associates, both of which can be helpful in setting
up a firewall. 
One is the Practical UNIX Security, by Simson Garfinkel
and 
Gene Spafford; the second is DNS and BIND, by Paul Albitz
and 
Cricket Liu. <P>
