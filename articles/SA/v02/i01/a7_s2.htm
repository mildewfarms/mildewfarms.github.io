<P>
ICMP -- Internet Control Message Protocol. 
Used by hosts and routers to inform neighbors of problems,
better 
routes, or other control information. The ping command
takes 
advantage of the ICMP &quot;echo request&quot; to determine
if a remote 
host is capable of responding.<P>

Internet -- When capitalized, it refers 
to the vast number of networks throughout the world
that are most 
often attached by leased or dial-up lines. Otherwise,
it refers to 
any network of networks.<P>

packet/datagram -- Often used interchangeably, 
a packet strictly refers to the data sent through a
packet-switched 
network while a datagram is often used to denote not
just the data 
but the headers as well.<P>

protocol stack -- Conceptually, several 
protocol definitions, each of which passes data to the
protocol &quot;above&quot; 
or &quot;below&quot; it. The typical suite of protocols
consists of 
layers such as ethernet, IP, TCP, and an application
program.<P>

router/gateway -- Both terms are often 
used very loosely. A router (or gateway) attaches to
more than one 
network and decides which way to direct packets. In
the context of 
the IP protocol, gateways and routers are equivalent.
Otherwise, a 
router is more often used to denote a device that forwards
packets 
of the same protocol, while a gateway forwards packets
between different 
protocols.<P>

TCP/IP -- Transmission Control Protocol/Internet 
Protocol. Very often, &quot;TCP/IP&quot; is used to
describe the Internet 
protocols, and vice versa. The full name is &quot;TCP/IP
Internet Protocol 
Suite.&quot; A full definition of either TCP or IP is
beyond the scope 
of a simple glossary.<P>

UDP -- User Datagram Protocol. If a virtual 
circuit is not required by the application program,
then UDP may be 
the better choice than TCP, since does not have so much
overhead. 
UDP still allows programs to use port numbers in order
to multiplex 
among different applications, but is not burdened with
the complexity 
required by TCP's guaranteed delivery.<P>

virtual circuit -- A reliable data stream 
between, in the case of Internet protocols, two TCP
modules. Regardless 
of the path taken by multiple packets, and regardless
of the time 
taken by those packets in transit, TCP attempts to make
it appear 
to the application program that there is an error-free
line between 
the two machines.<P>

WAN -- Wide Area Network. Usually refers 
to geographically disparate nodes or local networks
linked by dial-up 
or leased lines. <P>
