          <p> You can read detailed descriptions along with tips for 
            protecting your system from attacks targeting these vulnerabilities at the 
            SANS Web site: http://www.sans.org/top20/. 
          <p> Also, this month here at Sys Admin we say good-bye to 
            our managing editor, Rikki Kite, who is leaving the publication to pursue a 
            graduate degree and other opportunities. Rikki has been with Sys Admin for 
            almost 7 years and has been a great asset to the magazine because of her 
            fun-loving spirit and creativity as well as her competence and 
            resourcefulness. We wish Rikki success in all things, and we will miss her. 
          <p> Until we find a new managing editor for the magazine, 
            Hal Pomeranz and I will be handling the author correspondence, so if you 
            have an idea for an article, please send your proposal or manuscript to 
            SAeditors@cmp.com. Currently, we're looking for articles on backup 
            and recovery, clustering, database management, and networking, and we look 
            forward to hearing from you. 
          <p> Sincerely yours, 
          <p> Amber Ankerholz <br>
            Editor in Chief 
          <p>
