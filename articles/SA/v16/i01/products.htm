            <B>HP Enhances Cluster Portfolio for High-Performance Computing</B> 
          <p> HP has announced enhancements to its Unified Cluster 
            Portfolio for high-performance computing (HPC). Product updates include 
            support for new HP servers and workstations powered by Quad-Core Intel Xeon 
            5300 series processors. The HP Cluster Platform 3000 system now runs new 
            Quad-Core processor-based HP ProLiant servers that, according to the 
            company, offer greater energy efficiency and can improve system performance 
            by nearly 50 percent. 
          <p> Additionally, the HP Scalable Visualization Array 
            (SVA) V2.0 is available on the new HP xw8400 Workstations running the 
            Quad-Core processors. These HPC systems and software are part of the HP 
            Unified Cluster Portfolio, a comprehensive, modular package of hardware, 
            software and services to help customers manage, store, access, and 
            visualize the large volumes of data created by highly complex science, 
            engineering, and analysis applications. More information is available at:

            <b>Evergrid Announces High-Performance Resource Management Software</b>
          <p> Evergrid, Inc., a provider of advanced quality of 
            application service management for next generation datacenters, has 
            announced its entry into the high-performance computing market with patent 
            pending high availability and resource management software that lets 
            massively parallelized distributed applications run at near 100 percent 
            reliability on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. 
          <p> The Evergrid software sits between the operating 
            system and the applications, and captures the collective state of the 
            application and its IO across all processors. By recording the state of the 
            application, Evergrid is able to checkpoint and recover from failures 
            rapidly with minimal overhead. The software installs on Linux systems and 
            requires no modifications to either the OS or application. It is scalable 
            up to thousands of nodes at a time, with less than five percent performance 
            overhead. For more information, visit: http://www.Evergrid.com.
