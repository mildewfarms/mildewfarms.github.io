            <p> Quentin Hartman 
          <p> From the desktop to the server room, there is a place 
            for Linux in nearly any educational institution, large or small. The 
            flexibility, stability, and cost savings Linux offers is compelling. With 
            the right skills and careful planning, things that were impossible become 
            possible, and formerly daunting tasks become simple. 
          <p> This is particularly true in small and medium-sized 
            K-12 institutions where IT budgets are often woefully insufficient. For 
            example, the annual technology budget I worked with most recently for 
            equipment, maintenance, ink and toner, telephone systems, and software 
            costs amounted to just under $30 per student, or $50 per workstation. With 
            the needs of staff and students and the expectations now put on technology 
            this isn't a lot to work with. Stretching every penny is absolutely 
            required. 
          <p> Linux helps stretch that money. Not only is there 
            direct savings to be had in the form of license fees that need not be paid 
            for a variety of software, there are indirect savings in the form of lower 
            maintenance and lengthened hardware life cycles. The best part of all this 
            is that the barrier to entry is significantly lower than many people expect 
            and educational institutions can begin realizing some of these savings even 
            if their IT staff has little or no Linux or Unix experience. 
          <p>

            <b>Linux on the Desktop</b>
          <p>

"Linux on the desktop" has been the 
            subject of countless articles, discussions, and flame wars over the years. 
            Both sides have strong arguments in the right context. That's the 
            key, context. I often characterize Linux on the desktop as a "95% 
            solution", meaning that for 95% of the people 95% of the time, it 
            works just fine. Most of the arguments I have seen against Linux on the 
            desktop recently hinge around the fact that it is unsuitable for some 
            specific and often uncommon task. That's a fine and perfectly valid 
            argument. If that one task means the difference between "works" 
            and "doesn't work", then in that context, Linux 
            isn't ready. 
          <p> Luckily for educators, Linux is ready for a large 
            number of common desktop tasks that are seen in schools. Admittedly, there 
            are a number of specialized educational software titles that won't 
            work. However, the common tasks of Web browsing, word processing, 
            presentation creation, mind-mapping, typing practice, graphics 
            manipulation, and page layout are all handled easily by software running on 
            Linux. And, in most cases, the data generated by these programs can be 
            easily moved to other platforms. This makes Linux particularly well suited 
            to computers in libraries, drop-in labs, and secondary computers in 
            classrooms. Additionally, Linux on the desktop can be a very secure and 
            low-maintenance platform on which to do these tasks. This is particularly 
            true if one uses the K12LTSP distribution to run Linux thin clients. 
          <p>

            <b>K12LTSP</b>
          <p> K12LTSP bundles the LTSP (Linux Terminal Server 
            Project) into Fedora Core along with a number of applications targeted at 
            education and then makes installation a simple turn-key affair. Out of the 
            box, K12LTSP is a completely functional terminal server environment tweaked 
            particularly for K-12 education. 
          <p> Using a terminal server allows the work of computing 
            to be centralized on the terminal server, allowing the client workstations 
            to be "thin", meaning that they have no disks and need only 
            minimal RAM and computational power. One can use "worthless" 
            obsolete hardware, or purchase low-power terminals specifically designed 
            for the task. This can lower power requirements of a typical 30-seat lab 
            significantly as well as lowering the maintenance overhead, because there 
            is only one system image to maintain. Software updates and deployments only 
            need to happen once rather than 30 times. There is little or no 
            configuration or software stored on the clients, which simplifies 
            workstation deployment and makes them more resistant to tampering. If one 
            chooses to recycle old hardware for the client workstations, some power 
            savings can still be had by eliminating the hard disks in the client 
            machines. This also allows the up-front cost of a "new" lab to 
            be lowered significantly. 
          <p> By using K12LTSP, one can run modern software at good 
            speeds using the existing client hardware for only the cost of the terminal 
            server and network upgrades. This can be substantially less costly than a 
            traditional lab using standalone PCs or Macs, thereby freeing funds for 
            other technology needs or allowing additional seats to be added for the 
            same cost. Re-using older hardware can be particularly interesting for its 
            trickle-down effect. By creatively using existing client computers as well 
            as new bare-bone whitebox PCs, I was able to upgrade a 30-seat student lab 
            to thin clients, 30 teacher workstations, add a second 27-seat thin client 
            lab, and decommission 30 unsalvageable Apple 5260s and 5400s. 
          <p> This application of K12LTSP allowed us to upgrade 60 
            seats and create an additional 27 seats for the same cost as the initially 
            proposed purchase of 30 Windows PCs. Over the course of their first year of 
            operation, the terminal labs required less than 1 hour per month of 
            maintenance, which is significantly less than the other computer labs in 
            the district. This is thanks in part to Linux's stability and 
            security, but also to the centralized management introduced with the use of 
            K12LTSP. 
          <p> Linux's mature multi-user heritage brings value 
            to the table in the form of security and configurability, which is of 
            particular advantage in educational environments. Linux's inherent 
            user/admin privilege separation prevents the students from indulging in the 
            sort of mischief that is common in schools. If they delete icons or hide 
            toolbars, they are only hurting themselves. A similar level of protection 
            can be had in Windows or Mac OS by using third-party software or if Windows 
            XP is used on the clients by applying domain policies. 
          <p> Unfortunately, those solutions represent additional 
            expense and/or complexity, which many schools are not equipped to handle, 
            and Windows 98 is still quite common in K-12 schools. This user-centric 
            configuration also allows students to customize their computing environment 
            to their liking, without affecting others or incurring the overhead and 
            complexity that turns many institutions away from using Windows roaming 
            profiles. This makes K12LTSP appealing emotionally and aids in the buy-in 
            process. 
          <p> K12LTSP offers an easily installed and managed desktop 
            environment for thin clients and standalone computers. It also has the full 
            range of Fedora Core packages available to it, which makes it a suitable 
            distribution upon which to base any number of network services, which can 
            help introduce some positive consistency into the infrastructure of an 
            organization. 
          <p>

            <b>Linux in the Server Room</b>
          <p> Traditionally, Linux is most at home in the server 
            room, and in educational institutions this remains true. All of the typical 
            foundation level tasks, like DHCP, DNS, NTP, routing, firewalling, Web 
            serving, database serving, and file serving, that Linux has excelled at for 
            years are needed in K-12. Of particular interest in education though are 
            its file serving, routing, firewalling, and Web service capabilities. Most 
            of these services can be administered by a Linux novice through the tools 
            that most modern distributions provide. Another outstanding alternative is 
            Webmin, a Web-based server management tool that is available pre-configured 
            for many popular distributions. 
          <p> These tools won't eliminate the need for good 
            sense or an understanding of systems administration principals, but they 
            reduce the need to know the inner workings of Linux and also reduce the 
            intimidation of the command line. Many people who are charged with taking 
            care of IT in public schools have only worked with GUI systems and have 
            little or no formal training with computers. Many will give up when faced 
            with a blank command prompt. 
          <p> It is very common for computers in educational 
            organizations to run the full spectrum of age and operating system. In my 
            most recent school district, every version of Windows from Windows 98 and 
            every version of Mac OS from Mac OS 8.6 was in use in addition to Linux. 
            Combining OpenLDAP, Samba, netatalk, and PAM, Linux made an effective 
            authentication and file server for all those client operating systems. This 
            allowed users to have a single username and password to access a single 
            repository for work on the network. This added a much needed level of 
            consistency and simplicity for the users and eliminated the existing 
            problem wherein each user has data stored across multiple servers, one for 
            each client type. Additionally, with the creative use of symlinks a system 
            of "dropbox" and "handout" directories were created 
            on the high school file server. This allowed students to turn in work or 
            receive documents from their teachers electronically, something that had 
            been impossible or overly complex previously. 
          <p> This system also allowed for much simpler user 
            management. Because of the fractured nature of the previous infrastructure, 
            multiple accounts had to be created by hand for each user. The new Linux 
            file server infrastructure allowed the previously onerous task of adding, 
            moving, or deleting users to be automated almost entirely through 
            scripting. Annually, hundreds of accounts need to be created or destroyed 
            as students pass through the school system, often times all at once at the 
            beginning and end of the school year. Previously, this was done by hand and 
            was one of the most dreaded tasks that the tech department faced. With 
            Linux in the background, data extracted from the student management system 
            was fed to a custom script that generated a unique username for each 
            student, created their account, and created a home directory on the 
            appropriate file server. This reduced a task that had previously taken the 
            better part of a week to mere minutes. Not until the Linux infrastructure 
            was in place was there enough cohesion or enough flexibility for this level 
            of automation to be possible. This same script also allowed for normal 
            one-off user management tasks to be done, and it simplified the process 
            sufficiently that even people with no Linux experience were able to handle 
            user management unaided. 
          <p> Linux's routing and firewalling capabilities 
            also came in handy on a number of occasions. During a migration to a new IP 
            address range, I discovered that a number of legacy applications had been 
            configured on the client machines by IP address. These services were soon 
            to be retired, but that could not happen until well after the IP addressing 
            for the network needed to be changed. I was able to hang onto the small 
            block of addresses that contained the servers and, using Linux running on a 
            spare desktop, I created a router to pass packets onto it while moving 
            forward with the re-addressing. By avoiding re-addressing the servers and 
            reconfiguring more than 1100 client machines, I saved countless hours of 
            labor. 
          <p> This same machine was also used to create an isolated 
            testing and maintenance network in the tech support shop. A number of 
            network worms and viruses were contained by it, again saving untold hours 
            of work. A similar machine was used to section off the network that the IT 
            program used for experimentation and teaching. This protected the main 
            school network while still allowing Internet access for the students to 
            download patches and drivers as needed. Linux was able to meet unforeseen 
            and planned routing and firewalling needs with minimal effort and no cash 
            expense to the district. 
          <p> A proposed use of a Linux firewall that I was not able 
            to implement in production was the enforcement of per-user or per-classroom 
            Internet restrictions. By disallowing Internet access generally on the 
            firewall and then turning it on only for a certain machine by using a Samba 
            pre-exec script (as outlined at <b>http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Samba-Authenticated-Gateway-HOWTO.html</b>), students can have their 
            Internet access restricted if needed, but still have access to computers 
            and other network resources. Additionally, once this system were in place 
            with a high-quality computer inventory, it would be possible to extend it 
            to "turn off" Internet access to a given classroom or 
            classrooms. 
          <p> By associating a classroom with the MAC addresses of 
            the computers within it, one could create firewall rules to block traffic 
            from those computers. Then, a simple password-protected Web application 
            could be created to allow teachers to insert or remove those rules as 
            needed, allowing them to remove the distraction of Internet access if it is 
            unnecessary for the classwork at hand. I believe this use is a good example 
            of Linux's flexibility in routing and firewalling applications, 
            allowing a level of functionality that is offered by no other solution that 
            I am aware of. 
          <p> Linux's flexibility also shines through as a 
            platform for Web services. Using the classic LAMP stack, small Web 
            applications were created to meet a variety of school needs. These included 
            systems to track student assessment progress, report and reward exceptional 
            behavior, distribute contact information to staff, schedule labs, and more. 
            Linux also served as a platform for many other Web-based Open Source tools 
            that aided in the work of the district. These included IRM for help desk 
            and IT inventory, Nagios for system monitoring, MRTG for traffic 
            monitoring, and Webgui for management of the district Web site. The 
            reliability of Linux as a Web platform, the ease of development of Web 
            applications for it, and the wide availability of quality Web applications 
            that run on it brought incredible value to the district. 
          <p>

            <b>Linux Affecting Attitudes</b> 
          <p> Another value that Linux has brought to educators with 
            whom I work is that for many people it helps bring the fun back into 
            computing. After introducing Linux to people, it is not uncommon for them 
            to show a great interest in it, usually becoming inspired by the number of 
            things that they can do with it "out of the box". When the 
            wealth of software available to Linux is shown to them, people come to life 
            with ideas. The desire to make great things available for children is 
            strong in educators, but that desire is often stymied by the lack of 
            quality tools. By providing affordable professional-quality tools, Linux 
            has inspired a number of programs to be developed in educational 
            institutions. 
          <p> Programming, Web development, and digital art classes 
            often spring up with the introduction of Linux and other open source 
            software. A previously unknown interest in programming comes to life with 
            the open and accessible nature of Linux. The transparent and collaborative 
            attitudes found among Linux communities often mirror the attitudes found in 
            educational communities. That like-mindedness inspires educators to take on 
            projects and challenges that they likely would not otherwise. A teacher who 
            needs more computers in her classroom might install K12LTSP on her desktop 
            and rescue a few "junk" machines for terminals. The can-do 
            attitude is infectious. 
          <p> A great exercise to demonstrate this is to walk a 
            group of educators through the installation of a quality desktop-oriented 
            distribution. They need not be particularly proficient with computers as 
            long as a distribution with a simple installation procedure is chosen. 
            Ubuntu 6.06 LTS with its live graphical installer makes an excellent choice 
            (provided the machines it is being done on have 192 MB of RAM or more). It 
            makes a great demonstration because the installation is quick and simple, 
            and while the teachers are waiting they can get a feel for what the 
            installed system can do. Other good choices would be Fedora Core or SUSE, 
            though those installations are usually quite lengthy and don't 
            provide any sort of playpen while the installation is running. 
          <p> Once the installation is complete and the group has a 
            chance to look around a bit, they invariably start asking if there is 
            software available to do some of their favorite things. This is where a 
            good package manager like Synaptic or even the simplified "Add/Remove 
            Applications" interface found in Ubuntu can really shine. People who 
            are used to Windows and Mac OS are accustomed to having to search long and 
            hard on the Internet for a tool to meet their needs. Often those searches 
            end in frustration, a hefty price tag, or uncertainty about the safety of 
            downloading and installing what they have found. 
          <p> Quality package managers and repositories in Linux 
            alleviate these problems by making is possible to meet most software needs 
            with trustworthy "one-stop shopping". I have seen teachers 
            spend hours browsing through the available software and installing and 
            testing huge numbers of titles. In many cases they discover the large 
            number of entertaining casual games that are available, and that seals the 
            deal. By appealing to their need for safety, simplicity, and fun, Linux 
            turns a curious bystander into an active explorer. A lot of people 
            don't actively pursue Linux once the workshop is complete, but they 
            have at least become aware of it and had a positive experience. Sometimes a 
            spark of interest is set that carries over into their teaching or their 
            personal use of computers. 
          <p> IT classes in high schools are often looking for 
            projects for students to work on. One valuable and rewarding program is 
            refurbishing computers to give away to underprivileged families. If a 
            school can partner with an ISP to provide low- or no-cost Internet access 
            to qualified families, such a program can open great opportunities to 
            people who would not otherwise have them. Linux allows such programs to 
            install a wide variety of quality software on these machines without 
            worrying about licensing restrictions. Overcoming this one hurdle can often 
            mean the difference between success and failure for such community outreach 
            programs. These programs are often underfunded, if funded at all, and 
            license fees for software can easily overwhelm them. Additionally, 
            Linux's resistance to common Internet annoyances reduces the support 
            burden on the program by heading off problems before they occur. 
          <p> Again, it is important that programs like this be 
            carefully planned, particularly if they use Linux as their software 
            foundation. Appropriate hardware must be chosen and the participants must 
            understand that the computer they are getting is different from what they 
            may be used to. Making the strengths and weaknesses clear is very important 
            so that their expectations are aligned with what will be delivered. In most 
            cases this is a non-issue as the users never get beyond Web surfing and 
            word processing, but it is an important base to cover none the less. 
          <p>

            <b>Education and Linux Go Together</b>
          <p> Linux can help inexpensively meet the IT needs of 
            educational institutions. It has proven stability, a wide array of quality 
            applications available, and the learning curve for using it gets shallower 
            every day. If correctly positioned and planned for, it can help stretch the 
            IT dollars of a school and deliver all the tools that the staff and 
            students need. 
          <p> Promoting Linux use in schools also has a long-term 
            positive impact for the larger Linux using community. "Get them while 
            they're young" has been used as a strategy to promote many 
            things, and this is sound advice for the furthering the acceptance of Linux 
            as well. Linux in schools will go a long way to ensuring that we have a 
            healthy crop of smart Linux administrators and developers in the future to 
            help keep the community rolling in the decades to come. It really is a 
            win-win proposition for everyone involved, except perhaps for the software 
            vendors who aren't yet embracing Linux.

              education, however, to see what life is like in the private sector. When 
              he's not working on computers, he tries to spend as much time as 
              possible outside with his lovely wife.</i>
