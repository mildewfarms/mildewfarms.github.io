            <p> Amy Rich 
          <p>

            <font size='+4'>Q</font> I installed Solaris 10 on a Sun box that I had lying 
            around in order to investigate using ZFS. I chose to give ZFS entire disk 
            devices from an external disk pack instead of giving it individual disk 
            slices from each disk. After I was done playing, I wanted to re-install 
            Solaris 9 and slice up the disks, but it doesn't appear to work 
            anymore. Apparently ZFS deleted the disk label and I can no longer slice it 
            up for Solaris 9. Here's the command I ran to create the pool: 
          <p>

 
          <pre>
zpool create -f testpool mirror c2t0d0 c2t1d0
            </pre>
Now when I run format and try to partition the disk, it tells me:
<p>

<pre>
Current partition table (unnamed): 
Total disk sectors available: 143358320 + 16384 (reserved sectors)

Part      Tag    Flag     First Sector         Size         Last Sector 
  0        usr    wm                34       68.36GB          143358320 
  1 unassigned    wm                 0           0               0   
  2 unassigned    wm                 0           0               0   
  3 unassigned    wm                 0           0               0

partition&gt; 8
`8' is not expected.
</pre>
Note that there is no slice 7 anymore. If I try to 
    partition slice 0 to start at sector 0, I get the following error:
<p>

<pre>
partition&gt; 0 
Part      Tag    Flag     First Sector         Size         Last Sector

Enter partition id tag[usr]: root 
Enter partition permission flags[wm]:

`0' is out of range.
</pre>
Do I need to buy a new disk now that I've 
    modified this one, or is there some way to fix this?
<p>

<font size='+4'>A</font> ZFS installed what's known as an EFI 
  (extensible firmware interface) label on your disk, replacing the previous 
  SMI label. See the following for more information on EFI labels and what 
  they're used for: 
<p>

<pre>
http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-5093/6mkisoq1k?a=view
</pre>
To begin, make sure you've removed your zpool 
    with <b>zpool destroy testpool</b> if you're still running under Solaris 10. 
    To rewrite the SMI label again, run the following command:
    <p>

  <pre>
format -e 
    </pre>
Choose the disk you want to modify and reset the 
    partition type to SMI:
<p>

<pre>
format&gt; partition
partition&gt; label 
[0] SMI Label 
[1] EFI Label 
Specify Label type[1]: 0 
Warning: This disk has an EFI label. Changing to SMI label will erase  
all current partitions. 
Continue? y 
Auto configuration via format.dat[no]? 
Auto configuration via generic SCSI-2[no]? yes 
</pre>
When you look at the partition table now, you'll 
    see that it lists the SMI partitions 0 through 7 again. You can go back to 
    slicing your disk as you did previously.
<p>

 <font size='+4'>Q</font> I just upgraded a number of our departmental 
  Powerbooks to Mac OS X 10.4.7. Since the upgrade, users are complaining 
  that the Software Updater can't unpack software updates correctly. In 
  the log file of one such machine, I see the following errors: 
<p>

<pre>
Aug 28 06:13:58 mymac Software Update[27884]: JavaScript error
"Undefined value" while running "__choice_su_visible"
Aug 28 06:13:58 mymac Software Update[27884]: __choice_su_visible 
returned error: Undefined value
</pre>
If I download the update and apply it manually, it works just fine.
<p> Google is unhelpful about how to correct this other 
  than "do an archive install instead of an upgrade", which is 
  completely unacceptable. Do you have any suggestions on how I might fix 
  this issue? 
<p>

 <font size='+4'>A</font> Whenever there are issues with an OS X upgrade or 
  patch, I always suggest running the <b>Disk Utility</b> application to try to 
  "repair" permissions (this essentially does a <b>chmod</b> and <b>chown</b> on various files and directories) on the boot volume. If that doesn't 
  work, another step that commonly fixes issues is to reapply the Updater 
  that broke the behavior (in your case, presumably the 10.4.7 Updater). 
  I've successfully fixed the error you describe with those two steps. 
<p>

 <font size='+4'>Q</font> I have a Solaris 8 machine that I'm trying to 
  bring to the <b>ok</b> prompt, but every time I try, it asks me for a password. 
  I've tried the root password, but that doesn't work. I'm 
  stumped as to what this password might be, so how do I get around it? 
<p>

 <font size='+4'>A</font> You don't mention what kind of hardware or 
  exactly what the login message says, so there are a few possible scenarios. 
  You could have a firmware password set; you could have an LOM, ILOM, or 
  ALOM password set; or you could have an RSC password set. Each of these 
  requires a different method to circumvent. 
<p> Let's take the firmware password first, since 
  it's probably the easiest to deal with. Execute the following command 
  as root from the running system: 
<p>

<pre>
eeprom security-mode
</pre>
If it does not say:
<p>

<pre>
security-mode=none
</pre>
then you have an eeprom password set, and you can 
    either turn down the <b>security-mode</b> to <b>none</b> or you can reset the password. 
    To turn off firmware security entirely, run:
    <p>

  <pre>
eeprom security-mode=none
    </pre>
To instead change the password (<b>security-mode</b> must be 
    set to <b>command</b> or <b>full</b> for this to work), run:
    <p>

  <pre>
eeprom security-password 
    </pre>
It will prompt you for a firmware password twice.
<p> If the firmware password is not your problem, then you 
  either have an ILOM/LOM/ALOM password or an RSC password, depending on the 
  type of hardware you're using. If you have a SunSolve account, look 
  at InfoDoc 81146 to determine which type of console management software you 
  have: 
<p>

<pre>
http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-9-81146
</pre>
If you have RSC, then you may need to install extra 
    software to obtain the binaries you need to reset the password. Follow the 
    directions at:
<p>

<pre>
http://www.sun.com/servers/rsc_download_readme.html 
</pre>
to obtain and install the correct version of the RSC 
    software for your hardware platform and OS version. Once you have the 
    software installed correctly, run the following command to reset the admin 
    password:
<p>

<pre>
rscadm userpassword admin 
</pre>
If it claims that the username does not exist 
    (possible if you just installed the software), then you can create a user, 
    set its password, and give it privileges:
<p>

<pre>
rscadm useradd admin 
rscadm userpassword admin 
rscadm userperm admin cuar 
</pre>
The privileges set above are:
<p>

<pre>
c - Console permission: needed to toggle between LOM and console \
    (possible only when LOM and console share port A). 
u - User accounts permission: needed to create/manage LOM user accounts. 
a - Administrative permission: needed to re/set LOM 
    config variables. 
r - Reset permission: needed to reset/power-cycle LOM. 
</pre>
If your hardware has ALOM, then the software you need 
    should already be installed as part of <b>SUNWkvm</b>. To reset the password, run 
    the following command:
    <p>

  <pre>
/usr/platform/`uname -i`/sbin/scadm userpassword admin 
    </pre>
If you did not have the root password, you could erase 
    all of the ALOM settings by following the instructions from:
<p>

<pre>
http://www.sun.com/products-n-solutions/hardware/docs/html/ \ 
     819-3250-11/trouble_appx.html#pgfId-1003331 
</pre>
If your hardware has LOM, the predecessor to ALOM, 
    then you'll need to install the LOMLite software available from the 
    Solaris 8 Supplemental CD. After inserting it, perform the following:
<p>

<pre>
cd /cdrom/cdrom0/Lights_Out_Management_2.0/Product 
pkgadd -d . SUNWlomm SUNWlomr SUNWlomu 
</pre>
You might then be able to bypass user security by 
    modifying <b>/etc/lom.conf</b> or <b>/platform/sun4u/kernel/drv/lom.conf</b> to disable <b>serial_security</b>:
    <p>

  <pre>
serial_security=1; 
    </pre>
If you're working with an older machine, you 
    might also have the option of setting a jumper on the motherboard to reset 
    the LOM entirely.
<p> If you're using x64 hardware with ILOM and a 
  BIOS password, the default username is <b>root</b> and the default password is <b>changeme</b>. If it's been changed and you need to reset the password, it 
  requires physical access to the machine to open the case and modify the 
  physical jumper settings. Refer to your hardware guide to determine exactly 
  which jumper you need to change. For example, this document describes the 
  changes needed for the Sun Fire X4100 and X4200 class machines:

 <font size='+4'>Q</font> I have a Sun V240 running Solaris 9. I'm 
    currently using the default <b>bge0</b> interface, but I want to replace it with a 
    quad gigE <b>ce0</b> card. I added the card and plumbed the interface, and 
    everything looked good. I bought the interface up with a different IP and 
    things still looked okay. When I unplugged <b>bge0</b>, though, the machine 
    stopped responding. Here are the pertinent config files:
    <p>

  <pre>
/etc/hosts:
  127.0.0.1 localhost
  10.1.1.1 host-bge0
  10.1.1.2 host-ce0


/etc/hostname.bge0:
  host-bge0

/etc/hostnmae.ce0:
  host-ce0
    </pre>
When I run <b>ifconfig -a</b>, it shows everything up and 
    functioning as expected:
<p>

<pre>
lo0: flags=1000849&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4&gt; mtu 8232 index 3
        inet 127.0.0.1 netmask ff000000
bge0: flags=1000843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4&gt; mtu 1500 index 4 
        inet 10.1.1.1 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 10.1.1.1.255 
        ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx 
ce0: flags=1000843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4&gt; mtu 1500 index 5
        inet 10.1.1.2 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 10.1.1.255 
        ether yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy
</pre>
So why can't I get <b>ce0</b> to function when I unplug <b>bge0</b>?
<p>

 <font size='+4'>A</font> Your netmask indicates that you're using a 
  class C-sized network, which means that the IP addresses for <b>bge0</b> and <b>ce0</b> are on the same subnet. This is an unsupported configuration unless 
  you're using IPMP. When you bring up <B>ce0</B> after <b>bge0</b>, packets coming 
  out of the machine will leave the <b>bge0</b> interface regardless of which IP 
  address was used by the other machine sending said packets. This is because <b>bge0</b> is listed first in the routing table and is considered authoritative 
  for the <b>10.1.1.0/24</b> subnet. To verify this, you can look at the routing 
  table by doing <b>netstat -nr</b>. 
<p> The output should look something like the following 
  (with <b>10.1.1.254</b> assumed as the default gateway): 
<p>

<pre>
Routing Table: IPv4
  Destination          Gateway            Flags  Ref   Use   Interface 
-------------------- -------------------- ----- ----- ------ --------- 
10.1.1.0             10.1.1.1             U         1   4699  bge0 
10.1.1.0             10.1.1.2             U         1      0  ce0
224.0.0.0            10.1.1.1             U         1      0  bge0 
default              10.1.1.254           UG        1  31150  
127.0.0.1            127.0.0.1            UH        4    705  lo0
</pre>
If you run <B>snoop -d bge0</B> and <B>snoop -d ce0</B> at the same 
    time, you'll see packets coming into <B>ce0</B> and responses to those 
    packets leaving via <B>bge0</B>.
    <p> If you do a flash cutover instead of trying to have 
      both devices up at the same time, <b>ce0</b> should work just fine, assuming that 
      there aren't hardware problems. Remove <b>/etc/hostname.bge0</b> and reboot 
      the machine. You may also run into an issue with the ARP cache on your 
      switch, so give it a few minutes before deciding it didn't work (or 
      clear the ARP cache if you have that capability).
