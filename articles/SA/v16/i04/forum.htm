This month's theme is clustering, and we have several articles describing how to get going with this hot topic. To start, Sergey Nemirovsky explains how Red Hat Cluster Suite can reduce downtime and improve availability of Oracle databases. Chris Page describes Oracle's clusterware technology and demonstrates an example, and Rayson Ho describes Grid Engine, an open source job scheduler used in high-throughput clusters. Also in this issue, Peter Galvin takes an in-depth look at virtualization, examining the benefits and options and explaining how to choose the best solution for your own situation. Look for more articles on virtualization in an upcoming supplement.

Right now, we're taking proposals for articles on information security, storage, server management, and performance tuning. If any topics within these broad subject areas appeal to you, please send a proposal to me at: SAeditors@cmp.com.<p>
