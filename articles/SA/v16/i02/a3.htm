The man for wisdom's various arts renown'd,<br>

Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound;<br>

Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray'd,<br>

Their manners noted, and their states survey'd,<br>

On stormy seas unnumber'd toils he bore,<br>

Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore.<br>

TELL OF THE STORM-TOSSED PROGRAMMER, O
MUSE, who wandered long after years of trial and tribulation within the halls
of Akad&#275;meia
(&#913;&#954;&#945;&#948;&#949;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#945;),
where many an aspiring coder was laid to rest, never to rise again. Ere our
hero, mighty Codysseus (&#922;&#959;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#965;&#962;),
even entered into the fray,
he had fallen in love with, and wed, the beautiful and faithful Perlelope
(&#928;&#949;&#961;&#955;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#960;&#951;), Queen of the blessed isle Skryptica
(&#931;&#954;&#961;&#965;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;), where life was pleasant and little
effort brought great results, quickly. <p>

Now Perlelope – the fifth of her august
lineage – was a direct descendant of Perlelope-I who was the child of the
immortal &quot;C&quot; (&#931;&#951;), known throughout the heavens and the
earth for his speed, power, and unforgiving nature, and the mortal Schellia
(&#931;&#967;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#945;), Queen of the land of Unix
(&#933;&#957;&#953;&#958;) and much admired for her quickness and friendliness.
While still a child herself, Perlelope-I found the infant Regex
(&#929;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#958;) wandering lonely in the wild vastness of Unix,
and, immediately perceiving his extraordinary abilities and future strength,
adopted him for her own, bringing him to live with her. When she had come of
age, the denizens of Skryptica, seeing her strength and wisdom, declared
Perlelope-I the queen of their realm, a title that has been passed down to her
descendants. <p>

After enduring a thousand agonies,
persistent Codysseus emerged victorious from Akad&#275;mia and, having been
awarded the much-prized sheepskin, desired to return home to Skryptica and the
lovely Perlelope. But, alas, he and his staunch companions, the graduates, had
many a struggle to overcome before reaching his blessed homeland. First, they
passed through the land of Lotusnoters
(&#923;&#969;&#964;&#965;&#963;&#957;&#969;t&#949;&#961;&#962;). This strange
race wrote not code, but only documentation, thus squandering much of the
wisdom they had gained from their years of toil at the Akad&#275;mia. It is
said that once one eats of the fruit of that country, one loses all desire and
ability to return to the land of programmers, and is forever doomed to document
the deeds of others. <p>

Gaining the coastland, the intrepid band
set about making a sea-worthy vessel to carry them homeward. Their task completed,
they ventured out on the briny depths, their brazen prow cleaving the dark
waters. By day, brave Codysseus set their course by the sun's blazing path
though the heavens, and by night he used the infallible astral guides: bright
Pleiades and late-setting Boötes, belted Orion and the great Bear that faces
him. <p>

After struggling with unfavourable winds
and rough seas for many a long day, the weary graduates were forced to go
ashore at a mysterious island to replenish their stocks of food and water. Unfortunately,
this land was the home of Coboleus (&#922;&#969;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#962;),
the last remaining individual from a race of one-eyed giants, loathsome in
aspect and crude in speech. Now Coboleus was the son of the Titan known as
Mainphrame (&#924;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#966;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#949;), the
formerly all-powerful ruler of the data processing world, who long ago had
become aged and decrepit, and upon whom most of the coders of the world had
turned their backs in contempt. Although monstrously large, Coboleus was slow
and stupid. Because of this, subtle Codysseus and the graduates managed to
evade his evil clutches and leave the island, save two or three hapless
innocents who fell victim to the millennium bug, a vile pest known to inhabit
the fetid sloughs surrounding the realm of Coboleus. <p>

Entrusting themselves again to the
trackless expanse of the sea, the adventurers hoisted their canvas and set out.
The next place they landed was the realm of the enchantress Circeplusplus
(&#922;&#953;&#961;&#954;&#951;&#960;&#955;&#965;&#963;&#960;&#955;&#965;&#962;).<p>

Insidiously inconsistent and corruptly
complex, she too was sired by &quot;C&quot;, but had Oopsia
(&#927;&#959;&#968;&#953;&#945;) for her mother. Now whereas Perlelope had
inherited the best characteristics of her parents, Circeplusplus inherited the
worst. Some of the graduates were beguiled by her cunning ways, and she
transformed them into swine who were put to wallow in the muck and mire hidden
behind the deceitful façade of her false palace. But great-hearted Codysseus,
through strength of will, prevailed not only for himself but also for most of
his companions, the few weaklings who chose to stay, succumbing to their
accurs'd hunger for gold and Circeplusplus's promises of great riches. The
company once more put out to sea, continuing their luckless voyage towards
Skryptica. <p>

Wise Codysseus then decided to sail for
the land of the dead, to seek counsel from the spirit of the most ancient of
seers, FORTRAN (&#934;&#969;&#961;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#957;). Now FORTRAN – that
sagacious patriarch of innumerable languages, whose aristocratic line extends
through nine generations to his last still-living descendant, the age-worn and
grey-bearded FORTRAN-95 – spoke long with patient Codysseus, instructing him in
the way home, and prophesying of the dangers he still faced. Before leaving the
nether realm, our hero held converse with many of the shades from ages past,
among them ALGOL, and APL, Pascal and Prolog. <p>

After three and ten days of fair sailing, the
ship approached the land of the Sirens (&#931;&#953;&#961;&#949;&#957;&#962;).
These evil seducers were daughters of. Helios
(&#919;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#962;) and they lured the unwary by chanting,
over and over again, their seductive lie: &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot;.
Many a good programmer, captivated by this beguiling mantra, had been lead
astray to spend a miserable life in joyless travail. But, having been warned by
the venerable FORTRAN, clever Codysseus had his crew fill their ears with
beeswax so that they would not hear, although he, determined to see if the
stories of the Sirens' song were true, suffered not his ears to be stopp'd.
Instead, he had himself bound to the mast of his ship, that he might listen
without risk of being compelled to cast his life away. <p>

Finally nearing his blessed home, fearless
Codysseus and the graduates had one last obstacle to overcome before setting
foot on Skryptica. Their path lay through a treacherous narrows, bounded by two
terrifying destroyers of coders' souls. On their left was the sucking whirlpool
of death known as Management (&#924;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#964;).
From this perilous pit, none escape unscathed, for once ensnared within its
vortex, they are swallowed-up into an abysmal void of never-ending darkness
from which all rational thought has been eradicated. And of the few who return
to the land of programmers, none are ever what they once were, for the scars of
Management are deep and permanent. On the other side of this doubly-detestable
waterway, a tenebrous cave hewn from the living rock of the cliff was home to a
savage and invincible beast. Multi-headed and eternally yelping like an angry
dog, the insatiable monster known as Techsupport
(&#932;&#949;&#967;&#963;&#965;&#960;&#960;&#969;&#961;&#964;) snatched at all
who came within her cruel grasp. Once caught, her victims are eternally
tormented by the furious Newbies (&#925;&#965;&#946;&#951;&#962;), a race of
vile, ignorant creatures who are always whining, and never allow a moment's
rest. As his courageous comrades skillfully smote the foam-flecked sea-swell
with their oaken oars, careful Codysseus personally piloted his sturdy ship
temerariously towards the hideous hazards. Management he was able to avoid
completely, at the cost of losing several of his steadfast companions to the
foul clutches of Techsupport. With the anguished cries of those pitiable
wretches ringing in their ears, the remaining graduates swiftly rowed away from
the dual horrors, thanking heaven that their losses were not worse. <p>

After another three days and four and
nights of fair sailing, rosy-fingered Dawn gilt the courts of heaven with her
celestial light revealing to the weary crew the golden shores and cloud-capped
mountains of Skryptica. Disembarking, grateful Codysseus made oblations for his
safe return and proceeded towards his natal home. Nearing the place, he burned
with high disdain upon discovering that during his absence several suitors had
taken up semi-permanent residence in his former abode. Telling Perlelope that
he – the long-awaited Codysseus – would never return, these suitors where
urging her to accept one of them as her new husband. By this, of course, each
hoped that they would become the new King of Skryptica, taking the scepter for
their own. Although most of the suitors were of no account, and do not even
warrant mention in this history, there were three who merit remembrance. The
first among them was Roobeus (&#929;&#959;&#959;&#946;&#949;&#965;&#962;) a man
of noble blood and honourable intentions and the only truly worthy suitor,
since he too was of royal blood, being a distant relative of Perlelope. The
next was Psython (&#936;&#965;&#952;&#959;&#957;), a rich merchant, popular
with some, but wholly unsuitable to ascend to the throne due to his overbearing
nature and lack of flexibility. The last suitor to be here named was
P&#275;atchpe (&#928;&#951;&#945;&#964;&#967;&#960;&#951;), a member of the
common rabble, weak and unable to face the world without his supportive and
powerful friend from the land of applications, Apache
(&#913;&#960;&#945;&#967;&#951;). In the guise of a bedraggled beggar, and
feigning enfeeblement, shrewd Codysseus entered the house to confront the
suitors. <p>

It so happened that just as wily Codysseus
was passing the threshold, a test of strength and skill was beginning. In order
to discomfit the suitors, and prove to them their shortcomings, Perlelope had
organized a challenge. She announced that she would wed whomsoever could wield
the mighty weapon CPAN (&#931;&#951;&#960;&#945;&#957;), for she knew in the
depths of her heart that none but her beloved Codysseus had the fortitude and
intelligence to employ such a powerful tool. After calmly watching all of the
haughty suitors fail in their attempts, the ill-kempt beggar, much to the
astonishment of all present, brandish'd the dread weapon and approached the
would-be kings of Skryptica. To the nobleman Roobeus he said &quot;Since you
are actually worthy of the title, and bore no dishonourable intentions towards
my lady, you may go.&quot; Grim Codysseus then turned to the merchant Psython
and, forbearing to kill him, struck him gently so as only to break his nose and
blacken his eyes, saying &quot;That is for your audacity in presuming to a
place far above your standing. Now leave and let me never again see your face,
for on that day, you surely shall die.&quot; Now P&#275;atchpe, being
weak-hearted, fell groveling to his knees, filling all that place with his
cries entreating wrathful Codysseus to do him no harm. But saying &quot;You –
thrice damn'd miscreant – did not even have the right to look upon the face of
the regal Perlelope, much less aspire to be her husband&quot;, he smote
P&#275;atchpe with CPAN, shedding his brains upon the ground and his blood upon
the walls. Seeing the skill with which CPAN had been wielded, and the just
punishment meted out to the suitors, Perlelope, recognized that this could be
none other than her sorely-missed husband. She threw herself into his arms, her
face wet with tears of joy. <p>

For many days and nights afterward there
was much boisterous celebrating among the inhabitants of Skryptica, generous
Codysseus having ordered the slaying of an hundred bristly-backed swine and two
hundred wooly ewes so that all the people of that sovereign dominion could
partake of the feasting. During this time, amorous Codysseus and his
affectionate queen had many occasions to renew their acquaintance and revel in
their love for one another. And so it was that several weeks later Perlelope
found herself to be with child and, at the appropriate time, the most excellent
progeny of the renowned couple and the future Queen of Skryptica, Perlelope-VI,
was born. <p>
