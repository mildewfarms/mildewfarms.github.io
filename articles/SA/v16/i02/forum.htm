<p> Beginning in March of 2007, <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine will no longer be found on the newsstand. Along with many other magazines, we've made the decision to pull <i>Sys Admin</i> from the newsstand because of declining sell-through and increasing distribution costs. <i>Sys Admin</i> is not alone in seeing challenges in this area, and there is much speculation attributing the declines in print sales to the ever-increasing availability of online technical information. So, if you're reading this magazine while standing in a bookstore or have purchased this issue from a newsstand, I encourage you to subscribe in order to continue receiving the information we provide.
<p> This year we also intend to offer digital subscription opportunities that should be particularly appealing to our international audience for whom we sometimes have difficulty fulfilling a print version of the magazine. In other news, we're planning to host our own technical conference (more about that next month) and expand the <i>Sys Admin</i> Web site to include more articles and features and even blogs from featured contributors. You can see some of these new features on the Web site now at: <b>http://www.sysadminmag.com</b>.
<p> Note that version 12 of the <i>Sys Admin</i> back issue CD is also now available, containing all <i>Sys Admin</i> articles through December of 2006. Please see the <i>Sys Admin</i> Web site for the details on ordering and pricing.
<p> And, as always, we're looking for articles on a variety of topics for upcoming issues. If you're interested in contributing to the magazine, please send us an outline of the article you have in mind, and we'll be happy to consider it. Right now, we're accepting proposals and manuscripts on database management, networking, Linux, and information security. You can always check the call for papers on the Web site for a complete list of topics.
<p>
          <p>Sincerely yours,<p>
             <i>Amber Ankerholz</i><br>
              Editor in Chief
