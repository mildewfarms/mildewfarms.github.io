I frequently receive announcements of the upcoming technical conferences offered by various companies, and now <i>Sys Admin</i> has its own! <i>Sys Admin</i> is sponsoring a technical conference that will offer training specifically for systems administrators. This conference will take place May 7-8 in Baltimore, MD and is aimed at providing sys admins with knowledge of essential best practices and hands-on techniques in Unix security and scripting, along with the opportunity to network with peers and improve job skills.
<p>

This 2-day conference consists of both security and scripting tracks and includes courses for both beginners and experienced admins from these industry experts: Hal Pomeranz, Randal Schwartz, &AElig;leen Frisch, Richard Bejtlich, and Tom Limoncelli.<p>

The courses that will be offered include:<p>


<ul><li> Beginning and Intermediate Perl by Randal Schwartz
<li> Sendmail Tutorial by Hal Pomeranz
<li> Advanced Topics in Linux Security by &AElig;leen Frisch
<li> Network Incident Response by Richard Bejtlich
<li> Introduction to Python for Sys Admins by &AElig;leen Frisch
<li> Network Forensics by Richard Bejtlich
<li> Time Management for Sys Admins by Tom Limoncelli</ul>

For this conference, we've chosen expert instructors who will be teaching essential administration skills in order to make this conference as valuable as possible. The addition of this conference and other events allows <i>Sys Admin</i> to offer more technical information in new ways to strengthen its commitment to the systems administration community.<p>
