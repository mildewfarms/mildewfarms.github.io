            <B>Penguin Computing Announces Altus 600 </b><p>

Penguin Computing has announced the Altus 600 server, specifically designed for the needs of high-performance computing (HPC). Equipped with up to two Next-Generation AMD Opteron 2000-series processors and up to 64GB of memory, the company says the Altus 600 eliminates features that are not typically needed by HPC customers, reducing the cost of clustering without sacrificing performance or efficiency.<p>

The Altus 600 delivers key features for HPC users running complex simulations, such as strong performance and speed with the dual-core AMD Opteron 2000-series processors, as well as low overhead for HPC applications compared to general purpose Linux servers.<p>

Penguin's Altus 600 server also features the highest memory capacity available in a 1U form factor, onboard Gigabit Ethernet, SATA hard drives, and a PCI Express x16 expansion slot for high-speed, low-latency cluster interconnects. According to the company, the Altus 600 scales to support even the most memory and bandwidth hungry applications and is also highly energy efficient, maximizing compute power per rack and minimizing the impact on AC and utility bills. Altus 600 dual-processor configurations are available now starting at only $1499.<p>

<B>OpenVZ Virtualization Software Available for Sun UltraSPARC T1 Processor</b><p>

The OpenVZ project has made its open source virtualization software available for servers using Sun's breakthrough UltraSPARC T1 CoolThreads processor. According to the company, this operating system-level server virtualization software technology helps increase server utilization rates. OpenVZ is operating system-level server virtualization software technology, built on Linux, that creates multiple isolated secure virtual environments on a single physical server -- enabling greater server utilization and superior availability with fewer performance penalties. The virtual servers ensure that applications do not conflict and can be re-booted independently. With virtualization technology, the server can effectively be split into many small ones, each running its tasks so that the whole server is utilized more efficiently.<p>

With OpenVZ, SPARC system users can provision physical servers to run applications on virtual servers, rather than a full physical server. The OpenVZ project provides templates that allow for very fast (in many cases about a minute) provisioning of a virtual server.<p>

The OpenVZ software including UltraSPARC T1 support can be downloaded from: http://openvz.org/download/kernel/devel/. Also, users can access installation instructions from the OpenVZ wiki: http://wiki.openvz.org/Quick_installation. The site serves as a forum to gain and share knowledge about OpenVZ and includes documentation and a knowledge base.<p>
