<b>NetXen Releases 10-Gigabit Linux Sockets Acceleration</b>

<p>NetXen, Inc. introduced Linux Sockets Acceleration (LSA). It is the first network acceleration solution for Linux that requires no modifications to the kernel, host TCP stack or applications, and can offload both user- and kernel-mode applications. NetXen's LSA is also the first solution to support NIC and offload modes simultaneously.

<p>NetXen's Intelligent NIC delivers these unique advantages by providing a complete set of 10GbE acceleration capabilities on the NIC. The LSA solution allows users to run NIC and TCP modes simultaneously with NetXen's Selective Acceleration technology. With Selective Acceleration, any specialized applications that benefit from using host-based protocols can continue to do so under user control. For more information, visit: http://www.netxen.com.
