            <P>This is the last issue of <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine that you will receive. The magazine is ceasing publication as of this issue.
<P>There is often a large measure of regret and sadness when a long-term relationship ends, and I feel these emotions now at the end of my relationship with <i>Sys Admin</i>. No other publication really does what <i>Sys Admin</i> does, but you probably already know that. You might not know, however, the challenges currently 

<P>facing many print publications, particularly small niche ones like <i>Sys Admin</i>. These challenges, which have contributed to the 

<P>decision to stop publishing the magazine, include circulation woes, online competition, and market shift. I take some small comfort in the fact that <i>Sys Admin</i> fought these battles and survived much longer than many others in similar circumstances.

<P>I have worked for <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine for almost 12 years, and I've had a great time. So, in this note, I need to mention some of the many people who have made working for <i>Sys Admin</i> such a rewarding experience for me. In no particular order, I thank Hal Pomeranz, Joe Casad, Ralph Barker, and Robert Ward for making me seem smarter than I really am. I thank Rikki Endsley Kite for therapy shopping, making me do things that scare me, and being a fabulous friend. I thank Lori White and Twyla Watson Bogaard for always reminding me that life goes down better with humor. I thank the regular columnists and writers for their loyalty and consistently excellent articles, and I thank all the readers and contributors for making <i>Sys Admin</i> as successful as it was for as long as it was.

<P>Good-bye and good luck.

<P>Sincerely yours,

<P><i>Amber Ankerholz</i>

<br>Editor in Chief
