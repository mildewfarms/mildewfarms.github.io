<p><b>Sourcefire Launches Open Source Logging Tool</b>

<p>Sourcefire, Inc. has released Daemonlogger, an open source network traffic logging and "soft tap" tool.

<p>According to the company, Daemonlogger was developed and released by Sourcefire to simplify the implementation of a traffic logging solution. Like Snort, the open source intrusion prevention system from Sourcefire, Daemonlogger is at its core a packet sniffer that is capable of passively capturing network traffic logs and writing it to disk in PCAP format. Users have the option to retransmit packets on another network interface via Daemonlogger's "soft tap" feature.

<p>Users may configure which packets are logged using BPF filters to ensure that only the traffic that must be logged is collected. Users may configure how frequently the log file is rolled based on either the size of the log file or the age of the file. For more information visit http://www.sourcefire.com
