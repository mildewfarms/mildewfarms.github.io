<H1>Sidebar: Time Resources and the Internet</H1><p>
<P>
The U.S. Naval Observatory is on the net with a delightful
Web home 
page at http://www.usno.navy.mil. USNO provides a great
deal 
of information on how they operate in their role as
chief astronomers 
and timekeepers of the Navy, and it's clear they have
designed their 
Web pages with an eye toward the technical reader.<P>

Their ftp service has a number of time utilities, including
one (nistime.c) 
that sets your clock over the Internet. Look in ftp://tycho.usno.navy.mil/pub/time/

for this information.<P>

Surprisingly, many networks do not require accurate
time as much as 
systemwide agreement on a common clock (even if this
clock is wrong 
in absolute terms). Considering that filesystems are
often cross-mounted 
between various machines, a timestamp that says &quot;five
minutes 
ago&quot; on one computer might mean &quot;five minutes
from now&quot; 
on another. This can cause havoc with the make utility
when 
object files are &quot;newer&quot; than their source
files by virtue 
of unsynchronized system clocks.<P>

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) was designed to alleviate
just 
these concerns. It permits a network of interconnected
systems to 
make sure all their clocks agree and converge on a common
time. This 
protocol is defined in Request For Comments (RFC) 1305,
which 
is available from ftp://uunet/inet/rfc/rfc1305.Z. Source
code 
for the NTP utilities is at ftp://uunet/networking/applic/ntp/

(among other locations).<P>

For users with more modest requirements, it is possible
to create 
simple set-the-time utilities by using TCP to synchronize
with a master 
server (say, one that uses utc to set the clock). Most
TCP 
implementations provide services that give easy access
to the time 
on that machine. For instance,<P>
<PRE>
telnet mymachine.com daytime</pre><p>
<p>
where mymachine.com is the name of a machine 
and daytime is typed literally and corresponds to TCP
and 
UDP port 13. While implementations differ, most systems
return the 
time in the same format as the date command. (For more
information, 
see &quot;A Server-Based Date/Time Synchronizer for
TCP/IP,&quot; Sys 
Admin May/June 1995).<P>

Even simpler is the time service (TCP and UDP port number
37), which 
returns a network long integer that reflects the system
clock on the 
server machine. It is a straightforward matter to create
a program 
that queries a remote system and sets the local clock
with the time 
longword returned. <P>
