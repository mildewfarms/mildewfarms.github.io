<H1>Editor's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
If you've called our offices recently, you may have
noticed that
the phones are being answered &quot;R&amp;D Publications,
a Miller Freeman
company.&quot;  Effective June 1, Donna and I sold the
company to Miller
Freeman, Inc.<P>

Depending upon how closely you follow publishing, you
may or may
not recognize Miller Freeman (MFI) as a major publisher
of specialized
technical magazines.  Before this purchase, the stable
of MFI technical
titles already included Doctor Dobb's Journal, Software
Development,
UNIX Review, Microsoft Systems Journal, and OS/2 Developer,
among
others.  Miller-Freeman, in turn, is a subsidiary of
United Newspapers
plc.<P>

While this is certainly a significant event in my life
and the
lives of all those working here, it will probably be
a non-event for Sys
Admin readers.  Sys Admin will continue with the same
editorial staff,
the same columnists, and the same mission:  to print
practical, fully
detailed solutions to real-world UNIX system administration
problems.<P>

Hopefully, our readers will only see one significant
change: 
more and better Sys Admin information.  For one thing,
Sys Admin will be
my only responsibility--a change that will let me contribute
more than I
have in the recent past.  (To give credit where credit
is due, Martha
Masinton has been &quot;virtual&quot; editor, with strong
support from our
consulting editor, Larry Reznick, for some time--both
have done an
excellent job.)  More importantly, though, MFI has access
to far more
capital resources than our small company could muster
by itself.  With
more editorial resources and more capital resources,
we should be better
able to propose and produce new Sys Admin products.<P>

Speaking of new products, we have just recently sent
two new
volumes in the Reference Reprint Series to press:  Performance
(Vol. 3)
and Security (Vol. 4).  These join the earlier two releases:
Network
Access (Vol. 1) and Backup (Vol. 2).  If you are new
to Sys Admin, these
booklets are a great way to &quot;catch up&quot; on
the best articles out of past
issues.  You can find additional information about the
Reference Reprint
Series on page 89 in this issue.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Robert Ward<P>
