<H1>Books: A User's Report</H1><p>
<P>
Elizabeth Zinkann<P>

I recently had the distinct honor to be chosen by Sys
Admin 
readers as the author of the best article published
in 1994. I believe 
that this is a reflection of the desire of system administrators
for 
current, readable, and reliable information. As a result
of this choice, 
I was flown to SANS '95 (The 4th UNIX System Administration,
Networking, 
and Security Conference) to present an updated version
of the article. 
Since my columns involve book reviews, I presented a
list of my favorite 
technical books and why they rate that status. I have
been requested 
both by my editor and by several people who attended
the conference 
to summarize and publish the results, so that will appear
first, followed 
by a few new book reviews.<P>

My first choice is not really a computer book at all.
Preventing 
Computer Injury: The Hand Book (ISBN 1-884388-01-9,
Ergonome, Inc., 
New York, N.Y. (212) 222-9600 $19.95), by concert pianist
Stephanie 
Brown, is essentially a health book for computer users.
Ms. Brown 
discovered these health problems while studying music.
She developed 
a method to prevent RSIs (Repetitive Stress Injuries)
for pianists 
and later adapted them to help computer teachers. The
book encompasses 
both the right and wrong way to hold yourself, your
wrists, and your 
hands, exercises, adjustments, and massages. I have
tried everything 
in this book and it all works. This is one of the books
I keep 
recommending.<P>

Another book dear to my heart is The UNIX Programming
Environment 
(ISBN 0-13-937681-X, Prentice Hall, $28.95) by Brian
Kernighan and 
Rob Pike. This was my first and only UNIX book for several
courses 
and I still refer to it. When asked a UNIX question,
I can find more 
answers quickly in this book than in any other. At one
time or another, 
I have studied the entire book, so that it is quite
like an old friend. 
I have two other copies of this book, but when asked,
I always refer 
to the one with yellow highlighter, penciled comments
in the margin, 
held together by clear contact paper. In addition to
my sentimental 
attachment to it, I appreciate the fact that Kernighan
and Pike present 
a readable text, progressing from simple to complex
concepts.<P>

One book that thoroughly impressed me is W. Richard
Stevens' Advanced 
Programming in the UNIX Environment (ISBN 0-201-56317-7,
Addison-Wesley, 
$56.97). My family is not computer-literate, by choice.
Usually, I 
don't try to talk to them about computers, programming,
or operating 
systems, particularly UNIX. However, when I read this
book, there 
was no stopping me. I rhapsodized about it for days!!!
This 
was no ordinary book . . . this was a UNIX encylopedia
in disguise. 
I have several books (actually several bookshelves of
books) that 
cover part of this book's topics, but not as well. The
scope, 
the detail, and the style that Stevens used in writing
this book make 
it an extraordinary text.<P>

A favorite administration book is UNIX Systems Advanced
Administration 
and Management Handbook (ISBN 0-02-358950-7, Macmillan,
$48.00) 
by Bruce and Karen Hunter. When it was published, I
was not administering 
a system and read the book more for pleasure than to
solve problems. 
It remains a friendly, readable book which discusses
everyday obstacles, 
their solutions, how those solutions were discovered,
and how to apply 
the same principles to locate answers to your specific
problem. At 
the time, it was one of only a few books that mentioned
AIX and sendmail. 
The sequel, UNIX Networks: A Guide for System Administrators

(ISBN 0-13-089087-1, Prentice Hall, $26.95), is more
detailed and 
explains many new issues facing the network administrator.<P>

Another system administration favorite is the Nemeth,
Snyder, Seebass, 
and Hein Unix System Administration Handbook ( ISBN
0-13-151056-7, 
Prentice Hall ). For a long time, this was the only
book I would recommend, 
particularly to beginning administrators. Its style
is readable and 
practical, and it has a firm basis in reality. Now in
its second edition, 
it includes a CD-ROM and instructions on how to use
it. It covers 
a number of UNIX variants and is very complete in its
coverage.<P>

Firewalls and Internet Security: Repelling the Wily
Hacker, 
by Cheswick and Bellovin (ISBN 0-201-63357-4, Addison-Wesley,
$29.00), 
cannot be ignored. I don't need to expound upon the
importance of 
firewalls, security, or pre-ordained network policies;
Cheswick, Bellovin, 
and Berferd have done it for me. It is intelligible,
true to life, 
and excellently done. I became intrigued by the first
chapter. The 
TCP/IP Protocol Suite is now a given -- something that
everyone 
uses or will use. The authors point out the flaws and
weaknesses in 
TCP/IP and show just how vulnerable your system can
be without proper 
security measures.<P>

The next selection is actually three books. I have often
been asked 
by beginning system administrators to recommend books
that can help 
them. I think that these three books together will answer
most questions, 
provide ongoing help, and generate future support. The
three, all 
from O'Reilly, are Essential System Administration,
System 
Performance Tuning, and TCP/IP Network Administration.
Essential 
System Administration (ISBN 0-937175-80-3, $29.95),
by leen 
Frisch, is the introduction that provides constant support
and help; 
System Performance Tuning (ISBN 0-937175-60-9, $24.95),
by 
Mike Loukides, tells how to obtain the most from your
system; and 
TCP/IP Network Administration (ISBN 0-937175-82-X, $29.95),

by Craig Hunt, provides an excellent introduction to
TCP/IP. 
While it does not provide the depth of the Richard Stevens
or the 
Comer treatment of TCP/IP, it is an excellent overview
and reference 
for TCP/IP. Separately, these are superb books. Together,
they form 
a cohesive unit that is difficult to beat.<P>

UNIX Power Tools is a unique book and a browser's paradise.

The entries are concise and to the point. Reading one
article takes 
virtually no time at all. However, they are rather like
potato chips: 
no one can read just one. If you need an answer quickly,
this is the 
place to find it. A single entry can be found, read,
and used to solve 
the problem in no time at all. UNIX Power Tools (ISBN
0-679-79073-X, 
Random House, $59.95) contains a wealth of information,
brief explanations, 
and a CD-ROM. It was one of the first books to include
a CD-ROM, and 
is certainly one of the most valuable.<P>

UNIX Installation Security &amp; Integrity (ISBN 0-13-015389-3,

Prentice Hall, $36.00), by David Ferbrache and Gavin
Shearer, impressed 
me very much when I first read it. It includes process
security, cryptography, 
network security, and trusted systems, among other topics.
It delved 
into Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) and firewalls, long
before those 
topics rated their own books. The book's depth and range
of topics 
make it very useful. I felt that this book was overshadowed
when it 
debuted and never received the credit that it deserves.<P>

The Downloader's Companion for Windows, by Scott Meyers
and 
Catherine Pinch (ISBN 0-13-342254-2 Prentice Hall $19.95),
is one 
of my priceless little books. I have a little niche
to the left of 
my computer keyboard which will just accommodate a few
of these small 
books. I tend to use them often. This is one book that
I think should 
accompany every computer sold. Is there a Sys Admin
reader who has 
not been asked how to download or asked &quot;Remember
those 
pictures you sent me? Were they ALL supposed to be pink
and green? 
What do I do now?&quot; or &quot;I can't read the file
you sent me!&quot; 
For the Windows platform, this book provides the answers;
it allows 
the administrator to say &quot;look it up&quot; and
return to the task 
of administering the system.<P>

There is one trend in books that I would like to note.
We have moved 
from the simple to the complex; from the specialist's
book to a text 
for everyone. What this means to the reader is a matter
of physical 
fitness. Instead of carrying two 200-page books, he
or she now transports 
a single 1500-page book. The newer books address everyone:
novice, 
intermediate, and advanced user. Books used to be written
for the 
beginner or for a system administrator with experience;
today's audience 
includes both. As in most situations, there are benefits
and disadvantages. 
Macmillan's &quot;Unleashed&quot; series is excellent,
as are their 
&quot;Inside&quot; editions. <P>

My column in Sys Admin changes constantly. My criterion
for 
selecting a book is based on the book's relevance to
system administrators. 
If I think a system administrator either needs or would
be able to 
use a text's information, or if it will simplify his
or her job, I 
try to review it. I also try to include books that reflect
the 
best in their field. Often, this will encompass books
on the Internet, 
online services, and email habits of users, so the administrator

is aware of what he or she must protect.<P>

Another one of my priceless little books is The Element
of E-mail 
Style (ISBN 0-201-62709-4, Addison-Wesley, $12.95) by
Angell and 
Heslop. (For those who heard my presentation, this review
was not 
included due to time constraints. However, since it
was part of the 
originally planned presentation, I decided to describe
it in this 
column.) The authors show the correct ways to send email,
which occasionally 
uses different rules than normal composition. This book
becomes an 
extremely valuable tool when you are composing email
(although I still 
cannot break the habit of spacing twice following the
end of a sentence). 
This selection also provides useful guidelines for responding,
particularly 
to inflammatory messages, writing carefully versus dashing
off an 
extemporaneous reply, choosing the proper words, spelling
them correctly, 
and conveying the appropriate tone in the message.<P>

Thanks to Peter Salus, who loaned me the single copy
available at 
SANS of Casting the Net, From ARPANET to INTERNET and
beyond . 
. . (ISBN 0-201-87674-4, Addison-Wesley), I am able
to present 
a quick review. (As I spoke, 48 copies were delivered
to Cucumber 
Books at the show.) This is a tale of the Internet --
how it started 
and how it grew. To see where you are going, you have
to know where 
you have been. This book does an admirable job of showing
where we 
have been, why, and how, from the people who were there.<P>

The Internet book that I recommend most for system administrators

is Managing Internet Information Services (ISBN 1-56592-062-7,

O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc. $29.95). It contains
the information that 
administrators need when approaching the Internet and
its services.<P>

As an update to the presentation, a software version
of The Hand 
Book methodology, entitled &quot;KeyMoves,&quot; will
debut this 
summer for both the Windows and Macintosh platforms.
Now, on to some 
new books, which although not yet favorites, are definitely
worth 
reading.<P>

<B><I>Panic! Unix System Crash Dump Analysis</I><br>
by Chris Drake and Kimberley Brown<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-149-386-8<br>
CD-ROM Included</B><P>

Although I smiled at the title of this book when it
arrived, system 
crashes do not usually elicit smiles and laughter. A
system crash 
is extremely serious, and finding out what caused the
crash can be 
very difficult. This is the first book to address crashes,
their causes, 
methods of deciding what happened, and solutions. This
is not normally 
something that novice, or even experienced, system administrators

would undertake. Instead, a guru, who produces tools
from thin air 
(rather like Merlin or Gandolf), analyzes the problems,
solves them, 
and disappears. However, the authors maintain that with
the proper 
knowledge, an experienced administrator can do it. (As
I recall doing 
it, they are probably correct in this assumption. It
isn't fun, and 
requires some hard work in place of a flick of the wrist,
but there 
is no magic to it, and it isn't done with mirrors.)<P>

Drake and Brown address this book to system administrators
with a 
couple of years experience. Some of the analysis requires
programming, 
in both C and assembly language, but the authors realize
that not 
every administrator is an experienced programmer, so
they try to make 
those parts as easy as possible. The book is organized
in three parts: 
Getting Started, Advanced Studies, and Case Histories.
Getting Started 
introduces the system crash and the system hang, and
explains the 
differences. Since both authors are employed by Sun
Microsystems, 
the book uses Solaris 1 (based on BSD) and Solaris 2
(based on UNIX 
System V Release 4). The authors are also familiar with
several UNIX 
variants, so the result produces general rules for UNIX
crashes and 
analysis, while simultaneously illustrating how to accomplish
specific 
tasks for Solaris 1 and 2. The first section also discusses
what procedures 
to implement when a crash occurs, and how to perform
initial analysis 
both with and without adb (absolute debugger). The authors

present an introduction to adb, as well as a chapter
examining 
how it works and its commands. Drake and Brown show
how to use the 
/usr/include header files to your advantage, provide

a look at symbol tables, and devote three chapters to
adb 
macros.<P>

The second section, Advanced Studies, begins with an
introduction 
to assembly language, and to the SPARC assembly language
in particular. 
Other necessary concepts presented include stacks, the
kernel, virtual 
memory, scheduling, file systems, hardware devices and
drivers, Interprocess 
Communication (IPC), STREAMS, trap handling, watchdog
resets, interrupts, 
and multiprocessor kernels. The third segment, Case
Histories, demonstrates 
the use of every concept previously discussed. Through
the case studies, 
the authors evolve a logical procedure for approaching
a crash.<P>

Although the book is not for the novice administrator,
the authors 
explain each topic simply and clearly, occasionally
presenting multiple 
views of a concept, so that it is easily understood.
They augment 
the text with figures and screen dumps whenever applicable
and often 
present alternate ways to solve a problem. The CD-ROM
contains several 
analysis tools, including some adb macros. The authors'
expertise 
in the field is evident, and they have filled a void
in the UNIX library. <P>

<B><I>The USENET Handbook
A User's Guide to Netnews</I><br>
by Mark Harrison<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-101-1 $24.95</B><P>

USENET, also known as Netnews, is essentially a discussion
forum. 
It delves into such varied subjects as software, hardware,
operating 
systems, religion, politics, science, literature, and
some frivolous 
topics as well. In The USENET Handbook, Harrison explains
USENET 
and its history, and then discusses newsreaders. In
order to read 
newsgroups, the user must have a newsreader. Since beginners
occasionally 
find this hard to understand, the author explains newsreaders
in general, 
discusses the different newsreaders available, and presents
tutorials 
on the nn, tin, gnus, and Trumpet 
varieties. Harrison also includes a chapter on posting
articles to 
the Net, including what, when, and where to post, as
well as what 
and when not to post.<P>

Given the sheer bulk of news, it becomes important to
make efficient 
use of Netnews. Harrison devotes a chapter to Getting
the Most Out 
of USENET, including FTP, mail servers, FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions), 
mailing lists, and administration. He also includes
a useful Perl 
script that creates an index for your saved files. He
covers practices 
you may encounter, such as flaming, net jargon, and
encoded messages, 
and tells how to deal with them, explaining the concept
of netiquette. 
Other topics detail Software, Pictures, Other Goodies
(and where to 
find them), and Using Mail. <P>

The appendices are perhaps the most important sections
of this book, 
and will be the most used. Here, Harrison lists the
current newsgroups 
and the alternative newsgroups. Each appears with a
short description 
of what the user may expect to find within that particular
newsgroup. 
This is a well-written book, serving both as an introduction
to USENET 
and as a menu to what USENET has to offer. Harrison
presents commands 
for different newreaders, and shows how to use them.
He covers the 
most popular newsreaders for both UNIX and Windows platforms,
and 
shows how to respond to postings, a procedure often
confusing to the 
newcomer. The newsgroup directory will be welcomed by
all, and 
in itself make the book a valuable resource and a handy
reference 
guide. Overall, this is an excellent guide, one that
will become essential 
to USENET users. <P>
