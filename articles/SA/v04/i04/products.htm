<B>Haystack Labs Adds SATAN Detector to Stalker</B><P>

Haystack Labs has announced additions to Stalker's Misuse
Detector 
which can detect outsiders using SATAN to scan systems.
Stalker's 
Misuse Signature database provides a list of attack
patterns, which 
allows Stalker to monitor and detect a range of methods
used to break 
in to Unix systems. A pattern for SATAN has been incorporated
into 
the database.<P>

Stalker is active security monitoring software for UNIX
systems, designed 
to track system activities. Stalker manages system audit
files, dynamically 
detects breaking and insider abuse on UNIX systems,
automatically 
sends alarms, and generates standard reports on user
activities and 
resource access. SATAN (Security Administrator Tool
for Analyzing 
Networks) is a diagnostic tool which was designed to
help identify 
and close network and system weaknesses, but can be
used to exploit 
such holes. Stalker can detect not only the initial
SATAN probes, 
but also hacker attacks based on the results of a SATAN
scan.<P>

An update with the SATAN detection capability is being
distributed 
free to all registerd Stalker customers as a part of
Haystacks' ongoing 
security subscription service. New customers will automatically
receive 
the SATAN detection capability. Stalker is priced at
$375 per monitored 
client, and $15,500 per monitoring server. Stalker is
available for 
SunOS, Sun Solaris, Sun Trusted Solaris, and IBM AIX.

<B>Boole &amp; Babbage Launch Ensign</B><P>

Boole &amp; Babbage, Inc., has introduced Ensign, a
suite of UNIX system 
adminstration and management tools. The Ensign product
family is focused 
on simplifying and automating a UNIX administrator's
essential, everyday 
tasks. In addition, Ensign enables simultaneous control
of the same 
UNIX systems from a central data center and a remote
site location 
by different levels of staff, permitting delegation
of some operations 
(local print queue management) to local staff, while
keeping other 
operations centralized (backup and recovery of critical
data files). <P>

Ensign Central Manager and Ensign Alarm Manager were
developed from 
client/server technology acquired with Oslo-based Sysnet
Corporation 
earlier this year. A third product, Ensign Local Manager,
is being 
enhanced. Central Manager (multi-system) and Local Manager
(single-system) 
cover major administration applications. Ensign Alarm
Manager performs 
surveillance and automated problem correction of multiple
UNIX functions 
and status levels. The Ensign products use autonomous
&quot;agent&quot; software 
located on the managed systems. The  Ensign tools can
typically be 
installed in 60 minutes, and require no other &quot;framework&quot;
product 
to function. A standard GUI interfaces to all major
UNIX platforms.<P>

Ensign supports up to 13 different platforms, including
HP-UX, SunOS, 
Sun Solaris, AIX, and SCO. For more information, contact
Boole 
&amp; Babbage, Inc., 3131 Zanker Road, San Jose, CA

<B>CoroNet Introduces End-to-End Monitoring</B><P>

CoroNet Systems has announced CoroNet Management System
(CMS), a network 
management system which discovers, identifies, and monitors
client-server 
application conversations, network operating systems,
and network 
protocols end-to-end across enterprise networks in real-time.
CMS 
addresses discovery and measurement, resource utilization
tracking, 
detailed performance measurement, chargeback reporting,
and expert 
rule-based design and optimization using live network
data.<P>

CMS consists of a set of Windows-based management applications
built 
on top of CoroNet's Super Monitor Windows-based networked
applications 
monitoring system. Release 1.0 includes Super Monitor
and Single View, 
a console application providing an integrated view of
network components 
and application conversations. Once CMS is installed
on a network, 
CMS automatically discovers and displays the entire
network topology 
including all network segments, routers, servers, and
clients, as 
well as the network protocols and the applications running
across 
the protocols. CMS can then trace all conversations
in real-time, 
reporting the performance and bandwidth utilization
of specific applications 
on the whole network, on specific segments, or to and
from specific 
network elements.<P>

CMS recognizes major network operating systems (NFS,
Novell NetWare, 
Digitial PathWorks, Microsoft LAN Manager, Apple Share,
Banyan Vines, 
IBM LAN Server), network protocols (TCP/IP, IPX/SPX,
DECnet, NetBIOS, 
Appletalk, Vines, XNS, SNA), and applications including
Oracle, Sybase, 
Informix, ASK/Ingres, cc:Mail, MS-Mail, QuickMail, Lotus
Notes, Mosaic, 
MS Office, Novell Perfect Office, or Lotus SmartSuite.<P>

CMS requires a 486 PC with 12Mb of memory and Microsoft
Windows. Super 
Monitor is priced at $4,995 for a five pack or $24,995
for a corporate 
license. A Single View license includes one Super Monitor
and is priced 
at $6,995; a three-pack costs $16,495. For more information,

<B>Computronics Releases SYSMON and ASI-ACCOUNTING</B><P>

Computronics has released SYSMON and ASI-ACCOUNTING.
SYSMON is an 
event-driven monitoring tool for UNIX systems which
tracks memory 
use, swapping, buffer utilization, CPU use, disk I/O,
and more. SYSMON 
can be configured so that intensive monitoring is triggered
by system 
states -- such as unusually high CPU utilization. SYSMON
has a graphical 
tool, SYSGRAPH, which plots performance values, and
a context-sensitive 
help facility. SYSMON is also available as SysmonX,
an X Window version 
which runs in a client/server environment and permits
monitoring one 
system from another. SYSMON can save perormance items
(including user-defined 
items) into files at regular intervals, permitting trend
analysis. 
SYSMON allows users to create their own performance
meters and screens, 
such as application-based counters, and view up to nine
screens simultaneously.<P>

When SYSMON identifies a peformance bottleneck, it warns
the operator, 
makes a log entry, and makes suggestions about the source
of the trouble 
and ways to rectify it, such as new scheduling techniques,
memory 
management techniques, etc.<P>

ASI-ACCOUNTING is a set of programs for tracking resource
utilization, 
including number of logins, CPU usage, I/O usage, connect
time, and 
print resource usage. ASI-ACCOUNTING provides over 1000
report formats, 
and can present both technical and management reports.
Attributes 
maintained include user ID, user number, project ID,
login type, ETHERNET 
or X.25 source node name/address, and more. ASI-ACCOUNTING
is available 
on UNIX platforms, including HP-UX, AIX, SunOS, Solaris,
DG-UX, Ultrix, 
MIPS, and generic SVR4 systems.<P>

<B>HEROIX Introduces RoboMon Investigator</B><P>

HEROIX Corporation has introduced RoboMon Investigator,
a tool for 
managing resources and troubleshooting problems on multiple
UNIX systems. 
RoboMon Investigator was designed to provide highly
visual, interactive, 
simple, and flexible control of a computer's resources.
RoboMon Investigator 
is capable of collecting over 200 statistics from UNIX,
categorized 
into seven domains: files, files summarized by user,
files summarized 
by group, file systems, processes, users, and networks.
Some of the 
problems which can be identified include overly large
files, new large 
files, storage allocation issues, file systems not mounted,
file systems 
running out of space, CPU hogs, zombie processes, missing
critical 
processes, inactive users, users without passwords,
and excessive 
network traffic.<P>

RoboMon Investigator provides a Motif-based GUI, and
permits users 
to add site-specific actions. Collected data is presented
in spreadsheet-like 
displays called Views. <P>

<B>Aurora Announces Automated Performance Analysis for
SCO UNIX</B><P>

Aurora Software has announced SarCheck 1.0, a tool for
analyzing system 
activity reports produced by SCO UNIX. SarCheck collects
and explains 
various system statistics in a report written in &quot;plain
English.&quot;

explains 
how the bottlenecks were identified, and recommends
solutions. SarCheck 
can recognize CPU, memory, and disk bottlenecks and
can recommend 
changes in tunable parameters or hardware.<P>

SarCheck was consciously designed as a resource analyzer,
rather than 
a resource monitor. It uses data collected by tools
that are part 
of the SCO UNIX operating system.<P>

SarCheck costs $199. For more information, contact Aurora
