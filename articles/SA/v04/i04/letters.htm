Dear Sir,<br>

In my current position I find myself writing a number
of short programs. 
I have a hard time keeping track of what might be the
most recent 
variation of any given program or approach. I always
have a good idea 
of which directory might contain any given program,
script, or file.<P>

Given that the most recent version is usually the version
I want to 
use, I need to have a dated catalogue of the directory
in question 
sorted in chronological order with the most recent first.<P>

The enclosed listing (Listing 1)  (E-Media Production Manager's note:  Listings found within the New Messages/Letters can be found by
scrolling to the bottom of the current page.)   shows my solution to
this dilemma. 
If you feel it can help someone else in the same predicament,
please 
feel free to publish it in the New Messages section
of Sys Admin.<P>

Yours truly,<br>

RE: Issue Nov/Dec 1994,Vol. 3. No. 6. Article: Monitoring
and Optimizing <br>
NFS Performance by Robert Berry.<P>

I appreciate articles like Mr. Berry's. Not only does
it provide useful 
information, it was also short and nontaxing to read.
The script he 
provided also met these criteria. And in the interest
of not violating 
Mr. Berry's short and nontaxing article, here is a small
script (Listing 2)  (E-Media Production Manager's note:  Listings referenced within the New Messages/Letters can be found by
scrolling to the bottom of the current page.) 
that uses the netstat command, which did not appear
in his script. 
His article suggested that high output error rates on
your system 
might &quot;indicate a problem with your own network
interface.&quot; 
Furthermore, a percentage of five or greater is offered
as a peak 
or cutoff point between acceptable and unacceptable
levels. However, 
the norm for your system might be different. I have
a Sun Sparc Station 
II with SUNOS 4.1.3_U1. My percentages, thus far, have
fallen between 
2.52 and 2.8. I obtained those percentages with the
attached script. 
This script sets up a few variables, a function (CALCULATE)
and 
uses bc to do the math. I set the scale for bc to 5.
That might be 
a bit of an overkill, but it can be changed to fit your
needs. The 
CALCULATE function divides collisions (CO) by the output
packets 
(OP) then multiplies by 100 as instructed in the article.
I cron'ed 
the script to periodically mail me the results so I
could establish 
a history. Should a mail message arrive with a percentage
that is 
not normal I can then start researching the problem.
Output may also 
be appended to a file if the need exists.<P>

Subject: NFS and TCP/IP running DOS/WINDOWS with SCO 3.2.4<P>

Would you tell me where I can obtain public domain source
code for 
NFS and TCP/IP? If you have compiled programs that run
on dos/windows, 
I would like to try them on my AT-class machine and
test for SCO UNIX 
NFS and TCP/IP.<P>

Victor Wu<br>
email address: jdjacobs@rdjlaw.com<P>

<I>I'm afraid I don't know any complete, public-domain
DOS 
implementation. There are pieces (mostly packet drivers
for certain 
ethernet cards) in various places. In particular, one
of the Walnut 
Creek CD-ROMs (I think it's the CICA Source CD, perhaps
they could 
tell you) has packet drivers. We've been using various
commercial 
implementations.<P>

Unfortunately, I can't testify to the usability of that

code, since I've never installed it. I'm not even convinced
the documentation 
that comes with it is adequate to manage an installation.
<P>

I have, however, installed the yggdrasil linux distribution

and can highly recommend it. It comes with complete
source code for 
the entire operating system, as well as all the source
for all the 
networking layers. I've also experimented with the slackware
and another 
distribution of Linux. Of the three, I prefer yggdrasil
for ease of 
installation. It's also available from Walnut Creek.<P>

I've never tried to adapt any of the Linux code to SCO,

so I can't comment on how hard that will be, but I highly
recommend 
it as a platform. We have SCO for our main platform,
but are planning 
to use Linux for several departmental servers.<P>

You can reach Walnut Creek at:<br>

Mr. Robert Ward<br>
Senior Editor/Publisher<br>
SUBJECT: Good Job<P>

I have seen a notable change in your magazine from the
earlier 
Root to Sys Admin. Keep up the good work.<P>

Recently I was reviewing my current SCO Xenix system
which includes 
15 terminals and uses WordPerfect, Informix and Professional
software. 
To my surprise the root system was filling up at a rapid
rate. After 
searching for the cause I found a huge file (over 75
meg) in the directory 
/etc called wtmp. The file script find /-size +lO00
-print 
did not locate this file.<P>

After calling various people to try to find out more
about this file 
and finally reading the book by Bruce Hunter on Unix
administration, 
I found out that this file stores accounting or system
information 
and builds every minute the system is active. I reduced
the file to 
zero size and my problem was solved. I now watch this
file daily.<P>

Thought this information might be useful to other SCO
Xenix users.<P>

#Title:             NC: meaning Node Collisions, Nasty Collisions
#                   Number Collisions - your choice.
#Author:            George Sullivan
#Date:              Wednesday, December 7, 1994
#Description:       NC calculates a percentage based on the number of output
#                   packets and collisions resulting from the netstat command.
#                   The number of collisions are divided by the number of output
#                   packets. Then this result is multiplied by 100 to establish the
#                   the percentage. The percentage can be monitored periodically
#                   and corrective action can be taken should the percentage be
#                   abnormal.
#Requirements:      NC requires the following unix commands: netstat, grep,
#                   awk, bc
