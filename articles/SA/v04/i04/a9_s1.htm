<H1>Sidebar: A printcap Entry Dissected</H1><p>
<P>
The following is a printcap entry I set up on one of
the systems 
I manage. It shows several features of a normal printcap
entry 
extended with optional filters. This entry is for a
Hewlett-Packard 
LaserJet III connected to a Sun SPARCSTATION 10 using
a null modem 
cable attached to serial port A.<P>
<PRE>

<p>
printcap entries consist of one line of data. Each entry
option 
is separated by a colon. Empty options are allowed,
so that :: 
is okay. When the line is too long, a backslash (&quot;\&quot;)
extends 
the entry to the next lines. For more information, see
printcap(5).<P>

The sample entries have the following meanings:<P>

<I>lj|lj3|laser jet 3|:</I> The first entry lists 
names or aliases of the printer, each separated by the
vertical bar 
(&quot;|&quot;). Thus, to use this printer, users may
type lj 
or lj3. One printer in the printcap should have the

name lp, representing the system's default printer.<P>

<I>lp=/dev/ttya:</I> This is the physical device 
the printer is attached to -- in this case, serial port
a.<P>

<I>br#9600:</I> This is the baud rate to use for 
serial communications. Note that a &quot;#&quot; is
used between the 
br option and its value. This convention for numeric
options 
is comparable to the &quot;=&quot; used for string options.<P>

<I>ms=pass8,opost,ixon,onlcr,crtscts:</I> This option 
holds several communications parameters (see stty(1)).<P>

<I>sd=/var/spool/lpd:</I> This is the spool directory. 
Files destined for this printer are copied here.<P>

<I>lf=/var/adm/lpd-errs:</I> This is the file to 
use for logging errors.<P>

<I>sh:</I> This says that the header page should 
not be printed. This is a boolean option and is not
followed by a 
value. The value is implied by the option's presence.<P>

<I>mx#0:</I> This tells the largest file printable 
in bytes. Setting mx to 0 removes the size limitation.<P>

<I>if=/usr/local/lib/filters/sethp:</I> This is 
the input filter to use if no other filter is specified
on the command 
line. sethp initializes the printer, then sends the
print 
job unchanged to the printer. <P>

<I>cf=/usr/local/lib/filters/setland:</I> This is 
a filter invoked with the -c option on lpr's command

line. setland puts the printer in landscape mode before
sending 
the print job. <P>

<I>df=/usr/local/lib/filters/setnomarg:</I> This 
is another filter, invoked with the -d option. setnomarg

sets the margins as close to the edge of the paper as
possible and 
changes to a smaller font.<P>

<I>nf=/usr/local/wp/shbin/wpp:</I> This is a filter 
installed in printcap by the WordPerfect installation
program.<P>

Some printcap entries include fc and fs options. 
These options clear or set bits to fine-tune the serial
communications 
used by the print system. I try to avoid using them
if I can, as they 
are rather confusing. Information for which bits to
set is spread 
among several man pages and include files (the .h 
files in the /usr/include directory). The ms option

is usually sufficient for what you want to do. <P>
