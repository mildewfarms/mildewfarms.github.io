Before I get started, first a correction to the previous
issue. The 
Canadian company which sells UNIX tools for MS-DOS was
misnamed: the 
correct name is MKS, and the software is called the
MKS Toolkit. MKS 
can be reached at:<P>

<B>Report from SANS</B><P>

SANS 4 took place in Washington, DC in April. This conference
is growing, 
and is in its own right becoming a major event for UNIX
system administrators. 
It differs from LISA, which is also aimed at the UNIX
system administration 
community, in that it has a somewhat more commercial
aim: vendors 
are more welcome, and are better integrated into the
conference. It 
is not, however, a vendor-driven conference, as is the
case with so 
many of the conferences that feature large vendor shows.
SANS is still 
less than half the size of LISA, which makes it a pleasant,
more personal 
experience. Two of my favorite papers from this year's
conference 
were &quot;How To Find Good System Administrators in
Twelve Easy Questions&quot; 
and &quot;Building a Security Infrastructure: What You
Want vs. What 
You Need vs What You Can Afford,&quot; both by Michele
D. Crabb, a 
security specialist from NASA Ames. Another very good
paper is &quot;People 
Skills for the System Administrator,&quot; by P. David
Parks. The best 
ad-hoc tool was described in &quot;The NetScanner Network
Monitoring 
Tool,&quot; by Jack Stewart.<P>

The conference proceedings contain the full text of
all papers, along 
with the results of the 1994 System Administration Salary
Survey. 
(An overview of those results was published in the Jan/Feb
issue of 
Sys Admin.)<P>

The conference proceedings, should you be interested,
can be purchased 
from USENIX, a co-sponsor of the SANS conference:<P>

<B>Sun Microsystems Sunscreen</B><P>

Sun finally unveiled its new firewall, cutely named
SunScreen, which 
had been rumored for some time. It is essentially a
packet screening 
filter, apparently similar to screend, running under
Solaris 
on a Sparc 5 platform. The packet filter is managed
by a graphical 
user interface, running on a separate Windows machine.
While the screening 
mechanism was a disappointment, SunScreen has a number
of interesting 
details that are worth mentioning. It uses what the
Sun marketing 
folks call a unique &quot;stealth&quot; design -- ethernet
connections 
which implement only the lower part of TCP/IP protocol
stack and therefore 
do not provide any means of getting access to the machine
itself. 
The product also offers encrypted traffic across the
Internet, but 
this is not as newsworthy, as almost all other firewall
vendors either 
offer it already, or are scrambling to provide it soon.<P>

All in all, this is not an unattractive packet, although
very pricey, 
as a basic system starts at $40,000, and according to
Sun, a more 
realistic implementation would go for $100,000.<P>

<B>One More Word on SATAN</B><P>

Ironically, SATAN, the much discussed security checking
system, proved 
to be a security risk in itself. If you are using SATAN,
you are advised 
to use the latest version, currently version 1.1.1.<P>

And now to this month's questions.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 We have a number of servers which I would like our
users 
to be able to access in a round-robin manner. Is this
supported in 
BIND?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 It is not (yet) supported in the standard version of

BIND (Berkeley Internet Domain -- the UNIX implementation
of the 
nameserver). However, this feature has been discussed
for some time, 
and there is at least one BIND code patch floating around
the Internet 
that implements it. However, if you are not a regular
BIND hacker, 
you will have to be a bit patient, as modifying BIND
is not for the 
weak of heart. The sooner Paul Vixie (the current main
BIND architect) 
gets around to including this feature, the better for
the rest of 
us.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 We are about to install News on our site. As I never

have done this before, I have two questions: how difficult
is it to 
do, and which News software should we use?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Another question where the answer is: It depends. There

are two main packages currently used as News transfer
agents. Which 
one to choose depends on the local circumstances. C-News,
written 
by Geoff Collyer and Henry Spencer, which is the older
of the two 
(the name is chosen for historical reasons; C-News was
a successor 
to the older B-News transfer agent), was originally
written using 
UUCP as the underlying transfer mechanism, although
it can use NNTP 
when the separate nntp package is added (nntp is just

one implementation of the NNTP [Network News Transfer
Protocol]). 
This package is still a good choice for smaller News
sites -- that 
is, sites which do not receive a full news feed -- whether
UUCP 
or NNTP is used as the underlying transfer mechanism.
Larger Internet 
sites will probably want to use the newer INN (Internet
Network News), 
written by Rich Salz. INN is a faster and more efficient
implementation 
than C-News, at the cost of being a memory hog. However,
this tradeoff 
enables INN to keep up with the heavy traffic load in
today's News 
servers.<P>

For smaller sites, there is a third alternative to be
considered. 
If you have a reasonable amount of network bandwidth,
but not many 
users who read News, then you should consider reading
News from another 
site. You can do this by providing your users with a
News reader which 
uses NNTP to read News, rather than depending on local
files. If this 
works for you, you do not need to install and maintain
a News agent. 
Many Internet service providers can provide you with
this service, 
or you may get permission to read News from a large
site in your area 
(but choose somebody using the same provider; you get
higher performance 
that way).<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I am relatively new to System V, and am trying to get

an overview of the RC files used by that system. The
number involved 
makes it difficult for me to understand as well as I
would like.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 The System V release 4 implementation of RC files is

a great example of a good idea taken far beyond a reasonable
scope. 
Unfortunately, that seems to be typical for that flavor
of UNIX. These 
files are an example of the linked files from Hell.
Before you start 
looking at the content of the files, you will need to
figure out which 
files are linked together. As hard links are used, you
will need to 
sort them out according to their inode numbers. The
files that have 
the same inode numbers are really a single file which
appears to be 
in more than one place. When you have done this, you
will end up with 
many fewer files, and you only have to read one version
of each set 
of linked files. It is still messy, but at least you
have a chance 
to figure out what the system does at boot time.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Perl 5 has been out for some time now. Should I upgrade?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 That would probably be a very good idea. Perl 5 appears

to be almost perfectly backwards compatible with perl
4. In addition, 
the interpreter is faster, and there are a number of
nice extensions 
to the language. I especially appreciate the better
facility for data 
structures and pointers, which opens the language up
to &quot;real&quot; 
programming.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 We are connected to the rest of the world by UUCP.
A 
few weeks ago, we suddenly started having problems receiving
files, 
although we had made no changes to the UUCP configuration,
and our 
UUCP feed claims that they had not made any changes
either. What could 
be wrong?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I think both of you should check your modems, and ensure

that modem flow control is enabled. If you are using
fast modems, 
which almost everyone does these days, make sure that
you are using 
hardware flow control, as software flow control might
not be fast 
enough, particularly if the machine the modem is connected
to is slow 
or heavily loaded. <P>

If a UUCP file transfer starts up, runs for a while,
and then for 
some mysterious reason stops or gets very slow, you
can almost always 
place a safe bet that it is a modem problem. In fact,
I do not remember 
ever having seen this problem not be caused by misconfigured
modems.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Where can I find the newest version of the UNIX Name

Server?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 You can get it by anonymous ftp from ftp.vix.com/pub/bind/testing

(or in URL speak ftp://ftp.vix.com/pub/bind/testing).
This 
version is semi-public and primarily intended for testing
purposes; 
however, it appears to be fairly stable.<P>

The last version that has been officially fully released
is available 
from ftp.uu.net, in the directory /networking/ip/dns/bind.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I'm a subscriber to Sys Admin magazine, and I've 
been downloading code listings via UUNET's 900 number.
Unfortunately, 
UUNET has cancelled that service. The people at Sys
Admin suggested 
I email you and ask if the ftp site you're setting up
will 
allow ftp via email (I have a uucp Internet connection
through 
holonet). TIA.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I have no immediate plans for adding ftp via 
e-mail for the sysadmin ftp archive, as I want the archive

to become more complete before venturing out into other
projects. 
In the meantime, you can ftp by mail, using the service
from 
decwrl. Send email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com, with 
the necessary ftp commands in the mail body.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I am having a problem uncompressing may95.tar.Z. 
I downloaded the file from ftp.sysadmin.com to my PC,
then 
used binary ftp to transfer it to our UNIX workstation.
When I do 
an &quot;uncompress&quot; or &quot;compress -d may95.tar,&quot;
I get 
an error message &quot;file not in compressed format.&quot;
When I look 
at the file it sure looks compressed. Nothing is recognizable.

Any suggestions?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Most of the files on ftp.sysadmin.com are compressed

with the gzip program. You can recognize which compression

algorithm has been used by looking at the extension
of the file. A 
&quot;.Z&quot; extension used the older, and less efficient,
compress 
program, while files with a &quot;.gz&quot; extension
have been compressed 
by the much more efficient gzip program. You can find
the 
source for both programs in the compress directory.
Also, 
I have changed the files with Sys Admin content to no
longer 
be compressed.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I work as a system administrator, supporting our IBM

RS/6000 line of workstations running AIX. Recently,
I was posed an 
interesting and seemingly impossible question by one
of our clients. 
The site where they are working has a large number of
user accounts 
on one machine. This site is a hospital, and when a
report or memo 
is typed up and saved on this machine, at best it is
meant to be read 
only by people in their group. To enforce this security,
my client 
has set up each department within the hospital in its
own group on 
the RS/6000.<P>

Unfortunately, this has led to a problem. From what
we can determine, 
NIS will ignore anything past the 512th character in
the file /etc/groups. 
This is not good since many of these groups have large
numbers of 
users.<P>

My question is this: Is there a third-party application
that we can 
run that allows for more users in a group?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 I don't like NIS, in part for basic design considerations,

but especially for reasons of security. I therefore
avoid using NIS 
whenever I have the chance to do so, and it seems ironic
that your 
client is basing security on a piece of software that
can be broken 
so easily.<P>

You might be able to solve your problem by not using
the NIS maps 
for the /etc/group file. Instead, start distributing
this 
information using rdist (get the new version from the
University 
of Southern California). This will also remove one security
hole (more 
or less -- NIS will leave another open). However, because
you are 
not only using NIS, but also AIX, you might have a worse
problem, 
because SMIT, the AIX system administration tool, makes
such solutions 
very difficult to work out in practice. You might also
check to see 
if your vendor is planning to migrate to NIS+, which
fixes many of 
the problems identified in NIS. <P>
