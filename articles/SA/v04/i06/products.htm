<B>Seagate Releases DiMONS 1.2</B><P>

SEAGATE Enterprise Management Software (Seagate EMS)
has released DiMONS
1.2, the latest step users of the NetLabs/DiMONS network
management
platform can follow for migrating to the HP OpenView
network and systems
management platform. DiMONS 1.2 is intended to be the
final version of
the platform software, incorporating enhanced alarm
management, polling,
and reporting features designed to take advantage of
the Seagate
NerveCenter event correlation application.<P>

Seagate NerveCenter is a distributed, rule-based application
which uses
a state diagram paradigm to correlate network conditions,
identify
critical problems, and filter superfluous events. Combined
with HP
OpenView Network Node Manager, an enterprise license
of Seagate
NerveCenter can distribute network management across
multiple domains.
Users at remote sites can handle local problems and
also forward
designated events for centralized management.<P>

DiMONS 1.2 runs on SunSPARC and HP 9000 workstations
and is being
delivered as part of maintenance agreements. Seagate
NerveCenter is
priced at $15,000. The next release of Seagate NerveCenter,
expected to
be available with the conversion software in November,
will be offered
to DiMONS customers at a discount. For more information

<B>Network Peripherals Introduces Adapters and LAN Switch</B><P>

Network Peripherals has introduced a third-generation
Ethernet-FDDI
switching hub and a new PCI adapter for connecting to
a FDDI workgroup
backbone. The EIFO+ Client/Server Switching Hub was
designed for
workgroups with up to 500 users and provides 12 10Mbps
Ethernet 10BaseT
ports for workstation or Ethernet segment connections,
and two 100Mbps
FDDI fiber or unshielded twisted pair (CDDI) uplinks
for backbone access
or server connectivity.<P>

EIFO+ implements three significant features: the FIREchip,
an IP
fragmentation engine implemented on a switch port basis;
NPI's
Distributed Switching Architecture, described as delivering
consistent
wire-speed performance on each of the EIFO+'s 12 ports;
and distributed
virtual LAN (VLAN) creation and mirroring capabilities
to define and
manage VLANs over an FDDI network.<P>

The NPI-PCI adapters provide a copper (CDDI) or fiber
(FDDI) connection
for PCI bus systems. The adapter uses a 32-bit DMA bus
master
architecture with one megabyte of on-board buffer memory.
Driver
software is optimized for Novell NetWare 3.x/4.x, Microsoft
Windows NT
3.5, and is compliant with ODI and NDIS 3.x standards.
FDDI network
statistics are provided by integrated SMT 7.3 station
management
software handled by the on-board CPU.<P>

EIFO+ pricing depends on configuration and starts at
$8,495. NPI-PCI
adapter pricing begins at $795. For more information
