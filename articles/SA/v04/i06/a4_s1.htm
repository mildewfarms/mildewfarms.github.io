<H1>Sidebar: About Data Junction for Windows</H1><p>
<P>
It is probably impossible for any developer to have
sufficient expertise
to manage data conversions between even the major databases.
To
facilitate data movement, we are evaluating a client-server
product,
Data Junction for Windows from:<P>

<I>Tools &amp; Techniques, Incorporated
2201 Northland Drive
Austin, Texas 78756
Telephone: 1512-459-1308</I><P>

Besides conversions for the basic DOS packages (Dbase,
FoxPro, Lotus,
etc.), Data Junction provides Open Database Connectivity
(ODBC) between
most of the major databases. An example would be connecting
from the
source Oracle to the target Informix, with no need for
an ASCII
conversion. Among the different ODBC environments supported
are Access,
Informix, Oracle, SQL Server, and Watcom SQL.<P>

To test ODBC, we connected Data Junction to Oracle Work
Group Server,
v7.1, with the Oracle server on SCO UNIX. The target
conversion was a
CSV-delimited ASCII file. The network was NetWare 3.12,
with ODBC being
provided by Oracle. Setting up ODBC was straightforward
and painless,
since most of the administrative work had been performed
during the
Oracle installation. We were able to unload any table
we wanted from the
Oracle database to ASCII.<P>

Our main test involved performing a delimited-to-CSV
conversion exactly
as outlined in the article. The conversion was successful
except for
handling datetime data types. Because of the many ways
date and time get
stored, Data Junction requires datetime to remain a
text string, so we
are still unable to perform a conversion without the
datetime being
delimited by double quotes.<P>

Even if ODBC is not part of your world, the ASCII conversion
capability
Data Junction provides make this product well worth
investigating. If
supporting client-server and multiple database development
is in your
future, then you should definitely look at Data Junction
for Windows.<P>
