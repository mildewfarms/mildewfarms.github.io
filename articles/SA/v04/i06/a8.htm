<H1>Books: A User's Report</H1><p>
<P>
Elizabeth Zinkann<P>

This month, I take a brief look at The Unofficial Macintosh
Guide to
America Online, by Charles Flynn, and a more in-depth
look at
Client-Server Yellow Pages, by Ted Lewis; The Computer
User's Survival
Guide, by Joan Stigliani; Internet in Plain English,
by Brian
Pfaffenberger; Net Tech: Your Guide to Tech Support,
Product News and
Software Resources on the Info Highway, by Kelly Maloni,
Ben Greenman,
and Jeff Hearn; Lan Times Guide to Telephony, by David
D. Bezar; and
Instant UNIX, by Andrew Evans, Neil Matthew, and Richard
Stones.<P>

Occasionally, I discover a book that, although it does
not concern
either UNIX systems or system administrators directly,
is so outstanding
that it deserves a mention at the very least. The Unofficial
Macintosh
Guide to America Online, by Charles Flynn (John Wiley
&amp; Sons, Inc.; ISBN
0-471-06482-3; $19.95), provides the Macintosh user
with information
about being online and solutions to common problems,
whether encountered
online or offline. Although I do not have a Macintosh,
a lot of online
users do, and I often receive Macintosh related questions.
This book
furnishes the answers in a helpful and straightforward
manner. I
recommend it to Macintosh users, online travelers, and
system
administrators.<P>

<B><I>Client-Server Yellow Pages</I><br>
by Ted Lewis<br>
Manning Publications Company<br>
Manning ISBN 1-884777-04-X<br>
Prentice Hall ISBN 0-13-304601-X<br>
$33.00</B><P>

System administrators routinely perform tasks involving
client-server
systems and products. Consequently, they need some type
of resource or
reference that lists the available products and offers
pertinent
information. Ted Lewis's Client-Server Yellow Pages
meets that need.
Lewis begins with a short chapter detailing the history
and development
of client/server computing. The following sections,
&quot;Products&quot; and
&quot;Vendors,&quot; specify over 200 client/server
products and 250 vendors. Each
entry in the product section includes the product and
company name, type
of product, server and client platforms, pricing, a
description, pros
and cons, the versions reviewed, and where possible,
a rating by a
publication. The vendor section provides the company
name, address,
phone numbers, and some background. Lewis also includes
a short
glossary, an index of products by type, and an index
of vendors by
location.<P>

Although the versions described may not be the most
current, that is a
consequence of the publishing deadline more than anything
else. The
information provided is useful and presented in an attractive
format. (I
could even read the phone numbers without my glasses!)
For anyone
involved with client/server technology, this is an excellent
reference.<P>

<B><I>The Computer User's Survival Guide</I><br>
by Joan Stigliani<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-030-9<br>
$24.95</B><P>

Every computer user has experienced occasional stiffness
or soreness
while at the computer. Usually, a short break and/or
a change in
position will remedy it. However, with the emergence
of carpal tunnel
syndrome and Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSIs), computer
health has
become a more serious issue. Carpal tunnel syndrome
and RSIs are not
really new health problems. They can occur in any profession
or activity
that requires repetitive use of one particular movement.
RSIs range from
the butcher's slicing to tennis elbow, writer's cramp,
and golfer's
elbow. The computer industry appeared to relatively
injury free until
the 1980s. Since then, the expense and severity of these
injuries have
increased significantly. Fear of these injuries has
also invaded both
office and home environments.<P>

Stigliani approaches the topic of computer survival
in five sections:
The Basics; Repetitive Strain Injury; Eyestrain; Stress;
and The
Potential Risks of Electromagnetic Fields. The preface
introduces the
topic, identifies the book's intended audience, and
explains who is
involved in different aspects of the issue (individuals,
employers,
manufacturers, and government). The preface explains
how to use the
book, partly by means of a table with &quot;Your main
concern,&quot; &quot;Start by
reading,&quot; and &quot;Then explore&quot; headings.
In the first section, The Basics,
the first chapter illustrates some of the problems that
can develop from
prolonged incorrect posture or sloppy habits while at
the computer. The
next chapter describes different postures at the computer
and how to
identify your individual natural position (everyone
has a different one,
so there is no one absolute correct way to sit or stand).
Once you've
recognized your most comfortable positions, it becomes
easier for you to
modify the surrounding environment, as discussed in
the third chapter.
The next three chapters concern paying attention to
your body and the
signals it is sending (try to listen to your body, no
matter how
interesting the program is), how to use breathing to
relax or stretch,
and general guidelines for exercise and massages to
keep your body in
good condition.<P>

The second section of the book investigates Repetitive
Strain Injuries
(RSIs): what they really are, how they feel, what causes
them, the tools
available to help users prevent RSIs, good hand techniques,
treating the
injuries, and the recovery process. Stigliani uses real-life
examples to
illustrate the chaos and frustration that RSIs can introduce
into
previously well-organized lives.<P>

The single effective cure for a repetitive strain injury
is prevention.
If a user already has an RSI, Stigliani describes the
correct procedures
for treatment, including how to select a physician and
different methods
of aiding the healing process. (Before reading this
book, I had never
thought about the problem of locating an effective doctor.)<P>

Eyestrain, the third major topic, shows how computer
users damage their
eyes, often without realizing it. Since vision problems
occur so
frequently (with or without computers) and for such
a variety of reasons
(including the ever-popular &quot;You are getting to
be that age, you know&quot;),
eyestrain problems often tend to be casually dismissed.
Users pay
typically more attention to their work than to their
physical comfort.
As a result, they may develop poor posture, awkward
positions, or a
fixed stare at the monitor, which can lead to interruptions
in blinking,
breathing, and movement in general. Stigliani discusses
methods of
counteracting these bad habits, ranging from deliberate
yawning and
stretching to varied massage and relaxation techniques.
She assesses the
advantages and disadvantages of glasses and contact
lenses and suggests
some beneficial practices for wearers of both. She also
addresses
customizing the environment, reviewing color choices,
plant selection,
and light and lamp placement.<P>

The fourth topic is stress, which is a significant health
factor for
computer users as well as for those in other occupations.
Stigliani
identifies three types of stress _ physical, emotional,
and behavioral _
and describes their accompanying symptoms. She mentions
some of the
medical conditions related to stress and the different
stresses
associated with specific careers and job levels. She
then suggests ways
to alleviate stress generally, but makes a particular
point of reminding
computer users of the importance of balancing computer
and social time
(and, in some cases, computer social time).<P>

The concluding section examines the risk of radiation
from
electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and extremely low frequency
fields (ELFs).
The relationships of some of the individual health concerns
to ELFs
cannot be verified. Moreover, computers are only one
source of ELFs _
others include such styles of everyday life as  building
wiring,
televisions, toasters, office equipment, alarm clocks,
and hair dryers _
so strict avoidance of exposure to these fields is unrealistic.
The
appendices include an equipment selection guide and
and list of
resources, furnishing information about support groups,
online
newsgroups, documents, and many other available references.
Following
the appendices is a description of the sources quoted
in each chapter.<P>

Overall, Stigliani identifies the health concerns associated
with
computers and suggests possible solutions for those
concerns. The
solutions are not always possible to implement, but
the principles
remain sensible. The book reflects the author's extensive
research, as
documented by the numerous professional references.
The Computer User's
Survival Guide is a valuable addition to the existing
computer health
library: it merits the attention of every user.<P>

<B><I>Internet in Plain English</I><br>
by Brian Pfaffenberger<br>
MIS Press<br>
ISBN 1-55828-385-4<br>
$19.95<br>
Disk Included</B><P>

With this book, Pfaffenberger takes the concept of an
Internet
dictionary to a new and more comprehensive level. Each
entry consists of
a term, its definition, and an explanation of how the
term is used and
why it is important. In most cases, the description
includes at least
one cross-reference to another entry, and usually more
than one. How
deeply readers went to pursue these references will
depend on their
level of expertise and how much they need to know about
the topic.<P>

The book includes a useful introduction, an acronym
finder, a list of
abbreviations, the dictionary itself, and a topical
index. The main
text, however, is much more than a simple dictionary.
In addition to
defining terms, Pfaffenberger not only discusses Internet
customs and
history, but also furnishes practical tips for using
the Internet more
effectively and efficiently. The hypertext cross-referencing
feature
makes Internet in Plain English more thorough and more
accessible than a
normal Internet dictionary. Thus Internet in Plain English
contains
entries most frequently associated with protocol standards,
cryptography, operating systems concepts, database design,
and both the
hardware and software aspects of network theory and
practice.<P>

The disk that accompanies the book includes Chameleon
Sampler Version
3.11 (Dial-Up serial line only), which furnishes copies
of FTP, Telnet,
Mail, Ping, and some custom applications. Pfaffenberger
has produced a
book for users at all levels, whether novice, intermediate,
or advanced.
Individual entries simply answer a beginner's question;
the extensive
cross-referencing provides the  advanced technical person
with a means
of finding more sophisticated information on the same
topics. This will
be a superb addition to any computer user's library.<P>

<B><I>Net Tech
Your Guide to Tech Support, Product News and Software 
Resources on the Info Highway</I><br>
A Michael Wolff Book<br>
by Kelly Maloni, Ben Greenman, and Jeff Hearn<br>
Random House Electronic Publishing<br>
ISBN 0-679-76054-7<br>
$19.00</B><P>

The initial excuse for obtaining an online account is
usually related to
technical support and software programs:professional
necessity requires
an online connection. However, having an account doesn't
always
guarantee that you will find the resources you need.
Computer magazines,
product information, sound pictures, and movies, along
with the yellow
pages, now make it much easier to find what you want.
This book,
however, focuses on information pertaining to software,
hardware, and
other useful data regarding computers. The book is divided
into eight
sections: Booting Up; The Big Two: Apple and IBM; The
Rest of the Field;
A Small Matter: Minicomputers; PC Power; Creativity
in Cyberspace;
Computers and Society; and Getting Wired. The first
section presents
some interesting sites designed for various platforms,
including
computing, hubsites, hardware and peripherals, computer
bookstores,, and
shopping. Section 2 deals with the two most popular
platforms, Macintosh
and IBM. The following section covers other operating
systems, such as
Amiga and Atari. In the fourth section, portables, palmtops,
and
calculators are discussed, while section 5, PC Power,
examines
applications from word processing and desktop publishing
to screen
savers. Section 6 addresses creativity and sound, graphics,
multimedia,
and hypermedia interests. Section 7 provides information
about the most
recent technology trends, and the final section, Get
Wired, reviews the
online connections available. Appendices include Company
Support,
Internet Providers, Shareware BBSs, Net Speak (a glossary
of online
terms), and the Index.<P>

The most recent addition in the series, Net Tech is
a dedicated
reference for the computer professional. It can also
tell casual
computer users where the programs they need can be found.
Not all of the
entries are serious _ realize that even the most dedicated
computer
users enjoy some comic relief occasionally (I particularly
enjoyed the
entry on a program called Coffee Break, an application
designed to force
the user to take a break. After you specify break and
work times, Coffee
Break will lock you out of your computer when it is
time for a break.
However, I can imagine scenarios where this could have
disastrous
results.)<P>

Whether you are researching hardware or software information,
technical
support, or the most recent product news, Net Tech can
help. It provides
an excellent guide for all user levels, all operating
systems, and all
online services. This is a welcome reference for anyone
who has ever
scoured forums or departments looking for a particular
archived file.<P>

<B><I>Lan Times Guide to Telephony</I><br>
by David D. Bezar<br>
Osborne/McGraw-Hill<br>
ISBN 0-07-882126-6<br>
$34.95</B><P>

Telephony (pronounced te le' fun e) is the designated
term for all the
peripherals and equipment used for communication purposes.
This includes
Video Conferencing, Integrated Services Digital Networks
(ISDN), Frame
Relay, T-1 Networking, Interactive Voice Response, Computer
Telephony
Integration (CTI), the Internet, and Fax-on-Demand.
This diverse
assortment of tools and techniques introduces many new
terms plus a
multitude of acronyms. To help the reader grasp the
concepts and
accompanying vocabulary, Bezar divides the book into
five sections: The
Telephony Environment; Telemanagement: The Focal Point
of Telephony;
Telephone Connectivity; Peripheral Equipment and Services
of Telephony;
and Emerging Technologies. The appendices include a
vendors list and a
glossary.<P>

Since it is often easier to understand details when
you've got the
general idea, Bezar begins with what he calls &quot;The
Macro Approach to
Telephony.&quot; In this introductory chapter, the author
creates a company,
the XYZ Corporation, with its telephony network already
in use. He
examines the questions facing the network's originators,
describes how
the decisions were made, and analyzes the thought processes
at each step
of the design. As he discusses each segment of the overview
example, he
refers readers to the chapter(s) which explain the specific
concepts in
greater depth. Part one presents the overview, European
Communications,
Switching Platforms, and Telephony and the Internet.
Part Two discusses
Telemanagement, Computer-Based Telemanagement Systems,
Cable/Plant
Management, Equipment/Feature Inventory, and Work Order
Processing. Part
three explores T-1s, The Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN),
Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Wireless
Commucications, and Voice Processing Systems. Part Four,
Peripheral
Equipment and Services of Telephony, looks at Modems,
plus Facsimiles
and Fax-on-Demand. The final section addresses Video
Conferencing,
Computer Telephony Integration, CATV (cable television)
and Telephony,
and the New Digital CATV Network.<P>

Bezar presents his subject in a readable, straightforward
manner. He
first describes the finished, desired product _ a telephony
network. He
then illustrates the important concepts in depth, defining
each new term
and acronym as it is introduced. The writing style is
clear and precise
style; the presentation, logical. This is no small accomplishment,
since
there are nine contributing writers: Eric Tholome, William
J. Ringle,
Atis Jurka, Richard Brennan, Farhan Ahmed, Richard H.E.
Smith II, Daniel
S. McCrary, Jeanne Bayless, and Greg Schumacher. The
authors use tables
and figures throughout the book, as well as examples.
This highly
informative text on communications will become a welcome
addition to any
system administrator's or programmer's library.<P>

<B><I>Instant UNIX</I><br>
by Andrew Evans, Neil Matthew, and Richard Stones<br>
Wrox Press Ltd. (1-800-814-4527)<br>
ISBN 1-874416-65-6<br>
$24.95</B><P>

Instant UNIX was designed for the novice UNIX user and
also for those
who know the UNIX operating system, but wish to increase
their technical
knowledge (for example, a UNIX user who wants to advance
to a system
administrator's position would benefit from this book).
It can also
serve as a review text for those who need a refresher
course. Evans,
Matthew, and Stones explain the UNIX operating system
from the ground
up, beginning with the background, history, and current
variants of UNIX
available. They continue with discussions of the UNIX
File Systems,
General UNIX Commands and Utilities, Shell Programming,
and The UNIX
User. The more advanced sections of the book focus on
The System
Administrator, The X Window System, Networking, Network
File Systems,
E-mail Systems, the Internet, Security, the PC Connection
to UNIX, and
Getting Started with Linux.<P>

The authors do not attempt to provide every known fact
about the
subject. Their aim, instead, is to provide a solid introduction
to UNIX,
presented clearly and precisely. They present the most
important facts
about each topic, and they include every essential concept
that the UNIX
user and/or administrator needs to know. With all this
information, the
book is a surprisingly manageable size. Every other
page is thumbmarked
for easy access and the format is well-organized and
readable. The text
attests to the authors' extensive expertise, and each
chapter presents
an amazing amount of information in relatively few pages.
Instant UNIX
is a fine book, and one that will become an excellent
reference for
every level of UNIX user, programmer, and administrator.
I highly
recommend it.<P>
