<H1>Questions and Answers</H1><p>

The 1995 LISA System Adminstration Conference took place
in Monterey,
California, September 17 to 22. The technical quality
of the presented
papers continued the decline begun in recent years,
but this conference
still represents one of the best opportunities for UNIX
system
administrators to get together and learn from each other,
and from the
many tutorials offered. In fact, now that fewer of the
presentations are
of the &quot;bleeding edge technology&quot; type, the
conference will probably
have a greater appeal for newer UNIX system administrators.
Also, as I
have mentioned many times, the social value of the conference
can easily
outweigh the technical value; if in the year after the
conference you
are able to place a single phone call, or send a single
e-mail to a
conference contact, and get an answer to an urgent problem,
then the
price of admission to the conference will have been
paid off with
interest.<P>

Meanwhile, LISA continues to grow. More than 1,600 people
preregistered
this year, making this the largest LISA conference ever.<P>

The most interesting paper on innovations was Roland
J. Shemers'
&quot;lbnamed: A Load Balancing Name Server in Perl,&quot;
which described a way
to provide load balancing between computer servers;
the most promising
tool, described by Patric Powell and Justin Mason in
&quot;LPRng: An Enhanced
Printer Spooler System,&quot; was a completely redesigned
version of the
Berkeley line printer spooler; and the most interesting
sharing of
experiences was Arnold de Leon's &quot;From Thinnet
to 10base-T; From Sys
Admin to Network Manager.&quot;<P>

<B>Network Security Conference</B><P>

Allan Paller, the founder of the System Administration,
Networking and
Security conferences, is at work on a dedicated conference
for security,
the Network Security '95 conference, in Washington D.C.,
November 13-18.
He is cochairing this conference with Michele Crabb
and Matt Bishop,
both of whom are well known and respected in the UNIX
security
community.<P>

The Network Security '95 conference will be co-located
in the Washington
D.C. Convention Center with the Open Systems World Conference
and the
FedUNIX Exposition.<P>

<B>FTP Archive</B><P>

The FTP archive on ftp.sysadmin.com is now online. My
goal is to provide
a single FTP archive where all the good system administration
software
can be found. It already holds many of the most common
utilities, as
well as many useful but lesser-known utilities. It also
includes the
code listings released by Sys Admin magazine. If your
favorite system
administration program or utility is not in the archive,
drop me an
e-mail with the relevant information, and I will be
happy to add it to
the archive. The address of the archive is<P>
<PRE>
ftp.sysadmin.com:/pub/admin</pre><p>
<p>
or in URL speak:<P>
<PRE>
ftp://ftp.sysadmin.com/pub/admin</pre><p>
<p>
And now for this issue's questions.<P>

 My site has recently decided to join the Internet,
and to that end, we
have installed a dial-up SLIP connection. The problem
is that although I
can set up the SLIP connection, I haven't been able
to set up the mail
system.<P>

Thus messages not destined for local addresses do not
get sent.<P>

Can you help?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 There are many possible explanations for your problem.
From your very
brief description, I gather that you have no form of
firewall protection
in place, in which case all systems on your internal
network are
directly connected to the Internet (a scary thought!).
In that case, the
problem is most likely attributable to missing routing
configuration. In
the simple case of a single network, you need to set
the default route
on all your systems.<P>

The default route is used in the kernel's routing tables
to determine
where to send packets when the local machine does not
have a route.
Presumably, the machine pointed to in this manner will
know how to route
the packets successfully. On your gateway host, you
will also need to
install a default route, but in this case it must point
to the host at
the other end of the SLIP link.<P>

You can add new routes to the routing table with the
route command (the
syntax varies slightly among UNIX variants _ check your
local man
pages):<P>
<PRE>
route add default 123.123.123.123 1</pre><p>
<p>
where the add keyword tells route to add a new route,
the default
keyword tells route that it is adding the default route,
123.123.123.123
is the next machine towards the Internet (use your own
IP address, the
one shown here will not work in your setup), and 1 is
a hop count.<P>

If your gateway is actually configured with some kind
of firewall

functionality in place, the problem may be that you
are unable to
establish SMTP (email) connections through that machine.
In that case,
you will need to make a change to the sendmail configuration
in the
sendmail.cf file. This is not as difficult as it may
sound. Most
sendmail configuration files already support some kind
of &quot;smart relay
host&quot; to which mail can be forwarded. It is assumed
that the smart host
will be able to do what is necessary to get the mail
delivered.<P>

In sendmail 8.6, if you are using the m4 configuration
system, you
simply need to define the SMART_HOST m4 variable, and
if you are editing
your sendmail.cf file directly, look for comments referring
to &quot;smart&quot;
or &quot;relay&quot; to find the right place. In sendmail
8.6, the smart host is
defined by a line like:<P>
<PRE>
DSsmtp:your.smart.host</pre><p>
<p>
and in Sun sendmail, by<P>
<PRE>
DRyour.smart.host</pre><p>
<p>
The actual method will vary from vendor to vendor, because
the
definition is used in the sendmail header rewrite rules,
all of which
are defined by the content of sendmail.cf file rather
than by the
sendmail software itself.<P>

 In the past it's been my practice to make a backup
of any distribution
tape received from our vendor. I did this via the dd
command, which
worked just fine. However, the new release of our OS
came on a CD-ROM,
and when I tried to use my script (with the appropriate
changes), it
just kept on writing to the first filemark and never
went beyond that.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Using the dd command on a CD-ROM does not make sense,
as you will not
be able to use the created image very effectively.<P>

A CD-ROM comes with its information stored in a file
system, which is
why it can be mounted by the mount command. The file
system's format is
different from those you find on a hard disk. The format
used is
typically what is known as the Rockridge, or ISA 9660,
file system.<P>

To make a usable copy of a CD-ROM to tape, you will
need to use an
archive command which does not rely on the underlying
file format
structure. This eliminates dd as well as dump, but leaves
tar as a
possible method. You should be able to mount the CD-ROM
somewhere in
your file system (see the man page for mount or talk
with your vendor _
there are so many ways to do this that I cannot cover
them here) and
then make a tar tape, as you would for any other file
system.<P>

However, be aware that a backup tape will not do you
much good if the
CD-ROM is lost, as the installation tools your vendor
provides will
still assume that you are installing from a CD-ROM.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 We have installed the smap program from the Firewall
Tool Kit. However,
we have a problem with mail getting stuck in the spool
queue on the
firewall.<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Let me explain the function of smap to those of you
not familiar with
this program. smap (and its companion program, smapd)
provides a SMTP
proxy which protects sendmail on the firewall bastion
host from address
spoofing attacks. smap receives the mail and drops it
into a spool
directory, and smapd picks it up and gives it to sendmail
for further
delivery. smap is a small and simple program, so it
is easier to ensure
that it works correctly _ without the many problems
associated with
sendmail over the years. The problem you report is almost
certainly
caused by your not running sendmail as a daemon. While
smap does replace
sendmail as the program which listens to the Internet,
sendmail must
still run as a daemon in order to process mail which
could not be
delivered on the first attempt and has ended up in the
spool queue. If
you start sendmail from the rc file in this way:<P>
<PRE>
sendmail -q30m</pre><p>
<p>
it will run in background, and rerun the queue every
half hour. It will
not, however, attempt to attach itself to the SMTP port
(which is
serviced by smap).<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 At our site we have decided that there are too many
problems with
sendmail, and we are looking for an alternative. Is
there one that you
would recommend?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 Not really. sendmail certainly has its problems, but
there is really no
good substitute available. smail 3 works well on small
networks and for
connections over UUCP, but in my opinion does not work
well when used on
an Internet-connected site. Also, work on smail3 stopped
several years
ago, which would leave you up the creek without a paddle
if somebody
managed to break it. Some people argue that smail3 is
more secure
because it has not been broken as often as sendmail.
However, I think
the reason for that is that it is not nearly as common.
If given the
same scrutiny as sendmail, smail3 would probably prove
to be as
vulnerable.<P>

If your concern is for firewall security, implementing
a SMTP
application level proxy, e.g., with samp from the TIS
Firewall Toolkit,
will probably provide what you require. If the reduced
configurability
of smail3 is not a problem for you, you could use that,
but as explained
above, you should be prepared to deal with any security
problems on your
own.<P>

<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 We want to put up a Web page for our company, but do
not know which
server to choose. Which do you recommend?<P>

<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>
 With respect to freeware, there is a growing number
available. The ones
I have used are the httpds from CERN and NCSA. Unfortunately,
the latter
proved to have a major security hole, which I am not
sure has been fixed
adequately (I had switched to the CERN server prior
to the incident, and
have not followed the story of the NCSA server too closely).
The CERN
server is nice, as it will work as a HTTP server, as
a caching server,
and as a proxy server. The server at www.sysadmin.com
actually performs
all three of those functions simultaneously. The use
of a caching
server, especially at a large site, can cut down on
network traffic and
response time, as the commonly used pages are likely
to be readily
available in the server's disk cache.<P>

In spite of security reports for the CERN server, I
would strongly
advise you to run it under a changed root so that, should
someone manage
to break into the server, he/she would end up in an
environment without
any useful tools. Note that you will have to duplicate
several of the
system files (such as resolv.conf) in the chroot'ed
area, since the
programs no longer will be able to get to the original
locations of
those files.<P>

Several servers are available from the sysadmin FTP
archive, as well as
the chrootuid utility to handle the startup in a chroot'ed
environment.<P>
