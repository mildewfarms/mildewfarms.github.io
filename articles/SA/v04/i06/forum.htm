<H1>Editor's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
I have big news: starting with our next issue -- January
1996 -- Sys Admin
will be published every month.<P>

As I told many readers at UniForum last year, becoming
a monthly has
always been our goal. Unfortunately, the financial reality
is that it's
a lot less risky to launch a six-time-a-year publication
and grow it
into a monthly than it is to launch a monthly. Your
strong interest and
the continuing support of a growing population of advertisers
have
combined to produce exactly the kind of growth it takes
to justify
converting to a monthly production schedule.<P>

I'm excited about this change -- and I hope you are
too. Being a monthly
means more editorial space and the opportunity to bring
even more value
to the reader. When you only publish six issues, you
can only tackle six
editorial themes. Certainly those six have to be important
topics, but
in the UNIX world, there are a lot more than six important
topics -- now
we'll have room to give six more of those topics fair
coverage.<P>

But like every change, going monthly is a double-edged
sword. We can't
publish six more issues without doubling the editorial
and production
work-load. We'll have to make changes, sometimes easy,
sometimes not so
easy, to schedules and staffing. But we can handle all
that.<P>

We can't, however, just wave a magic wand and produce
the extra stories
it takes to fill six more issues. We need your help
for that. Our
stories come, mostly, from our readers. So, if you've
been thinking
maybe you'd like to share your experience with others,
now's the time to
pony up. Send in a proposal; we'll be happy to consider
it.<P>

And while I'm at it, I'd like to thank all our readers
and advertisers
for making Sys Admin such a big success. This magazine
has been (and
continues to be) fun -- because so many of you have
contributed to making
it useful.<P>

Thank you,<br>

Robert Ward<P>
