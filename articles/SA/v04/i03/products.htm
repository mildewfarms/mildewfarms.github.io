<B>UniPress Announces LAN Manager for Solaris 2</B><P>

UniPress Software, Inc., has begun shipping Microsoft/AT&amp;T
LAN Manager 
V2.2 for UNIX (LMU) for Sun Solaris 2. LAN Manager for
Solaris allows 
Sun workstations to act as servers for PC clients on
MS-DOS, MS Windows, 
Windows NT, Windows for Workgroups, and OS/2. LMU from
UniPress is 
compatible with Windows NT clients and works in the
same domains as 
Windows NT Servers (NTS), LMU provides an approach for
sites which 
need to integrate UNIX and Windows NT.<P>

A collection of LMU servers form a &quot;domain,&quot;
with a primary 
domain controller handling security, keeping track of
users, and managing 
server resources. Using such a primary controller can
simplify network 
changes and reduce network administration overhead.<P>

LMU for Solaris supports NetBIOS over TCP/IP or NetBEUI
for either 
the standard Sun Ethernet board or the optional Sun
Token Ring board. 
LMU also provides UNIX features, such as access to NFS,
RFS, and AFS 
data. LAN Manager users can access UNIX disks and printers
anywhere 
on the network. Extended TCP/IP enhancements allow domains
to span 
routers, connect to WANs, and connect to the Internet.
Clients can 
also be connected to Novell NetWare on the same network.<P>

LMU V2.2 for Solaris 2 costs from $2,395 for a 24-user
license to 
$9,595 for an unlimited user license. Clients are included.
UniPress 
also supports versions of LMU for SunOS, RS/6000, and
UNIX SVR4.2 
on 3/486 systems. For more information contact UniPress

<B>ESMC Announces UName*It</B><P>

Enterprise Systems Management Corporation has announced
UName*It, 
a tool which enables distinct groups of systems administrators
to 
collectively manage an enterprise's shared namespace.
UName*It is 
a client/server application that works by storing all
namespace information 
in a central database. A server that is knowledgeable
about systems 
administration controls access to the database. Client
applications 
provide UName*It users with both graphical and programmatic
interfaces. 
In addition, an open API enables customers to write
their own client 
applications.<P>

UName*It doesn't replace existing name services such
as NIS, NIS+, 
or DNS. Instead, it supports multiple name services
by modeling the 
environment abstractly so that the various name services
stay consistent. 
UName*It provides a user-configurable Task Oriented
Interface (TOI). 
For example, the process of renumbering an entire subnet
with new 
addresses can be aggregated as a single task, reducing
manual operations 
and avoiding possible errors. UName*It integrates a
security scheme 
into its data model, providing the capacity to control
authorized 
operations for creating, modifying, or deleting namespace
information, 
allowing restrictions by both role and scope. One class
of UName*It 
users might be restricted to adding new user accounts,
and prevented 
from otherwise modifying the namespace.<P>

UName*It is available for Sun Sparcs under either SunOS
or Solaris. 
Pricing depends on the size of the network to be managed.
A basic 
license for a site with about 400 nodes and a similar
number of users 
costs $24,000. For more information contact Enterprise
Systems 
Management Corporation, 2522 Chambers Rd., Suite 110,
Tustin, CA 92680;

<B>Elan Announces SoftWatch 3.1</B><P>

Elan Computer Group has announced SoftWatch 3.1, a tool
the provides 
consolidated usage reports on software applications
and monitors and 
controls networked software usage over heterogeneous
networks. With 
SoftWatch 3.1, system administrators running UNIX, Windows,
or Windows 
NT networks can monitor software applications by version,
provide 
a redundant server action recovery feature, license
and monitor suites 
of software applications, and reserve licenses by domain
name.<P>

SoftWatch 3.1 can recognize and separately monitor different
versions 
of the same application. Besides users and groups, IP
addresses or 
machine names can be used to reserve application licenses
(e.g., @marsbars 
-- reserve a license for the system marsbars; or @192.42.111-116
-- 
reserve licenses for 6 Class-C networks, 192.42.111-116).
SoftWatch 
3.1 can provide application-specific handling of a server
crash and 
can also provide queuing options for when no licenses
are available.<P>

SoftWatch is designed to work with off-the-shelf UNIX,
Windows, or 
NT applications; prices start at $495 on a per 25 client
basis. For 
more information contact Elan Computer Group, Inc.,
888 Villa 
St., Third Floor, Mountain View, CA 94041, (415) 964-2200;

<B>Digital Controls Releases NovPrint</B><P>

Digital Controls Corporation has released NovPrint,
a NetWare NLM 
which provides bidirectional UNIX-Novell printing. Uisng
NovPrint, 
UNIX users can route print jobs from UNIX hosts into
a NetWare queue 
so work can be accessed by printers on file servers,
NetWare workstations, 
or print-dedicated PCs. UNIX users can use standard
commands, such 
as lp or lpr, since NovPrint emulates the line printer
daemon (lpd). 
NetWare clients can route print jobs from NetWare server
print queues 
to printers on UNIX hosts or terminal servers supporting
TCP/IP connections. 
Existing NetWare print queues are used, so utilities
such as CAPTURE 
and NPRINT will not change for NetWare users. <P>

NovPrint is available for NetWare 3.11 or greater and
costs $595. 
NovPrint is available from UniDirect and other distributors.

information contact Digital Controls Corporation, 305
Pioneer Blvd., 
Springboro, OH 45066; (800) 274-1627.<P>

<B>1776 Upgrades Multi-Host</B><P>

1776, Inc., has announced a new generation of 1776 Multi-Host
software 
for SCO-based systems. 1776 Multi-Host software permits
two SCO systems 
to share resources. With a terminal network or compatible
terminal 
subsystem, a pair of SCO servers can share users to
improve system 
response time. With 1776 Multi-Host software, this cluster
is flexible: 
users can be switched from one server to another while
the host is 
running and either server can be rebooted without affecting
the other. 
If one server then fails, the second server acts as
a standby which 
can tack over automatically.<P>

1776, Inc., has also announced plans for cooperation
with Digiboard, 
Specialix, Stallion, and Systech to permit clustered
SCO UNIX-based 
systems using the Multi-Host software to tie clustered
SCO-based systems 
together.<P>

1776 Multi-Host is priced at $2,895. For more information
contact 
1776, Inc., 8632 S. Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 203, Los
Angeles,

<B>OPENSERVICE Ships Host Availability and SYSTEMWATCH 1.60</B><P>

OPENSERVICE, Inc., has begun shipping its Host Availability
Application 
&amp; SYSTEMWATCH Release 1.60. Host Availability allows
the system administrator 
to know if a remote host is down, without polling from
a central host. 
Host Availability can be configured for mandatory check-ins
or voluntary 
check-ins, and different classes of systems can be monitored
at different 
intervals. Before generating an alert, the Master Client
diagnoses 
the level of the problem. <P>

SYSTEMWATCH 1.60 incorporates expert systems technology
and behavior 
modeling algorithms to support routine UNIX tasks, such
as monitoring 
file systems, mail queues, system performance, customer
applications, 
and databases. When SYSTEMWATCH detects problems, it
can alert the 
administrator, make recommendations for remedial actions,
and, in 
some cases, take actions immediately. The swap and memory
manager 
can automatically increase swap space when existing
space approaches 
capacity. The daemon manager can prevent problems such
as email failure 
or communications breakdowns.<P>

Host Availability has a suggested list price of $195
per client, 
while SYSTEMWATCH Release 1.60 has a suggested list
price of $395 
per client and $7,995 per console. The SYSTEMWATCH family
of products
