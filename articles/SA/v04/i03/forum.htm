<H1>Publisher's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
<I>Publisher's Note: This month's forum comes to you 
courtesy of Larry Reznick, who serves Sys Admin both
as a Contributing 
Editor (that is, a regular columnist) and as Consulting
Editor. In 
the latter capacity, Larry reviews all proposals and
manuscripts submitted 
to Sys Admin, critiquing them for focus, clarity, and
fit to Sys Admin's 
purpose. In short, he helps make the magazine what it
is. Herewith 
a few thoughts from Larry on this month's theme: Networks.</I><P>

I was talking with a friend the other day about the

networking concerns of UNIX system administrators. Dave
specializes 
in installing network systems for high-demand facilities.
Two concerns 
came immediately to him: security and efficiency.<P>

Security is a significant concern with so many new 
people discovering Internet communications today. Systems
need solid 
firewalls to prevent unauthorized access. Authorized
users must be 
held accountable for their operations on the systems.
Administrators 
must remain vigilant of cracking techniques including
address-spoofing, 
software holes, and other vulnerabilities.<P>

Setting aside security concerns for the moment, the

next issue is efficient operation on the network. With
increasing 
demands on the network, is the bandwidth sufficient
to handle users' 
needs? 56K lines may be enough for some smaller installations
but 
applications such as web servers need more. 128K ISDN
may work with 
load analysis. T1 lines at 1.55M might be necessary.
T1 lines are 
available in fractional 56K increments up to the 1.55M
maximum. But 
maybe your system demands more. T3 offers 45M lines
and ATM offers 
a minimum of 155M.<P>

Sys Admin is looking for detailed articles on security

issues, what administrators must know and what to look
for, and techniques 
to solve the problems before they happen. We're also
interested in 
detailed articles on network efficiency, what options
are available 
including how to select the appropriate option, the
downsides of the 
options, when to plan for upgrades and transitions,
and what techniques 
are on the horizon.<P>

Keeping with our practical focus, what do your network

installations look like? What kinds of network security
and efficiency 
problems have you solved? Other UNIX system administrators
can learn 
from your installation, the decisions you made to get
there, and the 
problems you solved or headed off. So think about becoming
a Sys Admin 
contributor -- to paraphrase the recent PBS pitches:
if not you, 
then who? <P>
