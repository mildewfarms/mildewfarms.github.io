<H1>Sidebar: About sendmail 8.6.9</H1><p>
<P>
sendmail is used for processing both incoming and outgoing

mail. You can download the source code for sendmail
8.6.9 
by anonymous ftp from a number of sites. This software's
home 
is:<P>
<PRE>
ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:/ucb/src/sendmail</pre><p>
<p>
In this directory you will find the following files
related 
to sendmail 8.6.9:<P>
<PRE>
500945 Apr 19  1994 sendmail.8.6.9.base.tar.gz
199863 Apr 19  1994 sendmail.8.6.9.cf.tar.gz

You can download these files and build them, using the

Makefile for your platform.<P>

This version of sendmail is, according to our information

at least, the most current one. It fixes a number of
bugs and security 
holes from previous versions, notably sendmail 5.6.x,
which 
is still part of some commercial UNIX versions.<P>

sendmail is often called an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent).
It 
transports mail. During this transport a number of headers
in the 
message may need to be transformed from one form to
another. This 
transformation may be necessary due to restrictions
imposed by the 
delivery protocol. For instance, UUCP normally uses
a bang path (!) 
to separate the user from the node. SMTP can use the
familiar @ 
symbol. Failing to comply with these conventions may
render your mail 
undeliverable.<P>

Depending on a number of factors, sendmail selects a
delivery 
agent, which takes care of the actual delivery of the
message. sendmail 
doesn't do any delivery at all. The delivery agent has
all the knowledge 
about the delivery process. You can, for instance, write
your own 
delivery agent to support a special protocol.<P>

The selection process is controlled by the rewrite rule
sets in the 
configuration file. Rewrite rule sets specify how to
transform an 
address from one form to another. Rules are specified
in a special 
format resembling regular expressions. Different rule
sets are used 
for different fields in the message header.<P>

It is possible to configure the rule sets completely
by hand. sendmail 
8 supports another way, however. In sendmail's source
directory 
tree is a special subdirectory for configuring sendmail.
It 
contains a number of M4 (macro processor) files that
can be used to 
implement different functions in the configuration file.
By using 
these standard functions, you can create a configuration
quickly and 
reliably.<P>

To learn more about sendmail, read the book sendmail,

by Brian Costales, with Eric Allman and Neil Rickert,
published by 
O'Reilly and Associates (&quot;The BatBook&quot;). It
covers all aspects 
of sendmail, including configuring the different versions.
