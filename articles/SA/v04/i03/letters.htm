Subject: Customizing Calendar (Sys Admin 4.2)<P>

This was a good article but it missed one important
thing you can 
do.<P>

We modified our calendar program so it recognizes all
files that 
begin with .calendar. This allows us to create numerous
.calendarXXX 
files, each of which is linked to the home directory
of the affected 
parties. When calendar runs, it looks at all these files
and sends 
the appropriate messages to the appropriate people.<P>

There are pros and cons to this approach versus Isaacson's.
With his 
approach the SA or some other responsible person must
make the changes 
to any system-wide or departmental calendar file. With
ours, anybody 
who has the file linked to their home directory can
change it. There 
is another level which we do not use; the file could
be linked but 
only writable by the owner. This would be very close
to Isaacson.<P>

We also use a modified PD calprog picked up from the
net a number 
of years ago which provides some of his other options
as built-ins. 
When I remember all the problem I had getting that to
work correctly, 
I wish I had thought of his idea first.<P>

The include and multi-line features are nice.<P>

Dear Sys Admin,<br>

Thanks for mentioning the Sun User Group's &quot;UNIX
&amp; The Law&quot; 
symposium in your November issue. This year's symposium
was the glowing 
first of what we hope will be many annual events. The
symposium was 
four days long. It featured two days of intensive tutorials
(Monday 
and Thursday, the first and last days) and two days
of talks, panels, 
and keynotes (Tuesday and Wednesday).<P>

Some of the highlights of the symposium included Steve
Jackson's 
keynote speech on Tuesday, and the panel &quot;The Future
of Computer 
Crime,&quot; moderated by futurist Bruce Sterling.<P>

Mr. Jackson, who is the founder and editor-in-chief
of Steve Jackson 
Games, led a lively and interactive keynote titled &quot;Privacy,
Responsibility, 
and Computers.&quot; He and the audience discussed the
current state 
of laws on &quot;search and seizure&quot; of computers,
as well as various 
related privacy and legal issues such as corporate access
to employee 
e-mail and copyright in the digital era.<P>

Later on Tuesday the attendees were treated to one of
the most entertaining 
sessions of the symposium. Moderated by Bruce Sterling,
noted author, 
futurist, and computer maven, the &quot;Future of Computer
Crime&quot; 
panel featured three law enforcement professionals speculating
what 
directions high-tech crime may go in over the next one,
five, and 
fifteen years.<P>

Of course, not all of the issues discussed were so speculative.
Ed 
Cavasos, a Houston-based attorney and author of Cyberspace
and 
The Law, spoke to a standing-room-only crowd of system
administrators 
about e-mail privacy and their legal responsibilities
and liabilities. 
The talk was so popular that the Sun User Group has
decided to take 
it on the road, with the first stop scheduled for April
in Boston, 
MA. This workshop is presented as part of the Sun User
Group's ongoing 
tutorial program on a variety of technical issues, many
of them of 
interest to system administrators.<P>

If readers are interested in upcoming SUG tutorials,
they can contact 
the Sun User Group at (617) 232-0514 or office@sug.org.<P>

Hi Folks:<br>

Upon responding to a message from a reader concerning
my article, 
&quot;File Version Numbering&quot; (Sys Admin 3.5),
I found 
a typo which I didn't see when I reviewed the article
prior to publishing. 
The vedit source code has an error in it that will prevent
proper 
operation. Looking at the source code on page 51 of
the issue, line 
99 of the vedit program is the problem.<P>

As published it reads<P>
<PRE>
if [ EDIT -eq 1 ]</pre><p>
<p>
but it should read<P>
<PRE>
if [ &quot;$EDIT&quot; -eq 1 ]</pre><p>
<p>
I apologize for any confusion which this may have caused!<P>

Sincerely, <br>

Chris Hare<P>



Dear Editor:<P>

While Emmett Dulaney's article on filesystems (&quot;Understanding

Filesystems,&quot; Sys Admin 4.2) presented a useful
introduction 
to an area of UNIX systems most people take for granted
(and therefore 
fail to use to its greatest advantage), the omission
of one widespread 
filesystem was evident.<P>

The VERITAS File System (VxFS) is available from dozens
of system 
vendors with their operating systems; these include
the full range 
of open systems, from Novell's UnixWare to open servers
such as AT&amp;T 
GIS and Sequent to fault tolerant systems like Tandem
and Stratus 
to mainframes like Hitachi. It is available from VERITAS
for Sun's 
Solaris operating system, and is offered (as JFS and
OnlineJFS) in 
Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX release 10.<P>

VxFS offers the reliability and quick recovery benefits
of journaling 
discussed in the article sidebar. In addition, its contiguous-extent

allocation policies and direct-to-disk I/O capabilities
provide commercial 
database applications with performance levels traditionally
attainable 
only through raw disk interfaces, without sacrificing
the administrative 
ease of a filesystem. It offers a &quot;snapshot&quot;
interface to 
guarantee stable and consistent backups, as well as
resizing and defragmentation 
utilities which can operate safely while the filesystem
is mounted 
and in use, reducing administrative down-time.<P>

Users have been reaping the benefits of VxFS reliability,
performance, 
and on-line administration for up to five years. A review
in BYTE 
recently referred to VxFS as &quot;The Great Little
File System&quot;; 
I guess one of the things that's &quot;littlest&quot;
about it is awareness 
of its existence . . .<P>

Dear Editor,<br>

I enjoyed Larry Reznick's article on how to customize
remote login 
menus (Jan/Feb 95), however allowing the user to maintain
a local 
.openwin-menu for customization purposes may not be
the best solution 
in all environments. In our case we need to provide
a centralized 
system menu, as the applications being offered or their
locations, 
revision levels etc. change frequently. If users maintain
a local 
.openwin-menu, then they will never see the new items
being 
offered at the system level, but if they wish to customize,
they need 
that local control. We solved the problem of allowing
user customization 
as well as maintaining a system level openwin-menu in
the 
following manner.<P>

We created a .openwin-extras file in the users' accounts.

The user creates new additions to the openwindows menu
a la 
Larry's instructions in this file. We then modified
the .login 
to check for the existence of this file before starting
OpenWindows. 
If it exists it is added to the system openwin-menu
and the 
resulting file is written to the user's account as a
local .openwin-menu. 
(You could also force the system openwin-menu by copying
it 
to the user account as a local .openwin-menu every time
you 
log in.)<P>

Addition to .login BEFORE the call for openwindows:<P>
<PRE>
# if user has customized openwin menu add it to system menu
if ( -r ~/.openwin-extras ) then
cat /usr/openwin/lib/openwin-menu ~/.openwin-extras \
&gt; ~/.openwin-menu
endif</pre><p>
<p>
We also added a refresh menu choice under utilities
at the system 
level, so that a user could see any changes made to
the menu through 
the .openwin-extras file without logging out and in.<P>

Addition to .openwin-menu file:<P>
<PRE>
&quot;Utilities&quot; MENU
&quot;Refresh Menu&quot;              /usr/local/reread_menufile
&quot;Utilities&quot; END

/usr/local/reread_menufile:

#!/bin/csh
# This rereads the system openwin-menu file and adds any local user
# menus to it - use with an entry on the system openwin-menu , under
# utilities , Reread Menu File
#
/bin/cat /usr/openwin/lib/openwin-menu ~/.openwin-extras &gt; ~/.openwin-menu</pre><p>
<p>
This scheme works best in an environment where your
users are 
not logging into other machines with the same account
but with a different 
system level openwin-menu, since your local .openwin-menu

will reflect the system menu of the last machine visited.
(You can 
always refresh your menu but this is an extra step your
users may 
not appreciate.) <P>

9th USENIX SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATION CONFERENCE (LISA '95)</B><P>

<B>Co-sponsored by USENIX and SAGE,
the System Administrators Guild<P>

Monterey Conference Center, Monterey, California<P>

Program Chairs: Tina Darmohray, Lawrence Livermore<P>

National Laboratory, and Paul Evans, Synopses, Inc.</B><P>

The USENIX Systems Administration (LISA) Conference
is widely 
recognized as the leading technical conference for system
administrators 
from sites of all sizes and kinds. The theme for this
year's conference 
is &quot;New Challenges,&quot; which includes such emerging
issues as 
integration of non-UNIX and proprietary systems and
networking technologies, 
distributed information services, network voice and
video teleconferencing, 
and managing very complex networks. We are particularly
interested 
in technical papers that reflect hands-on experience,
describe fully 
implemented and freely distributable solutions, and
advance the state 
of the art of system administration as an engineering
discipline.<P>

The conference's two-day-long tutorial program will
feature full- 
and half-day tutorials, offering expert instruction
to system administrators 
at all levels from novice through senior. The three
days of technical 
sessions will consist of two parallel tracks: the first
track dedicated 
to presentations of refereed technical papers and the
second intended 
to accommodate invited talks, panels and Works-in-Progress
sessions. 
Vendor representatives will demonstrate products and
services at the 
informal table-top display.<P>

Submissions to the Refereed Paper Track: extended abstracts
due May 
1, notification to authors June 5, final papers due
August 1, 1995. 
An extended abstract is required for the referee process.
If you send 
a full paper, you must also include an extended abstract
of 2-5 pages. 
Please submit extended abstracts by two of the following
methods: 
e-mail to lisa9papers@usenix.org; Fax to +1 51 548 5738;
