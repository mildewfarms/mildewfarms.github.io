<H1>Books: A User's Report</H1><p>
<P>
Elizabeth Zinkann<P>

This month covers a variety of topics, as usual. However,
in two departures 
from the norm, I reviewed a book primarily for Windows,
in an effort 

to save countless repetitive explanations and confusion
regarding 
downloading, and a book that simulates the newspaper
and television 
tabloids. As always, there was an abundance of books
to review, but 
the final selections include: The Downloader's Companion
for Windows, 
by Scott Meyers and Catherine Pinch; Internet Insider,
by Ruffin 
Prevost; New Riders' Official Internet Yellow Pages,
2nd Ed., 
by Christine Maxwell and Czeslaw Jan Grycz; Solaris
Implementation: 
A Guide for System Administrators, by George Becker,
Mary E. S. 
Morris, and Kathy Slattery; The New Kornshell Command
and Programming 
Language, by Morris I. Bolsky and David G. Korn; UNIX
System 
Security Essentials, by Christoph Braun; Exploring Expect:

A Tcl-based Tookit for Automating Interactive Programs,
by Don 
Libes; and E-Mail Security: How to Keep Your Electronic
Messages 
Private, by Bruce Schneier.<P>

An item that may interest readers of this column: O'Reilly
&amp; Associates, 
Inc., has made &quot;HTML Overview,&quot; a subset of
its Managing 
Internet Information Services book, available at no
charge through 
its World Wide Web site (http://www.ora.com/). The overview

provides all the basic information for creating an HTML
(HyperText 
Markup Language) document, plus a view of the recently
redesigned 
World Wide Web site.<P>

<B><I>The Downloader's Companion for Windows</I><br>
by Scott Meyers and Catherine Pinch<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-342254-2<br>
$19.95<br>
Disk Included</B><P>

Meyers and Pinch have written a valuable book on an
integral component 
of personal computer and Internet use. Downloading a
file is only 
part of the issue. After the file has been successfully
transferred, 
is it readable? Comparing the files to wrapped packages
that cannot 
be opened, the authors demonstrate the correct way to
download, tell 
which files can view the mystery packages, and include
all of the 
necessary software.<P>

The introduction covers the basics of downloading, its
problems and 
importance. It outlines the structure and content of
each chapter 
and explains the various icons employed (installation
for instructions, 
wizard for advice, and pitfall for caution). The authors

also introduce the software featured on the disk and
offer an &quot;Installation 
Summary (for the Impatient).&quot; The second chapter
explains the 
principles of freeware versus shareware, and the benefits
and disadvantages 
of each. More important, it describes the correct procedures
to follow 
when using shareware programs.<P>

The fundamental concepts of downloading are examined
in chapter 3. 
Meyers and Pinch describe the different transfer protocols,
present 
a summary of each protocol's benefits and disadvantages
in an excellent 
table, and discuss how and why to choose a protocol.
The authors explain 
the differences between text and binary files, demonstrate
the essential 
downloading technique, and provide detailed downloading
examples, 
for both binary and text files. Chapter 4 focuses on
file storage: 
compression and archiving. Meyers and Pinch introduce
the concepts, 
illustrate what compression and archiving are and how
they differ, 
then explore the various types of archives. Chapter
5 discusses encoding 
and decoding, and why it is necessary (and when). The
authors also 
explain how to accomplish these tasks. Chapter 6 delves
into multimedia: 
images, sounds, movies, and the necessary tools to either
send or 
receive them. The final chapter references other books
and CDs pertaining 
to functioning online, while the appendices list the
extensions that 
the reader may encounter, in both alphabetical and category
order 
presentations.<P>

This book not only details the procedures used in downloading
files 
and images, but also includes the software for Windows
users (saving 
the reader time-consuming searches). The techniques
are methodically 
described, so that no step can be overlooked. Meyers
and Pinch have 
addressed a neglected topic. (Every time I go online,
someone asks 
if I know how to download. A &quot;yes&quot; response
usually starts 
a barrage of questions. Now someone should write one
for Macintosh 
users!) They include tips on such issues as how to avoid
downloading 
an outdated file and what transfer protocol is the best
for the reader's 
unique situation. The Downloader's Companion for Windows
is 
well-written and easy to understand: it will become
indispensable 
for anyone using an online service.<P>

<B><I>Internet Insider</I><br>
by Ruffin Prevost<br>
Osborne McGraw-Hill<br>
ISBN 0-07-882084-7<br>
$14.95</B><P>

The newspaper tabloid has become an accepted part of
everyday life: 
the various publications escort the shopper through
the grocery or 
drugstore check-out lane. Television shows use the same
format present 
sensational stories. Could the Internet be far behind?
The Internet 
Insider uses the breathless tabloid style to feature
some serious 
(and frivolous) articles. (One of my favorites, &quot;Woman
Ages Seven 
Years While On Hold,&quot; reminds me of some phone
non-conversations 
I have had!) <P>

The Internet Insider reflects the Internet as it exists
today: 
partly serious, partly humorous -- a mirror of the current
users' 
reflections and concerns. Online access to The Internet
Insider 
is available through the World Wide Web. This book illustrates
a refreshing 
change from the instructional books and shows how the
Internet is 
currently used. It is fun to peruse and should bring
a smile to the 
faces of serious Net surfers everywhere.<P>

<B><I>New Riders' Official Internet Yellow Pages</I><br>
2nd Ed.<br>
by Christine Maxwell and Czeslaw Jan Grycz<br>
New Riders' Publishing<br>
ISBN 1-56205-408-2<br>
$29.99</B><P>

This revised edition features an improved format. To
accommodate the 
additional listings and expanded International listings,
the second 
edition introduces a three-column page, replacing the
former two-column 
design. The newer fonts and typesetting give this edition
a more refined 
and professional look than the original. The revised
version has approximately 
45 percent more entries than its original counterpart,
a modified 
keyword list to parallel the listings, an improved rating
procedure, 
and more concentration on multimedia resources. The
new format has 
allowed the book to essentially remain the same size
book while providing 
more information. (While this may seem an extremely
minor point, avid 
readers with limited bookshelves can breathe a sigh
of relief. This 
one did.)<P>

The modified appendices still include keywords, audience
fields, Internet 
Service Providers, a glossary, further readings, and
A Whimsical Tour 
of the Internet. Additions include Making Your Voice
Heard and Advertisements. 
(Some advertising does appear in the directory itself,
but has the 
same form as an entry, no rating, and a tinted background.
It does 
not conflict with the directory in any way.)<P>


I like this second edition better than the original.
In attempting 
to include more information and keep the directory current,
Maxwell 
and Grycz have improved the book tremendously. New Riders'
Official 
Internet Yellow Pages remains an excellent resource,
one which 
will benefit any and every Internet traveler.<P>

<B><I>Solaris Implementation
A Guide for System Administrators</I><br>
by George Becker, Mary E. S. Morris, and Kathy Slattery<br>
SunSoft Press<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-353350-6<br>
$35.00</B><P>

This book helps the system administrator make the transition
from 
Solaris 1.x to Solaris 2.x. Although the versions retain
a similar 
structure, enough differences exist to complicate an
administrator's 
job. This book is intended to supplement the documentation.
Its contents 
include an Introduction to Solaris, Planning and Preparing
for Installation, 
Installing Solaris, Admintool, Boot and Shutdown Files,
Using the 
Network, Security Software Management, Disk Utilities,
and Solaris 
2.x Products. The Appendices include AutoInstall Samples,
Sample Disk 
Configurations, and Sources of Information.<P>

The introductory chapter, An Introduction to Solaris,
describes much 
more than the title indicates, including the major sections
of Solaris 
2.x and their respective functions, common features
in 1.x and 2.x, 
new features available only in the 2.x releease, and
a brief summary 
of modifications and new tools important to the system
administrator. 
Ensuring chapters cover Solaris installation, then present
the changes 
in detail.<P>

There is a bit of a problem with the Contents listing.
The last two 
chapters in the Table of Contents, AutoInstall Samples
and Sample 
Disk Configurations, are not missing. Although they
are listed as 
chapters 11 and 12 in the Table of Contents, they actually
appear 
as appendices A and B in the text. Appendix A in the
Table of Contents 
thus becomes Appendix C in the text (Appendix C, Sources
of Information, 
uses one of my favorite designs: practical questions
and answers encountered 
daily.) Prentice Hall is aware of this incongruity and
intends to 
correct it in future versions.<P>

Becker, Morris, and Slattery have written an extremely
readable, logical 
book. The reader is put at ease with the second and
third sentences 
in the book: &quot;We understand how hard it is to adapt
to a new environment. 
We are all in this together.&quot;  These words establish
the tone 
for the book. The authors are expert in the field, and
they share 
their knowledge with the reader as if with a colleague.
It is intended 
to be an auxiliary text to the documentation accompanying
the Solaris 
software. Solaris Implementation: A Guide for System
Administrators 
deals with daily tasks and should be beneficial to anyone
administering 
Solaris 2.x, whether a veteran or new Solaris user.<P>

<B><I>The New Kornshell Command and Programming Language</I><br>
by Morris I. Bolsky and David G. Korn<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-182700-6<br>
$42.00</B><P>

Since the KornShell first appeared, there have been
many changes, 
not only to the KornShell itself, but also to its environment.
In 
the interim, COSE (Common Operating System Environment)
has developed; 
POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) has tried
to set standards 
in the UNIX community; and several desktop products
(such as Novell's 
dtksh) and scripting languages (such as perl and tcl)
have 
evolved. The KornShell has also been changing to keep
pace with current 
trends.<P>

The New KornShell Command and Programming Language book
closely 
resembles the original version. It has retained the
format of the 
first book so that readers familiar with the original
edition can 
easily find a topic. The sections include: Introduction,
Tutorial, 
The Built-In Editors, Programming Language, Application
Programming, 
and the Appendix. However, this KornShell is more powerful
than the 
1988 version. The book is compatible with earlier versions,
as well 
as with the Bourne shell. The authors have included
some hints that 
will make your KornShell programs more efficient and
endurable. They 
indicate which features are not included in the Bourne
shell or the 
POSIX shell, and which features may soon be obsolete
(and what to 
use in their stead). This information helps you tune
your programs 
for optimum portablility.<P>

The New KornShell Command and Programming Language features

an easily readable style and simple references. Since
the book is 
designed for both novice and experienced users, ease
of use is an 
important issue. The description of each command includes
an explanation 
of the command, an example showing how the command may
appear, and 
sample output from that command. This method results
in a very effective 
demonstration of the language and its capabilities.
The appendix contains 
a summary of the new features and a separate section
for csh 
users currently learning the KornShell. This is the
definitive book 
on ksh. Everyone who uses the KornShell should have
access 
to a copy, within reach if possible. <P>

<B><I>UNIX System Security Essentials</I><br>
by Christoph Braun<br>
Addison-Wesley<br>
ISBN 0-201-42775-3<br>
$22.75</B><P>

Although many resources related to security exist for
the UNIX system 
administrator, the user has been largely overlooked.
Introductory 
texts usually warn against choosing a simplistic password
and emphasize 
the need to change it frequently, and some of the better
texts will 
inform the reader of mesg y or n (allow or disallow

messages to your screen), but most don't advance much
beyond that. 
In UNIX System Security Essentials, Braun focuses on
user security 
to a higher degree. His topics include an Introduction,
Security for 
Users, System Administration, Security for Programmers,
Planning Security 
Management, and Important Commands and System Calls.<P>

Braun discusses the fundamental security measures available
to the 
UNIX user. He points out that users must decide what
they need to 
protect and must see what utilities they can  conveniently
access. 
He then examines how system administrators configure
a system to protect 
it from unwarranted intrusions. He sees programmers
as a special class 
of users: programmers must also ensure their project's
integrity. 
Just as each system's needs vary and every programmer
has different 
requirements to safeguard, each organization has its
own unique security 
considerations. Braun discusses the process of developing
an effective 
security management plan and how to structure one for
your organization. 
The last chapter describes UNIX system security commands
and system 
calls.<P>

UNIX System Security Essentials focuses on the tools
the user 
already has available for implementing a security strategy.
Braun's 
approach emphasizes a carefully constructed design using
utilities 
that are accessible with any UNIX system.<P>

<B><I>Exploring Expect: A Tcl-based Toolkit for
Automating Interactive Programs</I><br>
by Don Libes<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-090-2<br>
$29.95</B><P>

Expect is a &quot;software suite for automating interactive
tools.&quot; 
In other words, it can automate responses from the keyboard,
releasing 
the user or administrator the tedium of having to sit
in front of 
a terminal waiting to enter &quot;y&quot; followed by
a carriage return. 
(This benefit is portrayed best by a set of cartoons
on page 2: &quot;Before 
Expect,&quot; an interactive process leads to the workstation,
with 
someone sitting at the keyboard; in &quot;After Expect,&quot;
the interactive 
process goes through Expect before reaching the unmanned
workstation, 
complete with a crooked &quot;Gone Fishing&quot; sign.)
Written by Expect's 
creator, Don Libes, the book demonstrates how to use
Expect. Although 
the reader may not need all of the information at once
(it is possible 
to read various sections independently), the author
does recommend 
reading the entire book. Each chapter ends with a set
of exercises, 
which should be read if not completed -- they could
be forerunners 
to problems you may later encounter.<P>

The author begins with an introduction to Expect, followed
by an overview 
of Tcl. From that point, Libes clarifies the 25-page
man entry, describing 
Expect's different properties and using code fragments
to demonstrate 
its capabilities. Following the introductions to Expect
and Tcl, Libes 
discusses getting started with Expect. Moving from the
general to 
the specific, he illustrates some of Expect's concepts,
including 
regular expressions, patterns, actions, limits, debugging
patterns, 
send, spawn, signals, and interact. Libes also describes
Expect + 
Tk (Expectk, pronounced &quot;ek spect tee kay&quot;);
Expect, C, and 
C++; and Expect as a Tcl extension. The book concludes
with a list 
of the Expect commands and variables, an index of scripts,
and 
the general index.<P>

The material in Exploring Expect is logically presented.

The writing style is not only informative, but also
humorous. (please 
don't ignore the author''s footnotes; many of them reflect
his excellent 
sense of humor). The author uses examples liberally
throughout the 
book, which helps the reader to understand the concepts
presented. 
Libes' expertise in both Expect and Tcl is obvious;
the clarity of 
his presentation is a bonus. The book merits the attention
of 
anyone using Tcl, Tk, or Expect.<P>

<B><I>E-Mail Security: How to Keep Your Electonic
Messages Private</I><br>
by Bruce Schneier<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.<br>
ISBN 0-471-05318-X<br>
$24.95</B><P>

Schneier encapsulates the entire electronic mail problem
more succinctly 
than anyone else has: &quot;The world of electronic
mail is the world 
of postcards&quot; (p. 1). Unprotected electronic mail
can be altered, 
mis-directed, and delivered to the wrong address. Schneier
demonstrates 
exactly what can happen to e-mail and then describes
different ways 
to protect its delivery and integrity. <P>

E-Mail Security is organized in two main sections. Part

I, Privacy and Electronic Mail, discusses The Problem,
Encryption, 
Key Management, Authentication, Certificates, Keeping
Your Private 
Key Private, Odds and Ends, and Patents, Governments,
and Export Laws. 
Part II, Achieving Electronic Mail Privacy, explores
Requirements 
annd Features, Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), Pretty Good
Privacy (PGP), 
Comparing PGP and PEM, and Attacks Against PGP and PEM.
The Appendices 
discuss Pretty Good Privacy and Privacy Enhanced Mail.<P>

Schneier presents the topics in a logical order. The
book is entertaining, 
but still maintains the gravity that the subject warrants.
His deep 
understanding of the subject is reflected in the lucidity
of his discussion 
of various concepts. This is an excellent book on an
extremely timely 
topic. It merits the attention of anyone involved with
electronic 
mail, online systems, the Internet, and security. <P>
