<H1>Sidebar: Setting Up an http Server</H1><p>
<P>
Although most web browsers are capable of viewing HTML-based
pages 
by loading the files from disk, an httpd server will
make 
it much easier to implement a set of pages. Several
httpd 
packages can be found on the Internet; I have been most
satisfied 
by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications'
(NCSA) httpd. 
NCSA has precompiled binaries for many platforms, as
well as source 
code available via ftp (see References for a list of
sources).<P>

NCSA has moved its documentation to HTML format, so
it can be accessed 
via the NCSA homepage or downloaded via ftp. Although
the instructions 
for setting up the server are quite clear, you'll need
to make several 
modifications to the configuration files if you plan
to use httpd 
only with my scripts. First, unless you want to allow
people outside 
your local network to access your homepages, you'll
need to deny access 
to requests from hosts outside your domain. By default,
all access 
control information is kept in the file conf/access.conf.

In this file you will find a section similar to the
following:<P>
<PRE>
&lt;Limit GET&gt;
order allow,deny
allow from all
&lt;/Limit&gt;</pre><p>
<p>
To restrict access to local hosts, revise this section

to look like this:<P>

<PRE>&lt;Limit GET&gt;
order deny,allow
allow from your.domain
&lt;/Limit&gt;</pre><p>
<p>
This will first deny access to all hosts, then allow

access to any machine in the domain your.domain. where
your.domain 
is your actual domain name. Next, add the line<P>
<PRE>
IdentityCheck on</pre><p>
<p>
to the end of the httpd configuration file conf/httpd.conf.

This will turn on RFC 842-based identity checking. This
option is 
especially useful for scripts that need to know a user's
identity. 
Unfortunately, to use this option, you must install
something 
similar to identd on each machine. I have not yet been
able to find 
a way to check the identity of a user sitting in front
of a PC. <P>
