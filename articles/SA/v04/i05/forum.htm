<H1>Editor's Forum</H1><p>
<P>
I recently attended a St. Louis UNIX Users Group meeting
(SLUUG -- 
how's that for a slimy acronym). Some 50 persons attended
-- a 
pretty healthy turnout, considering the beastly Midwest
summer heat. 
Despite the wilting heat and humidity, I enjoyed the
trip and the 
visit.<P>

A tutorial on B2 certified system administration preceded
the main 
part of the meeting. I found the tutorial interesting,
in part, because 
I didn't think very many installations were actually
using B2 systems. 
From the questions and volunteered answers, I'm guessing
there were 
actually five or more large B2 sites represented. <P>

That leaves me wondering if I've misgauged the prevalence
of B2 installations 
among our readership. Next time we do a reader survey,
I plan to ask 
some questions about B2 usage. Until then, if you are
a B2 site that 
really uses B2 security provisions, I'd like to hear
about your experience. 
Email me (at saletter@rdpub.com) a little note. Tell
me what 
you like best, what creates the biggest problem for
the B2 administrator, 
and how many users you support on the B2 system. <P>

I was also excited about something I overheard at the
meeting. It 
seems there is a multi-processor version of Linux brewing
somewhere 
out there in Linux land. (Of course, if I did a better
job of monitoring 
the net, I'd have known that without going all the way
to St. Louis.) 
I've been very impressed with Linux, and being generally
interested 
in parallel processing topics, I think an SMP version
of Linux would 
be great fun. <P>

I hope you find this DOS/UNIX issue helpful. I look
forward to hearing 
from you -- about your experience with B2, with Linux
or any other 
sys admin information you care to share.<P>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Robert Ward<P>
