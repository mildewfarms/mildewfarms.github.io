<H1>Sidebar: About SAMBA</H1><p>
<P>
The SAMBA package is a collection of programs written
by Andrew Tridgell, 
with the help of a number of other people on the Internet.<P>

It was written specifically to allow Windows PCs, preferably
Windows 
for Workgroups PCs, to share directories and printers
on UNIX hosts. 
It would enable you to build up a small network using
a simple UNIX host and a 
number of WfW PCs.<P>

The package is available on the Internet. We downloaded
it from a 
well-known Linux archive on the Internet, sunsite.unc.edu.
You can 
find it in the following directory:<P>
<PRE>
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Network/samba</pre><p>
<p>
You can compile SAMBA on a great number of platforms,
not 
only the public domain ones like Linux and FreeBSD,
but also Solaris, 
AIX, and OSF/1. The documentation on this is quite straightforward
and 
provides enough information to allow you to build it
on your platform. 
Your best bet is to use either the native compiler on
the platform or the 
GNU C compiler, which is also supported in the Makefile.<P>

In effect, SAMBA emulates a LAN Manager server on the
net. It captures 
the LAN Manager network messages and processes them.
Thus clients 
based on the LAN Manager protocol can connect to the
UNIX 
machine. Such clients include Windows for Workgroups,
OS/2, and Windows 
NT.<P>

The LAN Manager concept is based upon services -- named
network 
resources offered by the server. A resource can be a
disk service, 
for storing and retrieving data, or a print service,
enabling 
printer sharing on the network. Clients can access these
services 
by the name given on the server. They will then be mapped

to a local pseudo device, either a disk or a printer.
The client can 
access services by accessing the local pseudo device.<P>

The basic transport mechanism of SAMBA is based on TCP/IP.
This poses no 
real problem for the UNIX side, since UNIX systems are,
in general, already equipped 
with a TCP/IP stack. The TCP/IP protocol is directly
configured in 
the UNIX kernel and you need only configure it properly
to get it up and running.<P>

The desktop side is a different story. The
Microsoft Windows environment is not normally equipped
with a TCP/IP 
protocol stack, nor is the LAN Manager software. So
you must find
a working combination of both, on the platform you want

to connect to the UNIX server. Fortunately, Windows
95 does come
equipped with both a TCP/IP stack and a LAN Manager
Client. All that is
necessary is to configure it on the desktop machine.<P>

SAMBA contains its own configuration file, in which
you can define 
services and users who are authorized to use these services.
The main article 
provides a number of examples of how to configure these
services. <P>
