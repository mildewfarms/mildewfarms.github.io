<H1>Sidebar: Connecting a Printer to the Network</H1><p>
<P>
Printers that do not have a network interface can be
connected to 
the network through the serial or parallel port. The
most economical 
method is to use a serial cable to attach the printer
to a workstation 
that has an unused serial port. If no workstation is
available near 
the printer, you can use a small print server such as
the Fastport 
Network Print Server from MiLan. The Fastport will provide
a direct 
connection from either the serial or parallel port on
the printer 
to the network. The TranScript software from Adobe provides
communication 
filters to support the MiLan Fastport. The MiLan Fastport
has both 
a parallel and serial interface and can support a printer
on each 
interface simultaneously. If only one port on the MiLan
Fastport is 
needed, use the parallel port as the first choice for
more reliability, 
ease of configuration, and better performance.<P>

When connecting a printer via a serial cable, make sure
that the baud 
rates match between the printer and the workstation
or MiLan Fastport 
to which it is connected. To check the baud rate at
which the printer 
is set, print out a configuration page from the printer.
Also make 
sure that the serial port has been enabled on the printer.
After you 
have verified that the baud rates match, attach a serial
cable using 
pins 2, 3, and 7. Pins 2 and 3 are for transmit and
receive, respectively, 
and pin 7 is for ground. The transmit and receive pins
must be crossed 
at one end, which can be achieved by inserting a null
modem at one 
end of the serial cable. After the serial cable has
been attached, 
test the connection by using the UNIX commands tip or
cat 
to print directly to the serial port.
The following illustrates how to use tip to test the
serial 
port connection:<P>
<PRE>
# tip -9600 /dev/ttya
connected
executive
...&lt; a verbose PostScript message should appear &gt; ...
PS&gt; showpage
PS&gt; ~.</pre><p>
<p>
The 9600 represents the baud rate that tip 
will use for the connection. At this point, if you type
executive, 
which will not echo back to the screen, the PostScript
PS&gt; 
prompt should appear. If it does not appear, check the
cable and printer 
configuration. Typing showpage will print out a blank
page 
to the printer. Then type ~. to exit from tip.<P>

To test the printer serial connection using cat, 
type:<P>
<PRE>
(stty -parity 9600;cat /etc/motd) &gt; /dev/ttya</pre><p>
<p>
where 9600 is the baud rate for the connection. The
file 
/etc/motd should print on the printer. If neither tip

nor cat produces output on the printer, stop and reexamine

the serial cable and printer configuration. Do not proceed
until you've 
verified that the serial connection is communicating
properly.<P>

Printers with a built-in network interface can be attached
to the 
network using the supplied interface. The only network
interface not 
recommended is a LocalTalk interface. An EtherTalk interface
can be 
used. To test the network interface for a printer with
an assigned 
IP number, try pinging the printer. If the printer is
communicating 
via AppleTalk, check to see if the printer is visible
in the Mac Chooser. <P>
