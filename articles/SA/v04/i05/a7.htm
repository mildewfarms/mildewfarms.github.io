This month, I have reviewed Instant Internet with WebSurfer,

by David Sachs and Henry Stair; New Riders' Official
World Wide 
Web Yellow Pages, 1995 Edition, by Andrew Busey, Larry
Colker, 
Hank Weghorst, and Luckman Interactive; Networking Personal
Computers 
with TCP/IP, by Craig Hunt; The Solaris 2.x System Administrator's

Guide: J. Ranade Workstation Series, by S. Lee Henry
and John R. 
Graham; The SLIP/PPP Connection: The Essential Guide
to Graphical 
Internet Access, by Paul Gilster; and It's Not A Bug,
It's 
A Feature! Computer Wit and Wisdom by David Lubar.<P>

<B><I>Instant Internet with WebSurfer</I><br>
by David Sachs and Henry Stair<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-210675-2<br>
$24.95<br>
Disks Included</B><P>

One of the most engrossing features of the Internet
is the World Wide 
Web. Given the correct software and the proper connection,
the Web 
can become a reflection of the user's personality. I
have browsed 
art galleries and online stores, sent postcards and
personalized Hallmark 
cards, and ordered catalogs. The only problem encountered
by the typical 
Internet user -- whether new or experienced -- remains
the necessary 
computer configuration. Sachs and Stair include Network
Chameleon 
with their book, and have designed the text to answer
any questions 
regarding Chameleon. They direct the book toward both
beginning users 
and experienced users who have accessed the Internet
from a traditional 
UNIX background.<P>

The book is divided into three parts: 1) Instant Internet;
2) Basic 
Internet Tools; and 3) WebSurfer. Within these sections,
the authors 
use sessions, overviews, instant activities, pointers,
HeadsUp!, and 
tips to present the material. Since the book demonstrates
how to use 
the Internet, it is organized in sessions, rather than
chapters. Each 
session provides an overview and several hands-on excercises
(Instant 
Activities). When warranted, the authors include pointers
(suggestions), 
tips (commentary), and HeadsUp! (designating an area
more complicated 
or technical than previous sections).<P>

Part I, Instant Internet, includes Installing Internet
Chameleon, 
Signing Up with a Provider, and Custom, Connect, and
Ping. These introductory 
chapters present many of the screens the user will,
or could, encounter. 
During installation, the reader can compare each screen
in the book 
with those on the monitor. The session on providers
shows several 
opening screens for different providers. The third session
focuses 
on the Internet Chameleon screens displayed during custom
setup. (The 
reader will notice a section entitled NEWTNews; this
refers to the 
NetManage Enhanced Windows TCP/IP program and has no
connection to 
politicians in Washington, D.C.)<P>

Part 1, Basic Internet Tools, discusses four Internet
tools -- 
Telnet, E-mail, FTP, and Gopher. Each respective utility
is explained 
in a separate session and several activities demonstrate
how to use 
each. At the end of the sessions, the reader/user not
only knows what 
these tools do, but has also used each successfully.
Part 3, WebSurfer, 
describes an easy and exciting way to explore the Internet,
showing 
you how to exploit links among documents. The five sessions
in this 
section discuss the Chameleon WebSurfer, some of the
resources on 
the World-Wide Web, using WebSurfer for Telnet, FTP,
and Gopher sessions, 
how to search the World-Wide Web, and multimedia on
the Web.<P>

This book is a well-written guide to using Internet
Chameleon. It 
features a step-by-step introduction to installation
and the most 
essential tools on the Internet. The activities demonstrate
how to 
use each feature as it is discussed. The graphics, which
include screen 
displays and output as well as menus and Web pages,
supplement the 
text well. This is an ideal resource for either a beginner
or an experienced 
user searching for a friendlier way to access the Internet.<P>

<B><I>New Riders' Official World Wide Web Yellow Pages</I><br>
1995 Edition<br>
by Andrew Busey, Larry Colker, Hank Weghorst, and 
Luckman Interactive<br>
New Riders Publishing<br>
ISBN 1-56205-449-X<br>
$29.99<br>
Disk Included</B><P>

Several books on the market invite the reader to browse
for hours 
on end. One of these is the Internet Yellow Pages: this
book containing 
over 4,000 Web sites and resources, is another (I speak
from experience!). 
Choosing a few pages randomly, I discovered UNIX Security
Topics, 
U.S. Rare Coins and Precious Metals, The San Francisco
Free Press, 
Rocky Mountain Cyber Mall, Shopping 2000, Art Links
on the World Wide 
Web, and Doctor Who. This well-organized directory is
divided into 
30 subject areas, and includes an introduction, two
appendices, and 
an index. Appendix B shows how to use WebIndex, a searching
utility 
developed by Luckman Interactive specifically for this
book and its 
readers. The entire contents of the book can be found
on the accompanying 
disk.<P>

The introduction provides a description of the World-Wide
Web, its 
history, uses, and terminology. It discusses how to
access the World-Wide 
Web and lists the components of a Yellow Pages entry.
Each listing 
contains a site's name, Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
(also 
known more simply as the address), keywords, a description,
and details 
about the site. This is both a fun book to peruse and
a handy resource 
to Internet users. (Try showing it to non-computer users
and see their 
reactions. Around my house, it was &quot;Can you really
get that on 
your computer?? Can I DO that??&quot;) Keep this one
next to your keyboard.<P>

<B><I>Networking Personal Computers with TCP/IP</I><br>
by Craig Hunt<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-123-2<br>
$29.95</B><P>

Computing environments are no longer homogeneous. Today's
organization 
may use UNIX for one purpose and PCs for reports and
charts. The PCs 
may be further divided, with some running Windows, some
Windows NT, 
and others Windows 95. Any network may consist of several
different 
operating systems, which not only causes a little confusion
for the 
users (&quot;Which operating system am I on ?&quot;),
but can also cause 
difficulties for network adminstrators. Craig Hunt (also
the author 
of TCP/IP Network Administration) attempts to clarify
the issues 
involved and offer ways to reduce the problems of internetworking.<P>

Several chapters of Hunt's books focus on specific operating

systems (DOS TCP/IP, Windows on the Network, Windows
95 TCP/IP, Windows 
NT Networking, and NetWare and TCP/IP). Other chapters
discuss general 
topics: The PC Dilemma and Dealing with the Dilemma.
The first examines 
PC hardware and software, showing why PCs can turn a
network administrator's 
hair gray; the second presents advice to reduce the
problems (and 
therefore the strain) facing the network administrator.
Chapter three 
explores Network Tools, specifically PC tools that are
designed to 
help network administrators diagnose or prevent problems,
particularly 
conflicts. The tools include installation tools -- such
as EISA 
Configuration Utilities (ECU) -- which vary from vendor
to vendor. 
Maintenance tools and troubleshooting techniques are
also discussed.<P>

The chapter on configuration control confirms that TCP/IP
is 
not as easy to configure as some alternative networking
systems. Due 
to TCP/IP's power and flexibility, it also possesses
a higher degree 
of complexity. However, TCP/IP also has tools that simplify
the configuration 
process. Hunt explains the Reverse Address Resolution
Protocol (RARP), 
the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP), and the Dynamic Host
Configuration 
Protocol (DHCP), demonstrates how to use them, and documents
the respective 
RFCs that define them.<P>

The remaining chapters address Personal Email and File
and Print Servers. 
Since users have come to depend on email, it should
be reliable (both 
to satisfy the users and to keep the administrator's
phone relatively 
quiet). Hunt analyzes the most popular protocols currently
used: Simple 
Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP); Post Office Protocol
(POP); and Multi-purpose 
Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). He also discusses the
design of most 
TCP/IP email networks. In File and Print Servers, he
describes file 
sharing and the three major TCP/IP protocols currently
used: the Remote 
File System (RFS); the Andrew File System (AFS); and
the Network File 
System (NFS). He also examines print services, the advantages
of printer 
sharing, and possible techniques. Appendices include:
A) Installation 
Planning Form; B) Contacts and References; C) Sendmail
Configuration; 
D) Changes to System Files; and E) Public Domain Software.<P>

Craig Hunt has written a logical and accessible book
on a complex 
topic. The approach is thorough, and Hunt's knowledge
of TCP/IP is 
extensive. The figures, tables, sample screens, and
scripts significantly 
enhance the text. This fine book will become an essential
asset to 
any network administrator's library.<P>

<B><I>The Solaris 2.x System Administrator's Guide</I><br>
J. Ranade Workstation Series<br>
by S. Lee Henry and John R. Graham<br>
McGraw-Hill, Inc.<br>
ISBN 0-07-029368-6<br>
$44.95</B><P>

Henry and Graham begin this book by classifying users
in three categories: 
novice (level I), intermediate (level II), and advanced
(level III). 
A chart in the preface directs readers to the sections
the authors 
recommend for each category. The book is organized in
five parts: 
Introduction, Installation, Basic Administration, Advanced
Administration, 
and Theory of Operation. The Introduction examines the
role of the 
system administrator (&quot;How did I get this job,
anyway?), as well 
as product overview and standards. The second chapter
focuses on changes 
in the Solaris Operating Environment for the user, developer,
and 
system administrator. The Introduction also includes
a chapter on 
shells and one on the Solaris 2.x file system. The chapter
on shells 
shows how to invoke each of the three shells (Bourne,
C, and Korn) 
and some basic features of the shells. The chapter on
the Solaris 
2.x file system shows how to create and tune filesystems
in order 
to maintain the system properly.<P>

Part 2, Installation, consists of two chapters: Preinstallation
and 
Installation. Preinstallation covers requirements prior
to installing 
Solaris 2.x, configurations, partitions, and backups.
Installation 
details the procedure used to install the CD-ROM. Part
3, Basic Administration, 
encompasses Maintaining User Accounts, Administering
Printing Services, 
Managing Resource Sharing, Managing Backup, and Administering
Software 
Packages. Advanced Administration, Part 4, includes
Security and Administering 
NIS+. The final section, Part 5, Theory of Operation,
contains chapters 
on the Solaris Kernel, the Multithread Architecture,
Scheduling, Files 
and File Systems, and Solaris Networking.<P>

The Solaris 2.x System Administrator's Guide is intended
as 
a supplement to, not a replacement for, the existing
documentation. 
It does not re-explain concepts that are covered in
detail in other 
texts, but the authors carefully note the texts that
do explain those 
subjects. The focus here is on issues which are new
in Solaris 2.x 
and not explicitly covered anywhere else. The progression
is logical, 
and the format and graphics contribute to the book's
attractive presentation 
and readability. This is an essential resource for every
Solaris 
administrator.<P>

<B><I>The SLIP/PPP Connection
The Essential Guide to Graphical Internet Access</I><br>
by Paul Gilster<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.<br>
ISBN 0-471-11712-9<br>
$24.95</B><P>

This new book from Paul Gilster, the author of The Internet

Navigator and Finding It on the Internet, maintains
the 
high standard of his earlier works. Many of the latest
Internet toys 
require a SLIP or PPP connection. SLIP (Serial Line
Internet Protocol) 
and PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) are not the same identity.
However, 
since they basically serve the same purpose with respect
to the latest 
technologies (such as Netscape or Mosaic), they are
discussed together 
so often that it's easy for casual readers to assume
that they are 
synonymous. Further, most people who know what they
mean do not know 
how to establish this type of connection. This book
can change that. 
In the first chapters, the author explains this type
of access and 
shows examples. In the second chapter, he looks at TCP/IP,
packet 
switching, SLIP versus PPP, and the equipment needed
so that it will 
run efficiently a nd correctly. Gilster looks individually
at SLIP/PPP 
for Windows and on the Macintosh, identifying the software
needed 
and providing information on where to obtain the software.<P>

Since SLIP/PPP connections are different from the normal
Internet 
connections, the procedures for using the standard Internet
tools 
(FTP, email, Telnet, WAIS, Gopher, and USENET) also
differ. Gilster 
therefore includes updated chapters on these features.
Since the World 
Wide Web is now accessible through SLIP/PPP connections,
there's a 
chapter on browsing through the World Wide Web. In it,
Gilster presents 
the concepts, then provides individual sections to Mosaic,
Netscape, 
Cello, WinWeb, Web browsing with a Macintosh, and Web
browsing with 
TIA (The Internet Adapter), RemSock, and SlipKnot. (I
am happy to 
see Macintosh and Windows covered in the same book.
There are readers 
who have both platforms, and buying two separate books,
often by the 
same author, must be inconvenient and consume a lot
of space.)<P>

Gilster's style is, as always, clear, logical, and highly
readable. 
This is the first book I have seen that is devoted entirely
to the 
SLIP/PPP connection. Since more and more products need
this connection, 
the book is a welcome addition to the ever-changing
Internet library. 
Many networks now include PCs, both IBM and Macintosh,
so it is essential 
that the administrator know something about both platforms
and the 
correct connectivity. Gilster's book provides that knowledge.<P>

<B><I>It's Not A Bug, It's A Feature! Computer Wit 
and Wisdom</I><br>
by David Lubar<br>
Addison-Wesley<br>
ISBN 0-201-48304-1<br>
$9.95</B><P>

This is an enjoyable little book of quotations for every
computer 
situation. It provides a bit of comic relief between
software, hardware, 
and thunderstorms. Such comforting thoughts as &quot;Forget
all this 
talk about reliability; if it plugs in, it's trouble&quot;
(Anonymous) 
and &quot;we forget that you cannot impress software,
no matter what 
your rank&quot; (Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, who helped
design COBOL 
and coined the word &quot;bug&quot; circa 1970) may
sometimes seem to 
painfully apt, but will still make the reader laugh.
As will prognostications 
on the order of &quot;I see a world market for about
five computers,&quot; 
which is attributed to Thomas J. Watson, Sr., former
leader of IBM, 
circa 1947.<P>

David Lubar has performed a service for the programmers
of the world. 
When that program just will not work, take a deep breath,
read one 
or two quotes, smile, and then look at it again. It
is always easier 
to see the problem as you step back, but most of us
won't allow ourselves 
that luxury -- this will help. <P>
