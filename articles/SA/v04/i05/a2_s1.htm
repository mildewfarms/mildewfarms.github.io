<H1>Sidebar: About DHCP</H1><p>
<P>
The DHCP protocol is set out in an Internet RFC, RFC
1531. This RFC 
describes in great detail how DHCP operates. I will
provide merely 
a brief overview.<P>

DHCP resembles the BOOTP protocol, and is even capable
of interacting 
with it. DHCP allows you to dynamically supply a client
with configuration 
parameters, such as the IP address. For this purpose,
DHCP is split 
into two functional parts. First, it allows a client
to request its 
configuration information from a server. Second, it
allows a server 
to allocate a network address to a client. This is based
on a client/server 
model in which clients request information from a DHCP
server.<P>

IP addresses can be allocated in three different ways.
They can be 
allocated automatically, in which case the host is assigned
a permanent 
IP address. This implies that there are enough IP addresses
available 
to supply each (possible) host on the network. A second
method is 
dynamic allocation, wherin a server has a number of
IP addresses available 
for its clients and will allocate an address from its
pool when a 
client requests one. This scheme works well when the
number of IP 
addresses is limited and not all hosts are constantly
connected to 
the network. The third way of allocating addresses is
manually, that 
is, the network administrator assigns an address to
a host, and DHCP 
is used as a way of getting the address to the node.<P>

For further information I recommend reading RFC 1531.
It contains 
the complete specification of the protocol and the messages
that are 
exchanged between the server and client. <P>
