<B>HEROIX Introduces RoboMon UNIX</B><P>

HEROIX has introduced RoboMon UNIX for automating computing
facilities 
in multiplatform environments. RoboMon UNIX is a client/server
system 
administration tool supporting most UNIX operating systems,
including 
AIX, Digital UNIX, HP-UX, Solaris, and SunOS. RoboMon
is designed 
with an open architecture, enabling integration with
network managers, 
such as OpenView and NetView, as well as help desk applications
and 
other software. <P>

RoboMon uses rule-based automation, with more than 80
built-in sensors, 
to detect and address problems. RoboMon's analysis capabilities
allow 
users to automate system, network, application, and
database tasks 
with the goal of improving system availability and reliability.
RoboMon 
collects more than 1,000 UNIX performance statistics
which are analyzed 
by its rule engine in realtime. RoboMon can take actions
to correct 
a problem, or it can notify appropriate personnel (using
real time 
event display, email, paging, and network managers).
RoboMon provides 
escalation capability, that is, it evaluates the results
and tries 
new actions until the problem is solved. <P>

RoboMon's native collector is supplemented by the RoboMon
Omni Collector, 
which can gather data from data files or real-time sources,
such as 
a log file, a pipe, a database, or an application. RoboMon
ships with 
a comprehensive out-of-the-box rule set, and provides
a Motif interface, 
allowing tailoring and site-specific extension. <P>

RoboMon for UNIX pricing ranges from $500 to $9,500.

tool, adds support 
for SNMP and a utility for migrating from UNIX job scheduling
utilities 
such as cron. AutoSys/Xpert 1.0, an add-on tool for
AutoSys, 
provides various graphical views of complex job execution
environments. 
It offers both real-time monitoring modes and simulator
modes, for 
predicting the impact of jobs on system load.<P>

UniVision supports AT&amp;T GIS, HP 9000, IBM RS/6000,
Sequent, and Sun 
computers. It currently supports Oracle databases, with
future development 
plans calling for support of Informix and Sybase. Pricing
