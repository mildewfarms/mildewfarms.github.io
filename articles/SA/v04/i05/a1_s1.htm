<H1>Sidebar: IBM Mainframe Hardware</H1><p>
<P>
An IBM mainframe consists of many computing devices
connected together. 
Centered on these devices is the CPU. The existence
of these devices 
allows the CPU to offload computing power relative to
specific tasks. 
Over the years, IBM developed a standard called &quot;Systems
Network 
Architecture (SNA)&quot; for these devices. <P>

To understand SNA, it is necessary to understand the
term SNA User. 
An &quot;SNA User&quot; is simply a person or application
using the 
SNA network to communicate with another user. SNA creates
virtual 
or logical paths between users so they can communicate.
These paths 
are called &quot;Logical Units&quot; (or LUs). An LU
is a logical port, 
not a physical port, to which a user connects. The LU
is implemented 
through microcode that resides on the devices in the
SNA network. 
An LU is identified by a number. <P>

Along with LUs, SNA uses &quot;Physical Units&quot;
(or PUs) that 
represent the actual devices on the SNA network. &quot;SNA
Nodes&quot; 
are physical points in the SNA network that contain
one or more network 
components. Since an SNA Node represents an actual physical
device, 
there is an SNA PU associated with the device.<P>

There are two major types of SNA Nodes: &quot;Peripheral
Nodes&quot; 
and &quot;Subarea Nodes.&quot; Peripheral Nodes are
attached to Subarea 
Nodes. A Peripheral Node only talks to the Subarea Node
to which it 
is attached. Peripheral Nodes are also known as &quot;Terminal
Cluster 
Controllers.&quot; User terminals are connected to these.
The newest 
type of Cluster Controller is Type 2. The emulation
protocol used 
for these terminals is &quot;3270 Terminal Emulation.&quot;
Terminals 
can be configured as either &quot;CUT Mode,&quot; which
provides only 
a single session, or &quot;DFT (Distributed Function
Terminal) Mode,&quot; 
providing up to five sessions over a single line. Unlike
Peripheral 
Nodes, Subarea Nodes can talk with other Subarea Nodes
on the SNA 
Network. There are two types of Subarea Nodes: Type
5 and Type 4. 
Type 5 is usually called a &quot;Host Node.&quot; It
refers to the CPU. 
Type 4 is usually called a &quot;Communications Controller
Node,&quot; 
or Front-End-Processor (FEP). The communications controller
has one 
or many cluster controllers attached to them. For a
schematic, see 
Figure 3. <P>
