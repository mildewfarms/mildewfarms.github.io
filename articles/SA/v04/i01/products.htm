<B>Microport Introduces Session Log</B><P>

Microport Systems has introduced Session Log, a productivity
tool 
for UNIX workstation users. Session Log records and
plays back workstation 
user sessions. Recordings made with Session Log capture
mouse and 
keyboard interactions, not just screen images or X protocols.
The 
captured recordings can be stored for later playback.
Session Log 
records and plays back user sessions with a mouse click
or hot key 
and its control menu can be hidden away so that the
user's displays 
aren't cluttered.<P>

Session Log lets non-technical staff give precise demonstrations
created 
by technical experts. Training activities supplemented
with Session 
Log let instructors provide users with libraries of
live examples. 
For development organizations, Session Log automates
test procedures 
and provides a method for end-user problem reporting.
Session Log 
can also provide statistical analysis of recorded user
sessions.<P>

Session Log supports Sun SPARC workstations running
Solaris 1.1 or 
2.x and supports both Motif and OpenWindows. Recordings
made with 
Session Log are portable between Motif and OpenWindows.
Session Log 
costs $895 for a single right-to-use license. For more
information 
contact Microport Systems, 1770 North Research Park
Way, North 
Logan, UT 84321, (801) 750-7800; FAX: (801) 755-7888.<P>

<B>ISG-America Releases INFORMER-X</B><P>

ISG-America has released INFORMER-X, a suite of systems
management 
utilities for UNIX. The INFORMER-X product suite consists
of four 
modules: SCOUT (alert management), SILHOUETTE (system
profiling and 
reporting), PASSBOOK (job accounting and chargeback),
and ENACT (job 
scheduling).<P>

INFORMER-X provides a Windows 3.1 interface at the desktop,
and supports 
DDE and OLE integration and information exchange with
other Windows 
applications. INFORMER-X was developed in the United
Kingdom by ISG 
plc and has been marketed successfully there for more
than three years.<P>

INFORMER-X is priced at $3,500 for the four-module product
suite. 
The price per utility is $995. For more information
contact ISG-America, 
359 Littleton Rd., Westford, MA 01886, (508) 392-4977;
FAX: (508) 
392-4993.<P>

<B>MCS Ships NetLink</B><P>

Micro Computer Systems, Inc. has begun shipping NetLink,
a tool that 
links UNIX systems to NetWare clients. Tailored to the
Novell environment, 
NetLink provides the software needed to let a standard
Novell NetWare 
client communicate with a UNIX computer. NetLink uses
standard IPX/SPX 
compatible protocols developed by MCS. When installed,
the UNIX portion 
of MCS's NetLink provides the UNIX system with IPX/SPX-compatible

protocols, APIs, and terminal services. NetLink offers
three primary 
connectivity features: terminal emulation, file transfer,
and application 
software development. Accessing a UNIX system doesn't
require changes 
to the normal IPX/SPX configuration of the NetWare system.
<P>

The terminal emulation feature lets NetWare clients
function as VT100, 
VT220, or Wyse60 terminals, with up to four terminal
sessions available 
at one time. As with terminal emulation, NetLink uses
standard IPX/SPX-compatible 
protocols when initiating a file transfer session. Users
can transfer 
multiple files to and from the UNIX system from either
the command 
line or the NetLink file transfer session, which has
the look and 
feel of a UNIX ftp session. Another feature of NetLink
provides UNIX 
resident, NetWare-compatible IPX/SPX and NetBIOS APIs
that let programmers 
develop original network applications.<P>

NetLink supports Interactive UNIX 3.2.2, SCO UNIX 3.2.4,
IBM RS/6000 
AIX 3.2.5, SUN SPARC 4.1.3, HP/UX 9.0, Unisys SVR4 1.2,
Motorola SVR4 
88K, UNIXWare SVR4, and AT&amp;T SVR4. NetLink can also
be configured 
for either Ethernet or Token Ring networks, and provides
several device 
drivers for Token Ring support.<P>

Prices for NetLink start at $895. For more information
contact Micro 
Computer Systems, Inc., 2300 Valley View Lane, Suite
800, Irving, 
TX 75062, (214) 659-1514; FAX: (214) 659-1624.<P>

<B>CoSystems Ships CoISDN-SBus</B><P>

CoSystems Inc. has begun shipping a family of products
designed to 
let UNIX workstation users take advantage of the benefits
and bandwidth 
offered by Basic Rate ISDN. CoISDN-SBus supports Sun
SPARCstations 
and compatibles. CoISDN-SBus is available in two configurations,
a 
SOFTWARE ONLY version and the FULL PACKAGE. The FULL
PACKAGE includes 
both the CoISDN software and the CoISDN-SBus card, which
can be installed 
in any available SBus slot on a SPARCstation. The SOFTWARE
ONLY version 
targets SPARCstations which already have built-in ISDN
cards. Both 
packages include PPP support.<P>

The CoISDN-SBus FULL PACKAGE is priced at $895. The
SOFTWARE ONLY 
version of CoISDN-SBus costs $595. For more information

<B>Performix Releases EMPOWER/CS</B><P>

Performix, Inc. has released EMPOWER/CS, a client/server
load-testing 
tool. EMPOWER/CS captures and replays the activities
of client/server 
applications which run on Windows PCs. EMPOWER/CS stress-tests
a database 
server by running multiple scripts from one driver to
simulate the 
load of multiple PCs. The database server assumes the
load is originating 
from hundreds of PCs, and services the requests appropriately.
EMPOWER/CS 
measures the response time of the requested queries
and quantifies 
them according to predefined categories. Using a single
driver machine, 
EMPOWER/CS can emulate load testing that might otherwise
require a 
PC to represent each user.<P>

For more information contact Performix, Inc., 8200 Greensboro

Suite 1475, McLean, VA 22102, (703) 448-6606; FAX: (703)

<B>Beame &amp; Whiteside Introduce BW-MultiConnect for Solaris</B><P>

Beame &amp; Whiteside Software has introduced BW-MultiConnect
for Solaris, 
which provides connectivity between SunSoft's Solaris
UNIX system 
and Novell NetWare environments. BW-MultiConnect includes
a high-performance 
IPX/SPX protocol stack for the Solaris environment,

appropriate BW-MultiConnect client or server functions.<P>

The BW-MultiConnect software for Solaris resides on
the Solaris server; 
no additional software is required for NetWare client
workstations. 
BW-MultiConnect Server for Solaris includes: the IPX/SPX
protocol 
stack with a TLI/TPI interface, Ethernet support, SAP
(Service Advertising 
Protocol), RIP (Routing Information Protocol) connections
to other 
NetWare networks, and a NetWare subset API programming
library. BW-MultiConnect 
Server for Solaris is implemented as a loadable streams
driver on 
the Solaris host. NetWare features included are: server
filing system 
support, server print server, support for multiple simultaneous
users, 
queue management, and server bindery servers. NetWare
DOS utilities 
included are: LOGIN, ATTACH, MAP, SLIST, and LOGOUT.
The BW-MultiConnect 
print server includes a Virtual Terminal Server that
provides TELNET 
terminal emulation for remote access to UNIX services
via NetWare 
NVT protocol services.<P>

BW-MultiConnect Client for Solaris lets Solaris UNIX
workstations 
mount a NetWare volume or directory the same way they
normally mount 
a Solaris file system. Once mounted, the NetWare volume
operates like 
a Solaris directory. BW-MultiConnect Client for Solaris
includes support 
for automount by reference, UNIX file permission mapping,
UNIX uid/gid 
mapping, and client printing. The product can also print
to NetWare 
printers using the UNIX lp interface, or using nprint.<P>

Prices for BW-MultiConnect Server for Solaris range
from $495 for 
a five-user license to $9,695 for an unlimited license.
