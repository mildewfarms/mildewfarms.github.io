<H1>Books: A User's Report</H1><p>
<P>
Elizabeth Zinkann<P>

As usual, I've received too many books to include them
all (some will 
appear in the next issue), but I have attempted to offer
a variety. 
The books about the Internet are getting more specialized.
Therefore, 
there are several different approaches represented.
Jason J. Manger's 
The Essential Internet Information Guide, published
by McGraw-Hill, 
London, provides an international touch, with examples
drawn both 
from the United States and the United Kingdom. The Net
after Dark: 
The Underground Guide to the Coolest, the Newest, and
the Most Bizarre 
Hangouts on the Internet, CompuServe, AOL, Delphi, and
More, by 
Lamont Wood, offers a lighter approach to Internet information.
Managing 
Internet Informations Services, by Cricket Liu, Jerry
Peek, Russ 
Jones, Bryan Buus, and Adrian Nye, is intended for UNIX
system administrators. 
Low-Cost E-Mail with UUCP: Integrating UNIX, DOS, Windows,
and 
Mac, by Thomas Wm. Madron, addresses the high cost of
electronic 
mail and provides a solution for a multi-platform environment.
The 
Mosaic Handbook comes in three flavors: X Window, Microsoft
Windows, 
and Macintosh. Dale Dougherty and Richard Koman co-authored
all three, 
with Paula Ferguson joining them for the X Window version.
The final 
book, Inside UNIX, by Chris Hare, Emmett Dulaney, George
Eckel, 
Steven Lee, and Lee Ray, was written for the intermediate
UNIX user 
and the beginning system administrator, an often overlooked
audience. 
I hope that you enjoy them as much as I did.<P>

<B><I>The Essential Internet Information Guide</I><br>
by Jason J. Manger<br>
McGraw-Hill Book Company<br>
ISBN 0-07-707905-1<br>
$27.95</B><P>

Jason Manger's book helps readers understand what they
really need 
to know in order to use the Internet. Manger begins
by detailing the 
essential design of the Internet, then goes on to analyze
the needs 
of the typical user. He concludes that the user requires
three tools: 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP), to download files; telnet,
to interactively 
examine databases; and electronic mail (email), to communicate.
He 
also recommends learning a newsreader, but classifies
this as optional. <P>

Manger does not ignore the other Internet utilities;
he merely prioritizes 
them differently. Following the introduction, he presents
chapters 
on USENET, FTP, Archie, telnet, UNIX-related tools,
compressed files, 
images, finding information, Internet Relay Chat (IRC),
and electronic 
mail. The appendices, which alone would merit the reader's
attention, 
include an alphabetical glossary, a list of Internet
service providers, 
questions and answers, an alphabetical resource guide,
anonymous FTP 
listings, Internet domains, country codes and hostname
details, and 
USENET group listings.<P>

Manger addresses each topic from an international perspective,
providing 
examples from the United Kingdom as well as from the
United States. 
His examples demonstrate not only how other countries
access the Internet, 
but also how to communicate with users in other countries.<P>

Coverage in the book is both broad and detailed. The
chapter on USENET, 
for example, not only describes how to use it, but also
discusses 
the USENET hierarchy, news distribution, decoding binary
messages 
(which include images, sounds, and programs), encrypted
messages (ROT 
13), and Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), which
allows users 
with telnet to read messages from USENET groups without
the aid of 
a newsreader. Two chapters that are not necessarily
found in every 
Internet book deal with data compression and images.
The chapter on 
compressed files explores the different compression
formats, common 
problems, how to find the compression/decompression
utilities, and 
the tools necessary for decompression on miscellaneous
platforms. 
The image manipulation chapter focuses on the different
image formats 
and their respective encoding procedures, how to retrieve
or post 
images on USENET, common image questions, locating image-processing

utilities, and finding FTP imaging archives.<P>

The two concluding chapters describe Internet Relay
Chat (IRC) and 
email. The IRC chapter explains how to use an IRC server
via telnet 
and where to procure IRC information and software, then
lists the 
IRC commands and illustrates their applications. Although
the chapter 
on email is based on the UNIX mail system, most of the
information 
applies to all email systems and the author presents
some valid questions 
and solutions regarding email security.<P>

This book is a well-organized an exceptionally informative
Internet 
resource. The author explicitly itemizes what he will
explain in each 
chapter and proceeds to do it. He presents shortcut
solutions as hints 
and tips and uses figures, tables, and typical messages
to support 
his explanations. Many of the chapters address familiar
Internet topics 
from a new perspective or offer little-known facts about
them (I particularly 
appreciated the additional information included in the
international 
examples). Manger's extensive knowledge and lucid presentation
make 
this a truly useful book for serious users.<P>

<B><I>The Net After Dark: The Underground Guide to the 
Coolest, the Newest, and the Most Bizarre Hangouts on
the Internet, 
CompuServe, AOL, Delphi, and More</I><br>
by Lamont Wood<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.<br>
ISBN 0-471-10347-0<br>
$16.95</B><P>

For those online users who are either insomniacs or
night owls, this 
book was written expressly for you. A warning, however:
it may exacerbate 
your condition significantly (I speak from experience
regarding this). 
Certain sections of online services become alive after
a certain hour 
and many merit investigation. In his introduction, Wood
explains the 
symbols used throughout the book to help the reader
avoid places he 
or she really would not want to visit.<P>

The first chapter investigates What's Out There, Files
(Graphic, Text, 
Software, and Data), File Compression (the various compression
methods 
and their respective extensions), and important facts
about downloading 
and electronic mail, as well as behaviors and what practices
to avoid 
online. Subsequent chapters include the Layout of the
Net, Artificial 
Intelligence, Multimedia, Virtual Reality, Science Fiction,
Humor, 
Cyberpunk, Mondo Software Stashes, Games and MUDs, Chatting,
NetSex, 
Net Fringes: UFOs, Alien Possession, Dark Conspiracies,
and Other 
Madness, Commercial Services, BBS and Echo Networks,
and The Internet.Each 
chapter contains a description of the respective topic,
the jargon 
used with it, file extensions and their definitions,
and where to 
find files, utilities, and newsgroups related to the
topic.<P>

Reproductions of photgraphs and art available online
appear throughout 
the book, as do sidebars entitled either Saving Face
(don't embarrass 
yourself) or Check This Out (tips on what exists and
where to find 
it). This is a light, but enjoyable and informative
book.<P>

<B><I>Managing Internet Information Services</I><br>
by Cricket Liu, Jerry Peek, Russ Jones, Bryan Buus,
and Adrian Nye<br>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.<br>
ISBN 1-56592-062-7<br>
$29.95</B><P>

This Internet book was written for system administrators
and those 
who want to provide Internet services, but lack the
knowledge. As 
the preface states: &quot;This book explains how to
plan, set up and 
manage a complete array of Internet services including
an FTP archive, 
a Gopher server, a WAIS (Wide Area Information Server,
a World Wide 
Web (WWW) Server, and electronic mailing lists.&quot;
Managing 
Internet Information Services does not explain how to
use the different 
Internet services; it assumes a fairly extensive knowledge
of those 
services and their respective uses.<P>

The examples in the book are drawn from the authors'
work with the 
Species Survival Commission (SSC), part of the World
Conservation 
Union. (Regular O'Reilly customers may recognize the
SSC for its efforts 
to save the Victoria Crowned Pigeon, currently on the
cover of the 
lex and yacc Nutshell Handbook. For additional information
concerning 
this project, please email adrian@ora.com.)<P>

Two introductory chapters discuss the concepts implemented
in an information 
server, such as client/server and TCP/IP, and provide
a brief synopsis 
of the Internet services from a provider's viewpoint.
Chapter two 
also considers the purposes of each service and the
resources necessary 
to begin and maintain an information service. Chapter
three explores 
three services: finger, inetd, and telnet. The rest
of the book illustrates 
how to set up and maintain the FTP, WAIS databases,
Gopher, the World 
Wide Web, and electronic mail services. The concluding
chapters contain 
essential information regarding Firewalls and Information
Services, 
Legal Matters, and Protecting Intellectual Property.
Chapters A through 
C provide additional Gopher information, while chapters
D through 
G concentrate on supplementary World Wide Web data.<P>

A particularly valuable feature of this book is its
inclusion of material 
that has not previously appeared in book format. For
example, the 
segment on the World Wide Web consists of an introductory
chapter, 
Setting Up the Server, Web Authoring, Gateways and Forms,
and Access 
Control and Security. Setting Up the Server describes
a step-by-step 
procedure for obtaining, building, and maintaining the
NCSA Web server. 
Until now, anyone attempting to initiate and configure
a Web server 
had to download the FAQs, configuration files, and Makefiles
and then 
endeavor to assemble the resulting information in order.
The authors 
discuss some topics that the FAQs either ignore or only
partially 
address: legal issues, discovering hackers' attempts,
and firewalls.<P>

Managing Internet Information Services presents complex
material 
in a logical manner. Its progressive approach allows
the administrator 
to implement the various services with a minimum amount
of difficulty. 
The expertise of the authors is evident in the presentation
of the 
subject matter, and it is impossible to discern where
one author's 
work ends and another's begins. This excellent book
could not have 
been more timely. Anyone involved with installing Internet
services, 
as an administrator, consultant, or provider, should
read it and refer 
to it often.<P>

<B><I>Low-Cost E-Mail with UUCP<br>
Integrating UNIX, DOS, Windows and Mac</I><br>
by Thomas Wm. Madron, Ph.D.<br>
Van Nostrand Reinhold<br>
ISBN 0-442-01849-5<br>
$39.95<br>
Disks Included</B><P>

Electronic mail has evolved from part of network computing's
benefits 
to a standard. Email addresses now appear on business
cards and are 
regularly requested on various forms, along with name,
telephone number, 
and fax number. When cost reduction became a major factor
in network 
administration, electronic mail expenses presented a
primary challenge. 
The UNIX-to-UNIX Copy Program (UUCP) had originally
provided a low-cost 
dependable answer for UNIX networks. But since today's
administrators 
are usually dealing with multi-platform networks, consisting
of UNIX, 
DOS, Windows, OS/2, and Macintosh systems, UUCP has
generally been 
dismissed as an unsuitable solution.<P>

Thomas Madron addresses the benefits of UUCP, and explains
how to 
adapt it to other platforms. The initial chapter, An
Introduction 
to UUCP/Mail, explores some basics: who would want (and
can use) a 
UUCP mail network, the fundamental network topologies,
and understanding 
UUCP. Chapter two discusses the design of a UUCP network
and shows 
a simple example. Chapter three examines UUCP in UNIX,
its home environment, 
and then describes different products using UUCP on
DOS/Windows, OS/2, 
and Macintosh systems. Other chapters include the UUCP
and Mail Programs; 
the UUCP System Files: Installing UUCP on Your System;
Creating, Reading, 
and Sending Mail; Completing and Managing the Network;
and Beyond 
Your Private Network. The Appendices include an additional
reading 
list, a product directory, sample configuration files,
relevant RFCs, 
common modem problems, and a glossary. In other words,
Low-Cost 
E-Mail with UUCP is a network administrator's guide
to installing, 
running, and maintaining UUCP across diverse platforms.<P>

Madron gives administrators guidelines for determining
whether or 
not UUCP will work for them, then explains how to set
it up, what 
products are available, and how to maintain it properly.
He uses figures 
and tables when applicable, and gives many tips on installation
and 
configuration. The accompanying disks contain shareware
programs such 
as UUPlus, WinNET, and Waffle. The text is clearly written
and will 
furnish network administrators with an excellent resource
for using 
UUCP.<P>

Mosaic, a relatively new development in Internet history,
merges hypertext, 
graphics, formatted text, and multimedia for the user
in one application. 
As the authors state, &quot;Mosaic is more than a Web
browser. In fact, 
it's an integrated interface for the entire Internet.&quot;<P>

The World Wide Web is an extensive system of servers
connected by 
hypertext links. Through these links, any document can
be accessed 
simply, no matter where it really resides. Unlike other
documents, 
a World Wide Web page stores text and formatting codes,
pointes to 
other information (i.e., grpahics for the icons to appear
on the page), 
and links to other resources, not necessarily on your
machine. These 
links are stored in HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
When a client 
selects a link, a new connection is established between
the source 
of the information (where the data currently is located)
and the client 
machine, which downloads the facts and employs the HyperText
Markup 
Language (HTML) to format and present the information
requested. The 
exciting concept of the Web is that the whole world
becomes your file 
server and your workstation the connection manager and
display formatter.<P>

The Mosaic Handbook, whether the X Window System, Microsoft

Windows, or Macintosh version, introduces the user,
new or experienced, 
to Mosaic and demonstrates how to use it. Although the
three platforms 
differ, the books offer the same general information.
Each begins 
with The Wide World of Internet Services and Getting
Started with 
Mosaic. Following these introductory chapters are: Exploring
the World 
Wide Web, Accessing Other Internet Services, Customizing
Mosaic, Using 
Mosaic for Multimedia, Creating HTML Documents, and
Future Directions. 
The Appendices differ among the three versions, but
they all include 
the Mosaic Reference Guide, the HTML Reference Guide,
and a Glossary.<P>

In addition to illustrating how to use the Mosaic interface,
the authors 
explore the Web, leading the reader on a guided tour.
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 
Inc. is particularly well qualified to demonstrate this,
since O'Reilly 
instituted the Global Network Navigator (GNN). The GNN
makes it easy 
to demonstrate how to navigate with Mosaic, whether
the user needs 
information services, resources, or databases. The authors
explore 
requirements for using Mosaic, how hypertext works,
navigation tools, 
and using other Internet services via Mosaic.<P>

The writing in all three books is clear and the authors
have addressed 
the individual problems of each platform skillfully.
Plenty of diagrams 
and screen reproductions complement the text and the
figures and the 
text interact well. The topics are not long, which simplifies
searching 
for a particular instruction. Every Mosaic user should
have The 
Mosaic Handbook to peruse, read, and reference.<P>

<B><I>Inside UNIX</I><br>
by Chris Hare, Emmett Dulaney, George Eckel, Steven

Lee, and Lee Ray<br>
New Riders Publishing<br>
ISBN 1-56205-401-5<br>
$39.99, Disk Included</B><P>

Designed for the intermediate (and often neglected)
UNIX user and 
beginning UNIX system administrator, Inside UNIX occupies
a 
uniques position in the UNIX library. Usually a book
for a system 
administrator cannot help (or doesn't interest) a user
and vice versa, 
but this book bridges that gap quite well. It is also
extremely current 
regarding UNIX versions, so some of its topics would
be considered 
new by more experienced UNIX users.<P>

The book begins with a UNIX overview, including a history
that details 
the end of Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) and
the entrance of 
Novell. The first few chapters, which will probably
be a review for 
experienced users, deal with topics such as the importance
of good 
passwords, the complete structure of the root directory
(not just 
two or three examples to demonstrate how the structure
works), and 
inode information. A section on editors examines vi
basics, advanced 
vi topics, and ed. The original UNIX ed is not currently
used by choice. 
However, following a system crash, it may be the only
editor available 
to the administrator. In the advanced vi discussion,
the authors not 
only list the set commands, but also explain what the
individual options 
actually do. Following the editors section, Inside UNIX
describes 
the most popular graphical user interfaces.<P>

A subsequent section both introduces and demonstrates
shell programming, 
covering the different shells, additional features,
basic scripts, 
the awk processor, the sed editor, and some advanced
shell techniques. 
A section on administration discusses the login procedure,
processes, 
archiving and backup, and security. Most of the UNIX
variants, including 
SCO UNIX, Xenix, Linux, FreeBSD, UnixWare, Solaris,
Interactive UNIX, 
and NeXTstep are covered here. The Internet, mail, and
communicating 
are also explored, and a section entitled, Connections
deals with 
terminal and printer interfacing, connecting to MS-DOS,
and networking 
concepts. The concluding section is an A-Z command reference.
The 
appendices identify differences between UNIX and DOS
and provide sample 
programs. The accompanying disk provides ASCII copies
of all the shell 
scripts within the book.<P>

Although it is intended for intermediate users and beginning
system 
administrators, sections of this book will interest
other levels of 
users and administrators. The introductory sections,
editors chapters, 
and the segment on shell programming are good examples.
The topics 
are well-organized and presented in a logical order,
and the scope 
is extensive. The sections of particular interest to
the system administrator 
can either be read separately or progressively as the
next step. Diagrams, 
tables, and examples are used frequently throughout
the book and complement 
the well-written text. The expertise of the individual
authors is 
evident: this is a book that will significantly benefit
both UNIX 
users and administrators. <P>
