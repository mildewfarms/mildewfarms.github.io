<H1>Sidebar: Using lpc</H1><p>
<P>
lpc controls printer operations on the network. With
its various 
commands it can start or stop a printer, enable or disable
the printing 
queues for a particular printer, rearrange print jobs
within the printing 
queue, and display the status of each printer on the
network, along 
with printing queue and printer daemon information.<P>

You may use lpc either from the command line or interactively.

When lpc is executed from the command line with one
or more 
arguments, the first argument is interpreted as a command.
Each argument 
thereafter is taken as a parameter to this command.
For example:<P>
<PRE>
% lpc down laser3 Laser 3 is down for maintenance</pre><p>
<p>
In this example, down is the command that lpc 
will execute.  The down command turns off the print
queue 
and disables printing for a particular printer on the
network -- 

in this case &quot;laser3.&quot; The next parameter
is actually a message. 
This message will be displayed if anyone inquires about
laser3 in 
an attempt to use the printer. Notice that the message
is not enclosed 
within quotes.<P>

If you invoke lpc with no arguments, it runs interactively.

The shell prompt will be replaced with the following
lpc prompt:<P>
<PRE>
lpc&gt;</pre><p>
<p>
Simply type the command you wish to execute followed

by any necessary parameters. When you're ready to leave
the interactive 
prompt, type &quot;exit,&quot; &quot;quit,&quot; or
simply &quot;q&quot; 
to exit lpc and return to the shell prompt.<P>

Following is a list of some other useful commands recognized
by lpc 
and a description of the task each command performs.
Like the command 
&quot;quit,&quot; all lpc commands can be abbreviated.
If 
lpc is not sure which command you are trying to specify,
it will 
display, &quot;?Ambiguous command.&quot;<P>
<PRE>
up [ all | [ printername...]]</pre><p>
<p>
This command is the exact opposite of the down 
command. It restarts all queues or the specified queues,
enables printing 
again, and removes the message from the printer status
file.<P>
<PRE>
disable [ all | [ printername...]]</pre><p>
<p>
This command is similar to the down command except 
that it can only be used by the superuser and doesn't
give the option 
of adding a message to the printer status file.<P>
<PRE>
enable [ all | [ printername...]]</pre><p>
<p>
This command reverses the disable command and 
is also only available to the superuser.<P>
<PRE>
restart [ all | [ printername...]]</pre><p>
<p>
This handy command is available to all users. If the

printer daemon dies for some unknown reason, this command
will try 
to restart it. You will find out that the printer daemon
died when 
you use lpq to check on your print job. lpq will notify

you that the printer daemon is not present.<P>
<PRE>
topq printername [ jobnumber...] [ username...]</pre><p>
<p>
This command is also handy, but is available only to

the super-user. The command will take the specified
print jobs, or 
all the print jobs belonging to the specified user,
and move them 
to the top of the print queue ahead of all other jobs
in the queue.<P>
<PRE>
clean [ all | [ printername...]]</pre><p>
<p>
This command removes all print jobs from all the printers

or the specified printers. It is only available to the
superuser.<P>
<PRE>
status [ all | [ printername...]]</pre><p>
<p>
This command simply displays the status of the printer

daemons and queues; it is available to all users.<P>
<PRE>
help [command] ...</pre><p>
<p>
This is probably the most important command. Typed without
an argument, 
it displays a list of all recognized lpc commands. If
commands 
are specified, it will display a short description of
the task performed 
by each. <P>
