To the Editor:<br>

I found errors in the published version of the oldacct
code (&quot;Checking 
User Security,&quot; Sys Admin 3.5, Sept./Oct. 1994).
In the &quot;On since&quot; 
test line, hyphens were published instead of equals
signs. In the 
three lines that echo the users' names and dates, an
open quotation 
mark preceded all three $u values. None of those should
have been 
there. The corrected code is in Listing 1.(E-Media Production Manager's note:  Listings referenced within the New Messages/Letters can be found by
scrolling to the bottom of the current page.)<P>

To: SysAdmin Readers<br>
Subject: Printer Sharing with UNIX and Windows For Workgroups<P>

Since the November/December issue of Sys Admin appeared,
I have been 
receiving 1 - 3 calls a day with comments and questions
about the 
article that I wrote pertaining to sharing printers
between UNIX and 
Windows For Workgroups. The response has been overwhelmingly
great. 
I thank all of you for reading the article, and I am
glad that I was 
able to help you.<P>

It wasn't until after the phone calls started pouring
in that I realized 
that I had not identified which files on CompuServe
were needed to 
download the WinSpool and QVT programs. Those files
can be found in 
the Window's Shareware Forum by the following names:<P>
<PRE>
winspo.zip
qvt394.zip</pre><p>
<p>
Several people called to ask if the WinSpool/QVT solution

would allow them to print from Windows to a printer
connected locally 
to a UNIX box. Unfortunately, it does not. It only allows
printing 
from UNIX to a shared printer on the network. However,
I hope that 
those people that called are reading this letter, because
I now have 
an answer as to how that task can be accomplished.<P>

One of the calls I received was from a Douglas Smith
of Network Instruments. 
Mr. Smith mentioned that his company had just come out
with a product 
called NIPRINT, for $29.00, that would have saved me
a lot of time 
had it been around when I first tried to do my printer
sharing. I 
was a little reluctant to believe him since I had heard
this story 
many times before, so he sent me a demonstration of
his product.<P>

I installed NIPRINT when I received it and Mr. Smith
was right. It 
works great. First, let me say that I am not in the
business of reviewing 
products, and I certainly don't want to be telling you
which product 
is better. But I felt that since I did write about printer
sharing, 
I owed it to all of you who read the article to at least
inform you 
of my latest experience.<P>

NIPRINT has several advantages over the WinSpool/QVT
solution that 
I wrote about earlier.<P>

1. You only need to buy, setup, and maintain one package.<P>

2. NIPRINT responds faster than the WinSpool/QVT solution.<P>

3. NIPRINT is a bidirectional printer sharing package.
This means 
that not only can UNIX print to any shared printer on
a Windows For 
Workgroups network, but any Windows application can
also print to 
a UNIX printer.<P>

This last advantage is possible because NIPRINT uses
LPR/LPD. I have 
only been using NIPRINT for a little over a week, but
so far it is 
performing like a champ. I'm also sure that as time
goes by, many 
other similar products will be released, since, judging
by the phone 
calls I received, there are many, many WFW networks
being established. 
Network Instruments can be contacted at:<P>

<I>Network Instruments, LLC. <br>
P.O. Box 581156 <br>
Minneapolis, MN 55458-1156<br>
Voice: (612) 822-2025<br>
Fax: (612) 825-564</I><P>

Once again, I have really enjoyed talking with everyone

who has called. It's fun to hear and learn about all
of the many projects 
and situations being developed by other professionals.
If you want 
to contact me by e-mail, you can reach me on Compuserve
at 75667,1164. 
I usually check my mail there twice a week.<P>

Thank you.<br>

Dear Editor:<br>

I thought your readers would be interested in knowing
about the upcoming 
USENIX conference for System Administrators, LISA '95.
Feedback on 
the conference is excellent and it has grown tremendously
in the last 
few years.<P>

LISA '95, the 9th USENIX Systems Administration, co-sponsored
by USENIX, 
the UNIX and Advanced Computing Systems Professional
and Technical 
Association, and SAGE, the System Administrators Guild,
will take 
place September 18-22, 1995, in Monterey, California.<P>

Historically, LISA stood for &quot;Large Installation
Systems Administration,&quot; 
back in the days when having a large installation meant
having over 
100 users, over 100 systems, or over one gigabyte of
disk storage. 
Today, the scope of the LISA conference includes topics
of interest 
to system administrators from sites of all sizes and
kinds. What the 
conference attendees have in common is an interest in
solving problems 
that cannot be dealt with simply by scaling up well-understood
solutions 
appropriate to a single machine or a small number of
workstations 
on a LAN.<P>

The theme for this year's conference is &quot;New Challenges,&quot;
which includes 
such emerging issues as integration of non-UNIX and
proprietary systems 
and networking technologies, distributed information
services, network 
voice and video teleconferencing, and managing very
complex networks. 
We are particularly interested in technical papers that
reflect hands-on 
experience, describe fully implemented and freely distributable
solutions, 
and advance the state of the art of system administration
as an engineering 
discipline.<P>

Features of this year's conference include a two-day
tutorial program 
offering up to five tracks of full- and half-day tutorials;
three 
days of technical sessions with two parallel tracks,
one consisting 
of presentations of refereed technical papers, the other
comprising 
invited talks, panels, and Works-in-Progress (WIP) sessions;
and the 
popular Birds-of-a-Feather sessions (BoFs), which are
very informal 
gatherings of attendees interested in a particular topic.
We are soliciting 
submissions for the tutorial track, the refereed technical
papers 
track, and the invited talks track.<P>

Among topics of particular interest for technical papers
this year 
are:<P>

<li>Deployment of new networking technologies<P>

<li>Coping with the commercialization of the internet<P>

<li>Dealing with differences in UNIX implementations --

migration and interoperability among BSD, SVR4, OSF
and others<P>

<li>Integration of UNIX-based with non-UNIX-based and proprietary<P>

<li>systems and networking technologies (Mac, NT and DOS

PCs)<P>

<li>Application of emerging technologies (Mbone, Mosaic)

to system administration<P>

To discuss potential submissions, and for inquiries
regarding the 
content of the conference program, contact the program
co-chairs at 
lisa9chair@usenix.org. Extended (2 - 5 pages) abstracts
are due 1 
May 1995; final papers will be due 1 August 1995.<P>

For more detailed author instructions and a sample extended
abstract, 
send email to lisa9authors@usenix.org or call USENIX
at +1 510 528 
8649.<P>

If you have a topic of general interest to system administrators,

but that is not suited for a traditional technical paper
submission, 
please submit a proposal for a second track presentation
to the invited 
talk (IT) coordinators at &lt;itlisa@usenix.org&gt;.<P>

All details of the conference program, conference registration
fees 
and forms, and hotel discount and reservation information
will be 
available in July, 1995. If you wish to receive registration
materials, 
please contact:<P>

#       Finger doesn't always show &quot;On since&quot; when the
#       user is still logged in.  If the user has been
#       idle, finger shows the minutes &amp; seconds idle.
#       Added a test for &quot;Idle&quot; to catch that.  Also
#       found one acct that had a home phone field.
#       Finger outputs that on a separate line, pushing
#       the &quot;Last logged in&quot; line to the 5th line.  The
#       word &quot;Directory:&quot; appears on the 4th line when
#       that happens.  Added a test to handle that.
#       Finally, changed the &quot;Never logged in&quot; code to
#       collect the names.  After the loop finishes, the
#       names are output in a columnar list.  Looks
#       cleaner that way.
