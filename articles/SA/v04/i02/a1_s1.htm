<H1>Sidebar: Publicly Available Tools</H1><p>
<P>
The number of publicly available tools is large, and
the network administrator 
who is prepared to spend time investigating each of
them is wise. 
Listed here are some of the more popular tools.<P>

As is always the case with publicly available software,
the authors 
of the software make no claims as to its usefulness
(nor do I). As 
the system administrator, you are responsible for verifying
the usefulness 
and risks associated with the software you choose for
your system.<P>

<B>TCPwrapper</B><P>

This is probably one of the best-known tools for adding
logging and 
filtering to most standard services. The tcpwrapper
program 
supports only services that are invoked through inetd,
while 
portmapper is used for RPC services that are invoked
through 
the standard portmapper. The tool was written by a consultant
at Eidhoven 
University in The Netherlands to help determine the
source of some 
cracking activity directed at the University. The collection
of programs 
that make up the TCPwrapper kit can be found by anonymous
ftp 
on FTP.WIN.TUE.NL in the /pub/security directory.<P>

With this package you can monitor and filter incoming
requests for 
the SYSTAT, FINGER, FTP, TELNET, RLOGIN, 
RSH, EXEC, TFTP, TALK, and other network 
services. It supports both 4.3 BSD-style sockets and
System V.4-style 
TLI. <P>

The package provides tiny daemon wrapper programs that
can be installed 
without any changes to existing software or to existing
configuration 
files. The wrappers report the name of the remote host
and of the 
requested service. The wrappers do not exchange information
with the 
remote client process, and impose no overhead on the
actual communication 
between the client and server applications.<P>

Optional features are: access control, to restrict the
systems that 
can connect to your network daemons; remote user name
lookups, with 
the RFC 931 protocol; additional protection against
a host pretending 
to have someone elses host name; additional protection
against a host 
pretending to have someone else's host address.<P>

Early versions of the programs were tested with Ultrix
= 2.2, SunOS 
= 3.4, and ISC 2.2. Later versions have been installed
on a wide variety 
of platforms, including SunOS 4.x and 5.x, Ultrix 3.x
and 4.x, DEC 
OSF/1 T1.2-2, HP-UX 8.x, AIX 3.1.5 up to 3.2., Apollo
SR10.3.5, Sony, 
NeXT, SCO UNIX, DG/UX, Cray, Dynix, and an unknown number
of others.<P>

Requirements are that the network daemons be spawned
by a super-server 
such as the inetd; a 4.3 BSD-style socket programming
interface 
and/or System V.4-style TLI programming interface; and
the availability 
of a syslog(3) library and of a syslogd(8) daemon 
The wrappers should run without modification on any
system that satisfies 
these requirements. Workarounds have been implemented
for several 
common bugs in systems software.<P>

<B>The Swatch Logfile Monitor</B><P>

Swatch is a tool (written in perl) that lets you associate
actions 
with logfile entries. When logfile entries are found,

the administrator can arrange for a command such as
mail, 
finger, etc. to be executed. For example, swatch can

be used to read through the contents of the system syslog

file to filter and report only on information that is
of interest. 
Figure 10 shows a sample configuration file to restrict
information 
from a syslog file.<P>

The configuration file shown in Figure 10 consists of
patterns in 
the same style as perl, and an action to be performed.
In most of 
these examples, the patterns are echo or ignore. Echo

actions print the lines; ignore is self-explanatory.
When 
the swatch program uses this configuration file to examine

the syslog file, the output is similar to that shown
in Figure 11.<P>

The configuration possibilties using swatch are extensive,

and it is a good tool for sort through the contents
of a syslog 
file. The swatch programs can be found on sierra.stanford.edu

in /pub/sources.<P>

<B>tcpdump</B><P>

tcpdump is the best tool available on the Internet for
monitoring 
the traffic on a network. tcpdump prints out the headers
of 
packets on a network interface that match a Boolean
expression. In 
order to build tcpdump, you must also have the libpcap

library from the same ftp site. Sample output of the
tcpdump 
command is shown in Figure 12.<P>

The source code for tcpdump can be found on FTP.EE.LBL.GOV

in /tcpdump-3.0 (as of November 5, 1994).<P>

<B>TAMU</B><P>

The TAMU (Texas A&amp;M University) system is a collection
of 
tools that you can use to build a firewall, or detect
attack signatures. 
The collection includes a set of scripts included that
can be used 
to assess the security of the machines in your network.
The tools 
include drawbridge, an advanced internet filter bridge;
tiger 
scripts, extremely powerful but easy-to-use programs
for securing 
individual hosts; and xvefc (XView Etherfind Client),
a powerful 
distributed network monitor. Be warned that the anonymous
ftp server 
at NET.TAMU.EDU tightly restricts the number of anonymous

ftp users. The directory /pub/security/TAMU contains
the scripts.<P>

<B>COPS</B><P>

COPS, another popular system auditing package, runs
a set 
of programs, each of which checks a different aspect
of security on 
a UNIX system. If potential security holes do exist,
the results are 
either mailed or saved to a report file. COPS provides
extensive 
capabilities; Figure 13 shows a sample report from the
COPS 
tools.<P>

The COPS system can be retrieved from FTP.CERT.ORG,

in the directory /pub/tools/cops.<P>

<B>Crack</B><P>

In Sys Admin vol. 1, no. 1, I presented an article entitled

&quot;How UNIX Password Controls Work.&quot; In this
article I discussed 
the validity of using the password cracking program
as a system administration 
tool. While I am loath to condone their use, I also
feel that if we 
as system administrators don't use the tools at hand
to validate the 
state of our system's security, someone else will use
those tools 
to break that security. A real firewall alleviates the
possibility 
of external attack, but it does not solve the problem
of potential 
threats from internal users.<P>

crack is one of the best-known password cracking programs,

and it can be customized to use your own dictionaries.
crack 
can be found on ftp.cert.org in /pub/tools/crack. 
A good set of alternate dictionaries can be found on
black.ox.ac.uk 
in /ordlists.<P>

<B>Firewall and Security Mailing Lists</B><P>

A number of mailing lists and forums are available on
the topic of 
firewalls, and on security in general. Some are distributed
via electronic 
mail, while others are part of the USENET News System.<P>

There are two major mailing lists for firewalls. One
is hosted by 
greatcircle.com, and the other is hosted by tis.com.

To subscribe to the Great Circle mailing list, send
a message to majordomo@greatcircle.com, 
with the body of the message reading<P>
<PRE>
subscribe firewalls your-email-address</pre><p>
<p>
You can subscribe to the tis.com firewall list, which
focuses 
primarily on using the TIS firewall toolkit, by sending
a message 
to fwall-user-request@tis.com, with the body of your
message 
reading <P>
<PRE>
subscribe fwall-users your-email-address</pre><p>
<p>
In both cases, the messages will start flowing to your
mailbox within 
a day or two.<P>

There are other forums available for the discussion
of security 
in general. These forums are typically part of the USENET
News system, 
and include the news groups comp.security.announce,
comp.security.misc, 
comp.security.unix, and alt.security. <P>
