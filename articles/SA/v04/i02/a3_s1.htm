<H1>Sidebar: How Do Other Operating Systems Treat the Filesystem?</H1><p>
<P>
Often considered one of the most rudimentary of all
operating systems, 
MS-DOS in many places bears a striking resemblance to
UNIX. The simple 
structure of the MS-DOS filesystem resembles that of
S5.<P>

Following the boot block, there is a File Allocation
Table (FAT), 
which serves the same purpose as the inode list. The
remainder of 
the partition consists of data blocks. The size of the
data blocks 
is configurable, but by default is based upon the size
of the drive. 
[Editor's Note: The maximum number of entries the FAT
can hold is 
65,536. Using 2,048-byte blocks, MS-DOS can represent
drives as large 
as 128 megabytes. 4,096-byte blocks represent up to
256 megabyte partitions, 
and 8192-byte blocks go up to 512 megabyte partitions.
Of course, 
smaller partitions may need no more than 1,024-byte
blocks and floppy 
drives or RAM-drives may use 512-byte blocks, making
such a block 
size identical to the sector size. -- Larry Reznick]<P>

OS/2, on the other hand, has two different filesystems
that it 
can use. First, it can adopt the FAT structure of MS-DOS,
but it does 
this primarily for compatibility reasons. Second, it
can use the High 
Performance File System (HPFS). In HPFS, the inodes
are called fnodes, 
and the list is maintained in the center of the disk
instead of at 
the beginning. The remainder of the disk is configured
as data blocks, 
but the blocks are written from the center of the disk
out. Whenever 
a file is requested, the drive head goes immediately
to the center, 
reads the fnode information, then moves slightly in
either direction 
to where the data is stored. This minimizes the seek
time, and because 
the hard drive is the slowest component of any computer,
the access 
time is significantly reduced.  <P>
