<H1>Sidebar: Other Filesystems</H1><p>
<P>
While the primary two filesystems in UNIX are S5 and
UFS, with NFS 
and RFS handling networked partitions, a number of other
filesystems 
are cropping up from vendors. These include:<P>

<B>BFS</B> -- Boot File System contains only the utilities
necessary 
to bring a system up and into operation. Usually used
after a crash, 
it brings up a simple flat filesystem with one directory.<P>

<B>DTFS</B> -- Desk Top File System is a new entry planned
by SCO 
for release in the summer. Currently, SCO offers the
Acer Fast Filesystem 
(AFS) and Extended Acer Fast Filesystem (EAFS). AFS
roughly corresponds 
to S5 and limits filenames to 14 characters in length.
EAFS corresponds 
to UFS, enabling character names up to 255 characters
in length. DTFS 
will include compression and some undelete features,
and is aimed 
at the small disk market, where every byte saved is
a byte earned. <P>

<B>HTFS</B> -- High Throughput File System, another new filesystem

expected to be released by SCO in the summer, will implement
journaling. 
Journaling involves maintaining a record of changes,
rather than actually 
making the changes when they are requested. When the
system slows 
down, or at designated intervals, the journal writes
all the pending 
changes to the disk. An added benefit is that journaling
allows you 
to keep a record of changes, and even back them out,
reverting to 
previous versions of the file.<P>

<B>VFS</B> -- Virtual File System, created by Sun Microsystems
as 
an outgrowth of NFS, provides an interface between the
kernel and 
inode operations independent of the filesystem running.
Such independence 
means that it matters not whether S5 or UFS is the underlying
filesystem, 
since that is completely hidden from the end user and
all applications. 
An interface rather than a filesystem, VFS allows a
number of different 
filesystems to interact with the kernel. FFS (File System
Switch) 
was a similar attempt by AT&amp;T, but it failed to
gain any acceptance 
in the marketplace.  <P>
