<P>
Could there be a hotter topic than firewalls?  In late
December,
the astonishing story of an in-your-face hack into the
home computer of
Tsutomu Shimomura, a noted security expert, made headlines
throughout
the country.  As Bjorn Satdeva points out this month,
the hack, though
reported as new and ingenious, had in fact been identified
as a security
threat some years ago and ways of preventing it are
known.  Still, old
or new, this kind of story is not calculated to gladden
the hearts of
system administrators--if this could happen to someone
who really knows
all the ins and outs, how vulnerable are the rest of
us?<P>

The followup, however, proves that knowing how to dribble
behind
your back doesn't mean you can go one-on-one with Michael
Jordan.  The
story of how Tsutomu Shimomura responded to the attack,
and how that
response resulted in the arrest of cyber-desperado Kevin
D. Mitnick,
makes for better reading than the latest LeCarre.  It
also provides
reassurance to system administrators--however hard the
hackers may be
working to get in, somebody somewhere is working even
harder to figure
out how to keep them out.<P>

By pure serendipity (since this is not our security
issue), we
do have a solid overview of the various types of firewalls,
their
strengths and weaknesses, from Chris Hare this month.
Chris' article
should help you figure out whether or not a firewall
makes sense for
your system, and if so, what kind would do the job for
you.  As many of
you know, Chris is a long-time contributor to Sys Admin;
as it happens,
his career path has brought him to a point where he
really needs to know
about networks and network security.  The spin-off for
us is articles
like this one, as well as the subnetting article in
the January/February
issue.  With network administration looming as an ever
larger component
of system administration, we'll hope that Chris' learning
curve keeps
meshing with our readers'.<P>

On another subject:  we're making our annual pilgrimage
to
UniForum this month.  UniForum '95 takes place in Dallas,
at the Dallas
Convention Center, March 12-16.  Sys Admin will be located
in booth
1645; we'll be handing out copies of the magazine and
will be eager to
meet any of you who are attending.  This is the one
UNIX show that we
attend each year; it's the only opportunity we have
to meet readers face
to face and find out how you think we're doing, so if
you're there,
please do stop by.  You might have a shot at a free
Sys Admin (&quot;System
Administration.  It's a dirty job, but someone said
I had to do it&quot;)
t-shirt.<P>

Sincerely yours,<P>
