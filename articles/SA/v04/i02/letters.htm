Subject: Subnetting: Networking One Piece at a Time.<P>

Editor:<br>

I read with interest the subject article and found it
very well written 
and thorough. I did, however, find what I believe is
an error. On 
page 16, the table showing Network, Broadcast, and Netmask
indicates 
different netmasks for each subnet. I think the netmask
should be 
the same for each subnet and have a value of 255.255.255.192.
Please 
confirm.<P>

Thanks,<br>

<I>Chris Hare responds to this and other messages:<P>

A part of my article, &quot;Subnetting: Networking One
Piece 
at a Time,&quot; in the January/February 1995 issue
of Sys Admin, unfortunately 
created a bit of confusion in one area. On page 12,
in the section 
entitled &quot;Changing the Network,&quot; I should
have stated that 
splitting a class C network into 8 divisions will will
give you 6 
subnets when the restrictions for RFC 950 are applied.
<P>

In addition, I have received two questions from readers

concerning the article. The first one was concerned
with the broadcast 
address.<P>

The broadcast address for each subnet will be different

in order to broadcast only on the hosts in that subnet.
Consider this:</I><P>
<PRE>
delicious.apple.bite    192.1.1.33      Subnet 1
macintosh.apple.bite    192.1.1.34      Subnet 1
spartan.apple.bite      192.1.1.98      Subnet 3</pre><p>
<p>
<I>If you use a common broadcast address for all of these

machines, then the possibility exists that they could
be broadcasting 
unneeded packets. Normally, the broadcast address would
be used only 
to broadcast to the hosts on the same portion of the
network. This 
is why the broadcast addresses are different. <P>

It is not incorrect to use the typical Class C broadcast

address of 192.1.1.255, but it is perhaps less efficient.
Consequently, 
the table on page 16 is incorrect. <P>

The second issue had to do with the netmask and, again,

entailed a correction to the table on page 16. Once
the Class C network 
has been split up, the same netmask is typically used
on all portions. 
(You can however, in some situations, use different
netmasks within 
the same address space!) For the sample network that
I described, 
the netmask is actually 255.255.255.224. This is derived
from Figure 
7. The sample network I created had eight divisions,
and six usable 
subnets. This means that the network portion of the
address is 1110 
0000 binary, or 224 decimal. This makes the netmask
for all of the 
subnets 255.255.255.224.<P>

Given these two points, the table on page 16 should
look 
like this:</I><P>

<PRE>Network         Broadcast       Netmask

N.O.P.32        N.O.P.63        255.255.255.224
N.O.P.64        N.O.P.95        255.255.255.224
N.O.P.96        N.O.P.127       255.255.255.224
N.O.P.128       N.O.P.159       255.255.255.224
N.O.P.160       N.O.P.191       255.255.255.224
N.O.P.192       N.O.P.223       255.255.255.224</pre><p>
<p>
<I>I hope that this will help clarify any confusion that
I 
inadvertently created. I thank all of the people who
submitted their 
comments on this article. I appreciate the feedback.<P>

Subject: Solaris Performance Question<br>

Does anyone have a detailed explanation as to why Solaris
2.3 is no 
faster or even slower than SunOs 4.1.3?<P>

A lot of us are asking this question but have no clear
explanation 
other than &quot;CPU overhead for Security processes&quot;
or &quot;new 
code that has not been optimized&quot; -- pretty vague
explanations.<P>

We have a Sparc LX w/16mb RAM w/SunOS 4.1.3 running
next to a Sparc 
1000 w/128mb RAM w/Sol 2.3 and the Login process, and
general Windows 
performance is slower on the Sparc 1000 than on the
LX. We understand 
Sol2.3 is more complex and not as mature as 4.1.3, but
a little more 
detail on what these performance problems are due to
and when they 
might be fixed would be helpful (Sun, are you listening?).<P>

Are others experiencing the same performance gap? Does
Sol 2.4 solve 
this problem?<P>
