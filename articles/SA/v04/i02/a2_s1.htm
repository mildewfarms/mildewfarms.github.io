<B>Topics in Network Administration</B><P>

<B>Evi Nemeth (Univ. of Colorado) and Trent Hein (XOR Network

Engineering)</B><P>

This course provides guidance on solving very common
network management 
problems that confront system administrators. It includes
advice on 
when and how to use some of the public domain software
that is included 
with the course instructors' new UNIX System Administration
Handbook.<P>

<B>UNIX Security: Threats and Solutions</B><P>

<B>Matt Bishop (Univ. of California at Davis)</B><P>

This course will discuss some threats to UNIX security
and how to 
deal with them. The format of the class will be to analyze
case histories 
in depth, to show what attacks the attackers exploited,
how the systems 
administrators might have closed those loopholes, and
how the intruders 
were discovered. Concepts and mechanisms will be discussed,
as well 
as publicly available tools. This day is divided into
four sections 
each of which focuses on non-network problems.<P>

<B>Sendmail Configuration and DNS Management</B><P>

<B>Rob Kolstad (BSDI) and Tina Darmohray (Great Circle
Associates)</B><P>

This course presents an introduction to the DNS system,
history and 
motivation, configuration and management. It will also
look at how 
to modify, program, and debug sendmail configuration
files.<P>

<B>Tuesday, April 25: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM</B><P>

<B>Topics in System Administration</B><P>

<B>Evi Nemeth (Univ. of Colorado) and Trent Hein (XOR Network

Engineering)</B><P>

This course provides a survey of some key areas that
are of concern 
to many system administrators: Survey of Dial-Up Networking,
USENET 
News in the 90s, Security Tools, Introduction to Sendmail8,
and Policy 
and Politics.<P>

<B>Surfing 2000 Part I: Catching The Wave, An Introduction

to The Internet</B><P>

<B>Amy Kreiling (Univ. of North Carolina) with John Stewart

(Cisco)</B><P>

If you already have a home page, but want or need to
know more, this 
two-day course is just what you need. And, if you don't
know what 
is meant by a home page, then this is the place, too.<P>

<B>UNIX Security Course 2: Threats and Solutions from the
Network 
and Security Challenges in Programs</B><P>

<B>Matt Bishop (Univ. of California at Davis)</B><P>

This course analyzes incidents in which attackers have
tried to gain 
illicit access to UNIX systems. We discuss the attacks
used, why the 
exploited holes existed, how the system administrators
responded, 
and how they closed the holes.<P>

<B>Managing, Hiring, Ethics, and Policy for System Administrators</B><P>

<B>Rob Kolstad (BSDI) and Tina Darmohray (Great Circle
Associates)</B><P>

This course starts with tips and techniques for effective
management 
and hiring of system administrators and effective management
of your 
own time, then moves on to explore ethical and policy
questions that 
shape the work environment for system administrators.<P>

<B>Wednesday, April 26: 8:30 AM to 3:45 PM</B><P>

<B>Practical Perl</B><P>

<B>Tom Christiansen</B><P>

Perl is an excellent programming tool for many challenges,
including 
system management tasks. It has become the programming
language of 
choice for many system administrators because of its
interpretive 
nature and incredibly rich feature set. Perl is a publicly
available 
and highly portable interpreted programming language,
with syntax 
and features that resemble C combined with the best
parts of sh, 
sed, awk, and several other powerful UNIX tools.<P>

<B>Surfing 2000 Part II: Building A Successful World-Wide
Web</B><P>

<B>Amy Kreiling (Univ. of North Carolina) with John Stewart

(Cisco)</B><P>

The first day (Tuesday) helped you learn about all of
the important 
current Internet Discovery and Retrieval Tools. In this
second day, 
you'll get an inside look at the World Wide Web, its
browsers and 
servers.<P>

<B>UNIX Security Course 3: UNIX Security Tools and Internal

Security</B><P>

<B>Dr. Matt Bishop (Univ. of California at Davis) and Rob
Kolstad 
(BSDI)</B><P>

The goal of this course is to assist UNIX security administrators,

and interested users, in locating and using publicly
available programs 
to improve the security of their systems. The class
will compare the 
uses and drawbacks of several different programs, with
an emphasis 
on when to use which.<P>

<B>Constructing Firewalls for Network Security</B><P>

<B>Tina Darmohray (Great Circle Associates)</B><P>

Often, the success of an enterprise depends heavily
on digital communications. 
Until now, the techniques and tools required to secure
a functional 
TCP/IP network have been an art -- acquired only through
trial 
and error. This course presents issues and solutions
surrounding the 
securing of functional internetwork connections and
construction of 
an Internet Firewall.<P>

<B>Saturday, April 29: 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM</B><P>

<B>Four Keys to Professional Advancement: Managing Users;
Managing 
Your Boss; Effective Technical Presentations; Effective
Writing</B><P>


<B>Bill Howell, Rob Kolstad, Alan Paller, and Carolyn Sherman</B><P>

Now, more than ever, raises and promotions go to the
people who are 
good communicators as well as good technicians. If you
are interested 
in improving your communications skills, this four-part
course gives 
you tips and techniques that can help.<P>

<B>The Most Useful Tools For System Administrators: Where
to 
Find Them, How to Use Them</B><P>

<B>Bjorn Satdeva (/sys/admin, inc.)</B><P>

This course is aimed at UNIX system administrators,
and will teach 
a number of different publicly available tools which
will be useful 
in their daily work.<P>

<B>UNIX System and Network Performance Tuning</B><P>

<B>Marcus Ranum, Trusted Information Systems</B><P>

This class is an introduction to the arcane art of performance
tuning 
and benchmarking. Since system tuning is UNIX version
specific, the 
class will focus on providing a strong grounding in
what factors influence 
performance, and how to identify bottlenecks in various
parts of the 
system. <P>
