<B>SunSoft Releases SolarNet PC-X</B><P>

SunSoft, Inc., has released SolarNet PC-X, which provides
LAN-based 
or mobile Microsoft Windows users with point-and-click
access to applications 
running on Solaris and other UNIX systems from within
their Windows 
environment. SolarNet PC-X also provides access to X-based
applications 
and services from Microsoft Windows PCs across dial-up
or LAN-based 
facilities. PC-X can be used by itself or in conjunction
with other 
SolarNet facilities such as PC-NFSpro for Windows. Features
of SolarNet 
PC-X include: point-and-click desktop icons, running
client server 
applications on Windows PCs, and telecommuter and remote
access support.<P>

In addition to the Solaris platform, SolarNet PC-X runs
on other UNIX 
servers, including HP, DEC, and IBM platforms. Pricing
for SolarNet 
PC-X begins at $345 per user and decreases with volume.

<B>Auspex Systems Introduces DataGuard</B><P>

Auspex Systems has introduced DataGuard, which allows
NetServer data 
servers to continue delivering file and data service
to users in the 
event of UNIX operating system or application program
failure. <P>

When a Host Processor on the Auspex NetServer fails,
DataGuard will 
let data service continue without disruption while the
Host Processor 
automatically reboots and restarts UNIX. DataGuard also
allows you 
to install minor operating system releases and new applications
on 
the Host Processor without disrupting NFS service. Host-connected

SCSI devices can be added by halting the Host Processor,
adding the 
device, and rebooting the Host Processor. DataGuard
can reboot the 
Host Processor without operator intervention.<P>

DataGuard is part of the Continuous Data Service (CDS)
program at 
Auspex. The program comprises both technologies and
services designed 
to provide data to networked computer users. Current
elements in the 
CDS program include redundant power capabilities, hot-swappable
drives, 
disk mirroring, fast file system check, and Auspex's
File System Fault 
Recovery.<P>

DataGuard runs on Auspex Systems with HP5, HP6, and
HP7 Host Processors 
and Network Processors. DataGuard costs $15,000 for
the Series 200 
and $25,000 for the Series 500. Site licenses and installed
base upgrades 
are also available. For more information contact Auspex
Systems, 
5200 Great America Pkwy, Santa Clara, CA 95054,
(408) 986-2000; FAX: (408) 986-2020.<P>

<B>NetLabs Upgrades NetLabs/NerveCenter</B><P>

NetLabs has upgraded NetLabs/NerveCenter, a rule-based,
distributed 
application used to correlate and respond to network
events. With 
NetLabs/NerveCenter 2.0, users of HP's OpenView Network
Node Manager 
can expand enterprise-wide management coverage from
5,000 to 80,000 
nodes. NetLabs/NerveCenter 2.0 also includes features
to synchronize 
collected information and managed devices with the OpenView
management 
platform database.<P>

NetLabs/NerveCenter applies a state diagram paradigm
to correlate 
network condition, using event order or persistence
to identify problems 
and filter out events. Automated corrective action can
be sent at 
any point in a detected sequence of events. Managed
devices can be 
categorized by type, location, priority, business function,
or other 
selected characteristics, such as key route, T1 lines,
sales department, 
or workstation. Threshold conditions, poll rates, system
responses, 
or other management criteria can be tailored for each
category. When 
a new device is added to an existing group, NetLabs/NerveCenter
also 
activates all associated management constructs for the
device.<P>

NetLabs/NerveCenter supports HP9000 Series 700 systems
running HP-UX 
9.0 (or later) or Sun SPARCstation systems running Sun
OS 4.1.3 (or 
later) with 32 megabytes of RAM, 200 megabytes of disk
space, and 
a color monitor. An enterprise NetLabs/NerveCenter license
is priced 
at $15,000; the license supports an administrator who
can configure 
the application and an unlimited number of operators
with read-only 
access to the application. A remote NetLabs/NerveCenter
license costs 
$7,500 and supports an administrator and a single operator.

information contact NetLabs, Inc., 4920 El Camino Real,
Los Altos, CA 94022, (415) 961-9500; FAX: (415) 961-9300.<P>

<B>AXENT Announces OmniGuard/EMS</B><P>

AXENT Technologies, Inc., has announced the OmniGuard/Enterprise
Security 
Manager (ESM). OmniGuard/ESM manages data security across
heterogeneous 
client/server environments and is the foundation of
AXENT's OmniGuard, 
a security application that manages, secures, and protects
enterprise-wide, 
client/server systems and data. OmniGuard includes six
integrated 
software modules and supports PCs, PC-LANs, UNIX workstations,
UNIX 
servers, and Open VMS; support is planned for Windows/NT
and IBM MVS. <P>

As the network is evaluated for security risks, OmniGuard/ESM
makes 
recommendations for corrections and updates. Many corrections
can 
be made automatically through ESM's graphical interface.
OmniGuard/ESM 
enforcement assistance includes the following functions:
establish, 
manage, and ensure conformance with security policies;
check systems 
for vulnerabilities such as trap doors, Trojan horses,
or unauthorized 
privileges; provide integrity checks, including anti-viral
protection; 
detect changes to security settings or files; and correct
security 
settings, file attributes, and file access permissions.
OmniGuard/ESM 
also provides users with reports on the security status
of their enterprise 
through bar charts, pie charts, and graphics. Close-up
views of charts 
are accessible through a single mouse-click.<P>

<B>Datametrics Ports ViewPoint</B><P>

Datametrics Systems Corporation has ported ViewPoint,
its real-time 
and historical performance analysis tool, to UNIX. ViewPoint
uses 
client/server technology to detect, analyze, and report
on a range 
of system performance problems. ViewPoint sends data
collected from 
the host system to a PC at user-specified intervals.
This method lets 
system managers offload the overhead from the host to
the PC.<P>

ViewPoint for UNIX supports AT&amp;T 3000, Digital OSF/1,
IBM RS/6000, 
HP-UX, SunOS, SCO x86, Solaris, Sequent, Unisys U6000,
and Amdahl 
UTS platforms. Interfaces are also available for Digital's
POLYCENTERps 
and HP's PCS performance collection software. Features
of ViewPoint 
for UNIX include: AutoAnalyze, which automatically defines
a system 
performance problem for the user, then recommends actions
to correct 
the situation; EventScope, which shows which processes
are using the 
system's resource; Expressions, which lets you store
and build custom 
variables; AutoCorrelate, which isolates the causes
of bottlenecks; 
and Threshold Alarms, which automatically detect problems,
then warn 
of critical conditions via pop-up messages or an alphanumeric
pager.<P>
