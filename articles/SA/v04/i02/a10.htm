<H1>Books: A User's Report</H1><p>
<P>
Elizabeth Zinkann<P>

Once again, there were too many excellent books and
not enough space, 
but I tried to choose some of the best, and present
a selection as 
well. Several outstanding second editions appeared.
The column consists 
of a mixture of some Internet books, two system administration
books, 
a general UNIX book, and the latest on TCP/IP. One of
the Internet 
books is solely for our UK subscribers, and is not sold
here in the 
United States, hence the price of 19.95. This month
I reviewed 
The Internet Yellow Pages, 2nd Ed., by Harley Hahn and
Rick 
Stout; The Internet Companion, 2nd Ed., by Tracy LaQuey,
Foreword 
by Vice President Al Gore; UNIX System Administration
Handbook, 
2nd Ed., by Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, Scott Seebass,
and Trent R. 
Hein; the AIX RS/6000 System and Administration Guide,
by James 
W. DeRoest; The UK Internet Book, by Sue Schofield;
UNIX 
Unleashed, from Sams Publishing; and TCP/IP Illustrated,

Vol. 2: The Implementation, by Gary R. Wright and W.
Richard 
Stevens. I believe that these are some of the most significant
books 
currently available. I hope that you enjoy this month's
selections.<P>

<B><I>The Internet Yellow Pages
Second Edition</I><br>
by Harley Hahn and Rick Stout<br>
Osborne McGraw-Hill<br>
ISBN 0-07-882098-7<br>
$29.95</B><P>

The second edition of this valuable resource approximately
doubles 
the length and the number of entries in the first edition.
(The original 
edition contained 2,400 entries; the second edition
provides over 
5,000 individual entries.) Since Hahn and Stout expanded
this directory 
by so much data, I checked to see exactly what had changed
between 
volumes. I found that they included much more information
(the modifications 
to the Art topic alone are impressive), and they added
approximately 
28 new categories. Subtopics were added to several of
the existing 
topics (Computers grew from eleven to fifteen subtopics,
with Multimedia 
and computer companies at the forefront of new information),
and some 
of the existing topics were reorganized (for example,
Pets became 
the more inclusive Animals/Pets, and Programming evolved
from an independent 
entry to a subtopic of Computers). Among the new subjects
are Disabilities, 
Role-Playing, Energy, Kids, Museums, Women, Genealogy,
Zines, Real 
Estate, Parties/Entertainment, Crafts, Families/Parenting,
and Comic 
Books.<P>

The authors retained the organizational structure of
the first edition, 
along with the humorous sidebars, the imaginative artwork
(I believe 
the artists responsible are Leslee Bassin, Helena Worsley,
and Marla 
Shelasky), and the information pertaining to each entry.
The preamble 
to the directory itself includes an introduction to
the second edition, 
the introduction to the original edition, a how-to section
called 
&quot;The Internet and This Book,&quot; which offers
some tips on using 
the Internet with this directory, and the Acknowledgments.
(The aforementioned 
sections total approximately six pages; skipping any
of it will only 
deprive the reader of several smiles, a few laughs,
and some useful 
information.)<P>

This book (the original edition) has been my favorite
resource for 
the Internet. I only keep a few Internet books close
enough to my 
computer to access at a moment's notice. I use this
one often. (I 
also reference Hahn and Stout's The Internet Complete
Reference 
frequently.) The organization of the book allows the
reader easy and 
immediate access to information, the entries are all
free, and the 
book provides Usenet newsgroups in a separate listing.
The Index remains 
a valuable resource for entries the reader cannot find
either by perusal 
or by reviewing the table of contents, as well as for
entries the 
reader needs to find immediately. Hahn and Stout's The
Internet 
Yellow Pages, 2nd Ed., is an extraordinary resource
and an indispensable 
guide for any Internet user, whether casual or serious.<P>

<B><I>The Internet Companion
A Beginner's Guide to Global Networking
Second Edition</I><br>
by Tracy LaQuey<br>
Foreword by Vice President Al Gore<br>
Addison Wesley <br>
ISBN 0-201-40766-3<br>
$12.95</B><P>

The Internet reflects the people who use it -- it continuously

changes. To help the user keep pace with these changes,
author Tracy 
LaQuey has modified the best-selling The Internet Companion.

One of the first books published about the Internet,
this highly readable 
and often intriguing volume has expanded in size (from
4&quot; by 8&quot; to 
5 1/4&quot; by 8 1/4&quot;) and length (from 196 to
262 pages). A comparison 
of chapters between the original and the second edition
showed that 
each section had expanded in some way, and one former
topic (&quot;UNIX 
on the Internet: A Survival Guide&quot;) had become
a chapter. Even 
the foreword by the Vice President has been revised,
and many new 
real-life examples of the Internet in action have been
added.<P>

The Internet Companion remains one of my favorite books
on 
this topic and is never further than six inches from
my keyboard. 
I not only appreciate LaQuey's gentle introductions
to topics and 
her technical expertise, but also enjoy the Internet
anecdotes interspersed 
throughout the book. The revised version is a most welcome
addition 
to my Internet bookshelf.<P>

<B><I>UNIX System Administration Handbook
Second Edition<br>
by Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, Scott Seebass, and Trent R. Hein<br>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-151051-7<br>
$48.00<br>
CD-ROM Included</i></B><I><P>

The second edition of &quot;the yellow book&quot; (now
red) covers what 
every UNIX system administrator should know and be able
to do. This 
is not a book about theoretical concepts: instead, The
UNIX System 
Administration Handbook presents practical material
in a hands-on 
manner, using examples, horror stories, and solutions.
Nemeth, Snyder, 
Seebass, and Hein describe different aspects of administration
as 
they actually exist; they do not attempt to either oversimplifly
or 
complicate the tasks a system administrator must perform.<P>

The book covers six operating systems: Solaris 2.4,
HP-UX 9.0., IRIX 
5.2, SunOS 4.1.3, DEC's OSF/1 2.0, and BSD/OS 1.1. The
first three 
are derived from AT&amp;T UNIX, while the latter three
resemble Berkeley 
UNIX. The book is divided into three sections: Basic
Administration, 
Networking, and Bunch o'Stuff. Basic Administration
furnishes the 
fundamental information a system administrator needs
to run a standalone 
UNIX system. Since UNIX networking presents one of the
most difficult 
aspects of system administration, the authors not only
discuss the 
UNIX system protocols and the techniques utilized in
designing, installing, 
and maintaining a UNIX network, but also address networking
software, 
including the Domain Name System (DNS), the Network
File System (NFS), 
and sendmail. The section entitled Bunch o'Stuff covers
a variety 
of topics: Usenet news, Printing and Imaging, Disk Space
Management, 
Hardware Maintenance, Accounting, Performance Analysis,
Unix to Unix 
Copy (UUCP), Daemons, and Policy and Politics. (The
last chapter quickly 
became a favorite; it provides ethical solutions, some
real-life problems, 
as well as some humor.) The CD-ROM contents are well-documented,
and 
directions for mounting it and accessing the programs
are extremely 
clear.<P>

Nemeth, Snyder, Seebass, and Hein have outdone themselves
with this 
new edition. They have revised the information, included
new topics, 
and provided necessary tools on the CD-ROM. The authors
give practical 
advice for current problems, address the most difficult
and demanding 
issues, and illustrate a myriad of tasks that system
administrators 
must face daily. The UNIX System Administration Handbook
is 
well-written and bespeaks the thorough knowledge of
the authors at 
the turn of every page. No UNIX system administrator
should be without 
this book.<P>

<B><I>AIX RS/6000 System and Administration Guide</I><br>
by James W. DeRoest<br>
J. Ranade Workstation Series<br>
McGraw-Hill<br>
ISBN 0-07-036439-7<br>
$39.95</B><P>

Information for the AIX system administrator has been
extremely limited, 
consisting essentially of the cumbersome AIX manuals
that accompany 
the system, additional IBM documentation, bits and pieces
from other 
books, and a few periodicals. AIX administrators have
not enjoyed 
the luxury of other system administrators, who can simply
choose a 
supplementary text from any bookstore. This book covers
AIX up to 
the 3.2.5 release. (In the preface, the author mentions
the difficulty 
in writing about a current release; as he developed
the book, three 
releases were announced.)<P>

DeRoest divides the text into eight separate sections.
Parts 1, 2, 
and 3 -- System Administration Tasks and Tools, System
Installation 
and Operation, and System Configuration and Customization,
respectively 
-- explain basic tools, installation and maintenance,
daily procedures, 
and configuration for tapes, disks, file systems, terminals,
modems, 
and printers. Part 4, Network Configuration and Customization,
examines 
the use of TCP/IP, UUCP, the Network File system (NFS),
the Network 
Computing System, and System Network Architecture (SNA)
with AIX. 
System Services and Resources, Part 5, discusses how
AIX implements 
Process Management, Electronic Mail, News, DOS Services,
and X11 Administration. 
The sixth section, Users and Security, includes user
environment management, 
auditing and security, and system accounting. The next
section, System 
Tuning and Recovery, considers backup utilities, system
monitoring 
and tuning, and problem analysis and recovery. The final
section, 
Distributed Systems, features clustering and network
archiving. The 
two appendices provide email lists and ftp sites plus
sample 
code. DeRoest also furnishes a bibliography.<P>

AIX RS/6000 System and Administration Guide fills a
void in 
the publishing area. DeRoest's organization represents
a logical, 
step-by-step approach to AIX administration. His writing
style is 
readable, often humorous, and designed to provide an
easily accessible 
resource for AIX system administrators, developers,
and users. Every 
AIX system administrator should possess, read, and use
this book. 
It is an excellent, and long-awaited, reference.<P>

<B><I>The UK Internet Book</I><br>
by Sue Schofield<br>
Addison-Wesley<br>
ISBN 0-201-42766-4<br>
19.95</B><P>

Although this book specifically addresses the UK Internet,
Schofield 
offers a casual, straightforward approach to a topic
that is confusing 
for many users. The simple caption by the artwork introducing

the preface emphasizes the truth: &quot;Don't expect
this book to turn 
you into an Internet expert overnight&quot; (page ix).<P>

Frequently, books are bought and sold with just that
expectation, 
in a manner reminiscent of late-night television commercials
and diets. 
(&quot;Buy this potato peeler and you will become a
gourmet chef by 
morning&quot; or &quot;Purchase this exercise equipment
and lose sixty-three 
pounds in an hour.&quot; You don't even have to use
the item: just 
buy it.) Many of the Internet books appear to make the
same claim: 
the buyer of the book doesn't even have to read the
book; just 
purchase it and the knowledge is automatically his or
hers. The 
UK Internet Book makes no such claims and often reminds
the reader 
of reality: &quot;You won't become a Network Guru by
reading this chapter&quot; 
(page 21).<P>

Schofield describes Internet Basics, Internet Tools,
the Finale, and 
Appendices. She presents more appendices than chapters
(chapters, 
12; appendices, 14).<P>

The introduction, Internet Basics, presents an overview,
software, 
and how the Internet really works, if the reader is
interested. Part 
2, Internet Tools, is the heart of the book: it covers
Electronic 
Mail, Network News, Telnet, Archie, FTP, Gopher, and
the World Wide 
Web. The Finale, section 3, describes &quot;A brief
history of crime&quot; 
and &quot;Internet past, present, and future.&quot;
Among the Appendices 
are &quot;All about modems,&quot; &quot;Getting started
with an Internet 
provider,&quot; &quot;Getting started with Macs or Amiga
computers,&quot; 
a list of UK access providers as of 30 June 1994, email
abbreviations, 
and glossaries for both telecommunications and Internet
terms.<P>

A new edition of this book, &quot;Revised for '95,&quot;
is scheduled 
to be released shortly. I reviewed the original edition.
The UK 
Internet Book is currently the best-selling Internet
book in the 
UK. The new edition, according to author Sue Schofield,
will include 
both new chapters and trouble-shooting appendices, and
a PC/Mac/Amiga 
disk containing over 3Mb of Internet information accessible
without 
an Internet account. The new edition will also contain
an updated 
UK Internet provider list, a complete Usegroups and
Listservs reference, 
details about anonymous servers, and World Wide Web
pages and sites.<P>

The UK Internet Book is a well-written guide to the
Internet. 
Schofield presents the information in an organized,
unhurried manner. 
(She explains the topics so well that the reader actually
learns more 
than he or she realizes. I even learned where to telnet
for 
an IRC link to the UK.) The book also offers several
discounts for 
UK readers. Although the book is not sold in the United
States, it 
discusses the elements of the Internet very well and
really could 
be considered an international book, minus the UK offers.
I would 
recommend this book (and have) to any UK Internet user
as a valuable 
beginning text and an invaluable reference.<P>

<B><I>UNIX Unleashed</I><br>
Sams Publishing<br>
ISBN 0-672-30402-3<br>
$49.99<br>
CD-ROM Included</B><P>

The fifth book in the &quot;Unleashed&quot; series,
UNIX Unleashed 
proves worthy of its inclusion. (For the reader's information,
the 
others were CorelDRAW!4 Unleashed, The Internet Unleashed,

NetWare Unleashed, and FoxPro 2.6 for Windows Unleashed.)

Fifteen knowledgeable UNIX authors collaborated to share
their individual 
expertise with the reader. Several things strike the
browser at first 
glance: the welcome quick reference card (which really
is easily 
detachable), the book's format, which is both easily
readable and 
describes the topics in short, solution-finding sections,
and the 
use of examples throughout the book to pragmatically
demonstrate concepts.<P>

On closer perusal, the reader discovers that every type
and level 
of UNIX user, from novice through system administrator,
is addressed 
in an individual section. In each category users encounter
knowledge 
a step beyond their current comfort level: ideas to
learn beyond today's 
lessons. <P>

UNIX Unleashed divides the topics into eight parts.
The introductory 
section, Finding Your Way Around UNIX, provides the
beginner with 
fundamental concepts, a tutorial, the UNIX file system,
popular tool, 
text editors, traversing the network, and communicating
with others. 
Part 2, The Hunt for Shells, examines the Bourne, Korn,
and C shells 
and also evaluates and compares the shells. In Part
3, Programming, 
the authors discuss three languages: awk, a pattern
matching 
and processing language; perl, a programming language
with 
C language constructs and the interpretation and execution
of shell 
scripts; and the C programming language. Part 4, Process
Control, 
looks at processes, while part 5, Text Formatting and
Printing, investigates 
nroff/troff, tbl, eqn, pic, grap, 
and macros. Part 6, Advanced File Utilities, details
archiving, backups, 
and source control using the Source Code Control System
(SCCS) and 
the Revision Control System (RCS). Part 7 describes
System Administration, 
from UNIX installation, daily procedures, and file system
and user 
administration to performance monitoring, device administration,
and 
security. The final section, UNIX Flavors and Graphical
User Interfaces, 
begins with a look at the different varieties of UNIX
(flavors), and 
different graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for both
end users and 
programmers. The appendix furnishes instructions for
installing the 
CD-ROM and a table of contents identifying the program
name, location 
on the disc, and a description of the program.<P>

Although the chapters were written individually by different
authors, 
UNIX Unleashed has an orderly and cohesive style. The
text 
flows easily, as if one author were responsible for
the entire book. 
It is clearly written, the expertise of the authors
is evident, and 
the resulting book is outstanding. UNIX Unleashed, whether

used as a learning tool or a resource, is one of the
most useful UNIX 
texts available today.<P>

<B><I>TCP/IP Illustrated
Volume 2: The Implementation</I><br>
by Gary R. Wright and W. Richard Stevens<br>
Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series<br>
ISBN 0-201-63354-X<br>
$52.75</B><P>

The long-awaited and eagerly anticipated TCP/IP Illustrated,
Vol. 
2, is here. Volume 1 discussed the protocols; Volume
2 features 
the implementation of TCP/IP. Using the 4.4BSD-Lite

(Berkeley Software 
Distribution) release, Wright and Stevens detail the
implementation 
and present the entire source code for the kernel implementation
of 
TCP/IP, which totals approximately 15,000 lines of C
code. The audience 
that Volume 2 addresses includes anyone interested in
the TCP/IP protocols 
implementation. Wright and Stevens assume the reader
has a basic understanding 
of TCP/IP protocols (Volume 1 will assist anyone deficient
in this 
area) and a fundamental knowledge of operating system
principles. 
Although the authors do not emphasize this requirement,
the reader 
will benefit from some C language and data structures
knowledge.<P>

The underlying organization of the book is presented
graphically in 
the preface, on page __. In place of the usual cube
representation 
of the TCP/IP protocol suite, the diagram shows the
protocols and 
subsystems in a genealogical tree relationship. Wright
and Stevens 
explain TCP/IP with layers equivalent to generations,
beginning with 
the data link layer and progressing to the network layers
(IP, ICMP, 
IGMP, IP routing, and multicast routing), the socket
layer, and the 
transport layer (UDP, TCP, and raw IP). Since the source
code contains 
many functions and the functions appear in various places,
the authors 
use the inside back covers to present a directory indexing
the different 
functions. Wright and Stevens display the code in a
consistent manner, 
and make it as easy to read as possible. They provide
a great deal 
of information pertaining to the code, including bugs
(noting and 
discussing the bugs as they appear), and they occasionally
furnish 
comments from the original authors. Each chapter also
includes graphical 
representations of the data structures employed by the
source code 
and how these and other data structures used by TCP/IP
and the kernel 
interact. Since different types of readers will come
at the book in 
different ways, Wright and Stevens furnish both cross-references
and 
forward and backward references, in addition to the
index.<P>

Wright and Stevens teach the implementation in a practical
way that 
does not overwhelm the reader nor oversimplify the subject.
They focus 
on a set of source code in each chapter and detail how
it works. While 
the chapters are related, each can also be read as a
standalone unit. 
This allows the reader to either concentrate on a specific
area or 
progress step-by-step. Each chapter concludes with a
summary and a 
set of exercises. (For the reader's benefit, most of
the exercise 
solutions appear in Appendix A.) The chapters on memory
buffers, IP 
multicasting, and, particularly, the sockets (Socket
Layer, Socket 
I/O, Socket Options, and Routing Sockets) will be extremely
popular 
and well-used. The authors also explore 4.4BSD-Lite's
newest features, 
including long fat pipe support, window scale, and timestamp
options. 
In addition to exercise solutions, appendices include
Source Code 
Availability (it is occasionally helpful to have the
source code online) 
and RFC 1122 Compliance.<P>

TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2: The Implentation is a

thorough, readable, logical, and very well-organized
text on TCP/IP. 
The many figures and diagrams throughout the book help
the reader 
understand the concepts being discussed. This book is
an essential 
addition to any computer professional's library. <P>
