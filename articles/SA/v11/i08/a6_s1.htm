            <h1>DShield Principles
              <p> 
            </h1>
            DShield.org's system was designed to be fast and scalable and 
            to include a wide range of sensors. The initial challenge was to define 
            the lowest data fidelity considered valuable to the system. We chose 
            to focus only on very basic TCP/IP header information: date and time 
            with one-second resolution, source and target IP and ports, protocol 
            and flags. This allowed DShield.org to include a number of non-IDS 
            packages, such as personal firewalls. While we lose some valuable 
            information from other systems, such as IP and TCP options and packet 
            content, we gain a large number of additional sensors. Also, the amount 
            of data that has to be processed is reduced, allowing for a more agile 
            system while increasing the number of sensors.
            <p> From the beginning, DShield.org rejected relying on signature-based 
              recognition at the client. This would have significantly complicated 
              integrating new IDS packages, as each one uses its own set of signatures 
              and its own set of labels for any of the thousand or more different 
              attacks these packages recognize.
            <p> We also decided not to issue any specific guidelines for users 
              as to what event to submit or not to submit. Any such guideline 
              would introduce a bias into the data and could skew it. Instead, 
              if asked, DShield.org recommends the submission of any event perceived 
              as "irregular" or "hostile" by the user.
