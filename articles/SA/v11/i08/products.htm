            <p> <b>Cypress Releases USB Host Controller Driver for Linux</b>
            <p> Cypress Semiconductor Corporation recently released its Linux 
              USB host driver supporting the SL811HS embedded host/peripheral 
              controller. According to the company, this driver can provide Linux 
              developers the ability to add USB host functionality to a variety 
              of embedded system applications, such as cell phones, MP3 players, 
              network appliances, and PDAs. Currently, the Linux 2.44 kernel supports 
              the Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) and the Universal Host 
              Controller Interface (UHCI) specifications for USB host controllers. 
              Since Cypress's SL811HS is a memory-mapped device, the release 
              of this new driver allows the Linux host stack to provide USB host 
              support without realizing that there is a non-OHCI/UHCI type host 
              controller, which can help engineers to bring their products to 
              market more quickly.
            <p> The Linux USB 2.0 driver and source code are available now. To 
              download the source code, visit: http://www.cypress.com/press/linux.
