            <p>The articles in this issue describe various tools and techniques 
              for detecting whether your system has been cracked, and if so, what 
              to do. A common thread throughout these articles is that much can 
              be learned from analyzing the features of these attacks.</p>
            <p> One of the articles in particular ("Administering a Distributed 
              Intrusion Detection System" by Johannes B. Ullrich and Wayne 
              Larmon) describes the efforts of Dshield.org (<b>http://www.dshield.org</b>), 
              an organization that assembles and analyzes detection log data from 
              networks all over the world. Dshield.org then studies this data 
              for unusual activity in an attempt to identify sites that may be 
              participating in Internet attacks.
            <p> Another security organization, the Honeynet Project, is taking 
              a different approach to analyzing attacks. After one of its own 
              Honeynet systems was compromised, the Honeynet Project issued a 
              public challenge to examine the binary that had been installed. 
              According to the Web site, the goal of this "Reverse Challenge", 
              which was issued in May, is "to allow incident handlers around 
              the world to all look at the same binary -- a unique tool captured 
              in the wild -- and to see who can dig the most out of the tool 
              and communicate what they've found in a concise manner." 
              The mission for participants is to identify the purpose of the tool, 
              describe how it works, and to show their methods of analysis. The 
              results of the challenge were not available at press time, but can 
              be found at <b>http://project.honeynet.org/</b>.
            <p> Honeynets in general are systems set up specifically in the hope 
              that "blackhats" will attempt to crack them so that security 
              experts can then observe the crackers' methods. According to 
              the Honeynet Project's Web site, the goals of this volunteer-based 
              organization are to raise awareness of threats and vulnerabilities 
              that exist in the Internet today, to provide information to better 
              secure and defend resources, and to teach and provide the technology 
              and methods of information gathering. Some of the methods and technology 
              that have been learned through the Project's efforts can be 
              found in the book <i>Know Your Enemy: Revealing the Security Tools, 
              Tactics, and Motives of the Blackhat Community</i> by The Honeynet 
              Project (Addison-Wesley, 2001). Lance Spitzner, one of the book's 
              co-authors and a Honeynet Project founder, has another book coming 
              out. It's called <i>Honeypots: Tracking Hackers</i> and will 
              be available in September from Addison-Wesley. Good luck keeping 
              those "blackhats" at bay.

            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
