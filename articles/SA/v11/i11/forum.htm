            <p> This month's theme is interoperability, and several of the 
              articles in this issue provide solutions to cross-platform problems. 
              In the feature article, Ralf Engelschall (who has long been involved 
              in the development of open source software, such as Apache mod_ssl, 
              GNU Shtool, OpenSSL, and OSSP) and his co-authors describe a robust, 
              cross-platform software packaging tool called OpenPKG. Brian Gollsneider 
              has written a follow-up to his multi-booting article published last 
              year in <i>Sys Admin</i>. In this month's article, Gollsneider 
              provides new information about multi-booting Windows 2000, Windows 
              98, Solaris 8, and Red Hat 7.3. In other articles, Nathan Yocom 
              shows how the GPL'd pGina tool can provide PAM-like authentication 
              and facilitate adding Windows clients to your UNIX environment, 
              and Brent Bice explains how to use the net-snmp agent for monitoring 
              your UNIX systems.
            <p> A different type of cross-platform tool was released in the spring 
              of 2002 -- it's the <i>Universal Command Guide: For Operating 
              Systems</i> by Guy Lotgering and the Universal Command Guide Training 
              Team. This 1600-page book, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, is 
              a comprehensive command reference book. It contains more than 8,000 
              commands (and more than 57,000 options) from various operating systems, 
              such as UNIX, Linux, Windows, Mac 9.1 (but not OS X), and DOS. Not 
              all flavors of UNIX are covered -- HP-UX and Tru64 are notably 
              absent -- however, the book is well organized and well indexed, 
              and to my knowledge no other book has attempted to organize so many 
              commands in this way. The UCG team provides lots of usage examples 
              and cross-references each command. The book also comes with a CD-ROM 
              containing the UCG finder, which allows the user to type in a command 
              and request its equivalent for a different system. The UCG finder 
              tool can also be accessed (for free) on the team's Web site 
              at: <b>http://www.allcommands.com</b>. This book is a great reference 
              tool -- especially for beginning admins. 
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
