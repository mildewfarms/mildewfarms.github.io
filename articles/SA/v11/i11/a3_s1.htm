            <h1><b>Licensing and TCO</b></h1>
            <p> This setup will not get you out of licensing any client products, 
              such as word processing software, that you may use on the server 
              side. You will still need to purchase the same number of licenses 
              for the products you use.
            <p> Terminal services requires its own special license per user apart 
              from the CAL that you have to purchase for any client connecting 
              to a Microsoft server. The money savings is not in licensing (unless 
              you consider that you won't also be buying an operating system 
              for your client computers), but in the fact that you can use older 
              hardware that is defunct by today's standards.
            <p> Hundreds of support hours and dollars will also be saved in trying 
              to find drivers for components that are replaced on the client machines. 
              As long as your hardware is on the Linux HCL, run kudzu, and you're 
              ready to go.
