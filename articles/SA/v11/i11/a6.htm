            <h1><b><img src="../../resource/questions.gif" width="150" height="150" align="right">Questions 
              and Answers</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I found the following line in 
              /etc/system on my Sun E3500:
            <p> 
            <pre>
set snooping=1
</pre>
            <p>I'm not really sure what this is for, but it looks pretty 
              suspicious. Does this mean that I've been hacked and that someone 
              is snooping everything that goes out of and comes into the machine?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The <b>snooping</b> parameter 
              in /etc/system is not for <b>snooping</b> traffic flowing through 
              the machine. Setting <b>snooping</b> to true (1) turns on the deadman 
              timer and is used to try to force a drop to the <b>ok</b> prompt 
              when the system hangs hard. At that point, you generally do a sync 
              to get a core dump for someone to dissect. This parameter is probably 
              set in /etc/system because of some issue with the system hanging 
              without crashing sometime in the past. This is a common request 
              made by Sun support to help in debugging such situations. I hope 
              you're doing some sort of checksumming on your system files, 
              so you can verify when this change was made if you do not remember 
              making it yourself.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm setting up several servers 
              in various parts of the country for one client. Each server will 
              be hosting its own domain, including Web, email, ftp, etc. I was 
              wondering how best to configure DNS for these machines. Should one 
              machine be master and all the rest slaves, or should each machine 
              be master for its own domain and slaves for the others?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Depending on the number of machines, 
              there are tradeoffs with whichever method you choose. How many machines 
              are there (4, 10, 50+)? For a large number of machines, making each 
              the master for its own domain can be an administrative nightmare 
              -- especially if all of your IT people are centralized in one 
              place and changes must be made to each machine individually. It 
              also makes it harder to keep track of the changes made if you're 
              using any sort of revision control. On the other hand, if there's 
              one master machine and the rest are slaves, then you run the risk 
              of the master being down when the DNS information for one of the 
              slaves needs to be updated immediately.
            <p> There's also a point of diminishing returns when you keep 
              adding slave servers. If any one of your authoritative hosts is 
              corrupted, there's a good chance that that server will be queried 
              and you'll lose traffic. It's better to have a few really 
              reliable servers than many semi-reliable servers.
            <p> If you're setting up a medium number of machines, you could 
              keep a centralized master zone file directory on one machine and 
              then use some automated job to push the zone files out to all other 
              machines. Each machine would only load its own master zone file 
              when starting named and just ignore the rest. This would allow you 
              to centralize the administration and still have each machine be 
              its own master. It would also allow you to have the master zone 
              files on all of your machines in case you were to lose one machine 
              out of the bunch. It would be fairly trivial to modify one of the 
              remaining machines to be the new master for the domain of the downed 
              machine. Depending on your environment, though, this may be more 
              of a headache than it's worth.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to compile an 
              application from a third-party vendor, but I'm getting errors 
              with gcc. The compile keeps complaining about having unrecognized 
              options such as <b>-Xc</b> and <b>-Kpic</b>. Am I missing a library 
              or do I have a corrupt gcc installation?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> These are options to Sun's 
              C compiler, not gcc.
            <p> <b>-Xc</b> -- Maximally conforming ANSI/ISO C, without K&amp;R 
              C compatibility extensions. The compiler issues errors and warnings 
              for programs that use non-ANSI/ISO C constructs.
            <p> <b>-Kpic</b> -- Produces position-independent code for use 
              in shared libraries. Each reference to a global datum is generated 
              as a de-reference of a pointer in the global offset table. Each 
              function call is generated in pc-relative addressing mode through 
              a procedure linkage table. In later versions of the Sun compiler, 
              this is equivalent to <b>-xcode=pic13</b> (<b>-KPIC</b> is equivalent 
              to <b>-xcode=pic32</b>).
            <p> 
            <p> I'm guessing that you're using a makefile that was generated 
              by imake for use with Sun's C. If so, you can fix your Openwindows 
              configuration to use gcc instead of cc. Edit /usr/openwin/lib/config/site.def 
              and uncomment these sections by removing the surrounding <b>/* */</b> 
              characters:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#ifndef HasGcc2
#define HasGcc2 YES
#endif

#ifndef HasCplusplus
#define HasCplusplus YES
#endif
</pre>
            Also uncomment and change <b>#define PreIncDir</b> to be the location 
            of your gcc include files. For a Solaris 8 machine running 2.95.3, 
            it should look something like:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#define PreIncDir /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/2.95.3/include/
</pre>
            After making these changes to /usr/openwin/lib/config/site.def, also 
            edit /usr/openwin/lib/config/sun.cf and comment out (using <b>/*</b> 
            and <b>*/</b>) the <b>HasSunC</b> and <b>CCompilerMajorVersion</b> 
            directives:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/*
#define HasSunC YES
#define CCompilerMajorVersion 4
*/
</pre>
            And define <b>HasSunC</b> as NO:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#define HasSunC NO
</pre>
            Finally, add the following lines to the top of /usr/openwin/lib/config/Imake.tmpl:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#define LdPreLib -L$(BUILDLIBDIR) -R$(BUILDLIBDIR)
#define LdPreLib -L$(USRLIBDIR) -R$(USRLIBDIR)
#define LdPostLib -L$(USRLIBDIR) -R$(USRLIBDIR)
</pre>
            You can now use <b>xmkmf</b> to generate the proper makefile for use 
            with gcc.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just upgraded to bind 
              9.2.1 on my FreeBSD 4.6-STABLE machine, and I'm trying to use 
              <b>rndc</b>. I edit my zone file, change the serial number, and 
              issue an <b>rndc reload</b> command. Even though named is running, 
              I receive a connection refused error. It works fine if I just HUP 
              the daemon instead of using <b>rndc</b>, however. Is there some 
              new syntax that I should be using that I can't find in the 
              docs?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Check for the following line 
              in /etc/rndc.conf:
            <p> 
            <pre>
default-server localhost
</pre>
            If you have the name <b>localhost</b> there instead of the IP 127.0.0.1, 
            you may be having issues because the /etc/hosts entry or the DNS entry 
            for <b>localhost</b> maps to both the IPv4 (127.0.0.1) and IPv6 (::1) 
            loopback addresses. If you don't have IPv6 fully operational, 
            this can cause "network unreachable" or "connection 
            refused" error messages. To make sure that bind does not try 
            to connect to the IPv6 loopback interface, replace the above configuration 
            line with:
            <p> 
            <pre>
default-server 127.0.0.1
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running Solaris 8, and we 
            have a series of shell scripts that take a very long time to run. 
            Basically, a large file of file names is read in and an action is 
            performed on each file listed. I don't want to run the shell 
            scripts with <b>-x</b> because I don't want to slow them down 
            any more, and I don't need <i>all</i> of the output, but I do 
            occasionally want to check and see where the program is in its execution. 
            Is there any way to occasionally take a peek at the progress of the 
            shell script (how far it's gotten through the list of file names) 
            after it's already running?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Since your data is pretty unique, 
              it should be fairly trivial to tell where you are in your data file 
              by attaching <b>truss</b> to the PID of the running shell script:
            <p> 
            <pre>
truss -p &lt;PID&gt;
</pre>
            From the <b>truss</b> man page:
            <p> -p Interprets the command arguments to truss as a list of process-ids 
              for existing processes (see ps(1)) rather than as a command to be 
              executed. truss takes control of each process and begins tracing 
              it provided that the userid and groupid of the process match those 
              of the user or that the user is a privileged user. Processes may 
              also be specified by their names in the /proc directory, for example, 
              /proc/12345.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> One of our FreeBSD 4.6-STABLE 
              machines recently crashed hard. The root filesystem and a concatenated 
              vinum RAID volume were damaged. I was able to <b>fsck</b> the root 
              partition and comment out the vinum partition and get the machine 
              back up. I can't seem to get the vinum partition back online, 
              though. When I try to <b>fsck</b> the partition, it tells me that 
              the superblock is unreadable. Is there any hope of getting my data 
              back?
            <p> Here's the output of vinum dumpconfig:

</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Since one of your subdisks is listed 
            as crashed and your plex is just a concatenation (not a RAID 5), you 
            should consider your data damaged and restore from backup. If you 
            want to try and salvage what's on the disk, you can try the following:
            <p> Boot up the machine and have vinum start, but don't try to 
              mount the damaged partition (I think you've already gotten 
              this far). Then turn off logging for that plex:
            <p> 
            <pre>
vinum setdaemon 4
</pre>
            Set the states of the damaged subdisk and plex to "up":
            <p> 
            <pre>
/sbin/vinum setstate up incompetence.p0.s0
/sbin/vinum setstate up incompetence.p0
</pre>
            You can now try to <b>fsck</b> the raw device and see whether there 
            are any errors:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/sbin/fsck /dev/vinum/incompetence
</pre>
            If the disk appears clean, turn logging back on, and do an explicit 
            save of the configuration:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/sbin/vinum setdaemon 1
/sbin/vinum saveconfig
</pre>
            At this point, you can try to reboot and see whether the subdisk and 
            plex are still listed as up when doing a:
            <p> 
            <pre>
vinum l
</pre>
            If so, uncomment your partition and try another reboot. If you do 
            manage to get the machine back up, I'd obviously suggest doing 
            a backup right away.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've installed a number of 
              Solaris x86 servers for our external Web cluster. Now we need another 
              package off the Software 1 of 2 CD-ROM, but I can't seem to 
              get it to mount on any of the servers. I can get any other HSFS 
              CD-ROM to mount just fine, and I can also boot off the problem CD-ROM 
              ok, so I don't think it's a hardware issue. Is there a 
              trick to getting the packages off the CD-ROM after you've already 
              done an install? I've never had this issue with the SPARC versions 
              of the operating system.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Ideally, you'll let vold 
              handle mounting the disk for you. If you haven't installed 
              vold for security reasons (you did say these were publicly accessible 
              servers), then you can still mount the CD-ROM by hand. There's 
              a legacy layout design on the CD-ROM that makes it a bit different 
              from normal HSFS CD-ROMs that you try to mount. Instead of being 
              able to mount one of the slices directly, you have to mount it with 
              the following command:
            <p> 
            <pre>
mount -r -F hsfs /dev/dsk/c0t6d0p0 /mnt
</pre>
            The c0t6d0p0 device number used in the above command assumes your 
            CD-ROM drive is set to SCSI target 6. If you get the response "no 
            such device," your CD-ROM probably uses a different SCSI target 
            number.
