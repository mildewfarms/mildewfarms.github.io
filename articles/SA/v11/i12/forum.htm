            <p>According to the SANS Institute (<b>http://www.sans.org</b>), "the 
              majority of the successful attacks on operating systems come from 
              only a few software vulnerabilities. This can be attributed to the 
              fact that attackers are opportunistic, take the easiest and most 
              convenient route, and exploit the best-known flaws with the most 
              effective and widely available attack tools. They count on organizations 
              not fixing the problems, and they often attack indiscriminately, 
              scanning the Internet for any vulnerable systems."</p>
            <p> To help administrators identify and prioritize weaknesses in the 
              systems they maintain, SANS has developed the following list of 
              Top Vulnerabilities to UNIX Systems:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) 
              <li> Apache Web Server 
              <li> Secure Shell (SSH) 
              <li> Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 
              <li> File Transfer Protocol (FTP) 
              <li> R-Services -- Trust Relationships 
              <li> Line Printer Daemon (LPD) 
              <li> Sendmail 
              <li> BIND/DNS 
              <li> General UNIX Authentication -- Accounts with No Passwords 
                or Weak Passwords
            </ul>
            <p> These Top Vulnerabilities are actually part of a larger Top Twenty 
              List; the other half lists the ten most commonly exploited Windows 
              services. The SANS site states that "the list is sorted by 
              service because in many cases a single remedy -- disabling the 
              service, upgrading to the most recent version, applying a cumulative 
              patch -- can quickly solve dozens of specific software flaws, 
              which might show up on a scanner. This list is designed to help 
              alleviate that problem by combining the knowledge of dozens of leading 
              security experts."
            <p> Besides identifying these weaknesses, the Top Twenty document 
              provides detailed information about the systems affected, how to 
              determine whether your system is vulnerable, how to protect against 
              the specific vulnerability, and pointers to additional information. 
              The SANS site also specifies some tools and services that can help 
              you find the Top Twenty vulnerabilities on your systems and networks. 
              These include both free (Nessus and SARA) and commercial (from Foundstone 
              and from ISS) software and commercial services (from Qualys). According 
              to the SANS Web site, the list will be updated with additional information 
              and vulnerabilities as they are identified. To find out more about 
              the new list or to provide feedback to the SANS team, see <b>http://www.sans.org/top20/</b>.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
