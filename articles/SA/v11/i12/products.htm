            <p><b> Sourcefire Announces Snort 2.0</b>
            <p> Sourcefire recently announced Snort 2.0, which, according to the 
              company, provides users with increased accuracy and up to 12 times 
              greater performance than previous versions. Snort 2.0 has been reengineered 
              to use a new HTTP protocol flow analyzer and detection engine. The 
              flow analyzer optimizes data flow by reducing unnecessary data inspections, 
              while the detection engine uses a set-based rule selection methodology 
              and a high-performance multi-pattern search engine.
            <p> The multi-pattern search engine uses a two-stage architecture 
              to inspect data and find rule matches. The first stage of the multi-pattern 
              search engine is a high-speed set-based inspection engine, which 
              quickly identifies potential rule matches based on content and ports. 
              The second stage is an enhanced rule-processing engine, which provides 
              additional functionality for validation of potential rule matches. 
              Together, these enhancements can improve the performance and efficiency 
              of Snort and help to reduce false alarms.

            <p> <b>Rainfinity Announces RainStorage</b>
            <p> Rainfinity recently announced RainStorage, a plug-and-play appliance 
              that offers uninterrupted data access while moving data between 
              network attached storage (NAS) devices. According to the company, 
              the RainStorage appliance works transparently to eliminate data 
              access disruptions and time-consuming coordination efforts traditionally 
              associated with routine NAS data migration tasks, yet can be installed 
              and running in about an hour without data integrity or access risk. 
            <p> The RainStorage appliance can enable NAS administrators to perform 
              data migration, volume expansion, capacity management, load balancing, 
              file server consolidation, and other storage management duties quickly 
              and easily while ensuring the highest level of data integrity and 
              reliability. Clients can continue to mount directly to NAS devices 
              throughout data moves, and clients and servers have non-stop data 
              access with no disaster recovery, data access, or data integrity 
              exposure. RainStorage plugs into the existing network switch, and 
              integrates without changes to storage devices, servers, clients 
              or storage management tools and utilities.

            <p> <b>GMx Solutions Releases CM_SAFE Configuration File Management 
              Appliance</b>
            <p> GMx Solutions, Inc. announced the release of CM_SAFE, version 
              1.6. According to the company, CM_SAVE provides configuration file 
              management capabilities for Open Systems servers and stores server 
              configuration files in a centralized repository. In the event of 
              a configuration error, CM_SAFE can restore a known-working configuration 
              with a single command. It can also use current base-lined configuration 
              files to build configurations for new servers or to replicate current 
              functionality on existing servers. It supports configuration disaster 
              recovery for hot sites and cold sites, and can be used to monitor 
              vulnerable files for changes that could indicate security exposures.
            <p> CM_SAFE is designed to support all major Open Systems enterprises 
              and can be used to facilitate configuration recovery or duplication 
              on dissimilar platforms. CM_SAFE reduces the time and resources 
              required to manage server configuration, as well as reducing the 
              risk and length of configuration-related outages.

            <p> <b>Lund Performance Solutions Enhances Shadow DR</b>
            <p> Lund Performance Solutions recently announced enhancements to 
              its Shadow D/R data replication product, which replicates TurboImage 
              databases in real time. According to the company, the main enhancement 
              is that Shadow D/R can now replicate KSAM files and flat files as 
              well as TurboImage databases. Almost all file types and access modes 
              are supported. POSIX files and byte stream files are replicated, 
              as are mapped files.
            <p> An additional enhancement is that Shadow D/R can rename files 
              and databases when replicating them from the primary to the secondary 
              system. Files can now be replicated from a primary system back to 
              itself, giving the target files new names. Since the target files 
              can be on a different volume set than the source files, this capability 
              provides data integrity and disk load balancing, according to the 
              company.
