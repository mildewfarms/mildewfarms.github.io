            <p> <b>ImageStream Ships Rebel Router</b>
            <p> ImageStream Internet Solutions is shipping its new Rebel Router. 
              According to the company, when bundled with ImageStream's new 
              single-port DS3 card, the Rebel can deliver wire-speed performance 
              specifications at a list price of less than $4,000. The new Rebel 
              Router includes a low-profile 19" rack-mount chassis that is 
              10" deep. The base Rebel includes two built-in 10/100 Ethernet 
              ports and two PCI expansion slots. The expansion slots can be populated 
              with 1, 2, 4, or 8-port T1 or E1 cards, 1-port DS3 or E3 cards, 
              as well as 1 or 4-port 10/100 Ethernet cards.
            <p> The Rebel Router is designed to work in a wide range of network 
              designs for core, edge, and premise applications. For example, the 
              Rebel may be used as a core router for a small ISP that needs up 
              to 16 T1 or E1 ports. The same ISP could then upgrade to DS3 or 
              E3 speeds and still support up to 8 T1 or E1 connections in the 
              same chassis. Once an ISP finally outgrows the Rebel as a core router, 
              the Rebel can be moved to the edge, and any of its cards may be 
              moved into a more suitable core router.

              and perform operations on different IT elements. Furthermore, new 
              features allow for portability of the entire network from one location 
              to another.
            <p> Designed for enterprise IT operations, OpForce is a suite of graphical 
              point-and-click applications built to streamline and integrate business 
              processes with systems administration activities. According to the 
              company, OpForce includes a run-time version of the Elemental ITAP 
              Server and is essentially a flexible control console that makes 
              remote auto-discovery, provisioning, and updating network topology 
              possible from any Web browser.

            <p> Aurora Software, Inc. has announced the general release of SarCheck 
              Version 5.0 for Solaris SPARC and HP-UX. According to the company, 
              SarCheck is a performance management tool that can assist systems 
              administrators in the analysis of system performance by translating

              finds runaway processes and memory leaks, recommends changes to 
              various tunable parameters and hardware configurations, and quantifies 
              remaining system capacity.
            <p> A new feature in SarCheck Version 5.0 is its graphing capabilities. 
              SarCheck now uses gnuplot to create graphs on the fly and inserts 
              them into its HTML output. Both PNG and JPEG graphs are supported

              announced the integration of AnexTEK's network storage solution 
              with FalconStor's IPStor storage networking software. According 
              to the companies, the resulting product, the Z-Box, can provide 
              an integrated online storage solution for file sharing and data

              a user-friendly GUI, an embedded Linux operating system, and an 
              easy-to-use management system. The Z-Box can preserve a corporation's 
              existing network infrastructure investment by operating in multi-platform 
              server environments, and by backing up data faster than back up 
              to tape devices. The IP-based Z-Box plugs into a standard local 
              area network (LAN) and provides online, available storage for administrators,

            <p> <b>SWsoft Announces Magnum-SC and Virtuozzo 2.0.2</b>
            <p> SWsoft, Inc. announced the availability of its Magnum-SC line 
              of server consolidation appliances based on its Virtuozzo OS-virtualization 
              technology and Intel-based servers. According to the company, Magnum-SC 
              maximizes the efficiency of an IT infrastructure through consolidating 
              the workload of 10 to 200 physical servers onto a single Magnum-SC 
              appliance, thereby simplifying management and resulting in a 70% 
              reduction in overall systems administration costs. Flexibility can 
              be improved due to the scalability of Virtuozzo's dynamic partitioning 
              technology that allows the OS container, or "virtual environment" 
              (VE), in which both an OS and application run to smoothly grow from 
              a fraction of an Intel processor up to 8 processors. This is ideal 
              for large Intel-based servers that currently support 8-way Intel 
              processors partitioned for multiple workgroups.
            <p> SWsoft also released Virtuozzo version 2.0.2, with the "vzmc" 
              GUI to allow administrators to manage hundreds of Linux Virtual 
              Environments (VEs) across multiple servers. According to the company, 
              administrators can use the "vzmigrate" feature to automatically 
              move an entire OS container to another server for scheduled hardware 
              maintenance or system upgrades -- with only a few seconds of 
              planned downtime.

            <p> <b>Pocketec Releases Pockey USB 2.0 Drive</b>
            <p> Pocketec announced the Pockey USB 2.0 Drive. According to the 
              company, the Pockey USB 2.0 drive offers massive storage capacity, 
              fast transfer rates, and ultra-portability. The Pockey squeezes 
              the power and functionality of a computer's hard drive into 
              a sleek enclosure that measures just 5 in. x 3 in. x 1/2 in. and 
              offers 20 GB, 30 GB, or 40 GB of storage capacity, and can be stacked 
              to create a library of files.
            <p> The Pockey does not require any additional power source (such 
              as batteries or AC adapter) because all necessary power is drawn 
              through the USB cable. The Pockey is compatible with laptops and 
              desktops, PCs and MACs, so cross-platform file sharing is possible. 
              It works with Linux Kernel 2.4 and higher and includes hot-swappable, 
              and hot-pluggable features.
            <p> The 20 GB, 30 GB and 40 GB Pockey retails for $199, $299, and 
              $399, respectively, and will be available at most computer and office
