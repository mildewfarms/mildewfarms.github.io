           <p>I've received some early results from <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine's 
              most recent editorial survey. As I've mentioned in the past, 
              we do not use an external service to perform this survey; we mail 
              them and tally the responses ourselves.
            <p> Overall, the survey results were gratifying in that we seem to 
              be providing the information readers are looking for. The responses 
              indicated that the technical level of articles is right on target. 
              They also indicated that we provide an appropriate amount of coverage 
              of readers' favorite topics, which are: security, performance 
              tuning, scripting, and OS-specific administration. User account 
              maintenance and integration articles are of less interest. Specifically, 
              for the second year in a row, respondents found Amy Rich's 
              Q&amp;A column the most useful of all the regular features in the 
              magazine.
            <p> Readers are supporting more users than previously. 22% responded 
              that they now support 100 or more users, and 32% (up from 23% last 
              year) support more than 500. The most widely administered UNIX operating 
              systems are (in order): Linux (mainly Red Hat), Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, 
              BSD (mainly Free BSD), MacOS X, Irix, and Tru64. Some of the duties 
              that fall within readers' job descriptions are: security, systems 
              installation, programming/development, education, database administration, 
              management, Web administration, and engineering and design.
            <p> We asked how often readers program in various languages. 94% program 
              in shell; 79% program in Perl; 51% program in C/C++; 33% write Tcl/Tk 
              programs; and 28% program in Java. Other languages used are PHP, 
              Expect, Fortran, and COBOL.
            <p> Many of the write-in answers requested larger issues with fewer 
              ads. Note that a symbiotic relationship exists here -- the ads 
              in <i>Sys Admin</i> and its supplements directly support our ability 
              to provide editorial content. Thus, more advertising means more 
              articles.
            <p> Respondents liked the "conciseness", "technical 
              depth", "variety", and "very specific information" 
              provided within the magazine. There were many requests for more 
              Perl coverage. Those readers who don't use Solaris would like 
              to see less Solaris coverage. Suggestions for making the magazine 
              more useful included: "more product reviews", "more 
              code examples", "OS-specific columns", "dating 
              tips", and just plain "more" of everything.
            <p> One survey question asked a) whether you subscribe to the <i>Sys 
              Admin</i> email newsletter, and b) if yes, how useful you find it. 
              Interestingly, 96% of respondents currently do not subscribe. Those 
              that do, however, generally find it useful. The monthly email newsletter 
              provides a preview of the issue -- allowing subscribers to read 
              the feature article and columns before the print issue arrives in 
              the mail. If you're not familiar with our newsletter, please 
              check it out. You can subscribe through the <i>Sys Admin</i> Web 
              site at: <b>http://www.sysadminmag.com/newsletters</b>.
            <p> I thank all of you who took the time to respond to this survey, 
              and I invite those of you who did not receive one to email your 
              comments, complaints, and suggestions to me. I'll consider 
              them all -- I doubt that dating column will happen though. I'm 
              sure there are more qualified sources out there.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> 
            <p>
