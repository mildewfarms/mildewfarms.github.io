            <h1><b>Commercial Bandwidth Management Products</b></h1>
            <p> Commercial bandwidth management solutions are available from various 
              vendors including Packeteer, Checkpoint, Merilus, and Emerging Technologies. 
              Commercial vendors have features unique to their particular products 
              and one may work best for your situation.
            <p> Currently, Packeteer holds the largest market share. Packeteer 
              provides an intuitive graphical user interface, user support, and 
              hardware to run their software. However, Packeteer also has the 
              most expensive of the various commercial solutions on the market.
            <p> Packeteer competes with products from Checkpoint, which produces 
              Floodgate. Floodgate is designed to operate with Checkpoint's 
              FW-1 firewall software, to provide a fully functional firewall and 
              bandwidth-management solution. The Checkpoint solution requires 
              the FW-1 firewall, as well as Solaris, Linux, or Microsoft Windows 
              NT. Floodgate-1 is the best solution if your network is already 
              running the FW-1 firewall or the VPN-1 from Checkpoint.
            <p> Other Packeteer competitors include solutions from Merilus and 
              Emerging Technologies. The Merilus solution is part of their Gateway 
              Guardian Enterprise Edition and runs on a dedicated box. Gateway 
              Guardian Enterprise Edition is a powerful bandwidth management system 
              for the enterprise.
