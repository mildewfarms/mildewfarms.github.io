            <p>This month, I'm providing an excerpt from <i>Sun Performance 
              and Tuning -- Java and the Internet</i>, 2nd Edition by Adrian 
              Cockcroft and Richard Pettit (Sun Microsystems Press, 1998). In 
              this excerpt, the authors describe, in general terms, performance 
              management techniques that apply to many environments.
            <p> Performance management is the measurement, analysis, optimization, 
              and procurement of computing resources to provide an agreed-upon 
              level of service to the organization and its end users. These computing 
              resources could be CPU, memory, disk, network, and application related. 
              It is a complete proactive process, far removed from the crisis-driven 
              tuning and upgrading that seem so common.
            <p> Performance management starts with an understanding of the business. 
              The reason why a computer system exists may seem obvious, but if 
              you state the role of the system clearly, you can identify performance 
              problems caused by extra work. Users often run extra applications 
              on a system that are not part of its business role. Educating the 
              users or threatening to restrict their freedom can keep a system 
              working within its limits.
            <p> One technique I used when I was a system administrator was to 
              pin up various accounting summaries by a printer. While waiting 
              for printouts, users would read who and what was hogging the CPU 
              time, disk space, and printer consumables. Peer pressure was enough 
              to keep things in check.
            <p> An important part of performance management is to know the level 
              of service required by the business and the current performance 
              in business terms. You gain this knowledge by collecting and processing 
              performance metrics from several sources, thus providing a baseline 
              when a problem occurs in the future. By analyzing the metrics, you 
              determine the probable cause and the severity of a problem. A corrective 
              action plan describes the required changes, and, finally, the change 
              can be implemented.
            <p> To determine if the corrective action has helped, you go back 
              to understanding the new performance and service level by collecting 
              and analyzing the metrics. You could also be more proactive before 
              a problem occurs by trying to predict the performance and service 
              level in anticipation of a change, for example, a change in business 
              requirements, user load, applications, or hardware.
            <p> The main stages of performance management can be broadly classified 
              as:
            <p> 1. Obtain business requirements.
            <p> 2. Collect, monitor, and understand performance metrics.
            <p> 3. Analyze, identify, and publicize performance problems.
            <p> 4. Set objectives and implement changes.
            <p> 5. Forecast or project the effect of changes.
            <p> After Step 4 is done, you go back to Step 2 to see if the implemented 
              plan has achieved the objective. Typically, in order to achieve 
              Step 2 and Step 3, you use a performance management tool of some 
              kind.
            <p> In real life, the steps to performance management are not as clearly 
              defined as those stated here. However, this classification provides 
              the basic foundation upon which most performance management is built.
            <p> You will find lots of specific performance tuning tips within 
              this issue of <i>Sys Admin</i>. Let me know if you have questions 
              or comments.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> 
            <p>
