              can centrally configure and distribute software selections, manage 
              users, and create group profiles of target machines for installations 
              and updates. To organize and simplify software options, administrators 
              can build secure, private software channels combining packages from 
              the Red Carpet public library of applications from Ximian, Linux 
              OS, publishers and other Linux vendors with their own internally 
              developed applications and tools. Updates for workstations or servers 
              can be initiated "on demand" by users or can be scheduled 
              to occur automatically at designed times using CorporateConnect 
              Autopull technology. Built-in on-screen reports make it easy to 
              monitor user activity, downloads and status, and CorporateConnect's 
              automatically generated emails alert administrators to any problems 
              with scheduled updates.
