            <h1><b><img src="a9.gif" width="66" height="501" align="left">Solaris<sup>TM</sup> 
              Patch Manager</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Jody Little</i>
            <p> Software products are becoming more complicated and interconnected, 
              and keeping systems current is equally complex and time consuming. 
              The complexity of patch management can lead some administrators 
              to apply patches only after a problem has been identified. However, 
              the recognized security and reliability benefits of keeping systems 
              up to date with current patches are leading many organizations to 
              adopt proactive patch management practices. Sun Microsystems recently 
              announced a new product that addresses exactly these issues and 
              makes the patching process significantly faster and easier.
            <p> <b>Patch Management</b>
            <p> The process of patching a system involves several steps. First, 
              you must take inventory of the patches and product revision levels 
              already installed on the system or systems. Second, you must search 
              through the Sun database to identify patches appropriate to your 
              configuration. This step is particularly time consuming when multiple 
              patches are involved and encompasses the task of identifying patches 
              that are dependent upon other patches. The third step is to determine 
              the correct order for installing patches and reviewing any special 
              instructions. On a single system, this step typically takes several 
              hours. The fourth step involves the actual installation of patches 
              and the occasional removal of one or more patches.
            <p> In an environment with multiple systems running with different 
              configurations, this whole process is then repeated for each system. 
              Each individual step can take several hours to several days and 
              even longer when hundreds of servers are involved and interdependencies 
              with third-party products are considered. In this article, I will 
              take an in-depth look at Sun's new Solaris<sup>TM</sup> Patch 
              Manager Tool and how its automated features can turn patch management 
              from an infrequent chore to a simple daily task.
            <p> <b>Solaris Patch Manager</b>
            <p> Solaris Patch Manager is available in two versions. Solaris Patch 
              Manager Version 1.0 ships with Solaris<sup>TM</sup> 9 Operating 
              Environment (OE). Solaris<sup>TM</sup> Patch Manager Base Version 
              1.0 is freely available via download from:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.sun.com/sunsolve/patches
</pre>
            Both versions of Patch Manager provide automatic inventory of patches 
            currently installed on a system and enable authorized users to analyze 
            patch requirements, download, install, and remove patches. All analysis 
            is performed locally, and no information is sent back to Sun. Patch 
            Manager downloads the most current revision of a patch in Java[tm] 
            archive (.jar) format from Sun's Web site. Patch Manager currently 
            recognizes patches for the Solaris OE, Enterprise Systems Products, 
            Network Storage Products, and Sun<sup>TM</sup> Cluster. In the future, 
            Patch Manager will manage patches for all Sun products. Table 1 summarizes 
            the functionality of Solaris Patch Manager.
            <p> <b>Solaris Patch Manager on Solaris 9</b>
            <p> Start Solaris<sup>TM</sup> Management Console (SMC 2.1); see Figure 
              1.
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Login either as root or as an authorized user. 
              <li> Under System Configuration, choose Patches.
            </ul>
            Tabs in the GUI
            <p> <b>View</b>
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> When the user logs into Patch Manager, it automatically displays 
                a list of patches installed on the system. 
              <li> Patch Properties displays the patch ID, description, date added, 
                backout directory, and packages affected.
            </ul>
            <b>Action</b>
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Add Patch: Determines the proper installation order and installs 
                the patch(es) on a single system. Note: Patches are managed from 
                a local user-specified patch repository. 
              <li> Add Patch to Multiple Systems: Verifies the machine configurations 
                and preorders the patches to be installed, then installs patches 
                on the specified machines. The user may enter the system names 
                individually or a text file with the list of machines. 
              <li> Analyze and Add Patches: Analyzes the system configuration 
                against Sun's available patches. It then lists recommended 
                patches for the system including any dependent patches and installs 
                appropriate patches on the system. See Figure 2. 
              <li> Download Patches: Downloads the most current version of a single 
                or multiple patches from the SunSolve Web site. Users may specify 
                either ID number or a text string. All dependencies are automatically 
                checked and dependent patches are downloaded over a secure connection.
            </ul>
            <b>Remove</b>
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> De-installs the patch or patches from a system. The Remove 
                operation will pre-verify patch dependencies and will not allow 
                the removal of a patch that other patches are dependent on.
            </ul>
            <b>Command-Line Interfaces</b>
            <p> All operations available via GUI are available via the command 
              line for an experienced systems administrator, for example:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Analyze: <b>-/usr/sadm/bin/smpatch analyze</b> 
              <li> Download: <b>-/usr/sadm/bin/smpatch download</b> 
              <li> Add Patch: <b>-/usr/sadm/bin/smpatch add</b>
            </ul>
            <p> Keep the following disk space considerations in mind when using 
              the <b>smpatch</b> command to download and install signed patches:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> The default download directory for signed patches is /var/sadm/spool. 
              <li> The patch download process might use more disk space than anticipated, 
                because multiple patches can be downloaded if prerequisite patches 
                are required. 
              <li> Signed patches are unpacked in the /var/sadm/spool directory 
                before they are installed, so be sure you have enough disk space 
                in the /var directory for this process. 
              <li> If your /var directory is not large enough to support the downloading 
                and unpacking of signed patches, you can use the <b>smpatch</b> 
                command with the <b>-d</b> option to specify an alternate patch 
                download directory.
            </ul>
            <b>Special Notes and Tips</b>
            <p> Sun is eliminating the need for reboots after installation of 
              patches whenever possible. Patch Manager 1.0 on the Solaris 9 OE 
              will not install patches that contain Special Instructions. Patches 
              with special instructions such as reboot required, must be installed 
              manually. In the second quarterly release of the Solaris 9 OE, Patch 
              Manager will set aside patches with special instructions into a 
              separate subdirectory for manual installation.
            <p> To Add Patches on Multiple Systems, all of the systems on which 
              you wish to install patches must be homogenous, meaning they must: 
              1) run the same version of the Solaris 9 Operating Environment, 
              2) have the same hardware architecture, and 3) have the same patches 
              installed.
            <p> Patch Manager is security aware. It automatically verifies and 
              installs digitally signed patches. Digitally signed patches are 
              patches that include a digital signature from Sun. Verifying the 
              signature helps ensure the patch has not been tampered with. Patch 
              Manager also automatically downloads any dependent patches and has 
              the built-in intelligence to install all patches that a particular 
              patch depends on. An Update feature is expected to be available 
              soon. This feature further automates the patching process by combining 
              the Analyze, Download, and Add features to update the system to 
              the latest patches. It also offers flexibility for those who choose 
              to cancel out of the wizard after the analysis or download and add 
              patches to their systems at a later time.
            <p> <b>Summary</b>
            <p> Sun's first goal is to eliminate the need for patches. However, 
              patches are a fact of life today, so Sun has established a Patch 
              Management Initiative that utilizes products, processes, and services 
              to decrease the complexity of the patch management process. Solaris 
              Patch Manager is the first step toward a standard patch tool that 
              automates the analysis, installation, and removal of patches for 
              all Sun products. Patch Manager can save many days and hours of 
              tedious research by automating the process of determining the appropriate 
              patches, patch installation order, and patch dependencies while 
              providing customers with an easy tool for daily comparisons to the 
              latest Sun patch information tailored for their particular configurations.
            <p> Systems administrators will see significant time savings as the 
              most tedious steps in the patch process are automated. Security 
              is tighter than ever before with digital signatures on all patches. 
              Patch Manager downloads only the most current patches over a secure 
              connection and automatically verifies the patch has not been tampered 
              with since Sun signed it. This security is achieved with no additional 
              effort from the systems administrator and with no additional product 
              fees.
            <p> Patch Manager significantly simplifies the process of keeping 
              systems updated with the then-current revision available, which 
              inevitably translates to increased system reliability, availability, 
              and security. Patch Manager enables regular proactive patch management. 
              For more information about Patch Management best practices and the 
              tools and processes best suited for your particular environment, 
              please refer to the Sun Patch Management Best Practices White Paper 
              expected to be available from Sun in the fall of 2002. See also
