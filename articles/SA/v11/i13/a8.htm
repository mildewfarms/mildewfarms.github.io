            <h1><b><img src="a8.gif" width="66" height="501" align="left">Sun<sup>TM</sup> 
              Management Center Change Manager</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Jonathan Han, Eric Nielsen, and Julie Nelson</i>
            <p> When asked the question, "How do you like Sun's administration 
              tool set?" most experienced Solaris administrators would chuckle 
              and say, "What administrator toolset?" This, I am happy 
              to say, is changing. For the past five years, Sun has been improving 
              and enhancing its own systems management portfolio, and Sun<sup>TM</sup> 
              Management Center 3.0 has been growing in popularity. Sun's 
              own IT department has deployed Sun Management Center and is now 
              managing thousands of its own servers with the product.
            <p> This year, Sun announced the systems management concept called 
              iChange. Sun's iChange concept was presented as a way to manage 
              the change of all of the system software layers. As administrators 
              know, the ever-increasing complexity of the layer dependencies makes 
              it hard to roll out new solutions and keep them up to date. iChange 
              was described as technology that would help solve this growing problem. 
              Many of us were skeptical of the claims that new technology would 
              solve this long-standing problem. So it was a pleasant surprise 
              when Sun announced that the iChange concept would be released as 
              the Change Manager module for the Sun Management Center product 
              family. For many of the enterprise customers already using Sun Management 
              Center, this was great news.
            <p> Sun Management Center, like several recent deployment products, 
              takes advantage of a growing trend in the industry to deploy system 
              software using complete system images to any client. Sun has offered 
              pieces of this solution within the Solaris<sup>TM</sup> Operating 
              Environment, but never integrated the pieces into a complete application. 
              Solaris systems administrators are likely familiar with the capabilities 
              of Solaris<sup>TM</sup> Flash software, Solaris JumpStart<sup>TM</sup> 
              software, and Solaris<sup>TM</sup> Live Upgrade software. However, 
              it takes quite a bit of time and scripting to use these technologies 
              in a multi-client environment. Change Manager brings these technologies 
              together and adds functionality that makes it simple to point, click, 
              and deploy Solaris-based systems. In this article, I will describe 
              the tools that are available in the current Solaris release to deploy 
              system images to a large number of machines. Then we will cover 
              the installation and update process using Change Manager, as well 
              as its key features.
            <p> <B>Overview of Today's Solaris Installation</B>
            <p> Today's available Solaris installation tools are based around 
              three technologies:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Solaris Operating Environment -- Captures a snapshot image 
                of a complete software stack in a Solaris Flash archive format, 
                including the Solaris operating environment, applications, and 
                configurations. A Solaris Flash archive can then be used to install 
                any number of machines making them clones of the original machine 
                where the archive was created. 
              <li> Solaris JumpStart software -- Software that enables automated, 
                hands-off installation of software. The JumpStart software is 
                based on command line interface (CLI) that can install software 
                using either standard packages or using a Solaris Flash archive. 
                The administrator initiates installations automatically from the 
                system being installed. The files for installation are provided 
                by a JumpStart server that contains the install media (either 
                packages or an archive), JumpStart scripts, and data. 
              <li> Solaris Live Upgrade software -- Allows the installation 
                of Solaris Flash archives or software updates while the system 
                is fully operational. On a running system, an administrator uses 
                Live Upgrade to create an alternate boot environment. The alternate 
                boot environment is a replica of the current, running boot environment. 
                The administrator then initiates either a package-based upgrade 
                or the initial installation of a Solaris Flash archive onto the 
                alternate boot environment. When the upgrade is complete, the 
                administrator reboots the system to the alternate boot environment 
                that contains the newly upgraded Solaris operating environment. 
                If, for some reason, the new environment is unacceptable, the 
                administrator can revert to the original environment by simply 
                rebooting.
            </ul>
            <p> Today, using the technologies described above, administrators 
              interact mostly with a command-line interface (CLI) to perform complex 
              and time-consuming operations. For example, using JumpStart software, 
              administrators must write and maintain pre-install scripts, finish 
              scripts, profiles, and rules files on one or more JumpStart software 
              servers. Then, each machine to be installed must be initiated by 
              the administrator individually.
            <p> <b>Automating Installations and Updates Using Change Manager</b>
            <p> Sun Management Center Change Manager builds upon the current Solaris 
              technologies to create a unique, aggregated change management application 
              that makes deploying software on a massive scale easier, scalable, 
              and more cost-effective. Change Manager automates the tools and 
              technologies described above and integrates them into an easy-to-use, 
              Web-based interface, as well as a fully functional, scriptable CLI.
            <p> Those of you who have interacted with Web-based management interfaces 
              on printers, routers, or hubs will be quite at home in the Change 
              Manager browser user interface (BUI), which is a second-generation 
              Sun<sup>TM</sup> OpenNet Environment (Sun ONE) Web Server software 
              interface. The Change Manager BUI connects to the centralized Change 
              Manager server via an http connection, tunneling all of the traffic 
              between the BUI and the server.
            <p> Some features of the Change Manager software may surprise you. 
              For example, the software does not use any client-side Java in its 
              user interface. The BUI is based on HTML and Javascript<sup>TM</sup> 
              technology. The interface, of course, talks to Java servlets on 
              a server, but is 100% pure, fast HTML on the client, resulting in 
              significantly improved performance.
            <p> When trying out the software, we discovered it was convenient 
              to reload machines and change what we did. We placed older Sun Ultra 
              1's in a rack and loaded them with solution sets just because 
              it was easy. We flashed one machine with an xpilot server image, 
              so we could play with it, and it literally took only minutes to 
              download the server image and provision the client system. Also, 
              we found that the Live Upgrade feature allowed us to fall back to 
              an existing stack quickly and efficiently. Several times we changed 
              our minds after running a new stack and found ourselves back online 
              in minutes by using the fallback feature.
            <p> <b>Change Manager Key Features</b>
            <p> Sun Management Center Change Manager also offers other capabilities, 
              including the following:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Change Manager Server Administration -- The Change Manager 
                server contains all of the Sun Management Center Change Manager 
                software and runs a Web Server that supports the Web-based Change 
                Manager applications. It stores information about the managed 
                hosts and stores files used for Change Manager operations, including 
                Solaris Flash archives, shared profiles, audit rules files and 
                manifests, and Solaris boot images. The administrator uses Sun 
                Management Center Change Manager to administer and maintain this 
                server. 
              <li> Solaris Flash Archive Manager -- Change Manager provides 
                a tool for Solaris Flash archive management. The Solaris Flash 
                archive manager enables systems administrators to import Solaris 
                Flash archives, group the archives into folders, and delete and 
                search for archives. It also enables users to edit archive properties. 
              <li> Host Manager -- Administrators can easily install, update, 
                and audit systems. Sun Management Center Change Manager enables 
                administrators to group systems in any way. Administrators can 
                perform upgrades, audit systems, and re-provision software services 
                on one system or on a group of systems. 
              <li> Configuration Writer -- The configuration writer tool provides 
                the ability to create and manage configuration profiles that can 
                be applied to individual managed hosts or groups of managed hosts. 
                The configuration writer also helps administrators install and 
                provision new managed hosts. 
              <li> Software Auditor -- The Change Manager audit feature provides 
                the ability to create the software stack manifest of one or more 
                deployed systems. These manifests can be used in rules-based comparisons 
                to check the software configurations of a managed host or groups 
                of managed hosts. Administrators can compare manifests between 
                two points in time, for example, between the current state and 
                the original software stack manifest. Or, administrators can compare 
                the manifests of individual managed hosts. This helps solve the 
                problem of how to quickly detect what has changed across a farm 
                of servers. This tool provides functionality to write auditing 
                attribute rules, such as file content changes, to help reliably 
                manage changes for software upgrades or system maintenance. 
              <li> Job Scheduler -- Change Manager contains a rich scheduling 
                feature set that allows administrators to schedule software deployment 
                operations during offload hours. Operations such as upgrades, 
                reboots, and software auditing can be scheduled on a single managed 
                host or on a group of managed hosts. Administrators can also monitor 
                the status of scheduled jobs, reschedule jobs, and cancel jobs 
                as necessary.
            </ul>
            <p> Sun continues to invest in Sun Management Center 3.0, moving it 
              forward and making administrator's lives easier. Sun Management 
              Center Change Manager continues this trend in the area of software 
              provisioning and change management for Sun systems.
