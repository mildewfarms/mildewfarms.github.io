            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just installed Solaris 
              9 on one of our test bed machines to experiment with it. I really 
              like a number of the new features, including the integrated tcp_wrappers 
              functionality for /etc/inetd.conf. I think I've misconfigured 
              something, though, because instead of logging the service, it always 
              logs the blocked process as <b>inetd</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Aug  15 11:09:29 my.host.domain inetd[11156]: refused connect from localhost
</pre>
            The above example should be logged as <b>telnetd</b>, not <b>inetd</b>. 
            What am I doing wrong? Did I miss some flag to <b>inetd</b>?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> This is a known bug with Solaris 
              9's implementation of tcp_wrappers. It's been logged under 
              bugid 4711482. I hope there will be a patch out soon that will change 
              the log messages to show the actual calling program.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just upgraded to Solaris 
              9 and installed OSA Raid Manager 6.22,REV=01.14. We've migrated 
              an A1000 array from an old machine and are now getting errors in 
              the log file on the new machine:

Aug 27 12:05:32 colossus /usr/lib/osa/bin/nvutil: [ID 187284 user.error] 
The controller firmware version for controller c2t5d0 
(module: colossus_001) is 2.05.02. The recommended firmware version 
for this application is 3.00.00 or higher.
</pre>
            What patches do I need to fix this? I installed all of the recommended 
            ones and security ones already, but that doesn't seem to help.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You need to upgrade the firmware 
              on the A1000, not install OS patches to fix this problem (though 
              you may also need OS patches for the version of OSA Raid Manager 
              that you're using; see the release notes). See page 121 (Appendix 
              A) of <b>http://docs.sun.com/doc/805-7756-10</b> for information 
              on upgrading your controller firmware. Because you're back 
              at 2.05.02, you first need to upgrade to 2.5.6.32 and then to the 
              latest revision for the firmware. See also <b>http://docs.sun.com/doc/806-0478-10</b>, 
              pages 143-152 for information on how to download and upgrade the 
              firmware.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I tried installing Solaris 9 from 
              my Plextor PlexWriter 12/20/32 CDRW, which is installed in one of 
              our Ultra 60s. Solaris 9 installed fine, but when the machine rebooted 
              at the end of the installation, I received a large number of error 
              messages that scrolled by in the logs at many more than one per 
              second:
            <p>

Oct 23 11:25:21 fruba genunix: [ID 349501 kern.warning] WARNING: Device sd6 failed to power up.
</pre>
            This is a brand new CDRW drive, and it worked fine under Solaris 8 
            and continues to work fine under Solaris 8 and FreeBSD, so I don't 
            think this is a hardware problem. Have you seen this error before? 
            Is it a hardware incompatibility that's cropped up in Solaris 
            9?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> This is actually a known issue 
              with this model CDRW drive, yes. As far as I know, there is no patch 
              out for this, though the bug has been reported to Sun. As a temporary 
              workaround, you can leave a readable CDROM in the drive to prevent 
              these errors from appearing at boot time. If you do not want to 
              leave a CDROM in the drive all of the time, you can remove the vold 
              init scripts or remove the CDROM lines from /etc/vold.conf.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a number of 220R servers 
              that must have near 24x7 uptime. We also want to upgrade all of 
              these servers from Solaris 2.6 to Solaris 8. What's your suggestion 
              for the absolute minimal downtime for doing the upgrade on these 
              systems?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If your machines are supposed 
              to be up as close to 24x7 as possible, you likely have the boot 
              drives mirrored with DiskSuite. The option that will cause you the 
              least amount of downtime is to use Live Upgrade combined with Web 
              Start Flash, especially if you have a large number of similarly 
              installed machines or one test machine where you can create installations 
              to turn into flash archives.
            <p> Presumably you've designed your systems so that all of the 
              user data and third party software are on a separate partition from 
              those needed by the OS. I tend to lay out filesystems with / /usr 
              and /var for the OS, and one large filesystem for /usr/local, /home, 
              etc. This segregation makes it easy to upgrade the OS without touching 
              the non-Solaris parts of the machine.

            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a problem with a Netra 
              X1 that has Solaris 8 and DiskSuite 4.2.1 installed. When I try 
              to set up a two-way mirror using DiskSuite, I get an error when 
              trying to create the state databases on the second drive:
            <p> 
            <pre>
metadb -a -c 4 c0t2d0s7
metadb: sekrit: c0t2d0s7: overlaps with device in metadevice state database
</pre>
            I checked both of the disks with format to make sure there were no 
            errors on slice 7 of either disk, and everything looked ok. I also 
            tried repartitioning and re-labeling the disks. I even tried removing 
            and recreating the disk devices with devfsadm. Still no luck. I'm 
            not sure what I'm doing wrong, any clues?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> This sounds like a known issue 
              with IDE disks lacking unique device IDs. The early X1s shipped 
              with 20-GB Seagate drives with the part numbers 600-7097-02 and 
              F600-7097-02 are susceptible to this problem. Sun Alert 27211 addresses

            According to Sun, this issue has been fixed in Solaris 8 Update 6 
            or later. If you still have issues getting DiskSuite to work, Sun 
            has an unsupported but documented workaround: FIN I0680-1. This workaround 
            is not available from the public site, and you'll need to contact 
            your Sun service representative for the FIN. Sun will give you a tool 
            called <b>rwdevid</b> that will create unique device IDs for each 
            disk:
            <p> 
            <pre>
rwdevid -d /dev/rdsk/c0t2d0s2 -w

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Our company has a large number of 
            jumpstart servers located throughout the world. Every time a new release 
            comes out, we need to either ship CDROMs to each site or have them 
            download and burn their own copies. Then someone has to physically 
            go to the machine and insert the CDROM into the jumpstart server so 
            that the new image can be installed. This process is slow and tedious. 
            There must be a better way to get the new image on all of our jumpstart 
            servers.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can install from a downloaded 
              ISO image instead of burning your own CDROMs and use <b>lofiadm</b> 
              (with version of Solaris greater than 7) to mount the file as a 
              filesystem. You can then do the installation from the filesystem 
              image.
            <p> To begin, make the machine think that the file is actually a device:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/sbin/lofiadm -a /path/to/sol-8-u7-sparc-v1.iso
</pre>
            which creates /dev/lofi/1 and its associated entry in /devices, /devices/pseudo/lofi@0:1.
            <p> To mount the ISO image on /cdrom:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/sbin/mount -F hsfs -o ro /dev/lofi/1 /cdrom
</pre>
            Then you can <b>cd</b> to /cdrom/Solaris_8/Tools/ and run:
            <p> 
            <pre>
./setup_install_server /path/to/your/jumpstart/cdrom_image
</pre>
            When the installation of the first disk is complete, delete the loopback 
            mount for the first ISO image:
            <p> 
            <pre>
cd /
/sbin/umount /cdrom
/usr/sbin/lofiadm -d /path/to/sol-8-u7-sparc-v1.iso
</pre>
            Create a loopback interface for the second ISO image, and mount it:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/sbin/lofiadm -a /path/to/sol-8-u7-sparc-2.iso
/sbin/mount -F hsfs -o ro /dev/lofi/1 /cdrom
</pre>
            Then, finish up the installation of the second ISO image:
            <p> 
            <pre>
cd /cdrom/Solaris_8/Tools/
./add_to_install_server /path/to/your/jumpstart/cdrom_image
</pre>
            Finally, after the second image has finished, unmount the image and 
            delete the block device:
            <p> 
            <pre>
cd /
/sbin/umount /cdrom
/usr/sbin/lofiadm -d /path/to/sol-8-u7-sparc-v2.iso
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I heard that the StorEdge A3000 will 
            not be supported under Solaris 9. Is this true? I just bought a number 
            of A3000 arrays, and I'll be mighty upset if I have no upgrade 
            path.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The Solaris 9 release notes on 
              docs.sun.com did in fact say that the A3000, A3500, and A3500FC 
              storage arrays were no longer supported under Solaris 9. The good 
              news for you is that this announcement was an error and the A3x00 
              arrays are still supported.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an issue with Solaris 8 
              and an Ultra 220R. I've been trying to add a user with the 
              following command:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/sbin/useradd -c "Test User" -d /home/test -g test -G root -k -u 600 -s /bin/sh test
</pre>
            I get this error:
            <p> 
            <pre>
UX: /usr/sbin/useradd: ERROR: Cannot update system files - login cannot be created.
</pre>
            The syntax is right, and the <b>useradd</b> works fine if I remove 
            the <b>-G</b> flag. According to the man page, the <b>-G</b> should 
            add the user to a secondary group in /etc/group, but I can't 
            seem to get it to work. I also tried to use <b>usermod</b> to modify 
            the test account after creation and that also fails:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/sbin/usermod -G root test

UX: /usr/sbin/usermod: ERROR: Cannot update system files - login cannot be modified.
</pre>
            I can never get <b>useradd</b> or <b>usermod</b> to work when I use 
            the <b>-G</b> flag. Is the <b>-G</b> flag just broken?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> First, double check that /etc/.pwd.lock 
              is not in use by any other program. If you can create the user without 
              the <b>-G</b> flag, though, this is likely not your problem. My 
              guess is that you're having an issue with your <b>TMPDIR</b> 
              setting. If you <b>truss</b> the <b>useradd</b> or <b>usermod</b> 
              process, you may see a line that says something to the effect of:
            <p> 
            <pre>
rename("/your/tmp/dir/gtmp.&lt;something&gt;", "/etc/group") Err#18 EXDEV)
</pre>
            If you do see this error near the end of the <b>truss</b> output, 
            then it means that your <b>TMPDIR</b> is not on the same physical 
            partition as /etc/group. EXDEV is an error that indicates that you're 
            trying to do an illegal cross device link. To work around this issue, 
            you can have your script set the <b>TMPDIR</b> to the same partition.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I am trying to install patch 112438-01 
              for the /dev/random and /dev/urandom drivers on a Solaris 8 10/01 
              release machine. I did the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
pkgadd -d 112438-01
</pre>
            and rebooted the machine. The application that's trying to use 
            /dev/urandom, OpenSSH, dies with the error:
            <p> 
            <pre>
PRNG not seeded
</pre>
            I took a look in /dev, and there's no random or urandom there 
            at all. Is there something else needed to get this patch to work?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You said you used <b>pkgadd</b>, 
              and not <b>patchadd</b>. If this is true, you'll need to add 
              the patch with <b>patchadd</b>, then remove it, then add it again 
              to clean up any problems:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/sbin/patchadd 112438-01
/usr/sbin/patchrm 112438-01
/usr/sbin/patchadd 112438-01
</pre>
            After the patch is properly installed, you need to reconfigure the 
            devices. You can either shut down the machine and do a reconfiguration 
            boot (<b>boot -r</b>), or you can use <b>/usr/sbin/devfsadm</b>.
            <p> You may also have a copy of OpenSSH that was built to use <b>prngd</b> 
              instead of /dev/urandom. You can use <b>truss</b> to verify what 
              random source your binary is trying to open. You should see the 
              line:
            <p> 
            <pre>
open("/dev/urandom", O_RDONLY)                  = 3
</pre>
            If you have a copy that's trying to use something other than 
            /dev/urandom, pick up the correct package from <b>http://www.sunfreeware.com/</b> 
            or configure and build your own from source.
