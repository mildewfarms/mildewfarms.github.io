              Management Center -- A Specialist in a Specialized World</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Andrew Hillier and Andres Gomez-Rivas</i>
            <p> First released in 1998, Sun<sup>TM</sup> Management Center is 
              now in its third major release with Sun Management Center 3.0. Scaling 
              from one system to thousands of servers, all accessible from one 
              centralized console, Sun Management Center 3.0 is Sun's first 
              fully scalable Element Manager for Systems Mangaement. This article 
              will highlight the benefits that Sun Management Center provides 
              for monitoring Sun hardware and the Solaris<sup>TM</sup> Operating 
              Environment, as well as describe its architecture, features, and 
              usage.
            <p> <b>Features</b>
            <p> The most important infrastructure change in Sun Management Center 
              3.0 has been the introduction of Group Operations. This feature 
              collapses the setting of operational thresholds for hundreds of 
              hosts into a single task. Using Group Operations, users can load 
              modules across a hundred agents in the enterprise, or set the thresholds 
              for alarm conditions on any monitored property on any number of 
              hosts. The Sun Management Center Agent profile for any number of 
              hosts can also be synchronized with that of a "reference" 
              host, by propagating that host's Module Configuration to the 
              agents. This grouping infrastructure provides a point-and-click 
              interface to these operations and replaces previous custom efforts 
              to propagate configuration files via file transfer.
            <p> Also, the Performance Reporting Manager (PRM) add-on for Sun Management 
              Center provides a suite of tools for graphing, analyzing, and exporting 
              data from Sun Management Center. Utilizing the data logging capabilities 
              of Sun Management Center agents, PRM is able to acquire the value 
              of data properties such as system load averages, CPU utilization 
              rates, or free disk space, over extended periods of time. The resulting 
              data can be exported or graphed, and used to facilitate such decision-making 
              tasks as server consolidation and capacity planning, as well as 
              for general performance monitoring and tracking.
            <p> Other new features in 3.0 include add-ons for hardware management, 
              service management, patch management, and the monitoring of network 
              services such as SMTP, IMAP, POP, HTTP, Telnet, NIS, FTP, etc. New 
              means of accessing the data are also a part of Sun Management Center 
              3.0. A new Web interface provides HTTP/HTTPS access to management 
              information through any firewall, and a new command-line interface 
              allows administrators to utilize Sun Management Center without launching 
              the GUI. See Figure 1.
            <p> Over the past two years, customer awareness of Sun Management 
              Center product has increased. Some of this can be attributed to 
              the price/performance of the product. The base package is available 
              free of charge, and add-ons are charged for only where they are 
              utilized. Enterprise discounting allows the complete set of add-on 
              features to be available for as little as $250 per server.
            <p> <b>Architecture</b>
            <p> Sun Management Center is based on a three-tiered architecture, 
              and Sun Management Center agents form the frontline of systems management. 
              The server layer powers the configuration (security, module parameter-setting, 
              etc.) of the agents. A console layer connects to the server layer 
              and browses data, alarms, and log files on the agents. See Figure 
              2. In a typical installation, there is one server layer, with many 
              agents reporting to that server layer, and one or more console hosts 
              used to connect to the server layer and manage the agents.
            <p> The Sun Management Center agent is an SNMP-compliant agent. You 
              can poll it via SNMP "get" commands, and you can configure 
              Sun Management Center to forward SNMP traps to your existing Enterprise 
              Management Software. Furthermore, Sun Management Center agents allow 
              you to configure other SNMP agents as "sub-agents" of 
              Sun Management Center. This means that you can have requests for 
              certain SNMP Object Identifier branches deferred to an existing 
              agent running on a different UDP port. The benefit is you need only 
              expose and reference one UDP port to access all your SNMP agents 
              on that host. Also, Sun provides an Advanced System Monitoring pack 
              "module" for the Sun Management Center agent called "MIB-II 
              Instrumentation", which fully implements RFC-1213, allowing 
              the agent to serve up this information as well.
            <p> The Sun Management Center agents support the SNMPv2 User Security 
              Model standard. All communication between the console/server and 
              the agent is via this protocol. SNMPv2usec utilizes a username and 
              password (encrypted) to verify user access to data, as well as user 
              privileges to perform management operations (via SNMP "set" 
              commands). This SNMPv2usec protocol is driven by security configuration 
              information provided by the server layer.
            <p> The server layer drives all access to the Sun Management Center 
              environment. To monitor or manage Sun Management Center agents, 
              users must have a UNIX account on the server layer host. Furthermore, 
              only users whose account name appears in the "esusers" 
              file can log into Sun Management Center. A user's privileges 
              within Sun Management Center are further defined by the Sun Management 
              Center group membership that they possess; groups exist for Domain 
              Administrators, Administrators, and Operators, each with a predefined 
              category of access in the system. Users without membership in a 
              Sun Management Center group but present in the "esusers" 
              file will have general read-only access to all management data. 
              All of these default permissions can be overridden on an object-by-object 
              basis for arbitrary users or other UNIX groups.
            <p> As mentioned, the Sun Management Center server layer drives this 
              security functionality. However, the loading of "modules" 
              (roughly analogous to SNMP MIBs), the setting of operating thresholds, 
              and other tasks are also affected through the use of the console. 
              The console requires a server layer to access the agents. The configuration 
              of hundreds of servers at a time is driven by a "grouping service" 
              at the server layer. The server layer also maintains a comprehensive 
              database of alarms that have occurred across the enterprise, which 
              can be queried via the console or through the Client API.
            <p> Returning to the agent layer, where the acquisition of systems 
              management data takes place, there are several distinctive features 
              that Sun Management Center agents have over traditional SNMP agents. 
              The Sun Management Center agent is dynamic; the SNMP Management 
              Information Base (MIB) that the agent supports is defined by the 
              modules the agent has loaded. Modules can be dynamically loaded 
              and unloaded, so during the lifespan of the agent process, its MIB 
              may grow or shrink as new management capabilities are required or 
              removed from the agent.
            <p> These Sun Management Center modules encapsulate not only the model 
              of what properties are important for managing a system, but can 
              also include default thresholds for normal operating behavior, suggested 
              fixes, and corrective scripts. The Sun Management Center agent allows 
              the end-user to define exactly what constitutes "normal operating 
              conditions". Thus, the end-user can tweak the limits on each 
              property in the system. When a property exceeds that limit, the 
              agent will generate an alarm and send a trap. See Figure 3.
            <p> When an alarm state has been reached, the agent can be configured 
              to launch a "corrective action" script. The execution 
              of this script can be delayed until a Sun Management Center administrator 
              authorizes its execution, or the agent may be enabled to launch 
              the script automatically. The entire configuration of all Sun Management 
              Center components is done via plain text configuration files, and 
              the User's manual describes how to change these settings and 
              force these changes to take effect.
            <p> <b>Using the Product</b>
            <p> Before all of these features can be accessed, the software must 
              be installed, and like most systems management products, it must 
              be installed everywhere. The product is package based. Installation 
              and deployment is straightforward, however, it would benefit from 
              an installation GUI and a more sophisticated deployment mechanism.
            <p> There are three basic components that must be installed: the server, 
              the console, and the agents. The server requires a dedicated box, 
              and Sun provides a "Configuration and Deployment Guide" 
              to help size the hardware (with a Netra X1 being sufficient for 
              smaller installs and a 280R being recommended for larger environments). 
              The console can be installed on either Solaris OE or Windows clients 
              (using RMI to communicate with the server). The agents are lightweight 
              and go on every "managed node" you care to put them on.
            <p> When starting it up, the first thing the user sees is the login 
              screen, which requires a user ID, password, and server name or address. 
              The login credentials are the same as the user's UNIX account 
              on the Sun Management Center server layer, and any UNIX account 
              can be authorized to use Sun Management Center simply by adding 
              the user name to the "esusers" file on the server. The 
              server specified is the Sun host that is running the Sun Management 
              Center "server layer". This must be specified, as large 
              organizations may be segregated into several server "contexts", 
              each with their own server layer. Sun Management Center sits on 
              the SNMPv2 "usec" (user security) model, so all of this 
              input is used in the underlying agent communication. See Figure 
              4.
            <p> After this formality, the main "topology" window appears. 
              In general, user interaction consists of double-clicking on managed 
              objects to see a detailed view, or right clicking to bring up a 
              context sensitive pop-up menu of possible actions. However, some 
              functions are only accessible from the drop-down menus at the top 
              of the window. This window, like many in Sun Management Center, 
              provides a familiar tree browser look and feel. Here you can organize 
              the entities in your system along several lines, including physical 
              structure, network hierarchy, or logical function (such as "Production" 
              or "Testing"). This organization is depicted as a tree-view 
              on the left and a series of icons on the right, with the icons representing 
              the contents of the currently selected "container". All 
              of these structures are organized under "management domains", 
              the highest-level construct in Sun Management Center.
            <p> Drilling down into these structures will inevitably end with the 
              appearance of a "host details" browser. This window is 
              specific to a managed node and provides the mechanism to load and 
              unload modules, browse management data, manage alarms, edit alarm 
              limits, view log files, and view the physical or logical configuration 
              of the host. This is the business end of Sun Management Center, 
              and it allows users to configure and view almost every aspect of 
              the Sun Management Center agents. Because the agents are autonomous, 
              the rules, thresholds, and actions specified in the host details 
              browser translate directly into management of the target server.
            <p> The features and information present at this level are largely 
              a function of what modules are loaded on the agent. Modules are 
              the "building blocks" of the management configuration, 
              and many modules exist to perform both basic and advanced management 
              functions. There are modules to watch the kernel, inspect the hardware, 
              launch diagnostics, scan files, monitor directories, hit Web servers 
              with "synthetic" transactions, analyze crash dumps, launch 
              batch jobs, and so on. If you can't find the module you need, 
              a third party can probably provide it. Failing that, you can always 
              build it using the graphical module builder tool, which is provided 
              as part of the Developer Environment add-on. See Figure 5.
            <p> All of this functionality is subject to stringent access control, 
              which means that different users and groups of users can be independently 
              authorized to access the various features. Most "managed objects" 
              in the system, including data properties, modules, agents, topology 
              constructs, and even management domains, allow access control rules 
              to be specified. This allows the product to fit well with the responsibilities 
              and workflow of the users in small shops as well as large organizations.
            <p> <b>Integration</b>
            <p> Just as no other tool can manage Sun hardware as comprehensively 
              as Sun Management Center, the converse is surely also true. That 
              is why integration with third party ESM solutions has always been 
              a strong mandate for Sun Management Center. Integration packages 
              for HP Open view, Tivoli, CA, BMC, Netcool, and others are readily 
              available, allowing hardware and software data and alarms to be 
              brought into other tools for consideration in the broader organizational 
              context. This strategy makes Sun servers work better in the overall 
              environment and thus makes good sense.
            <p> <b>Summary</b>
            <p> If you have an environment that includes Sun servers performing 
              critical operations, I recommend looking into Sun Management Center. 
              It has steadily improved over the years, and the latest version 
              has some impressive capabilities. A free download of the product
