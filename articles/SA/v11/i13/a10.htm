            <h1><b><img src="a10.gif" width="66" height="501" align="left">The 
              SunPlex<sup>TM</sup> Platform</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Chitra Badrinath</i>
            <p> The Sun<sup>TM</sup> Cluster 3.0 Software extends the Solaris 
              Operating Environment, enabling core Solaris services to operate 
              seamlessly across a SunPlex[tm] Platform. This is done while maintaining 
              full Solaris compatibility with existing applications. Sun Cluster 
              3.0 provides high availability (HA) and scalability to everyday 
              Solaris applications through continuous network and data availability. 
              Application services that are written to the Sun Cluster 3.0 API 
              helps achieve higher levels of availability as well as scalability. 
              This article will provide a brief overview of Sun Cluster 3.0 features 
              and benefits as seen within the SunPlex system.
            <p> The SunPlex system is a key element of a services-driven computing 
              environment. SunPlex systems deliver management capabilities in 
              tightly coupled pools of resources, making it possible to manage 
              the service, not the server. Sun Cluster 3.0 software is the key 
              to building SunPlex systems, including the Solaris Operating Environment, 
              Sun servers, storage devices, and network connectivity products, 
              and Sun support services.
            <p> Sun Cluster 3.0 software takes clustering beyond the realm of 
              high availability by adding the simplicity of single system administrative 
              view and the potential of seamless scalability. It provides a single, 
              globally coherent process and resource management view for the multiple 
              nodes of a cluster. In essence, the cluster becomes a single administrative 
              entity and presents itself and its services to clients as if it 
              were a single compute resource.
            <p> A typical SunPlex system consists of the Sun servers, Sun StorEdge 
              arrays, Solaris operating environment, Sun Cluster 3.0 software, 
              and other networking products in addition to the applications that 
              are made cluster aware by the agents (see Figure 1). A private interconnect 
              ties the cluster together to help ensure a tighter coupling of the 
              cluster resources. A correct configuration of the cluster helps 
              to ensure no single point of failure. Customers can choose to cluster 
              in a box, for example to cluster the various domains within Sun<sup>TM</sup> 
              Fire hardware, or to cluster across servers with multiple Sun servers. 
              The global features of Sun Cluster 3.0 -- the global devices, 
              the global file service, and the global networking -- provide 
              the plumbing that ensure faster failure detection and recovery of 
              the application service in the cluster.
            <p> <b>Manageability Simplified</b>
            <p> Traditional clustering solutions have been a challenge to install, 
              manage, and monitor for systems administrators. The SunPlex environment 
              with its SunPlex Manager tool, integration with Sun<sup>TM</sup> 
              Management Center, and SunPlex Agent Builder tool helps improve 
              the manageability aspect in deploying a SunPlex system.
            <p> <b>Easy Infrastructure Management</b>
            <p> SunPlex systems incorporate system management tools, such as Sun 
              Management Center software and SunPlex Manager, to create a centrally 
              managed hardware and software environment that provides easy administration 
              and lower operating costs. Day-to-day administrative functions can 
              be automated to minimize human errors and to enable faster recovery 
              and consistent service levels. Refer to Sun Cluster 3.0 systems 
              administration guide on <b>http://docs.sun.com</b>.
            <p> To begin, the SunPlex environment can be configured using the 
              SunPlex Manager tool. This is a browser-based tool that enables 
              remote and secure management of the cluster. Installation of the 
              cluster software can be done using Solaris Jumpstart<sup>TM</sup> 
              technologies. This enables faster installation of the cluster software. 
              Continuous monitoring of the cluster is achieved by the integration 
              of Sun Cluster 3.0 with Sun Management Center software. The Sun 
              Management Center integration enable administrators to graphically 
              display cluster resources, resource types, and resource groups. 
              It also enables users to monitor configuration changes and check 
              the status of cluster components. The integration of Sun Cluster 
              3.0 software with the Sun Management Center, Sun StorEdge<sup>TM</sup> 
              Instant Image software, Sun StorEdge Point-in-Time, Sun StorEdge<sup>TM</sup> 
              9900 Truecopy and Sun StorEdge<sup>TM</sup> Network Data Replicator 
              and other products from Sun and its partners ensures a seamless 
              environment designed to deliver highly available application services, 
              within and across datacenters. Customers also have the ability to 
              lower their total cost of ownership by deploying Sun's storage 
              solutions, such as StorEdge Instant Image software and StorEdge 
              Network Data Replicator, within the SunPlex environment. The SunPlex 
              environment can also be deployed in a campus cluster scenario to 
              deliver disaster recovery solutions from Sun.
            <p> <b>Benefits for SAP Deployments</b>
            <p> Sun Cluster 3.0 offers two types of application services to customers 
              who desire high availability. The failover services provide the 
              traditional application failover foundation that leverages the global 
              file service and the global network service to provide for faster 
              failure detection and failover. Vertically scaled applications, 
              such as databases, are most suited for failover services.
            <p> SAP Deployments in a SunPlex environment can benefit from simpler 
              manageability and consistent service levels. Within a SunPlex environment, 
              customers can cluster the central instance, the database and the 
              application servers. With the Scaleable SAP agent and the liveCache 
              agent for SAP, Sun provides a unique solution within the SunPlex 
              environment. With the addition of the liveCache agent customers 
              can get both performance and availability of their applications.
            <p> SAP Deployments in a SunPlex environment can benefit from simpler 
              manageability and consistent service levels. Within a SunPlex environment, 
              customers can cluster the central instance, the database and the 
              application servers. With the Scaleable SAP agent and the liveCache 
              agent for SAP, Sun provides a comprehensive solution within the 
              SunPlex environment. With the liveCache agent customers no longer 
              have to choose between performance and availability of their applications.
            <p> <b>Consistent Service Levels</b>
            <p> Consistent service levels are difficult to attain even in clustered 
              environments. The SunPlex environment, however, has a number of 
              capabilities that meet this challenge. Sun Cluster 3.0 Software 
              enables service level management and helps maintain consistent service 
              levels by isolatin, automating and efficiently managing the failovers 
              of SAP components. In contrast to other clustering solutions, the 
              SunPlex environment for SAP, includes the database and the central 
              instance, and the application servers within the SAP deployment. 
              Additionally, the Scalable SAP agent can be managed with a single 
              agent for all the instances of the application. The prioritized 
              service level management within Sun Cluster 3.0 also helps to ensure 
              that, in the event of a failure, the application server with the 
              higher priority receives the required resources. Prioritized service 
              management can be leveraged for other applications services within 
              a SunPlex environment in addition to SAP. Sun Cluster 3.0 works 
              in conjunction with Solaris Resource Manager allowing resources 
              to the SAP system which has the higher priority to the customer's 
              business process while optimizing the use of server resources.

            <b>Oracle9i RAC in a SunPlex Environment</b>
            <p> Oracle9i RAC can also benefit from the SunPlex environment. Sun 
              and Oracle work closely together to provide reliability, scalability, 
              and manageability to RAC deployments on SunPlex Systems. Sun Cluster 
              3.0 offers an advanced agent for both HA-Oracle and the parallel 
              versions Oracle parallel server and Oracle9i RAC.
            <p> SunPlex Systems also offer support for Remote Shared Memory Technology, 
              which enhances the performance of distributed applications by allowing 
              fast messaging between instances of a distributed application. Oracle 
              is working to incorporate RSM technology into 9iRAC. Refer to the 
              SunPlex system data sheet for Oracle at:

            <b>Easy Agent Development</b>
            <p> Sun provides agents for both HA and scalable application services, 
              and SunPlex Systems offer one of the easiest cluster agent development 
              environment. The SunPlex Agent Builder generates agent codeKsh or 
              C in two simple steps. Additionally, the SunPlex Agent Builder offers 
              the Generic Agent functionality that generates pre-compiled agent 
              binaries that require no code writing or modification.
            <p> Sun provides the flexibility of choosing to deploy a Sun-developed 
              agent, an ISV-developed agent (like IBM DB2, Legato, etc.) or an 
              agent developed in-house with the agent builder tool. If the customer 
              is running an application for which a standard agent from Sun is 
              not available, Sun recommends using the Agent Builder tool or a 
              professional service to help deliver an agent. Cluster Platforms 
              also offer pre-tested, pre-configured SunPlex Systems that can reduce 
              the time to deployment and maximize personnel productivity.
            <p> In summary, the SunPlex environment enabled by Sun Cluster 3.0 
              provides a highly available application service-level management 
              platform and also provides customers with the requisite tools and 
              technologies to quickly and easily deliver and deploy applications 
              in a clustered environment. For more information, refer to "Deploying 
              SunPlex Systems" -- a white paper that outlines some of 
              the SAP and Oracle9i RAC discussion mentioned previously, and Managing
