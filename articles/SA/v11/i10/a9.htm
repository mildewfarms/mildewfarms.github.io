            <h1><b><img src="../../resource/netadmin.gif" width="150" height="150" align="right">Open 
              Shortest Path First Protocol</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Ron McCarty</i>
            <p> In the March 2001 issue of <i>Sys Admin</i>, I covered the Routing 
              Information Protocol (RIP). As discussed in that column, RIP is 
              a distance-based protocol where each node advertises its complete 
              routing table every 30 seconds. The distance is based on a maximum 
              hop count of 15, where 16 represents infinity or a poisoned route 
              that is to be dropped. The limited hop count, along with the practice 
              of advertising the complete routing table, prevents RIP from being 
              the protocol of choice for large networks.
            <p> Opens Shortest Path First (OSPF), on the other hand, is a link 
              state protocol. A link state protocol advertises changes within 
              the network, not the complete routing table. For example, consider 
              the network shown in Figure 1. Using a link state protocol like 
              OSPF, Router A tells Routers B and C that link A1 has failed. The 
              state changes can immediately be sent when Router A notices that 
              A1 has failed, for example, when the CRC errors become so high as 
              to make the link unusable or when it loses its electronic signal. 
              If RIP or another distance vector protocol were used, Router A would 
              wait until its next update (in 30 seconds) to send out its routing 
              table. The routing table would not include the route for path A1, 
              and the change would "slowly" make its way through the 
              network or "converge". OSPF's current version, version 
              2, is defined in RFC 2328, "OSPF Version 2".
            <p> Each OSPF node or router uses a link state advertisement (LSA) 
              to tell other routers about link states it has received from other 
              routers or neighbors through other LSAs and its own links to which 
              it is directly connected. Because only changes are advertised, OSPF 
              routers -- in addition to recognizing failures caused by physical 
              or lower-level protocols -- must also have a mechanism for determining 
              when an OSPF neighbor has failed. The mechanism used here is a Hello 
              protocol, which is a subset of OSPF as defined in RFC 2328.
            <p> These link states are stored in a table within each router and 
              referred to as link state databases.
            <p> <b>Hello Protocol</b>
            <p> The Hello protocol is dependent upon the type of network that 
              connects the OSPF routers. On broadcast networks such as Ethernet 
              and Token Ring, the router sends out a Hello protocol packet using 
              the multicast address of 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6.
            <p> On non-broadcast networks such as X.25, Frame Relay, or ATM, two 
              methods can be used to send the Hello packets: either non-broadcast 
              where all OSPF nodes are known, or point to multipoint where the 
              router communicates with all routers to which it is directly connected. 
              In these scenarios, the destination address of the Hello packet 
              is the actual router's address.
            <p> The Hello packets are sent out to each interface, with one packet 
              listing a minimum of one neighbor in the particular packet. There 
              is no acknowledgement of the Hello packet; instead, the router will 
              expect to receive a Hello packet with its own IP address listed 
              as a neighbor address in a Hello packet from all of its neighbors.
            <p> In addition to the neighbor(s) listed in the packet, the packet 
              also includes the designated router and the backup designated router. 
              The designated router is the router on a broadcast network (such 
              as Ethernet) that is responsible for the particular network so that 
              not all routers within the network will advertise the links outside 
              the broadcast network. (It is beyond the scope of this article, 
              but OSPF also provides a quick convergence of a designated router 
              failure using the backup designated router and new elections through 
              the Hello protocol). OSPF also contains four other message types: 
              database description packets, link state requests, link state updates, 
              and link state acknowledgements.
            <p> The database description packets is used whenever nodes recognize 
              each other as running OSPF. During the first communications (called 
              creating adjacency), the nodes will transfer the contents of the 
              link state tables. Additionally, link state requests, link state 
              update, and link state acknowledgements are used by the protocol 
              for received and acknowledging link state changes. Section 10.10 
              of RFC 2328 gives a detailed overview of routers creating adjacency.
            <p> <b>Route Costs</b>
            <p> One of OSPF's major benefits is its concept of costs for 
              routes. RFC 2328 allows the administrator to specify cost; however, 
              most organizations and vendors follow Cisco's lead and define 
              the route as directly proportional to its bandwidth. (Remember, 
              RIP only uses distance vector based on a count -- the protocol 
              does not distinguish between a dial-up, 56-K line, and a 100-Mbit 
              Ethernet.) This route cost is what determines the shortest path, 
              hence the name Open Shortest Path First.
            <p> <b>OSPF Topology</b>
            <p> After an overview of the basics of OSPF, you might have recognized 
              a weakness of OSPF -- scaling. With advertisements flooding 
              immediately through the network, large networks could not have a 
              router's failure consuming all available bandwidth as routing 
              tables were updated and changes advertised; therefore, OSPF uses 
              the concepts of areas to define smaller databases in the larger 
              autonomous system. Figure 2 shows two areas with separate link-state 
              databases. Each router within an area will have the same link-state 
              database as the rest of the routers in the area; however, each of 
              the routers within the area will have no state information on other 
              areas within the complete autonomous system with the exceptions 
              of routers connected to two areas. Such routers are aptly named 
              "area border routers".
            <p> To support the scaling of areas, OSPF makes use of an OSPF backbone 
              called Area 0 or 0.0.0.0. Area 0 contains all area border routers 
              as shown in Figure 3. If area border routers are not directly connected, 
              then they can be logically connected using OSPF virtual links. The 
              virtual link simply defines the path for the OSPF protocol to travel. 
              An area 0 using virtual paths is shown in Figure 4.
            <p> By dividing an OSPF network into areas, link-state databases are 
              smaller and more manageable, which directly impacts the amount of 
              bandwidth needed to advertise a change.
            <p> <b>OSPF on Routers</b>
            <p> The major router vendors support OSPF. Below follows a list of 
              some additional resources for vendor-specific OSPF implementations. 
              Keep in mind that most shops will tend to deploy all OSPF nodes 
              on the same hardware, with an interoperability required at the area 
              border router, if at all.

OSPF on UNIX
</pre>
            OSPF is not as widespread on UNIX systems as RIP since OSPF will typically 
            be deployed in large IP networks with dedicated infrastructure staff 
            to support routers; however, OSPF is available and can be used where 
            host-based routing is used. There are several implementations, most 
            notably:
            <p> 
            <p> Zebra (<b>http://www.zebra.org/</b>) is an open source solution 
              and commercial (<b>http://www.ipinfusion.com/</b>) offering that 
              has a very Cisco-like user interface.
            <p> gated (<b>http://www.nexthop.com/products/gated.shtml</b>) is 
              a commercial offering with roots in the original gated implementation 
              found on most UNIX systems.
            <p> MRTd (<b>http://www.mrtd.net/</b>) or Multi-Threaded Routing Tool 
              Kit is an open source solution funded by the National Science Foundation, 
              but it has not received a lot of development or press lately.
            <p> A Linux implementation of OSPF to supplement the book OSPF Complete 
              Implementation is available at: <b>http://www.ospf.org/</b>.
