            <p>"Innovation happens faster in a down market." I recently 
              read this quote by Carl Howe, a principal analyst for Forrester, 
              and I really liked it. It makes me more optimistic than perhaps 
              I should be right now.
            <p> In the story I read on NewsFactor.com, Howe was commenting on 
              the many microprocessors that are scheduled for release at the 15th 
              Microprocessor Forum in October. More than 15 new microprocessors 
              from major manufacturers are being announced, which leads analysts 
              like Howe to point out that even companies that are trying to cut 
              costs rarely reduce their research and development staff.
            <p> And lately, it has seemed that researchers everywhere, besides 
              building faster microprocessors, are developing technologies that 
              have the potential to change the world. For example, Vinton Cerf 
              (co-designer of TCP/IP) is pursuing the idea of an Interplanetary 
              Internet, which among other things will allow astronauts to be able 
              to access the Internet.
            <p> Other researchers are working on quantum cryptography, which uses 
              principles of quantum mechanics to ensure that encrypted material 
              will be secure, not just until computing power catches up to where 
              someone can crack the algorithm, but forever. For more information, 
              see <i>PC Magazine's</i> special report on quantum cryptography 
              at: <b>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,440168,00.asp</b>.
            <p> Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web) is fostering 
              the idea of a Semantic Web. This huge project involves building 
              a vast framework of metadata with which to catalog the Web and, 
              in the words of Berners-Lee, take the "Web of today to a Web 
              in which machine reasoning will be ubiquitous and devastatingly 
              powerful." See: <b>http://www.w3.org/designissues/semantic.html</b> 
              for Berners-Lee's draft of the project.
            <p> These ideas and innovations inspire great optimism about the future, 
              which is intrinsically the future of technology. The quote from 
              Howe above also reminds me of a question posed in a meeting not 
              too long ago. The question was "Where do you want to be when 
              the market recovers?" The answer, of course, is different for 
              everyone, but the implication is the same. If you have more time 
              because business is slow, spend some of it on research and development. 
              Try to improve your processes and get more out of your systems. 
              Put yourself there now, so you'll be ready.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> 
            <p>
