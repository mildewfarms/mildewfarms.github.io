              -- A top-like Clone for MySQL</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Werner Klauser</i>
            <p>mytop is a console-based (non-GUI) tool 
              that allows you to monitor MySQL 3.22.x, 3.23.x, and 4.x servers 
              by viewing active threads, queries, and overall server performance 
              numbers. mytop was inspired by the popular system monitoring tool 
              "top". It runs on most UNIX systems (including Mac OS 
              X) that have Perl and the DBI and DBD::mysql modules installed.
            <p> Basically, it connects with the MySQL server, periodically runs 
              the <b>SHOW PROCESSLIST</b> and <b>SHOW STATUS</b> commands and 
              attempts to summarize this information in a useful and informative 
              format. A goal of mytop is to show SQL statements that persist longer 
              than expected. Often these can indicate where MySQL might be having 
              problems, where a query is not optimally set up, or where the creation 
              of indexes might help speed the query.
            <p> This useful tool was developed, copyrighted, and is maintained 
              by Jeremy D. Zawodny, a MySQL expert, and is licensed under the

Availability and Installation
</pre>
            The latest version of mytop is available from:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/mytop/
</pre>
            After downloading it, you must execute the following steps to install 
            it:
            <p> 
            <pre>
tar -zxvf mytop-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz
cd mytop-&lt;version&gt;
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
</pre>
            <b>Optional Color Support</b>
            <p> If you want color support, install Term::ANSIColor from the CPAN: 
              <b>http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=ANSIColor</b>. mytop will 
              then automatically use colors to display its output.
            <p> <b>mytop's Display</b>
            <p> The mytop display screen is broken into two parts (Figure 1). 
              The top four lines (header) contain summary information about your 
              MySQL server:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> The first line identifies the hostname of your server (localhost) 
                and the version of your MySQL. The right-hand side shows the uptime 
                of the MySQL server process in days+hours:minutes:seconds format, 
                as well as the current time. 
              <li> The second line displays the total number of queries the server 
                has processed, the average number of queries per second, and the 
                number of slow queries. 
              <li> The third line deals with threads. Versions of MySQL before 
                3.23.x did not provide this information, which means that only 
                zeros are seen. 
              <li> The fourth line displays key buffer efficiency (how often keys 
                are read from the more efficient buffer rather than the disk) 
                and the number of bytes that your MySQL has sent and received.
            </ul>
            <p> You can toggle the header by using the "h" key when 
              running mytop.
            <p> The second part of the display lists as many threads as can fit 
              on the screen. By default, they are sorted according to their idle 
              time (least idle first). A display line looks like this:
            <p> 
            <pre>
    ID    User      Host     Dbase Idle Command  Query Info
    --    ----      ----     ----- ---- -------  ----------
220526  apache localhost ACholding    1   Query  SELECT * FROM parts WHER
</pre>
            The user, <b>apache</b> (Web server), running locally is running the 
            SQL query beginning with <b>SELECT * FROM parts WHER</b>. Because 
            the query information is often the information in which you're 
            interested, and because it is limited to the screen's width, 
            it is best to run mytop in an xterm window that is as wide as possible.
            <p> <b>Arguments and Configuration File</b>
            <p> A list of mytop's arguments shows both the tool's flexibilities 
              and capabilities. See Figure 2. To avoid having to use bulky command-line 
              parameters, mytop also supports a configuration file named <b>.mytop</b> 
              found in your home directory. mytop automatically reads this configuration 
              file before command-line arguments are processed, which means that 
              command-line arguments will override directives found in the configuration 
              file.
            <p> The following <b>~/.mytop</b> configuration file implements the 
              default command-line arguments:
            <p> 
            <pre>
user=root
pass=
host=localhost
db=test
delay=5
port=3306
batchmode=0
header=1
color=1
idle=1
</pre>
            It is best to use a configuration file when a database password is 
            used. This prevents users from seeing it on the command-line when 
            viewing the running processes using <b>ps -ef</b> or something similar. 
            Be sure that the permissions on <b>~/.mytop</b> are adequate so that 
            inquisitive eyes cannot read it.
            <p> Another feature of mytop is its shortcut keys, which work while 
              mytop is running. See Figure 3.
            <p> <b>Conclusion</b>
            <p> You can use mytop not only to see what your system is doing properly, 
              but also to see what it could be doing better. Seeing a query for 
              too long might indicate a source of performance problems. mytop's 
              informative output not only shows how MySQL is working for you, 
              it might help it work better.
