            <p> Aptitune Corporation has announced the release of SarCheck Version 
              5.0 for AIX. According to the company, SarCheck is a performance 
              management tool that assists systems administrators in the analysis 
              of system performance by translating the output of several monitoring 
              utilities into a plain English or HTML-formatted report. SarCheck 
              identifies performance bottlenecks, finds runaway processes and 
              memory leaks, recommends changes to various tunable parameters and 
              hardware configurations, and quantifies remaining system capacity.
            <p> One new feature in SarCheck Version 5.0 is its graphing capabilities 
              -- it uses gnuplot to create graphs on the fly and inserts them 
              into its HTML output. Both PNG and JPEG graphs are supported, and 
              the graphs highlight information specific to the operating system 
              and the values of various kernel parameters.
            <p> SarCheck runs on many UNIX platforms, and support for other platforms 
              is planned. For more information, contact: <i>Aptitune Corporation,
