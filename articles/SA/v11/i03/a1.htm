              IOS HTTP Authorization Vulnerability </h1>
            <p> <i>Karen Kent Frederick</i>
            <p> Cisco IOS security is often overlooked as a critical aspect of 
              overall information security. Many systems administrators are not 
              aware that lax router and switch security may lead to major system 
              compromises. In this article, I discuss Cisco IOS security and how 
              following best security practices can prevent the success of many 
              attacks. Much of my discussion focuses on the Cisco IOS HTTP Authorization 
              Vulnerability, which could allow attackers to easily gain administrative-level 
              access to vulnerable Cisco devices. I'll also show that environments 
              that had implemented strong security measures for their Cisco devices 
              were generally not susceptible to this vulnerability.
            <p> <b>Cisco IOS HTTP Authorization Vulnerability</b>
            <p> Cisco IOS (Internetworking Operating System) is the software used 
              to configure and monitor many (but not all) Cisco routers, switches, 
              and other devices. Administrators connect to Cisco devices using 
              a variety of methods, such as telnet, modem lines, and local console 
              access. Generally, these users are using the Cisco CLI (Command 
              Line Interface) to interact with the Cisco device. An alternative 
              to these methods is the Cisco IOS HTTP server, which has been included 
              in more recent versions of the Cisco IOS software. It runs on the 
              Cisco device that the administrator chooses, and it allows administrators 
              to monitor or reconfigure a Cisco device remotely through a Web 
              browser. Although many of the same functions can be performed using 
              the CLI or the HTTP server, some users prefer the HTTP method because 
              they find it to be easier or more convenient than the CLI.
            <p> In mid-2001, Cisco released a security advisory pertaining to 
              a vulnerability related to their IOS HTTP server. This vulnerability 
              (the Cisco IOS HTTP Authorization Vulnerability) affected various 
              Cisco IOS releases from 11.3 through 12.2, running on dozens of 
              models of Cisco routers and switches. The advisory stated that the 
              vulnerability existed on such devices with the HTTP server enabled 
              and with local authentication being used for HTTP users, which means 
              that their usernames and passwords are on the local device, not 
              in a remote authentication system such as RADIUS. By exploiting 
              the vulnerability, an attacker could gain complete access to the 
              Cisco device, with the ability to remotely execute commands on the 
              device at level 15 (the enable level). This is the highest privilege 
              level, which allows configuration changes to be made. Normally, 
              you must use the enable password in order to work at this level, 
              however, this vulnerability allows attackers to execute commands 
              at the enable level without using the enable password.
            <p> This vulnerability is particularly dangerous not only because 
              the attacker can gain full administrative access, but also because 
              the vulnerability is extremely easy to exploit. Typically, you would 
              expect to see the Cisco device's HTTP server accessed through 
              URLs like the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://10.1.2.3/level/15/exec/show/config
</pre>
            The format of these URLs follows a standard:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> The first part is the IP address of the Cisco device. 
              <li> The second item must always be <b>level</b>. 
              <li> The third part (the number 15 in this example) corresponds 
                to the privilege level. Level 15, the enable level, is the highest 
                of the 16 privilege levels; 0 is the lowest level, which provides 
                very limited functionality. Any value between 00 and 15 is valid 
                here. 
              <li> The fourth item is always <b>exec</b>. 
              <li> The rest of the URL is optional. If supplied, it should correspond 
                to a command. In this case, the command-line equivalent of the 
                command that is being sent in this URL is <b>show config</b>.
            </ul>
            <p> To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker supplies similar URLs 
              to the Cisco device, except that she supplies privilege level values 
              between 16 and 99. So an example of an exploit attempt is:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://10.1.2.3/level/16/exec/show/config
</pre>
            Not all the values between 16 and 99 will work; in fact, often only 
            one number in that range will be able to exploit the vulnerability. 
            The correct level number needed to exploit the vulnerability will 
            differ among IOS versions and device types and models. Because the 
            attacker can specify anything that she wants to after the <b>exec</b>, 
            she can perform any available IOS command using this method after 
            she discovers which privilege level allows the vulnerability to be 
            exploited.
            <p> It's important to note that this exploit will only work if 
              local authentication is being used. If you are using a different 
              authentication method for HTTP users, such as RADIUS or TACACS+, 
              any attempt to exploit this vulnerability will fail and the attacker 
              will be prompted to authenticate herself.
            <p> <b>Published Exploits</b>
            <p> Since this vulnerability is so easy to exploit, attackers could 
              literally start compromising Cisco devices immediately after learning 
              of its details, which were widely available. Within days of the 
              Cisco security advisory, several people had written and published 
              programs to find or attack vulnerable devices. Again, because the 
              exploit is so simple, some of these programs required fewer than 
              twenty lines of code and each program had a somewhat different purpose 
              or methodology.
            <p> One published exploit allowed the attacker to scan a particular 
              network block for vulnerable Cisco devices by trying every privilege 
              level between 16 and 99 for each IP address and monitoring the HTTP 
              response codes. Any device that returned a 200 code, indicating 
              that the command was successful, had its IP address and vulnerable 
              privilege level logged to a file. Another published exploit was 
              more user friendly; it performed a similar scan but when it found 
              a vulnerable device, it prompted the attacker to choose another 
              action (such as altering the message of the day, displaying configuration 
              information, or performing any IOS command as specified by the attacker).
            <p> Because this vulnerability can provide full device access to an 
              attacker, the attacker can do anything she chooses to the device 
              -- cause a denial of service, or reconfigure it. Attackers can 
              alter the ACLs to allow other types of traffic through to set up 
              more attacks. Perhaps you use the same passwords on multiple devices, 
              so compromising one device and getting its passwords can quickly 
              compromise other devices as well, or the device might be used to 
              gain reconnaissance information about other devices, again to set 
              up future attacks.
            <p> <b>Eliminating the Vulnerability</b>
            <p> This vulnerability depended on three conditions: a susceptible 
              IOS version, an enabled HTTP server on the device, and local authentication 
              in use for HTTP users. By eliminating any of the three of these 
              conditions, the vulnerability is eliminated, and these exploit attempts 
              will fail. (There is an exception to this -- in Cisco IOS version 
              12.2(2)T with IPv6 enabled, its HTTP server cannot be disabled.) 
              However, all three of these items already present other security 
              weaknesses, so it may be prudent to eliminate two or all three of 
              the conditions.
            <p> Cisco advises that one way to eliminate the vulnerability is to 
              stop using local authentication for HTTP users. Alternatives such 
              as Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS+) or 
              RADIUS should be used instead for HTTP authentication. Information 
              on how to implement TACACS+ is available at <b>http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/480/tacplus.shtml</b>.
            <p> Another way to eliminate the vulnerability is to upgrade to a 
              newer IOS version that is not vulnerable. The appropriate IOS version 
              depends on what device you're using, so check the latest information 
              on the Cisco site to know which version to use. However, before 
              upgrading, don't forget to make sure that you have sufficient 
              resources in your device, such as enough memory, to handle the new 
              IOS version.
            <p> A third way to eliminate the vulnerability is to disable the HTTP 
              server, which can be done by issuing the command <b>no ip http server</b>. 
              The HTTP server is only one of several methods that can be used 
              to view and modify Cisco IOS configurations. If none of your administrators 
              use the HTTP server, it should definitely be disabled. If you are 
              using a vulnerable IOS version and are using local authentication 
              for HTTP, you should immediately disable the HTTP server and use 
              other methods for configuring the device until you can upgrade IOS 
              or change the authentication method.
            <p> <b>Improving Your Cisco IOS Device Security</b>
            <p> Good Cisco IOS security practices are very similar to that of 
              servers and workstations. The details are certainly different, but 
              the underlying principles are all the same -- after all, Cisco 
              IOS is an operating system. Here are several actions that you can 
              take to strengthen your Cisco IOS security:
            <p> 
            <p> 1. Subscribe to Cisco security mailing lists and promptly read 
              all Cisco security advisories that pertain to devices and models 
              in your environment. Security advisories are mailed to Cisco's 
              cust-security-announce mailing list, and they are also posted to 
              <b>http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/advisory.html</b>. 
            <p> 2. Be aware that many Cisco passwords are passed between users 
              and the Cisco device in cleartext. Telnet is an obvious example, 
              but many people are not aware that when you are using the HTTP server 
              the password (often at the enable level) is passed in cleartext 
              in each URL. (The password is base64 encoded, which is far different 
              from encrypted; it's trivial to decode it.) Be cautious about 
              using any connection methods that send passwords in cleartext on 
              networks that may be sniffed, particularly public networks. Even 
              on internal networks, there may still be a substantial risk because 
              users could be running their own sniffing software, or Trojans could 
              be monitoring traffic and collecting passwords. 
            <p> 3. Use different passwords for different functions and on different 
              Cisco devices. For example, the enable password should not be the 
              same as the HTTP password because the HTTP password is transmitted 
              in cleartext. Also, if you use the same passwords on every router 
              and an attacker obtains one password, he will be able to log in 
              to every router. It's also a good practice to change passwords 
              regularly.
            <p> 4. It's vital that you do proper logging on your Cisco devices. 
              AAA logging will record such things as logins, privilege levels, 
              and HTTP accesses. This information is extremely valuable for incident 
              handling purposes when a vulnerability is being exploited, because 
              it provides a record of how the device was exploited and what the 
              nature of the exploit was.
            <p> 5. Restrict network connectivity to Cisco devices. For example, 
              an external user shouldn't have any legitimate reason to initiate 
              a telnet connection to one of your internal routers. By configuring 
              your firewalls and router ACLs to prevent direct connections to 
              these devices, you can prevent the exploit of some vulnerabilities. 
              Note that your Internet router may remain unprotected by this; perhaps 
              your ISP can block connections directly to it. Also remember that 
              there are many different connection methods, so you're safest 
              blocking access to the Cisco device IPs instead of blocking by individual 
              services, such as telnet. It's also a good idea to use <b>ip 
              access-class</b> to specify which IP addresses can make a connection 
              with each VTY. 
            <p> 6. Secure each access method for connecting to Cisco devices, 
              which includes restricting physical access to routers and switches, 
              as well as limiting modem and serial line access and network-based 
              methods such as telnet, rlogin, and ssh. Each VTY or TTY should 
              either require authentication or should be configured to prevent 
              logins. Also, each VTY should be configured using <b>transport input</b> 
              to specify which access methods are permitted to connect to it. 
            <p> 7. Disable all unnecessary services. Depending on the IOS version 
              and device model, various services may be enabled that you're 
              not even aware of. The small services (i.e., echo, chargen, and 
              discard) are rarely used legitimately but can be used in attacks. 
              These can be disabled through the <b>no service tcp-small-servers</b> 
              and <b>no service udp-small-servers</b> commands. Finger should 
              normally be disabled as well; other services such as the Cisco Discovery 
              Protocol (CDP), HTTP, the Network Time Protocol (NTP), and SNMP 
              should be disabled if not used, or otherwise configured in a secure 
              manner. Also, if you only want a service to be available on some 
              interfaces, make sure to disable it from the other interfaces.
            <p> 
            <p> Implementing just one or two of these items is not recommended 
              -- it's best to implement them all (if possible in your 
              environment). A fundamental security concept is that of a layered 
              defense. If a device is only protected by one security mechanism, 
              its defenses are quite weak. By implementing multiple security mechanisms, 
              you increase the amount of protection and decrease the likelihood 
              that a vulnerability can be exploited. In a layered defense, you 
              would use router ACLs and firewall rules to block access to a device. 
              You'd harden the device by following good Cisco IOS security 
              practices, such as removing unnecessary services. Also, you'd 
              maintain the device's security by keeping it currently patched 
              (particularly with security-related patches) and by auditing its 
              configuration periodically. A great source of information on protecting 
              your devices is "Improving Security on Cisco Routers", 
              available at <b>http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/21.html</b>.
            <p> Besides limiting access to Cisco devices and configuring them 
              to limit exposure to vulnerabilities, another important security 
              measure that can help to protect your systems is network intrusion 
              detection. It is highly useful to identify attackers probing for 
              vulnerabilities or attempting to exploit things. Because of the 
              severity of the Cisco IOS HTTP Authorization Vulnerability, some 
              intrusion detection companies released signatures within hours of 
              the Cisco security advisory, which sent administrators an alert 
              when an attacker attempted to exploit this vulnerability. In some 
              cases, the signatures also attempted to determine whether the attack 
              had been successful. So in an environment with current and robust 
              intrusion detection technologies deployed, successful attack attempts 
              could have been reported to systems administrators within seconds 
              of occurring. See the "Other Cisco IOS Vulnerabilities" 
              sidebar for other security-related vulnerabilities.
            <p> <b>Conclusion</b>
            <p> In this article, I've taken a close look at the Cisco IOS 
              HTTP Authorization Vulnerability, under what conditions it occurs, 
              and how it can easily be exploited. More importantly, I've 
              focused on the methods that can be used to eliminate the vulnerability. 
              By following good Cisco IOS security practices, as well as implementing 
              a good network intrusion detection solution, you can greatly reduce 
              the risk that your Cisco devices will be exploited now or in the 
              future. If you approach Cisco IOS security with the same mindset 
              you use when protecting a critical server, you can improve the overall 
              security of your network infrastructure.
