            <p>With this March issue, we include our third supplemental issue 
              of <i>The Perl Journal</i>. These supplements have been well received 
              by readers, and I particularly appreciate the feedback from previous 
              <i>TPJ</i> subscribers expressing their gratitude and support of 
              our efforts on behalf of <i>TPJ</i>. Some time ago, <i>Sys Admin</i>'s 
              publisher posted an open letter to readers on the <i>TPJ</i> Web 
              site explaining the necessity of binding <i>TPJ</i> into <i>Sys 
              Admin</i>. To recap the publisher's statements, the challenges 
              to the high-tech industry in the second half of 2001 took a toll 
              on high-tech publications in the form of reduced ad dollars and 
              forced many magazines to adopt severe cost-saving measures. For 
              example, big news magazines such as <i>Computerworld</i> and <i>Infoworld</i> 
              recently reduced circulation by as much as 40% to save on expenses, 
              and <i>Internetworld</i>, a sister CMP publication, has ceased publication. 
              Binding <i>TPJ</i> into <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine allows <i>TPJ</i> 
              to survive, and I hope provides a place where it will thrive.
            <p> There's been a sense lately of a shift in the market and 
              a more positive outlook for the future. In the field of systems 
              administration, just as in other areas, it seems that now is the 
              time to re-evaluate our current practices and look toward future 
              improvements. With tight budgets all around, we may not be able 
              to afford frivolous expenditure on the sexiest new piece of hardware. 
              To mitigate risk, we must look for proven technologies with minimal 
              up-front costs. Now is the time for pragmatic decision-making, careful 
              scrutiny of existing systems and policies, and for enhancing what 
              we have. We must also continue to educate ourselves and users in 
              the process of improving the security and reliability of our systems.
            <p> One particular article in this issue of <i>TPJ</i> represents 
              these ideas in action. In his article, "...And Now for Something 
              Completely Similar", Damian Conway provides insight into the 
              evolving state of the Perl language. In his entertaining and cogent 
              style, Conway describes the changes that users will see with Perl 
              6 and compares them to the current standard. He writes, "... 
              the real problem doesn't stem from those changes, nor even 
              from people's exaggerated fear of them. The real problem stems 
              from several billion years of evolution, which have inconveniently 
              wired our brains entirely the wrong way. The trouble is, we're 
              adapted to detect, highlight, and focus on anything new, different, 
              surprising, or unexpected and to ignore the old, the commonplace, 
              and the familiar."
            <p> Conway tells us that Perl 6 will certainly be different from Perl 
              5, but never gratuitously so. He says, "When syntax or semantics 
              change, it will always be a change for the better: for greater consistency, 
              for more intuitability, for extra Do-What-I-Meanness." These 
              guidelines can be just as sensibly applied to systems administration. 
              We must strive to implement only those security measures and policy 
              changes that will truly benefit our systems and users, and I hope 
              that the articles in <i>Sys Admin</i> and <i>The Perl Journal</i> 
              will be useful to you in making such decisions for your company.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> 
            <p>
