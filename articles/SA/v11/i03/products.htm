            <p> <b>Radware Announces Peer Director</b>
            <p> Radware announced the release of Peer Director, an ITM device 
              that dynamically manages Cisco and Juniper IP Backbone traffic. 
              According to the company, the Peer Director introduces traffic management 
              capabilities in multi-homed network environments that utilize Border 
              Gateway Patrol (BGP), the most common method of connecting disparate 
              backbone networks across the Internet. Radware's Peer Director 
              gathers and analyzes real-time statistics associated with Internet 
              traffic carried on multiple links. Based on these statistics and 
              in conjunction with customizable user-defined policies, Peer Director 
              redistributes and optimizes traffic loads between the links through 
              multiple load-balancing algorithms that are proprietary to Radware. 
              Peer Director automatically redirects users to the healthiest link, 
              thereby avoiding traffic congestion that often affect BGP routing 
              schemes.

            <p> <b>everStor Adds Linux Feature to Replicator</b>
            <p> everStor Software Corporation has added a "One-to-Many" 
              Linux feature to its Replicator storage management software. According 
              to everStor, the new feature allows systems administrators to mirror 
              data to multiple local and remote storage locations on their enterprises.

              and archiving. Replicator can now push data from a single computer 
              to multiple Windows-based and UNIX-based computers, which allows
