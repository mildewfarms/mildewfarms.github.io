            <H1>Other Cisco IOS Vulnerabilities</h1>
            <p> In addition to the Cisco IOS HTTP Authorization Vulnerability, 
              several other security-related vulnerabilities have been discovered 
              in recent IOS versions. Here are brief descriptions of a few of 
              those vulnerabilities, along with how each one can be eliminated. 
              Notice that most of these vulnerabilities would not be present in 
              an environment where strong IOS security measures are in place.
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Three different SSH vulnerabilities were announced in a single 
                advisory. The most severe of the three could permit SSH sessions 
                to be decrypted. The only reasonable option for eliminating this 
                vulnerability is to upgrade IOS to a non-vulnerable version. An 
                alternative option is to disable SSH access, but this will likely 
                introduce more serious security problems by forcing administrators 
                to use telnet and other cleartext connection methods, so it should 
                only be done as a last resort if it's simply not possible 
                to immediately update the IOS. 
              <li> An attacker can crash a device that has the Point-to-Point 
                Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) enabled by sending an abnormal PPTP 
                packet to it. Similar to the SSH vulnerability, the options in 
                this case are to disable PPTP or to upgrade the IOS version. Of 
                course, if the device does not need to be running PPTP, it should 
                have already been disabled. 
              <li> One IOS vulnerability only affected the Cisco 6400 Access Concentrator 
                Node Route Processor 2 (NRP2). If a VTY did not have a password 
                set, anyone could access it via telnet. As with the other vulnerabilities, 
                it can be eliminated by upgrading the IOS to a non-vulnerable 
                version. The quick fix is to set passwords for each VTY. As mentioned 
                earlier, you should either have authentication properly configured 
                for a VTY or disable interactive logins on it. 
              <li> Certain IOS versions do not properly handle connection attempts 
                to certain TCP port numbers. After such an attempt, the router 
                will reload the next time that its configuration information is 
                accessed. The port numbers related to this vulnerability are unused 
                by IOS, so there shouldn't be any legitimate attempts to 
                contact them. Of course, upgrading to a non-vulnerable IOS version 
                will eliminate the vulnerability; also, implementing firewall 
                rules and router ACLs to block such connection attempts to routers 
                could also reduce the risk of an exploit attempt.
