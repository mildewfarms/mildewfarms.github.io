              and Answers</h1>
            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm writing a CGI script 
              that takes input from a Web page and does some data sanitizing for 
              security purposes. To be sure that I catch everything, I'm 
              running Perl with taint checks on. Every time I try to test the 
              script, however, I get the following error:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Too late for "-T" option at addform.cgi line 1.
</pre>
            I've removed pretty much everything but the <b>#!</b> line from 
            the script in order to debug this, and I'm still getting the 
            error. How can the first line of the script be too late, especially 
            when that's pretty much the only thing in there? Here's 
            the first line:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -T
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You don't specifically say how 
            you're testing this script, but I'm guessing you're 
            trying to execute it from the command line by running:
            <p> 
            <pre>
perl addform.cgi
</pre>
            If that's the case, Perl is complaining because you're calling 
            it from the command line without specifying <b>-T</b> on the command 
            line itself. You can either specify <b>-T</b> on the command line:
            <p> 
            <pre>
perl -T addform.cgi
</pre>
            or, better yet, don't invoke the command by calling Perl first. 
            You can just make your script executable and call it as:
            <p> 
            <pre>
./addform.cgi
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have Solaris 8 running on an Ultra 
            450. Occasionally, when I attempt to do an <b>init 6</b>, I only get 
            the prompt back and the machine refuses to shut down. I was under 
            the impression that <b>init 6</b> should bring the machine down and 
            bring it back up to the default mode (multiuser, in our case). Is 
            there some reason why <b>init</b> (I also tried <b>shutdown</b>) does 
            not work?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> <b>Shutdown</b> gives you the 
              choice of sending out a message via wall and delaying the shutdown, 
              but then it merely calls <b>init</b>. An <b>init</b> directive can 
              fail if one of the <b>rc.*</b> shutdown scripts does not finish 
              for some reason. If you're seeing this sporadically, this could 
              be the result of a process waiting for I/O. To try and track down 
              the culprit, do a <b>ps</b> and look for processes with an <b>rc</b> 
              in their names that have been spawned by <b>init</b>. If the system 
              absolutely refuses to shut down with <b>init</b>, you can manually 
              kill off the stuck process, or use <b>sync; sync; sync; halt</b>. 
              You want the syncs to flush the I/O buffer to disk before bringing 
              the machine down.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm in the process of writing 
              a fairly complex set of CGI forms for our corporate Web pages. I've 
              done a bit of Perl, but not necessarily much in the way of CGI programming, 
              and I'm finding it's a bit different. One thing I find 
              frustrating is that debugging is harder because some fairly obscure 
              messages get written to the Apache logs, and I just get a non-informative 
              500 error in the Web browser itself. Is there a way to actually 
              see what the problems are in the browser, and is there any way I 
              can get more verbose error reporting?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Instead of using Perl's 
              stock <b>warn</b> and <b>die</b> functions, try using the <b>CGI::Carp</b> 
              module. It replaces <b>warn</b> and <b>die</b>, plus the normal 
              Carp module's <b>carp</b>, <b>croak</b>, and <b>confess</b> 
              functions with more verbose versions. If you're not familiar 
              with using modules, you can get more information on them by running 
              <b>perldoc -q</b> module. To use the <b>CGI::Carp</b> module, just 
              put the following line at the top of your script:
            <p> 
            <pre>
use CGI::Carp;
</pre>
            You can also have <b>CGI::Carp</b> output to a logfile of your choice 
            if you're not happy sifting through the server error logs:
            <p> 
            <pre>
BEGIN {
  use CGI::Carp qw(carpout);
  open(LOG, "&gt;&gt;/tmp/cgi.log")
    or die "Unable to append to /tmp/cgi.log: $!\n";
  carpout(*LOG);
}
</pre>
            <b>CGI::Carp</b> also fulfills your request to have fatal errors sent 
            back to the browser for debugging:
            <p> 
            <pre>
use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
</pre>
            The CGI::Carp module will try to push data out to the browser, even 
            if the error happens before the HTTP header is generated. Normal warnings 
            still go out to the file you've defined with <b>carpout</b>, 
            or to the daemon error log by default.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm using UFS snapshots on 
              Solaris 8, and they were working great until recently. Now, when 
              I try to use it to back up the root directory (<b>/</b>), I get 
              the following error:
            <p> 
            <pre>
snapshot error: File system could not be write locked
</pre>
            I haven't changed anything with the snapshots since I set them 
            up, so I'm rather perplexed as to why they suddenly stopped working. 
            Any ideas?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There's a known bug (#4458695) 
              that is most likely the cause of your problem. If you're running 
              something in the real-time scheduling class with a <b>/</b> as its 
              current directory, you'll see this behavior. <b>Lockfs</b> 
              fails if a process has its pages locked in memory. The most common 
              culprit is <b>xntpd</b>, and you can shut it off while you're 
              doing the backup.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I wrote a Perl script that's 
              supposed to take a command as input and then format the output. 
              This works fine for normal system commands, but I'm also trying 
              to get it to work for aliases as the argument (such as <b>dir</b> 
              instead of <b>ls</b>), because many people here are attached to 
              their aliases. To do this, I'm invoking the command via back 
              tics in the Perl script, and I've also tried a system call. 
              Neither of these seem to be invoking the proper shell (<b>bash</b>), 
              however. Instead, Perl invokes <b>sh</b> to run all of its commands, 
              and <b>sh</b> doesn't have aliases. Is there a way around this? 
              Can I get Perl to somehow read the aliases?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Perl does indeed call <b>sh</b> 
              when you invoke external programs from within it. Instead of independently 
              trying to read the aliases from people's dot files, you can 
              instead use <b>system</b> to explicitly invoke the user's shell. 
              If you're only concerned about <b>bash</b>, it's something 
              as simple as:
            <p> 
            <pre>
system('/path/to/bash', '-ci', $COMMAND);
</pre>
            This assumes that you've defined <b>$COMMAND</b> previously, 
            of course. If you want to be more flexible, you can read the environment 
            variable for the user's shell (<b>$ENV{'SHELL'}</b>) and have 
            an <b>if</b> statement that invokes the proper shell for each individual 
            user. As a fall-through case, you could just let Perl pass it off 
            to <b>/bin/sh</b>. Be sure to only allow specific shells, though, 
            and not to just blindly invoke whatever people set for their shell 
            environments.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We need to have more than seven 
              partitions on a large data stripe. I used Veritas Volume Manager 
              at my old job, so I know this was possible with their software. 
              Due to budgeting crunches, however, our CIO does not want to spend 
              the money to buy Veritas's expensive licenses. Is there a way 
              to accomplish the same thing with Solstice DiskSuite? I've 
              looked at all the documentation, but it looks like we're still 
              stuck with the disk slice restriction. We're running Solaris 
              8 on E450s.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Starting with version 4.2.1 with 
              patch 108693-06, Solstice DiskSuite supports soft partitions. This 
              is similar to Veritas Volume Manager's ability to create large 
              numbers of virtual partitions on either one disk or multiple disks 
              striped or concatenated together. DiskSuite soft partitions can 
              be created on top of a physical disk, RAID 0, RAID 1, or RAID 5 
              volume. Sun hasn't updated their documentation on <b>docs.sun.com</b> 
              yet because this was functionality added on by a patch, but if you 
              download and install the version of SDS from:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/ds/ds-disksuite/
</pre>
            the accompanying man page has more information on the soft partitions 
            feature and how to set it up. Also, a decent primer seems to be:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.primushost.com/~griff/soft-partitions.html
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a Sun 280R server that's 
            hooked up to an external RAID box via two different SCSI cards. Is 
            there any way to have the 280R provide redundant failover?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You don't mention what kind 
              of external RAID you've got attached to the system. If you 
              have a hardware RAID box, you can use specialized software that 
              will work with the RAID controllers in the box. If you just have 
              a generic JBOD RAID box attached via two generic SCSI cards, then 
              you may want to look at Dynamic Multipathing for Solaris 8. You 
              can get this functionality by purchasing Veritas Volume Manager, 
              or if you have one of Sun's StorEdge boxes, they usually come 
              with a license for StorEdge Volume Manager (Sun's stripped 
              version of Veritas's product).
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an AIX machine that blew 
              a power supply on October 28th. Every day since then, I get an email 
              message telling me about the problem, even though it's been 
              corrected:
            <p> 
            <pre>
A PROBLEM WAS DETECTED ON Tue Nov  2 04:00:43 EST 2001

The Service Request Number(s)/Error Code(s).
805-805: Error Log Analysis indicates the following problem:

Probable Cause or Causes:
- 100%  power supply      00-00        Loss of AC Power.
</pre>
            Why am I continually getting this message, and how do I make it stop?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You're receiving a message 
              every day because you have a cron job that runs and checks your 
              errorlog for any serious reported errors. After you fixed your power 
              supply issue, you did not clear the error log. You can clear the 
              errorlog by using <b>errclear 0</b>.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a pipe-delimited dump of 
              an Oracle database. There's a lot of extraneous spaces and 
              tabs in between the data, but some of the fields do actually have 
              embedded spaces in them. What I want to do is strip out all of the 
              extraneous spaces but leave the embedded spaces. I'm sure there 
              must be a fairly easy way to do this with <b>sed</b>, but I keep 
              deleting the white space that I want, in addition to the unwanted 
              whitespace.
            <p> Here's an example of what the record looks like to begin 
              with (where <b>x</b>'s are either alphanumerics or symbols 
              other than <b>|</b>):
            <p> 
            <pre>
|&lt;tab&gt;  xxxx&lt;tab&gt;  |    xxx x x xxxxx  &lt;tab&gt; || xxx|&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;|xxx  |
</pre>
            The output I want is:
            <p> 
            <pre>
|xxxx|xxx  xxxxx||xxx||xxx|
</pre>
            The fields where the spaces and tabs appear are not consistent, so 
            I can't count on that to build up a regular based on that. Any 
            suggestions?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Instead of trying to work up 
              a regular expression that tries to determine where NOT to delete 
              the whitespaces (which sounds like what's happening if you're 
              accidentally deleting valid whitespace), use an algorithm that explicitly 
              defines where TO remove the white space. In your case, the only 
              place you want to remove the whitespace is around your delimiter, 
              the <b>|</b>. To accomplish this, try:
            <p> 
            <pre>
sed -e 's/[     ]*|[    ]*/|/' infile &gt; outfile
</pre>
            There are a space and a tab character enclosed within the brackets. 
            You can get the tab by first hitting Control-v and then the Tab key. 
            Depending on your system, you can also try:
            <p> 
            <pre>
sed -e 's/[:blank:]*|[:blank:]*/|/' infile &gt; outfile
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running a small news server 
            for a non-profit organization, and I was wondering what happens when 
            the server gets duplicate Message IDs with different bodies? One of 
            the users is complaining that some of his messages never appear when 
            he uses his posting script. I'm suspicious that this has something 
            to do with the Message IDs, since he hard-codes it in there.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> This would indeed be an issue. 
              When a news server receives an offered message with the same Message 
              ID as an existing message, it refuses it. When the news server is 
              manually fed an article with the same Message ID as an existing 
              message, it rejects it. Your user should be seeing some errors when 
              he uses his script. Instead of hard-coding the Message ID, you can 
              have your user generate it on the fly (if it's being directly 
              sent to the news server on port 119) or just let some piece of posting 
              software handle the generation. The better answer is to use some 
              sort of real posting software, but that may or may not be an option, 
              depending on exactly what your user is trying to accomplish.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a number of ASCII files 
              that I need to translate into EBCDIC as part of an exchange of data 
              that needs to be done with another site. Just telling them to use 
              ASCII is not, unfortunately, an option. I took a look at various 
              system tools like <b>sed</b> and <b>tr</b>, and none of those seem 
              to fit the bill. I'll also need to be able to convert data 
              we get from them back to ASCII, too, but I'm hoping that one 
              tool will accomplish both objectives. Do I need to get a third party 
              utility, or is there something on my system (SCO) that I can use 
              to do the conversion?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You're in luck. There's 
              a tool on almost every UNIX and UNIX-like system that can do the 
              conversion for you -- <b>dd</b>. To convert from ASCII to EBCDIC, 
              do:
            <p> 
            <pre>
dd if=infile of=outfile conv=ebcdic
</pre>
            To translate in the reverse direction, merely do:
            <p> 
            <pre>
dd if=infile of=outfile conv=ascii
</pre>
            There are several other arguments to the <b>conv</b> operand. Refer 
            to the man page for more information.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're collecting a lot of 
              <b>sar</b> data to do performance profiling on our Solaris 7 machines. 
              We'd really love a way to hand upper management some color 
              graphs of each our machine's <b>sar</b> output, which will 
              help them pinpoint where we need to budget more money for hardware. 
              Is there a fairly simple graphing tool that can be used with <b>sar</b>?
