            <p>The 19th Top 500 Supercomputer list was released at the International 
              Supercomputer Conference (ISC2002 in Heidelberg) in June of this 
              year. Since the previous list came out 6 months prior, there've 
              been quite a few changes in the supercomputing world.
            <p> Performance of machines on the Top 500 list is measured with the 
              Linpack benchmark. The benchmark involves solving a system of linear 
              equations. According to the Top 500 Web site, "For the Top 
              500, we used that version of the benchmark that allows the user 
              to scale the size of the problem and to optimize the software in 
              order to achieve the best performance for a given machine. This 
              performance does not reflect the overall performance of a given 
              system, as no single number ever can. It does, however, reflect 
              the performance of a dedicated system for solving a dense system 
              of linear equations. Since the problem is very regular, the performance 
              achieved is quite high, and the performance numbers give a good 
              correction of peak performance." A detailed description of 
              the benchmark, as well as a list of performance results for a wide 
              variety of machines, is available from Netlib. A parallel implementation 
              of the Linpack benchmark, and instructions on how to run it, can 
              also be found at: <b>http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/</b>.
            <p> The number one spot on the Top 500 list is now occupied by the 
              Japanese Earth Simulator. The Earth Simulator is based on the NEC 
              SX architecture and has 640 nodes -- each node with 8 vector 
              processors (8 Gflop/s peak per processor), 2 ns cycle time, and 
              16 GB shared memory. It has a total of 5104 total processors, 40 
              TFlop/s peak, and 10 TB memory. For comparison, the Japanese Earth 
              Simulator's performance equals the sum of the Linpack performance 
              of the next 12 systems on the list. According to the Web site, it 
              leads number two on the list (IBM-built ASCI White at Lawrence Livermore 
              National Laboratory) by a factor of almost 5 in Linpack performance.
            <p> There are three other new systems in the Top 10, as follows:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> At #4 is a Hewlett-Packard AlphaServer (with 4 Tflop/s) installed 
                in France at the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA). 
              <li> At #8 is an IBM Power4 system (with 2.3 Tflop/s) installed 
                at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
              <li> At #10 is a similar IBM system (with 2 Tflop/s) currently tested 
                at Poughkeepsie for shipment to the U.S. Army Research Laboratory 
                (ARL).
            </ul>
            <p> Note that to be on the list at number 500 requires at least 134 
              Gflop/s. Six months ago, 134 Gflop/s would have gotten you almost 
              half way up the list to number 280. Also:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Two Tflop/s Linpack performance are needed to enter the Top 
                10. 
              <li> Five of the Top 10 systems are from IBM, three are from HP, 
                one from NEC, and one from Intel. 
              <li> Although IBM has the most systems in the Top 10 (5), Hewlett-Packard 
                has the most in the whole list (168). 
              <li> Only 23 machines in the world exceed 1 Tflop/s of Linpack performance.
            </ul>
            <p> More than 10% of the systems on the list now consist of cluster 
              machines. The fastest of these is an AMD Athlon-based system (at 
              number 35), located at the University of Heidelberg. You can see
