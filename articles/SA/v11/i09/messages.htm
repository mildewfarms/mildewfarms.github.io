            <br> Subject: Building a Web Mail Server with SquirrelMail
            <p> The section on installing imap is missing <b>make install</b>, 
              and the section on OpenLDAP is missing <b>make install</b>.
            <p> The line just before "Install Apache" about configuring 
              openldap without BerkleyDB just doesn't work. <b>--with-ldb_api=ndbm</b> 
              with <b>ndbm</b> not even being an option.
            <p> Under Adding the PHP Module, <b>make su-install</b> should be 
              <b>make install-su</b>.
            <p> Overall, the article was very useful, but the details weren't 
              accurate enough to get a successful install.

            <br> Subject: Re: Building a Web Mail Server with SquirrelMail
            <p> You're absolutely right.
            <p> It appears that the config line has changed a lot since the last 
              time I built <b>slapd</b> on Solaris. Try this configure line instead:
            <p> 
            <pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/openldap2.0.15 --without-threads --disable-slapd
</pre>
            That disables the need for ANY back-end. I made the mistake of making 
            a shell script to extract and compile all the packages in order (for 
            final testing of my instructions on Solaris) and forgot to check that 
            the newer openldap libraries really got built. I missed the config 
            error and PHP got rebuilt successfully since I already had the older 
            libraries installed. Doh. That's what I get for doing all of 
            the writing in late nights and weekends, I guess. (sheepish grin)

            <br> Subject: Correction to June article on performance tuning
            <p> I'd like to provide a correction to Bob Larson's article 
              on performance tuning in the June issue. He mentions that as far 
              as anyone knows the Wait/IO statistic issue for MP systems has not 
              been fixed by any Unix vendor. While working at SGI in 1998 I fixed 
              the problem in Irix 6.5. We needed to support 128 CPU Origin server 
              systems and I worked to get the WIO problem addressed.
            <p> The solution I used was to factor in the number of threads waiting 
              for I/O to complete when assigning idle time to the cpus. For example, 
              an idle system with 100 CPUs and one thread waiting for I/O will 
              then correctly report 99% idle and 1% WIO to reflect the one cpu 
              that was idle because of the one thread waiting for I/O.
            <p> I had become very familiar with the WIO MP problem, having fixed 
              it earlier while at Cray Research working on their Unix OS called 
              UNICOS in 1994 and before that working at Control Data on their 
              MP version of the MIPS r6000 Unix OS called EP/IX way back in 1991.

            <br> Subject: <i>SysAdmin</i> Mag, July 2002 error in "Compiling 
              Palm Apps on Linux"
            <p> On page 14 of the July 2002 issue, you say that the code needs 
              to be changed to accommodate lowercase tags. However, the function 
              in question (<b>strcasecmp</b>) does a case-insensitive comparison 
              of the strings so there is no need to change the tags.
            <p> Besides which, your proposed solution of adding an "or" 
              clause for "h1" only works because there is one character 
              in the string that is case sensitive. I frequently see tags with 
              capitalized leading characters (e.g., Table vs. TABLE) so adding 
              cases for all of those possibilities would be overly onerous.
            <p> Other than that, it was an interesting article.
            <p> Thanks,<br>

            <br> Subject: Using Email ... "in vol 11 no. 5 of Sys Admin"
            <p> I have a few comments on Bob Dilworth's article in the current 
              issue. I have to say, that the title of the article set security 
              alarm bells ringing in my head, but I thought it sounded interesting, 
              so I pressed on. I found the article well written and absorbing, 
              but slightly alarming. Here is why.
            <p> Security for the emctl.pl script is based in part on the From: 
              field in the mail header (not MIME header, incidentally). It is 
              incredibly easy to spoof mail headers - just telnet to port 25 on 
              the appropriate machine and type them in! However, even if you don't 
              know how to do this, the emctl.pl script grabs the From: field from 
              e-mail messages using a simple regex that is applied to the whole 
              message - header and body - so as long as you have a line matching 
              /^[F|f]rom:/ (which, bizarrely, also matches "|rom", but 
              there you are) and includes one of the valid e-mail addresses you 
              are OK! This does assume that there isn't an invalid e-mail 
              address in the mail header, but then a From: value that doesn't 
              have a "@" in it will be ignored anyway, so depending 
              on your mail client this is relatively easy to get around.
            <p> But, suppose you are careless enough not even to do this, surely 
              the users.dat restrictings prevent you from executing commands? 
              Apparently not! If a Command: line is found before a matching From: 
              line (in the header or the body), it is parsed and executed, and 
              the result is e-mailed to "noone". Since this will not 
              result in a failure of the open pipe to mailx in mr_mailman, this 
              failure is not detected (at least, unless you are reading no one's 
              mailbox!). OK, possible denial of service attack here; nothing more 
              serious, due to the emctl.dat restictions. The combination of the 
              Parse::RecDescent grammar and the emctl.dat file mean that it is 
              only possible to execute pre-scripted commands, with options that 
              match the pattern in the grammar, which is fine.
            <p> Anyway, I think there is sufficient cause for concern here about 
              whether this is a sensible approach to remote systems administration. 
              Apologies if I have misunderstood the script - I am happy to concede 
              if any of the points I have made are in error, but think this issue 
              is worth raising nonetheless.

            <br> Subject: Re: "Using Email ..." in vol 11 no. 5 of Sys Admin
            <p> Thanks for the email regarding my article in the May, 2002 <i>Sys 
              Admin</i>. I really do appreciate your comments regarding the flaws 
              in my script and the fact that you took the time to write me.
            <p> Unfortunately, I can't take the article back since it's 
              already "out there". I can, however, fix it up internally 
              here at MCO so that it's better behaved, which I will do.
            <p> Thanks again!<br>
