# Configuration file for LVS setup. This information is processed by
# the LVS director startup script, normally stored in "/etc/init.d" as
# "lvs-director" or "lvs-director.sh".
#
# The default location of this configuration file is /etc/lvs.conf,
# but you may change this by editing the director startup script.
#
# At the moment, only LVS NAT is supported, using the one network NAT
# topology outlined by the LVS project. This is not the best performing
# solution available, but it is the easiest to implement on our subnet
# at this time.
#
# As the project evolves, support for other network topologies and
# protocols will be added (in particular, support for Direct Routing
# will be provided to boost performance and scalability, as well as
# provision for different load-balancing algorithms).

# VIP == Virtual IP Address, or the address of the published service
# presented by the LVS director to the network. This is the address
# used by the client network to access the cluster.
VIP=epsg9008

# VIP_IF == Virtual IP network interface. The VIP must be associated with a
# network interface in order to be available to the network. If there is only
# one physical NIC, then create an alias for this network interface. Aliases
# are represented using this syntax: eth:. For example, eth0:110
# would be a valid alias for the ethernet interface eth0.
VIP_IF=eth0:110

# LVS_IF == LVS Network Interface. This is the interface on the
# director through which all LVS traffic travels. We need to turn off
# all ICMP redirects on this interface on a one network NAT system so
# that the real-server does not try and contact the client
# directly. See the LVS documentation wrt LVS One network NAT for
# details.
LVS_IF="eth0"

# TPORTS == The TCP ports of the services provided by the cluster. Use
# whitespace as a separator -- don't forget to escape newlines with a
# "\" and wrap the whole string in quotes.
TPORTS="telnet"

# UPORTS == The UDP ports of the services provided by the cluster. Use
# whitespace as a separator -- don't forget to escape newlines with a
# "\" and wrap the whole string in quotes.
UPORTS="xdmcp"

# RIPS == Real IP Addresses. These are the addresses of each of the
# real-servers in the LVS cluster. These are the machines that provide
# the actual service to the client. Use whitepsace to separate systems.
RIPS="epsg9010 \
