            <p><b> Sony Introduces PetaApp</b>
            <p> Sony Electronics recently introduced the PetaApp system for data 
              backup, a pre-configured and pre-tested solution. According to the 
              company, PetaApp is based on Sony's PetaBack software and DTF-2 
              (Digital Tape Format) tape drives, which have a data transfer rate 
              of 24 MB/s. The PetaApp system provides a solution to centrally 
              back up data in Network-Attached Storage (NAS), Storage Area Network 
              (SAN), and heterogeneous storage environments. This packaged solution 
              can enable serverless backup, customized backup size, and quick 
              delivery to customers.
            <p> Customized to meet the capacity requirements of virtually any 
              size enterprise, the PetaApp system comes pre-assembled with the 
              Sony PetaSite Tape Library, DTF-2 tape drives, a Brocade SilkWorm 
              Fibre Channel fabric switch, and PetaBack software. The complete 
              system attaches to an enterprise network via a SCSI or Fibre Channel 
              connection.
            <p> The PetaApp systems are now available. For more information, visit:

            <p> <b>NetBoz Announces Firewall</b>
            <p> NetBoz recently announced a burn-and-play firewall. According 
              to the company, the NetBoz firewall boots from a CD-ROM, having 
              nothing to install on the hard disk, and actually does not use a 
              hard disk at all. The settings are managed through a Web administration 
              system, and stored on a write-protectable diskette.
            <p> NetBoz can make a firewall of any Pentium-class PC, and allows 
              the user to reach the necessary level of performance by adjusting 
              the computer power to use (CPU, RAM, and network interface cards). 
              NetBoz is based on FreeBSD and uses ipfw to implement the firewall 
              features. NetBoz is available as freeware. For more information, 
              or to download NetBoz, visit: <b>http://www.netboz.net/</b>.
            <p> <b>STORServer Releases S10000</b>
            <p> STORServer, Inc. recently began shipping the first of the S Series 
              of its Backup Appliance, called the S10000. According to the company, 
              the S10000 contains all the functionality of the larger STORServer 
              Backup Appliances in a much smaller footprint. Pricing starts at 
              $19,900 and the S10000 ranges in size from 90 Gb to 270 Gb, expandable 
              up to 2.16TB.
            <p> The S10000 is configured as a tabletop/deskside system, or can 
              be upgraded to mount in a standard 19" rack. The tabletop version 
              has two pedestals -- one that holds the server and one that 
              holds the tape library. The rack configuration uses 9U (just under 
              16 inches) of rack space . The optional rack KVM uses an additional 
              3U (just over 5 inches) of rack space. The S10000 is also expandable, 
              both by upgrading the tape drives to AIT2 or AIT3, and by doubling 
              the number of tape storage slots in the tape library.
            <p> For the S10000, customers must buy client licenses after the purchase 
              of the appliance, and agents for their databases. Support on the 
              S10000 is an annual fee, and STORServer offers both phone installation 
              and on-site installation. STORServer appliances back up any LAN, 
              SAN, and NAS-attached client that utilizes directly attached storage. 
              The appliance supports 35 different platforms, including Windows 
              NT/2000, Novell, HP/UX, SUN, AIX, and OpenVMS. Special fiber connections 
              for SAN clients are also available. For more information visit:

            <p> <b>Pocketec Introduces Pockey-DataStor</b>
            <p> Pocketec recently introduced the Pockey-DataStor, USB 2.0 hard 
              drive. According to the company, the Pockey-DataStor squeezes the 
              power of a computer's internal hard drive into a small enclosure 
              that measures 5 in x 3 in x 1/2 in. The Pockey-DataStor offers 20-GB, 
              30-GB, and 40-GB capacities and dozens of drives can be liked together 
              via USB hubs to create a library of files.
            <p> The Pockey-DataStor is USB 2.0 compliant and offers transfer rates 
              up to 480 mbps. The Pockey-DataStor is self-installing under Windows, 
              ME, XP, and 2000, and is backward compatible to the older USB 1.1 
              standard. The Pockey-DataStor is compatible with laptop and desktop 
              computers, PCs, MACs, Linux, and DOS.
            <p> Pockey-DataStor drives will retail for $199, $249, and $349, respectively.

            <p> <b>Avax Announces Magnetic Tape Replacement</b>
            <p> Avax International recently announced the availability of a family 
              of high-performance units designed to replace a legacy 1/2" 
              magnetic tape unit on computer systems, machine tools, and telecommunication 
              switches. According to the company, the new DS-1000 and DS-2000 
              MTE (Magnetic Tape Emulator) systems are a direct replacement for 
              1/2" and DAT tape drives. The MTE units are compatible with 
              systems that use either Pertec or SCSI connection to the host.
            <p> Systems that currently log to magnetic tape, or require input 
              from legacy tape drives, can now use the Magnetic Tape Emulator 
              and either write the data to CD or to a hard disk and transmit the 
              data over intranet/Internet for remote access and collection. Model 
              DS-1000 is for general applications and model DS-2000 is optimized 
              for use with telecom switches where filtering, reformatting, validation, 
              or provisioning is required.
            <p> The DS1000 and DS2000 Magnetic Tape Replacement units are available 
              immediately. For more information, contact: <b>http://www.avax.com/magnetic_tape_replacement.html</b>.

            <p> Reliaty recently introduced Reliaty Backup, the first data protection 
              software developed on a Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) 
              foundation, allowing backup and recovery of data from any point 
              within a storage environment to any device, regardless of the server 
              and storage platforms or location of the connections. 
            <p> According to the company, Reliaty Backup preserves information 
              on secondary storage so that it can be recovered reliably in case 
              of disaster. This standards-based software can be used with Network 
              Attached Storage (NAS) devices, and also with UNIX, Linux, and Windows 
              systems even if NAS is not present. Reliaty Backup can serve as 
              the only data protection software required in heterogeneous environments.

            <p> Imperial Technology announced the availability of SANaccess software 
              for LUN security in Storage Area Networks (SANs). According to the 
              company, SANaccess is a data security feature that creates access 
              protection for data volumes residing on an Imperial File Cache Accelerator 
              when used in a SAN. Previously only available only in the SANaccelerator, 
              SANaccess is now available as an optional feature for all MegaRam 
              2000 and 5000 products. 
            <p> Operationally, SANaccess LUN security can enable UNIX operating 
              systems and Windows-based operating systems to simultaneously share 
              access to MegaRam File Cache Accelerators in both small and large 
              SAN environments. Imperial MegaRam and SANaccelerator products are 
              storage-centric architectural components where critical "hot
