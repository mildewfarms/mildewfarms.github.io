              the Rabbit 3000's low-EMI features can help designers eliminate 
              EMI problems that frequently derail tight development schedules. 
              The Rabbit 3000 runs at up to 54 MHz, and is C-friendly, with compact 
              code and direct software support for 1 MB of code/data space. Rabbit 
              3000 development tools include support for Internet and network

            <p> <b>The TOLIS Group Releases BRU-Pro 2.0</b>
            <p> The TOLIS Group, Inc. recently announced BRU-Pro 2.0. According 
              to the company, BRU-Pro 2.0 runs on a Linux box and provides backup 
              and data recovery services on medium to large heterogeneous network 
              systems. In addition to storing archive catalogs on the server disk, 
              BRU-Pro 2.0 also writes the catalogs and indexes to tape along with 
              each archive. Additional key features of BRU-Pro 2.0 include: encrypted 
              data streams from the client to the server, client-side data compression, 
              NFS/SMB mounts to backup NAS boxes on the network, QFA (Quick File 
              Access), native SCSI library support (no costly add-ins), and the 
              ability to back up multiple clients to multiple tape destinations 
              simultaneously for optimized throughput.
            <p> The tape format of BRU-Pro 2.0 allows verification that audits 
              the first bit of data taken off a client system to the last bit 
              written to tape, which helps assure the accuracy of the backup. 
              Should a tape be damaged following a backup, BRU-Pro 2.0 error detection 
              and recovery schemes help the maximum amount of data to be recovered. 
              BRU-Pro 2.0 is priced at $999 and ships with three client licenses. 
              Additional clients are priced on a sliding volume scale.
