            <h1>What's 802.11b? </h1>
            <p>02.11b is the IEEE standard for wireless communications in the 
              2.4-GHz band. It allows connections at up to 11 Mbps, and is practical 
              in the short-to-medium range (local, to around 20 miles with the 
              right antenna). Don't confuse it with the earlier generation 
              802.11 standard, which tops off at 2 Mbps, or its baby brother 802.11a, 
              which operates at up to 56 Mbps in the 5-GHz band at a reduced range. 
              Note also that 802.11g is due out some time in the future, and will 
              offer 56 Mbps in the 2.4-GHz range, thus retaining backwards compatibility 
              with 802.11b antennas. For now, however, 802.11b is the best choice 
              for high-speed, medium-distance wireless connectivity.</p>
            <p> Wireless network connections can be used in many ways. Schools 
              that can't afford to run CAT-5 to their classrooms might instead 
              consider using well-placed access points (doubling as repeaters) 
              and wireless cards in classroom computers. A coffee shop might offer 
              high-speed wireless Internet access to its patrons. Businesses can 
              run wireless networks to allow staff with laptops to be connected 
              anywhere on their sites. Community-based wireless networks are also 
              popular, offering wireless Internet access in metropolitan areas. 
              Volunteers set up and maintain access points and antennas throughout 
              their areas, and allow public access to the Internet.
            <p> There are some inherent limitations to 802.11b, and they can range 
              from un-noticeable to pretty major. Because 802.11b operates in 
              the microwave band, anything that reflects microwaves is bad for 
              transmission. Water is the worst -- and while that isn't 
              usually a big problem indoors, it can adversely affect outdoor connections. 
              Trees and plants are particularly bad -- wireless cards see 
              them as a big body of impenetrable water. Save yourself a lot of 
              trouble and plan your outdoor network in the spring, after the leaves 
              are on the trees. Kitchen microwave ovens can also introduce interference 
              into your connection, although it's not usually noticeable.
            <p> Fortunately, these limitations are well known and are not too 
              hard to work around, making 802.11b wireless networks fun and functional.
