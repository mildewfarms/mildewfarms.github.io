            <p> As I mentioned earlier this year, 2002 marks the 10th anniversary 
              for <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine. Here's a quick overview of the 
              magazine's history. During its 10-year evolution, <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              has addressed the ever-changing systems administration demands of 
              heterogeneous environments. For the premiere issue, founding editor 
              Robert Ward wrote, "That is our mission: to provide you with 
              useful information and tools -- and to create an off-line forum 
              where systems administrators can archive and share their expertise 
              and concerns. We also hope you find <i>Sys Admin</i> substantially 
              different from other UNIX magazines. We strive to be more technical, 
              more practical, and more focused. Instead of exhorting you to periodically 
              remove unneeded core files, we've included a tool that helps 
              you determine whether a core file is important or not. Instead of 
              telling you that overnight scheduling can improve system response, 
              we've provided the full source code for a tool with which to 
              implement overnight scheduling."
            <p> During that first year of publication, <i>Sys Admin</i> focused 
              on growing its circulation from 3,000 to about 10,000 subscribers. 
              Early on, the magazine attracted a group of UNIX loyalists who ardently 
              opposed any attempts to tweak the focus or format.
            <p> In 1996, <i>Sys Admin</i> began publishing on a monthly basis, 
              launched its Web presence, and produced the first of seven annual 
              issues devoted to Linux administration. This early support and interest 
              in the Linux operating system helped <i>Sys Admin</i> grow. Also 
              at this time, Ralph Barker became senior editor of <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              and reiterated the magazine's mission. In his first editorial, 
              Barker wrote, "We plan to keep the treatment of these (technical) 
              themes at the hands-on level, because that is the type of coverage 
              you have indicated is the most relevant for you. We understand that 
              it is our job to serve your UNIX system administration information 
              needs in a highly relevant manner."
            <p> I became editor in 2000, and circulation and during that year, 
              the <i>Sys Admin</i> team also assumed responsibility for the UNIX 
              Review online presence, re-launching <b>UnixReview.com</b> as a 
              UNIX-centric site presenting book and product reviews, certification 
              updates, and columns dedicated to Linux tools, shell scripting, 
              and regular expressions. In 2001, <i>Sys Admin</i> acquired <i>The 
              Perl Journal </i>from Jon Orwant and now produces <i>TPJ</i> as 
              a quarterly supplement to <i>Sys Admin</i>.
            <p> Circulation for the magazine has now grown to more than 33,000 
              paid subscribers, a 22 percent increase since June of 2000, and, 
              thanks to you, <i>Sys Admin</i> celebrates its 10th birthday in 
              a strong position, continuing its mission to provide practical, 
              technical information for UNIX systems administrators.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
