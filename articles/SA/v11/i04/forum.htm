            <p>The ACM news wire had a link to an interesting article about storage 
              capacity recently. Written by Anne Michaud for the <i>Boston Globe</i> 
              (p. C2, 1/14/2002), the article says, "Engineers are beginning 
              to perceive a wall at the end of the road of information that can 
              be stored on a hard disk. Some say the wall is two years out, others 
              estimate a decade. In either case, after unexpected capacity expansion 
              in the last dozen years, experts say they are witnessing the beginning 
              of the end."</p>
            <p> Various researchers, however, are looking for ways to stave off 
              this impending storage crisis. For example, a consortium led by 
              Seagate Technologies and Carnegie Mellon University is researching 
              a technology called heat-assisted magnetic recording (or HAMR). 
              HAMR technology involves supplementing magnetic disk drives, which 
              use magnetic heads to read and write data onto spinning platters.
            <p> According to Michaud's article, "As storage density 
              grows, the bits are becoming so small that soon they will become 
              unstable due to a phenomenon known as superparamagnetism. The solution 
              is to use a more stable medium, but today's magnetic heads 
              can't write data to such a medium. HAMR solves the problem 
              by heating the medium with a laser-generated beam at the precise 
              spot where data bits are being recorded. When heated, the medium 
              becomes easier to write to, and the rapid cooling stabilizes the 
              written data." According to Seagate, if implemented, HAMR technology 
              could enable the magnetic data storage industry to extend its technological 
              advancement for a decade or more beyond what could otherwise be 
              anticipated. I look forward to seeing how this and other research 
              into storage technology plays out over the next few years.
            <p> In this storage and backup focused issue of <i>Sys Admin</i>, 
              Henry Newman contributes an article on I/O and performance-related 
              topics. Newman has worked in the IT industry for more than 20 years. 
              In positions with Cray Research and now at a consulting organization, 
              he has provided expertise in systems architecture and performance 
              analysis to customers in government, scientific research, and industry. 
              His focus is on high-performance computing and advanced UNIX systems, 
              and he previously wrote a monthly storage column for <i>Server/Workstation 
              Expert</i> magazine. For <i>Sys Admin</i> this month, Newman starts 
              at the beginning and discusses how I/O works from the application. 
              In his next few articles, he plans to address the whole I/O path 
              and the issues with performance and tuning for the server hardware, 
              operating system, file system, and applications.
