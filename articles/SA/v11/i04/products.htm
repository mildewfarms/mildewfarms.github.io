            <p><b> Hybrid Servers Announces the Hybrid Web Server</b>
            <p> Hybrid Servers announced that its Hybrid Web Server is now available. 
              According to the company, the Hybrid Web Server provides cross-platform 
              Web replication for emergency purposes. During an emergency, such 
              as unscheduled downtime due to a virus attack or rogue application, 
              the Hybrid Web Server can be activated to assume much of the duties 
              of the primary Web server. The Hybrid Web Server can be used as 
              a replacement OS after a company rolls out its latest-technology 
              computers and can be installed on the systems that were replaced. 
              It is a basic Linux distribution with only a few services running.
            <p> The Basic version handles mostly static Web pages and is suited 
              for information-only sites. The Advanced version can replicate dynamic 
              Web sites, including those with query strings and database back-ends. 
              The Multi-server version can replicate up to ten sites, and any 
              of the ten can be activated in an emergency. All versions include 
              a basic Linux distribution and the Apache Web server, customized 
              with additional software to replicate and re-serve. All are priced 
              under $300, and come with 30 days of support.

            <p> <b>DCB Announces New Broadcast Polling FRAD</b>
            <p> Data Comm for Business, Inc. (DCB), announced release of their 
              modified Broadcast Polling FRAD (Frame Relay Access Device), model 
              BPF-BU. According to the company, two remote terminal unit (RTU) 
              ports are bolstered by a dedicated, leased-line backup port and 
              a dial-up backup port to provide dual-redundant security. 
            <p> The BPF-BU operates by receiving continuous data from the remote 
              unit, or keep-alive packets from the host. If either the data or 
              "keep alive" signal stops for 60 seconds, the remote BPF-BU 
              begins the backup process. The BPF-BU first attempts a connection 
              through the leased line port. If the leased line port does not receive 
              a request to send (RTS) assertion, the BPF-BU resorts to the dial-up 
              modem port. The BPF-BU will continue to cycle through the backup 
              choices until a connection is made. As soon as "keep alive" 
              or user data is received through the frame relay link, the backup 
              link is dropped and the frame relay link is automatically restored
