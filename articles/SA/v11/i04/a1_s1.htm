            <H1><b>gnutar vs. dump</b></h1>
            <p> There have long been arguments between the proponents of <b>tar</b> 
              and <b>dump</b> as archiving utilities. Both applications stem from 
              the early days of UNIX and were designed for different purposes. 
              <b>tar</b> (and its descendants <b>pax</b> and <b>gnutar</b>) will 
              archive files from an arbitrary point in the directory tree, while 
              <b>dump</b> (and its variant <b>ufsdump</b>) backs up filesystems 
              inode by inode. Each holds advantages under certain circumstances, 
              but Amanda allows for both and hides the differences within Amanda 
              itself.
            <p> Because <b>dump</b> uses the filesystem information from the block 
              device, and that information is synchronized at a different schedule 
              than individual file writes, the usual recommendation is to run 
              <b>dump</b> on an unmounted partition. If <b>dump</b> is run on 
              an active partition, it is possible to get an un-restorable dumpfile 
              if any files change during the run. In addition, because <b>dump</b> 
              is filesystem specific, it has to be ported to different filesystems 
              and is not yet supported on some of the newer filesystems in use. 
              However, <b>dump</b> contained a mechanism to identify archived 
              files by date so that incremental and differential backups could 
              easily be scheduled and had a more flexible restore system than 
              available with <b>tar</b>.
            <p> At this time, however, <b>gnutar</b> has overcome some of the 
              limitations of the original <b>tar</b>, is available on most UNIX 
              systems, and because it is frequently not possible to unmount a 
              filesystem for backup, it is the preferred choice as a backup service 
              for Amanda. Amanda also implements the same mechanism for monitoring 
              incremental backups that is used in <b>dump</b>, and the Amanda 
              restore mechanism transparently restores files and directories in 
              the same manner whether the underlying backup system is <b>tar</b> 
              or <b>dump</b>.
            <p> In the end, while <b>gnutar</b> is the preferred backup system, 
              <b>dump</b> is supported and may still be appropriate under specific 
              circumstances.
