            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I want to set up IP Multipathing 
              on my Netra T1. I've heard it's now possible with Solaris 
              8, but it doesn't seem to be well covered in the docs. Any 
              pointers?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> First, be sure that you have 
              have media dated 10/00 or later; that's when multipathing was 
              introduced. There are several reference documents that will be of 
              use to you.
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> An article on the blueprints site: <b>http://www.sun.com/blueprints/0801/Multipathing-updt1.pdf</b> 
              <li> The IP Network Multipathing Administration Guide: <b>http://docs.sun.com/ab2/coll.780.2/IPNETMPADMIN/</b> 
              <li> A <i>Sys Admin</i> article written by Peter Baer Galvin: <b>http://www.samag.com/documents/s=1441/sam0111i/0111i.htm</b> 
              <li> A short HOW-TO style document, by Doug Hughes: <b>http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~doug/howtos/multipathing.html</b>
            </ul>
            <b>The basic steps are:</b>
            <p> 1. Make sure you have two working NICs in your machine (the Netra 
              T1 comes with two already, so you should be fine there).
            <p> 2. Configure the machine to use actual Ethernet addresses by doing:
            <p> 
            <pre>
eeprom 'local-mac-address?=true'
</pre>
            3. Obtain four IP addresses (two floating public addresses, one for 
            each NIC, and two fixed private addresses, one for each NIC).
            <p> 4. Create <b>/etc/host</b> entries for all four IPs, tying the 
              actual machine name to one of the public IPs.
            <p> 5. Set up the secondary interface to use a different MAC address.
            <p> 6. Create <b>/etc/hostname.&lt;interface&gt;</b> files according 
              to the hostnames you defined in <b>/etc/hosts</b>.
            <p> 7. Tweak failover parameters in <b>/etc/default/mpathd</b>.
            <p> 
            <p> If you're using more than two NICs, be sure to take that 
              into account for the above numbers (two IPs per NIC). I suggest 
              reading Doug's document for some tips and examples to help 
              you along.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I want to automatically sync a 
              few directories from one AIX server to a bunch of FreeBSD clients. 
              The transfer will take place over the public network and the data 
              is somewhat sensitive, so both the authentication and data transfer 
              have to be encrypted. I've taken a look at things like scp 
              and sftp, but I don't want to transfer all of the files every 
              night if nothing has changed. There also doesn't seem to be 
              any good way to automate things since I don't want to have 
              to use expect. Any suggestions?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There are a few programs that 
              are well suited for just this sort of application, and you can do 
              them securely if you already have ssh. For starters, take a look 
              at rsync (<b>http://rsync.samba.org/</b>). This is probably the 
              best tool for what you're trying to accomplish, since you mentioned 
              that you only want to sync a few directories. If you're looking 
              for something more flexible and powerful, try cfengine (<b>http://www.cfengine.org/</b>).
            <p> You can also combine the two and have cfengine use rsync over 
              ssh for its file transfers. Take a look at the following page to 
              get you started if you're interested in combining the two:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/jdavis/cfengine.html
</pre>
            I also suggest doing ssh DSA key authentication (with no passphrase) 
            if you're setting up a simple automated job via ssh. Using DSA 
            auth allows you to limit the action that ssh can take when the key 
            is used. This example is for using rsync over OpenSSH and would exist 
            as <b>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys2</b> on the machine from which you're 
            trying to pull down (MachineA):
            <p> 
            <pre>
command="/usr/local/bin/rsync --server --sender -vur . /Directory/To/Sync/"  &lt;key&gt;
</pre>
            <b>&lt;key&gt;</b> would be the <b>$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</b> from 
            the machine on which you're calling rsync (MachineB) and would 
            be of the form:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ssh-dss &lt;a long string of characters&gt; remoteuser@remotehost
</pre>
            So, to copy MachineA:/Directory/To/Sync to MachineB:/Local/Directory, 
            execute the following command from MachineB:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/local/bin/rsync -vure "/usr/local/bin/ssh -c blowfish" machineA:/Directory/To/Sync /Local/Directory
</pre>
            The user executing this command must be able to read all of the files 
            in MachineA:/Directory/To/Sync and be able to write to MachineB:/Local/Directory, 
            of course.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Our environment here is completely 
              Solaris (Ultra SPARCs). I've advocated getting KVM switches 
              for our machine room since I've found them to be invaluable 
              in the past. When I proposed this idea in a meeting, however, the 
              developers declared that KVM switches are unnecessary because everything 
              can be done via the network. The developers have been here longer 
              than I have, so they have more sway with the president of the company 
              (we're fairly small). I'm looking for suggestions to help 
              me convince the president that we should purchase KVMs because they'll 
              make my job as a sysadmin easier. Any tips on how I can sway him 
              to my point of view?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> I'm afraid that I'll 
              have to side with your developers on this issue. If you're 
              doing PC administration, then KVMs are pretty much the only way 
              to go. They're primarily designed to get around the BIOS bootstrapping 
              issue. Since you have all Suns at your workplace, though, you have 
              the OBP, making the KVMs unnecessary and, in some cases, a hindrance. 
              As your developers stated, most things can indeed be done over the 
              network (all X applications, for example, if you actually have X 
              installed on your servers), and those things that can't be, 
              usually need to be done at the prom (OBP) level.
            <p> What you really want to push for is a terminal server, and I'm 
              betting that you can probably sway both the developers and the president 
              to your cause on that account. It would be optimal if you get a 
              modem card and a terminal to attach to the terminal server for instances 
              where the network is completely down. If you have the budget, also 
              get an IP addressable power switch so you can remotely power-cycle 
              machines.
            <p> Here are a few points you can bring up in your crusade to get 
              a terminal server. Upper management especially wants to know what 
              it will save them on the bottom line, so be sure to emphasize monetary 
              savings when possible:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Multiple people can use the terminal server to connect to multiple 
                machine consoles at the same time (this is many-to-many, unlike 
                a KVM, which is one-to-many). 
              <li> The terminal server can be set up for encrypted logins if you 
                purchase a terminal server that supports ssh. 
              <li> The terminal server can be set up on a restricted network to 
                further protect console access. 
              <li> The terminal server will occupy less space in the machine room 
                (fewer cables and no monitors, keyboards, or mice). 
              <li> Sys admins do not have to work in the unpleasant conditions 
                (cold, not ergonomic, etc.) of the machine room. There also will 
                be less waste of energy in the machine room and less chance that 
                someone will accidentally trip over a network cable or power cord. 
              <li> Many terminal servers have some sort of capture buffer so that 
                quickly scrolling errors or boot sequences can be logged and reviewed 
                for speedier debugging. 
              <li> Hardware costs are lower. For example, many terminal servers 
                can be had for less money than most KVMs that support Suns. 
              <li> No need to purchase frame buffers, mice, and keyboards for 
                all systems. 
              <li> KVM cables are more costly than serial cables (which you can 
                make in-house fairly easily if you have to). 
              <li> You can also hook up your network equipment and other non-PC 
                hardware to the terminal server. 
              <li> Some Sun machines (e.g., the Netra X1s and T1s) do not have 
                a slot for a frame buffer and the console MUST be accessed via 
                the serial port. Extra hardware would have to be purchased for 
                these machines anyway. 
              <li> Remote administration via a terminal server allows separation 
                of administrative power and physical access. This can be especially 
                important if you have customers at remote sites or machines co-located 
                in cages. 
              <li> Remote administration allows the sys admin to respond more 
                quickly to off-hour incidents, which can save big bucks in downtime 
                and overtime/comptime costs.
            </ul>
            <p> Good luck getting your new hardware!
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm ssh'ing from a Windows 
              box to a UNIX box and running screen. I've tried putty, ttssh, 
              and SecureCRT, and they all exhibit the following problem. When 
              I hit Control-\ (which, preceded by the screen hotkey, should be 
              mapped to quit in screen), everything dies, not just the window 
              I'm in. According to the screen man page, I'm doing this 
              right, but I'm seeing really unsuspected results. Is the man 
              page incorrect, or have I done something wrong?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Most likely Control-\ is set 
              in to quit in your shell session. If you do:
            <p> 
            <pre>
stty -a | grep quit
</pre>
            and you see:
            <p> 
            <pre>
quit = ^\
</pre>
            you've found your culprit. To disable this in the shell, you 
            can do the following in the shell from which you start screen:
            <p> 
            <pre>
stty quit undef
</pre>
            You can also use the screen hotkey and then type in <b>:quit</b> instead 
            of Control-\ if you don't want to change your shell settings.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We've made a bunch of custom 
              Solaris 8 packages for our customers to install on their machines. 
              When we find the occasional bug, we want to make patches available 
              to them for download, instead of making them install the whole package 
              again (this also makes it easier to track which version they really 
              have installed with <b>showrev -p</b>). I know how to make the packages, 
              but I've never seen documentation on how to make patch files. 
              Looking at the patches from Sun, they should be somewhat similar, 
              but I'm not sure what the actual differences are. Will I need 
              to use <b>pkgadd</b> to add my patches, or is there some way I can 
              create patch files that can be applied with <b>patchadd</b>?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You're correct in assuming 
              that patches are just like packages in many respects. A patch is 
              what's sometimes called a "sparse" package. For those 
              people who aren't familiar with package creation, take a look 
              at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://docs.sun.com/ab2/coll.45.13/PACKINSTALL/
</pre>
            As part of that document, there's a section on Advanced Packaging 
            Techniques. Under this book, they cover creating patch files, among 
            other things:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://docs.sun.com/ab2/coll.45.13/PACKINSTALL/%40Ab2PageView/idmatch(CH6ADVTECH-41)
</pre>
            The sections on patches cover the six basic parts to a patch file:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> checkinstall script 
              <li> preinstall script 
              <li> Class Action script 
              <li> postinstall script 
              <li> patch_checkinstall script 
              <li> post_checkinstall script
            </ul>
            <p> Looking at the examples they provide and dissecting some of the 
              Solaris OS patches should give you a practical understanding of 
              how to implement your own.
            <p> While it is possible to add the patch with the <b>pkgadd</b> command 
              (it is, after all, just another package), you NEVER want to do this 
              because it doesn't register the patch information with the 
              database. That means it won't show up under <b>showrev -p</b> 
              and you will lose the ability to back out the patch. Always add 
              your patches with the <b>patchadd</b> command.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a FreeBSD 4.4-STABLE machine 
              (800-MHz Duron) that keeps crashing when I run seti@home. I've 
              also had it crash when I attempt to do a "make buildworld", 
              but not when I do a simple kernel build. This machine is about two 
              months old, and it stays up just fine unless I do one of those two 
              things. Do I have bad hardware? Is it a FreeBSD incompatibility? 
              Am I tickling some sort of weird bug somewhere?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There is always some chance that 
              you've hit a software bug or that you have bad hardware. The 
              first place I'd look, though, is how hot your machine is running 
              (CPU and case temperatures), verifying that it has proper cooling. 
              Both seti@home and building the FreeBSD userland can be very CPU 
              intensive, and some PCs do not ship with a sufficiently rated fan 
              or heat sink for sustained intensive use. If you find that your 
              CPU is running hot, you might want to try putting a small bit of 
              thermal compound (just enough to fill in the irregularities on the 
              chip surface, not so much that it's acting as an insulator) 
              between your CPU and the existing heat sink. If that doesn't 
              help, try replacing the fan and/or heat sink with a better one. 
              You may have to go as far as to get a different case (or modify 
              your existing case) if you're really tight on space.
            <p> If it's not a temperature issue, search through the FreeBSD 
              mail archives (<b>http://www.freebsd.org/search/search.html#mailinglists</b>) 
              for your chipset and OS revision. It could also be some other piece 
              of hardware you have in the machine, too, so you may want to search 
              for other pieces of hardware you have in or attached to the machine.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I want to add a CDRW drive to 
              my Sun to pump out a large number of data CDs to be shipped to our 
              branch offices overseas (doing the data transfer via network isn't 
              an option). I know that Suns can be picky about the kind of devices 
              that it will support (driver wise), so I was wondering if there 
              was a blessed list of third party vendors/products from Sun. Also, 
              what software should I be using to write the discs?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Sun has a list of their supported

            Plextor has the most number of supported CDRW drives out, so that's 
            probably your best bet. As to software, if you're using Solaris 
            8 10/00 or later, there is a tool called cdrw on your supplemental 
            CD. If you have a pre-Solaris 8 OS, there's also J&ouml;rg Schilling's

              with <b>-DPROCESS_OPTIONS</b> to handle both allow and deny statements 
              in the same file) looks similar to the following (the names and 
              IPs have been replaced):
            <p> 
            <pre>
imapd : LOCAL foo.bar.com 10.2.2. : ALLOW
ALL : ALL : banners /usr/local/etc/banners : DENY
</pre>
            Some of the allows seem to be working:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Feb 22 9:47:16 server imapd[11753]: connect from 10.2.2.5
</pre>
            But some seem to be failing:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Feb 22 10:19:13 server imapd[11753]: warning: can't verify hostname:  gethostbyname(external.machine.com) failed
Feb 22 10:19:13 imapd[11753]: refused connect from 192.168.2.12
</pre>
            192.168.2.12 is the IP address of external.machine.com in this case. 
            So, why does tcp wrappers allow the first connection through, but 
            not the latter? They're both checking IPs and not hostnames. 
            Why does gethostbyname even come into the picture?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It sounds like you've compiled 
              tcp wrappers with -DPARANOID. If the forward and reverse resolutions 
              don't match, then tcp wrappers won't even look at your 
              ALLOW and DENY rules. The correct way to solve your problem is to 
              fix your DNS. If you disable PARANOID when you compile, though, 
              this should also allow these people to pick up their mail. You are, 
              of course, sacrificing security when you do that. If you want to 
              take a middle approach to security, compile without -DPARANOID but 
              have the following lines:
            <p> 
            <pre>
imapd : 192.168.2. : ALLOW
imapd : PARANOID : banners /usr/local/etc/banners : DENY
imapd : LOCAL foo.bar.com 192.168.2. 10.2.2. : ALLOW
ALL : ALL : banners /usr/local/etc/banners : DENY
</pre>
            This way the machines with the bogus DNS entries can pick up their 
            mail, but you then check for mismatched forward and reverse name resolution 
            before you allow anything else.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a quick and, hopefully, 
              easy Perl question. I'm writing a script to do reporting for 
              a number of clustered Web servers. All of these servers are named 
              web<i>NN</i>, where the <i>N</i>'s are digits. The problem 
              I'm having is that I'm trying to do a foreach loop like 
              the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
foreach $servernum (01, 02, 11, 12) {
  print "web$servernum\n";
}
</pre>
            I wind up with web10 and greater printed out correctly, but web01 
            coming out as web1. Obviously, this isn't going to work since 
            I later need to do pattern matching based on the name. Is there a 
            way to get the machine names to print out correctly?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> As long as you don't have 
              machine names greater then 99 (i.e., you will ALWAYS have two digits), 
              you can do the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
foreach $servernum (1, 2, 11, 12) {
  printf ("web%02d\n", $servernum);
}
</pre>
            A leading 0 on a number will indicate to Perl that you want to use 
            octal numbers, so make sure to leave out the leading 0 for 1-9. If 
            you use 01 instead of 1, Perl will error, complaining that you're 
            using an illegal octal digit in your print statement.
