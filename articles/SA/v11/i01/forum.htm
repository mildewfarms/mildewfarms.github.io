           <p> 2002 is the 10th anniversary year for <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine. 
              The first issue was published in May of 1992, and we had about 3,000 
              paid subscribers at that time. As of December 2001, we reported 
              33,000 paid subscribers. If you follow such things, you may be interested 
              to know that <i>Sys Admin</i>'s renewal rate (paid subscribers 
              who renew their subscriptions) is regularly between 50 and 60% (an 
              excellent rate by industry standards). Our newsstand sales are also 
              consistently high.
            <p> Through the years, the "mission statement" of the magazine 
              has been a clear and consistent one -- to provide practical, 
              technical information for UNIX systems administrators. We've 
              not changed our tag line to reflect industry trends or blurred our 
              basic editorial position to attract a wider audience. I compared 
              the results of the very first reader survey to the most recent one 
              and found that our readers' technical interests have remained 
              consistent as well. In response to the question "which topics 
              would you like more information about", "system performance" 
              and "network management" were most frequently mentioned 
              in 1992. Most recently, "security" and "performance 
              tuning" were the top two responses. Ten years ago, the UNIX 
              system most frequently used by <i>Sys Admin</i> readers was System 
              V -- followed by SCO and Sun OS. According to the most recent 
              survey, Linux and Solaris are most frequently used, followed by 
              HP-UX and AIX.
            <p> If you're interested in browsing old <i>Sys Admin</i> articles 
              for additional historical tidbits, check out the most recent version 
              of our back issue CD. We recently released Version 7 of the <i>Sys 
              Admin</i> CD-ROM, which includes articles and code from <i>Sys Admin</i>'s 
              premiere issue in 1992 through December of 2001. This year, we've 
              added <i>The Perl Journal</i> archives to the CD-ROM -- thus, 
              you also get past issues of <i>The Perl Journal</i> from 1996 through 
              2001. As always, we offer both HTML and ASCII versions of the articles 
              on the CD. So, when all else fails, you can grep for whatever you're 
              looking for. There are a few exceptions; note that some articles 
              do not appear on the CD either because we couldn't track down 
              the authors or because they chose not to grant permission for their 
              articles to be included. The CD is available online (<b>http://www.sysadminmag.com/extra/cd_order.htm</b>) 
              for $49.95 (or $24.95 for registered owners of the previous version).
            <p> If you have suggestions regarding ways we could improve either 
              the CD or the magazine, please send email to me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> 
            <p>
