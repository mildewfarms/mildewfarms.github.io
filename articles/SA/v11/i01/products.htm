              tools, known as SNARE (System iNtrusion And Reporting Environment), 
              provides information system owners, managers, and administrators

            <p> IBM announced availability of the Mylex SANArray FFx-2, a (2-Gb) 
              per second end-to-end Fibre Channel RAID controller. According to 
              the company, the SANArray FFx-2 provides dual 2-Gb/s fabric ports, 
              which automatically adjust their modes of operation to the SAN topology-point-to-point 
              or arbitrated loop. The controller's autonegotiate feature 
              enables each port to operate at the maximum speed supported by the 
              user's environment. Dual 2-Gb/s disk-side channels provide 
              failure-resilient paths to storage. Both fabric and disk channels 
              improve performance by supporting full duplex operation. With this 
              capability, the controller can send and receive data from the fabric 
              and the storage simultaneously on all four ports.
