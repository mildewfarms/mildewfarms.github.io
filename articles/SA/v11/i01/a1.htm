              The Open Source Way to Run Windows Applications</h1>
            <p> <i>Marcel Gagn&eacute;</i> 
            <p> I usually recommend Linux when discussing alternative operating 
              systems, and I've found that many people are open to the concept 
              but they continue to run at least some Windows applications. How 
              can you have the best of both Linux and Microsoft worlds? Dual booting 
              is an option, but having to boot from Linux to Windows and back 
              simply to run a single program seems counterintuitive at best. Luckily, 
              there are other options. 
            <p> VMWare and Win4Lin are well-known products that allow you to run 
              Microsoft Windows programs on your system, but they also require 
              a full, licensed version of Windows to achieve that end. While either 
              of these alternatives provides an excellent means of running Windows 
              applications on Linux, neither lets you circumvent Windows. 
            <p> WINE, which stands for "WINE Is Not an Emulator", is 
              different in that it does not require a copy of Microsoft Windows 
              in order to run programs, thus saving the cost of a license. WINE 
              provides a complete rewrite of the Win32 APIs that contains no Microsoft 
              code. Don't think of it as Windows, but rather a productivity 
              layer that lets you run some Windows applications. Furthermore, 
              WINE is open source and freely distributed, so the price can't 
              be beat. Keep in mind that WINE is designed for X86 architectures, 
              which means that you can compile it on your Intel box running Linux, 
              FreeBSD, or even Solaris. However, Solaris SPARC workstations, having 
              different hardware architecture, will not work. 
            <p> If you would like to try WINE, you can get the latest sources 
              from the WINE headquarters at <b>http://www.winehq.com</b>. Building 
              from source may not be necessary. The site has links to daily builds 
              in many different formats. Should you wish to obtain the source 
              and build for yourself, you'll find that it is pretty straightforward: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
gunzip Wine-20010824.tar.gz
tar -xvf Wine-20010824.tar
cd wine-20010824
./configure
make depend
make
make install
</pre>
            However, when you pick up the source in this manner, it tends to trail 
            behind actual WINE development. The more recent your WINE version, 
            the better your productivity application (or favorite game, for that 
            matter) will run, which is another reason why the daily builds may 
            be a better option. If you'd still prefer to build it yourself 
            (maybe giving the source a few tweaks), then CVS is an option: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
export CVSROOT=:pserver:cvs@cvs.winehq.com:/home/wine
cvs login
cvs -z 3 checkout wine
</pre>
            This will create a directory called "wine" relative to where 
            you were when you started the checkout. If you have never downloaded 
            anything from a CVS, it is a little different from grabbing a source 
            tarball. A listing will appear in your terminal window as, one-by-one, 
            the files will be downloaded into your directory. When the process 
            is finally complete, you can build WINE using the same technique as 
            in the previous "tarball" example starting with the <b>./configure</b> 
            step. From your source directory, <b>cd</b> to programs, type <b>make 
            regapi</b>, and <b>cd</b> back to your source directory. 
            <p> To run WINE, you need a personal ".wine" directory inside 
              of which resides a <b>config</b> file. You can start by copying 
              the default file from the source distribution, which you can find 
              in your WINE source tree under the documentation/samples directory: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
cp documentation/samples/config ~/.wine/config
</pre>
            The config file has quite a few parameters, so I'll focus on 
            some of the more important ones. The single most important thing you 
            need to identify is your C: drive (in old DOS parlance). This is important 
            because this is where WINE will create its C: drive hierarchy, which 
            means identifying a location for the WINDOWS and SYSTEM directories, 
            among others. The following section from the <b>~/.wine/config</b> 
            file shows one such configuration with a hypothetical C: drive at 
            <b>/data1/dosc</b>. Which path you choose is up to you: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
[Drive C]
Path=/data1/dosc
Type=hd
Label=MS-DOS
Filesystem=win95
</pre>
            Despite the fact that this is a Windows-free installation, you will 
            need to create some of the basic Windows structure. You must create 
            empty directories for "windows", "system", and 
            a couple of others. In my case, I would do the following: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
cd /data1/dosc
mkdir -p windows/system
mkdir -p windows/Start\ Menu/Programs
</pre>
            These will be represented to WINE as more classic MS-DOS pathnames: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
c:\windows
c:\windows\system
c:\windows\Start Menu
c:\windows\Start Menu\Programs
</pre>
            To see how this affects the WINE configuration file, locate the beginning 
            of the <b>[wine]</b> section. There is no need to do editing here, 
            but this section shows the importance of what we have done so far, 
            including that of properly defining the C: drive. Everything builds 
            from that earlier foundation: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
[wine]
Windows=c:\windows
System=c:\windows\system
Temp=e:\
Path=c:\windows;c:\windows\system;e:\;e:\test;f:\
Profile=c:\windows\Profiles\Administrator
GraphicsDriver=x11drv
</pre>
            Additional drives, such as your A: or D: drives, are configured in 
            a similar fashion. The <b>Path</b> parameter is the UNIX/Linux path 
            to the device itself. <b>Type</b> can be either <b>hd</b> (for a hard 
            drive or directory), <b>cdrom</b> (for a CD-ROM drive), <b>floppy</b> 
            (for a diskette), and <b>network</b>. For instance, the following 
            paragraph defines a CD-ROM device as drive D: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
[Drive D]
Path=/mnt/cdrom
Type=cdrom
Label=CD-Rom
Filesystem=win95
</pre>
            Notice the <b>Filesystem</b> parameter, which defines the structure 
            that is being used. <b>win95</b> and <b>vfat</b> are equivalent. You 
            can also specify <b>msdos</b> for old eight-character filenames with 
            three-character extensions. <b>dos</b> and <b>fat</b> are synonyms 
            for <b>msdos</b>. 
            <p> Next, use <b>regapi</b> to install a default registry. (I'm 
              assuming that you aren't running as root here.) Return to the 
              WINE source directory and type: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
programs/regapi/regapi setValue &lt; winedefault.reg
</pre>
            Now, forego any further configurations and try something simple. I'm 
            going to copy a certain card game from an existing Windows installation 
            into my "fake" Windows directory. To run a program under 
            WINE, simply type "wine" followed by the program name. The 
            program name can have a number of different formats. Assuming that 
            I am in the Windows directory (a mounted <b>vfat</b> partition), any 
            of the following would work: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
cd /data1/dosc/windows ; wine sol.exe
wine /data1/dosc/windows/sol.exe
wine "c:\windows\sol.exe"
</pre>
            Figure 1 shows a snapshot of WINE running this familiar card game. 
            <p> After running your first program on WINE, look at the <b>$HOME/.wine</b> 
              directory. Notice that WINE has created some registry files, which 
              you can recognize by the <b>.reg</b> extensions. Also notice the 
              <b>cachedmetrics:0.0</b>. When you first started your application 
              with WINE, you might have noticed some messages about creating font 
              metrics. These "metrics" are stored here. This font discussion 
              brings leads to the topic of how WINE applications behave in UNIX 
              and Linux environments. 
            <p> The <b>[x11dev]</b> section lets us define how the WINE session 
              will appear and interact with the X-Window managers. For example, 
              notice the line that says "Managed = N", which is only 
              a portion of this section: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
[x11drv]
; Color depth to use on multi-depth screens
;;ScreenDepth = 16
; Name of X11 display to use
;;Display = :0.0
; Allow the window manager to manage created windows
Managed = N
</pre>
            With the parameter set to "N", WINE creates unmanaged windows 
            that are independent of the current X Window manager, which you can 
            test by running an application and then minimizing it. Notice that 
            the minimize (and maximize) button is the classic Windows button. 
            In writing this article, I was running KDE as my X desktop and when 
            I minimized the application, I got a small icon floating on my desktop. 
            If I switch from one desktop to another, the minimized icon follows 
            me and maintains its position on the desktop. In fact, it sits on 
            top of any windows I have open, which is not what I wanted and probably 
            not what you want either. When <b>Managed</b> is set to <b>Y</b>, 
            applications running under WINE are under the control of your Window 
            manager. Minimized tasks (in the case of my KDE desktop) drop into 
            the taskbar, and they do not follow from one virtual desktop to another. 
            <p> Another option is to comment out the <b>Managed</b> line and to 
              use the <b>Desktop</b> setting instead: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
Desktop = 800x600
</pre>
            My X desktop runs at 1024x768. The above setting creates a virtual 
            desktop upon which my application runs. My card game can be minimized 
            on that desktop while the desktop itself is controlled by my X Window 
            system. 
            <p> <b>The Dreaded DLLs</b> 
            <p> Since WINE is designed to run without Windows being present, certain 
              DLLs are built in as part of the distribution. WINE can use these 
              or use the native Windows versions if they are present. This is 
              handled through the <b>[DllDefaults]</b> and <b>[DllOverrides]</b> 
              section of the config file: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
[DllDefaults]
EXTRA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/wine
DefaultLoadOrder = native, builtin, elfdll, so
</pre>
            You may find that some applications work better when using the native 
            DLLs. The order in which WINE loads and uses these programs can be 
            specified on a DLL-by-DLL basis: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
[DllOverrides]
kernel32, gdi32, user32 = builtin
krnl386, gdi, user = builtin
toolhelp = builtin
comdlg32, commdlg = elfdll, builtin, native
version, ver = elfdll, builtin, native
shell32, shell = builtin, native
</pre>
            Attached devices need to be dealt with in the configuration as well. 
            Things such as printers and serial ports must be identified. The serial 
            ports section is self-explanatory: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
[serialports]
Com1=/dev/ttyS0
Com2=/dev/ttyS1
Com3=/dev/modem,38400
Com4=/dev/modem
</pre>
            Printing is, of course, an important consideration. Your setup for 
            LPT1 (or 2 or 3) is defined in the <b>[spooler]</b> section. Unless 
            you are writing text directly to a printer port (as in the example 
            for LPT3), you will probably want to specify an existing print queue: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
[spooler]
LPT1:=|lpr -Phplj5
LPT2:=|gs -sDEVICE=bj200 -sOutputFile=/tmp/fred -q -
LPT3:=/dev/lp3
</pre>
            The way decorations (such as buttons and title bars) are displayed 
            under WINE is a function of the <b>WineLook</b> parameter, which you 
            will find in the <b>[Tweak.Layout]</b> section of your config file: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
[Tweak.Layout]
;; WineLook=xxx (supported styles are 'Win31'(default), 'Win95', 'Win98')
WineLook=Win95
</pre>
            Like the <b>Managed</b> parameter I previously discussed, this is 
            another parameter to play with. There is no right or wrong for this 
            one, but a matter of preference. Figure 2 shows a sampling of the 
            different appearances. 
            <p> <b>Before Its Time?</b> 
            <p> I mentioned that only some Windows applications will work well 
              with WINE. You can read about the experiences of users with your 
              application of choice, and sometimes a little tweaking with the 
              configuration or a run-time flag is all that is necessary to get 
              you on your way to WINE nirvana. To discover what games run and 
              how well they run, visit LinuxGames' WINE success stories page

            CodeWeavers has made it their mission to (in their words) "help 
            our customers leverage Windows technology on Linux and other alternate 
            operating systems". They are in the process of creating a friendly, 
            easy-to-install version of WINE and are pushing the project toward 
            the ultimate goal of an official 1.0 release. CodeWeavers' WINE 
            provides a configuration wizard (to edit your config file), an application 
            launcher, and virtually seamless integration into KDE and GNOME. You 
            can download an RPM package (the only format at this time) from: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://wine.codeweavers.com
</pre>
            The database covers a number of items and rates them according to 
            the level of success users have had -- from running Internet Explorer 
            to Word and Excel. You'll also find many other popular nonMicrosoft 
            applications. For istance, I've found that my copy of Quickbooks 
            accounting works very well under WINE, as does Pegasus (an email client). 
            I have a friend who still considers Lotus Organizer indispensible. 
            WINE handles this one very well. 
            <p> In the end, WINE may not be the answer to all your Windows needs, 
              especially if they are relatively complex. The WINE Web site warns, 
              "WINE is still under development, and is not suitable for general 
              use." WINE does, however, run a number of applications very 
              well and it is getting better all the time. And because it is free, 
              it may be worth some of your time to discover whether you can use 
              WINE to save the cost of buying Windows licenses or the hassles 
              of dual booting.
