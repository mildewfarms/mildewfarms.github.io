<H1>New Products</H1></b><p>The Santa Cruz Operation has announced two products, NC/OS and Tarantella. The first product, Network Client Operating System (NC/OS), gives OEMs a way to develop Network Computers on Intel processor-based hardware. NO/OS gives network end users access to Intranet, Internet, and Enterprise applications by combining a 1.5 Mb footprint UNIX operating system and TCP/IP networking with Netscape Navigator client software and Java software. Unlike typical network desktop PCs, NC/OS uses centralized server administration and management, helping to reduce expensive upgrade costs, as well as the support and administration overhead for the IS department.<p>
The second product, Tarantella, lets UNIX system servers and mainframe-class applications run on Java clients without rewriting the code. Tarantella provides Java clients running Web browsers with access to graphical X applications, character-based UNIX applications, and UNIX SQL-data across the Internet. The applications run instantly and are seamlessly embedded within a Web browser alongside HTML text and graphics. Client software is downloaded on demand from the server as a Java applet, letting it be updated on the server as new versions become available.<p>
Tarantella uses the Advanced Adaptive Protocol (AAP) to transfer information to the Java clients. Tarantella adapts to the bandwidth of the connection media and delivers performance specific to the application type (X or character-based) and device type. Using Tarantella, system administrators can control which applications and data are distributed to different workgroups in their organization. The Tarantella desktop adapts to the user's browser and access device and provides authentication and security. Tarantella also includes SCO Vision Resume, which lets users disconnect from the network and change location or device type and then reconnect without loss of information or shutting down and restarting applications. For information, contact the Web site at: <B>http://tarantella.sco.com</B>.<p>
For pricing and other information about NC/OS or Tarantella, contact <I>The Santa Cruz Operation, 400 Encinal St., P.O. Box 1900, Santa Cruz, CA 95061; (408) 425-7222; Fax: (408) 427-5448; WWW: http://www.sco.com</I>.<p>
<B>NCD Upgrades PC-Xware</b><p>Network Computing Devices, Inc. has upgraded PC-Xware, its X11R-6 compliant, 32-bit server software for Windows 95 and Windows NT. PC-Xware 5.0 integrates NCD's PC-X emulation software with Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 user interface for transparent multi-platform network computing. PC-Xware 5.0 features the Connection Wizard, designed to walk users through the steps of creating a network connection using a series of questions and options familiar to Windows 95 and Windows NT users. PC-Xware 5.0 works in the background of the Windows desktop and is accessed by an icon in the Task Manager. Configuring existing connection icons is done via MS Property Sheets. PC-Xware 5.0 also includes NCD's WinCenter Acceleration extension, which delivers Windows applications to networked platforms via enterprise intranets.<p>
<p>
PC-Xware is available in two versions. PC-Xware Classic, and PC-Xware Suites, which combines the server software with a package of TCP/IP utilities, including NFS client and server, terminal emulation, a graphical keyboard remapper, and a GUI-based <B>ftp</B> client. PC-Xware also provides remote access to X applications via NCD's XRemote software. Based on a communication protocol running over PPP, XRemote gives simultaneous access to multiple TCP applications over telephone lines and other lower-bandwidth networks.<p>
PC-Xware is priced at $395 for the classic package (PC-Xware only), $325 for the Marathon product only, and $545 for the PC-Xware Suite package (PC-Xware and Marathon.)

</I><B>StorageTek Announces CAM/EBF for Solaris</b><p>Storage Technology Corporation has announced its CAM Enterprise Backup Facility, CAM/EBF for Solaris. CAM/EBF is software that lets a server in a multi-vendor network function as a central backup and archive manager. This central manager automatically backs up data from client systems to storage devices attached to the server, protecting vital data from loss. Additionally, CAM/EBF offers user-initiated or centrally administered backup and retrieval of a set of predetermined files for a prescribed or indefinite period.<p>
CAM/EBF for Solaris extends this capability to UNIX servers running Solaris so they can function as backup and archive managers for many kinds of files, including online backups for Sybase and Oracle databases.<p>
CAM/EBF for Solaris is priced at $9,500 for a departmental server, while the enterprise version that supports robotic tape libraries is priced at $17,500. Client licenses for desktop platforms start at $120. For more information, contact <I>Storage Technology Corporation, 2270 S. 88th St., Louisville, CO 80028; (303) 673-5020; WWW: http://www.stortek.com or http://www.network.com.</I><p>
<B>PDC Introduces the BudTool Solution for Windows NT</b><p>PDC has introduced the BudTool Solution for Windows NT, enterprise-class backup and retrieval software for mixed UNIX and NT environments. BudTool is an open, standards-based tool that uses native server operating system commands to backup and restore data. A tape backup created with BudTool can be read by compatible systems.<p>
Installed on the media server, the BudTool Solution for Windows NT automatically recognizes NT servers as backup clients and supports the file naming characteristics and security features of NT. Because BudTool is standards-based, NT backup is performed with a tar-based image that collects and manages NT file attributes. At the same time, an administrator can restore data using tar images even where BudTool is not available. As a result, NT files can be restored to a UNIX platform. The current version of the BudTool Solution for Windows NT performs backup and retrieval over the network. Full NDMP compliance is planned for 1997.<p>
The BudTool Solution for Windows NT supports backup for Windows NT 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0 servers running on SunOS, Solaris, and Auspex platforms. The BudTool Solution for Windows NT is priced at $2,500. For more information, contact <I>PDC, King of Prussia, PA; (800) 654-4732 or (510) 449-6881; WWW: www.pdc.com.<p>
</I><B>Software AG Opens Millennium Center</b><p>Software AG Americas has opened the Millennium Center at its customer support facility at Highlands Ranch, Colorado. The Millennium Center will provide services and solutions to customers converting their computer code to the new 4-digit date standard required after Year 2000. Using management and systems consulting techniques and automated tools for analysis and code repair, the Millennium Center evaluates and modifies mainframe, UNIX, and PC-based applications to Year 2000 standards.<p>
The Year 2000 strategy, a three-phased approach to the problem called INSIGHT 2000, focuses on business information needs. The three phases of INSIGHT 2000 included inventory, analysis, and remediation. In the inventory/impact assessment phase, the scope of the problem and a cost-benefit analysis are established. The analysis phase continues to study the problem, designs cost-effective solutions, and outlines a plan to implement those solutions. The remediation phase focuses on repairing the problem through several methods, which includes repairing existing applications, re-engineering the applications or business processes, replacing the applications, or converting the applications.<p>
For more information about the Millennium Center or INSIGHT 2000, contact <I>Software AG Americas, Highland Ranch, CO; (703) 391-6946.</I><p>
<B>Seattle Software Introduces WatchGuard Global Console</b><p>Seattle Software Labs has introduced the WatchGuard Global Console, its firewall management software that provides a visual "snapshot" depicting the realtime status of each firewall on the corporate Intranet.
