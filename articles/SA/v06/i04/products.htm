<B>Resilience Ships Resilient 110</b><p>Resilience Corp. has begun shipping the Resilient 110, a SPARC-based fault tolerant system. The Resilient 110 systems uses a hardware-based approach to fault tolerance that identifies faults at the sub-kernel level. The Resilient 110 uses three SPARC system modules running copies of a single application that constantly compare themselves against each other, and vote out a module when its results disagree with the other two. The malfunctioning module is then retired and the application continues to run on the two remaining modules. Each identically equipped system module retains its own CPU, memory, I/O controller, and power supply. No components are shared among the three subsystems. The voting architecture lets the operator replace the hot swappable module with no loss of system availability. Modules can be field replaced, and the new module is automatically reintegrated into the system at the operator's command.<p>
The Resilience 110 uses standard microSPARC-II hardware. Custom-designed ASICs and a slightly modified Solaris 2.5 OS kernel handle system checking. The Resilient 110 runs standard Solaris software and includes fault-tolerant SCSI support for a variety of storage configurations. The Resilient 110 connects to RAID or mirrored disk systems optimized for fault tolerance. Fault-tolerant network support is also provided by three independent Ethernet interfaces, which use the same address and include built-in failover. The Resilient 110 also includes a one-year warranty of system and Solaris compatibility.<p>
Prices for the Resilient 110 begin at $21,995. For more information, contact <I>Resilience Corporation, 1755 Embarcadero Rd., Suite 120, Palo Alto, CA 94303; (800) 977-9008 or (415) 843-3600; Fax: (415) 843-3609; Internet: sales@resilience.com; WWW: www.resilience.com.</I><p>
