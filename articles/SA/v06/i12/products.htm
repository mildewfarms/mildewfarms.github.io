Trend Micro Upgrades InterScan VirusWall for HP-UX</b><p>Trend Micro Inc. has upgraded its email and Internet gateway virus protection software, InterScan VirusWall for HP-UX. InterScan VirusWall for HP-UX is a three-in-one server-based product that scans for viruses in SMTP email attachments, HTTP files, and FTP traffic. Each of the three product components can be installed on an individual dedicated server, or all three can be installed together on one server.<p>
InterScan VirusWall HP-UX Ver. 2.0 is multi-threaded and simultaneously scans multiple mail message attachments. InterScan VirusWall for HP-UX 2.0 includes installation scripts that integrate with the HP-UX system and a built-in FTP/HTTP proxy for smoother integration with InterScan VirusWall and HP-UX. InterScan VirusWall for HP-UX 2.0 also includes optional Java applet blocking and executable program downloads (such as .exe or .com files), and a performance monitor that measures the number of kilobytes of message attachments handled per second. Other features of InterScan VirusWall for HP-UX 2.0 include: automatic, realtime multi-threaded scanning; immediate notification to the sender, recipient, and administrator of virus incidents; automatic and prescheduled virus pattern updates via the Internet; and a reporting format that tells the user and administrator the name of the virus found, the name of the infected attachment, sender of the infected file, and the action taken for the infected file.<p>
InterScan VirusWall for HP-UX 2.0 scans only files capable of carrying a virus, including Word macro viruses. The administrator is also able to exclude scanning for a specific file type, such as lengthy sound and animation files. InterScan VirusWall for HP-UX 2.0 also scans nine types of compressed files including PKZip, PKLite, MS Compress, LZExe, LZH, ARJ, GNU zip, UNIX compress, and TAR, as well as BINHEX, UUENCODE, and MIME formats.<p>
InterScan VirusWall for HP-UX 2.0 installs directly on the HP-UX gateway machine or on a proxy server and requires no additional hardware. Intranet traffic can also be scanned if SMTP is used for interdepartmental communications. InterScan VirusWall for HP-UX 2.0 is priced at $1,795 for a 50-user license and includes one year of free virus pattern updates. An evaluation copy is available for download at the company's Web site.

</I><B>1776 Announces 1776 Fault-Freedom II</b><p>1776, Inc. has announced 1776 Fault-Freedom II server-mirroring cluster software, which supports the SCO OpenServer 5 platform. Fault-Freedom II can be used at remote sites and conforms to the UNIX Computing Forum's tentative requirements for low and midrange clustering software.<p>
Fault-Freedom II features network-based "server mirroring" technology. With server-mirroring, each server in a cluster holds an identical and current mirrored copy of user data, so the nodes within a cluster can be separated physically or geographically. Data is protected in case one of the servers, or its storage subsystem is damaged due to fire, theft, or other disaster. Fault-Freedom II also provides online data archiving, which protects the data in case one of the servers or its storage subsystem is damaged.<p>
Fault-Freedom II also provides traditional shared-storage clustering on platforms that support the sharing of storage devices between multiple servers. The company plans to port Fault-Freedom II to SCO UnixWare (including the merged Gemini release). Other ports will be made available for other variants of UNIX as well as NT.<p>
Pricing for a 1776 Fault-Freedom II 2-node cluster begins at $3,950 in the United States and Canada, $4,450 in all other regions. For more information, contact <I>1776, Inc., 8632 S. Sepulveda Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90045; (310) 215-1776; FAX: (310) 216-1107; Internet: info@1776soft.com; WWW: http://www.1776soft.com.<p>

Originally developed for CD library configurations, NET-CDR is available in a standalone configuration for local and network-based recording.<p>
Using NET-CDR, any local or remote directory accessible from the UNIX server can be recorded to CD-R. NET-CDR creates a CD image that can be tested while it is still on hard disk then records and verifies that image onto CD-R. Once recording and verification is finished, the Fire Series software can automatically mount the recorded disc, making it available to users on the network. NET-CDR supports recording and retrieval of ISO 9660, Rockridge, Joliet, and Macintosh HFS-formatted CD-ROMs.<p>
