<H1>New Products</H1><p>
</b><p>SYNCHRONIX has released Ecopad, telecommunication optimization software that increases the efficiency of transmitting data over Unix local and wide area networks. Ecopad handles data locally and eliminates most of the "echo" frames required in conventional systems. Only the differences between successive screen images are transmitted over the network rather than entire displays. Transmission volumes are also lowered through selective data compression performed on the fly. During work sessions, Ecopad identifies and memorizes frequently used screen displays, sending a single command code to display these screens locally. Ecopad has increased network performance two to five times, with display speed increases of three to eight times, and reductions in telecommunications volume by as much as 75%.<p>
Ecopad is independent of applications, equipment, network configurations, and protocol, and operates on all types of network, including: X.25, Frame Relay, ATM, cellular phone, ISDN, leased lines, LAN, and Internet/Intranet. Two modules are used: a server module installed in the server or on a front-end communications computer, and a client module on PCs running under MS-DOS, Windows 95 or NT, or other Unix machines.<p>
For more information, contact <I>SYNCHRONIX, Avenue des Andes, Bat. "Le Cedre," 91952 Les Ulis Cedex, France; (33.1) 64 46 26 26; Fax: (33.1) 64 46 69 67; Internet: laure@synx.com</I>.<p>

<B>Enterprise Systems Management Announces UNameIt 2.0</b><p>Enterprise Systems Management (ESM) has announced, UNameIt version 2.0, an intranet management product. UNameIt provides a single point of change for a corporate intranet, helping to maintain configuration consistency. UNameIt models the various intranet resources - such as networks, services, and users - as independent entities, but also models the relationships between resources. New in version 2.0 is the ability to extend the underlying schema through the same graphical user interface used in normal operation.

<B>American International Introduces Tape Storage System</b><p>American International Business Technologies, Inc. has introduced its Golden Gate family of tape storage products. The product family offers concurrent tape operation on UNIX/Open System platforms, such as HP9000, Sun, SGI, AS/400, RS/6000, as well as Intel-based LAN servers using standard SCSI adapters. The Golden Gate line includes Exabyte Mammoth drives, as well as the Philips 36x0, Quantum DLT*4000, and the Quantum 4700 Auto Cartridge Loader (ACL), which range in capacity from 14 Gb and 1 Mb/sec to 280 Gb and 6 Mb/sec. Golden Gate products allow the peripherals to be shared between two heterogeneous host computers, performing backups on two different computers at the same time. One new feature of the Golden Gate products is the ability to attach to the 6501 feature card on the IBM AS/400 systems, allowing higher throughput. The OPEN Systems support various storage management software systems, including: Cheyenne Arcserve, Legato Networker, Seagate Software Backup Exec, and Novastar Novaback.<p>
Golden Gate is available in two- and three-drive tape subsystems using a combination of 8mm, Mammoth, and DLT tape drives. When tow devices (drives or cartridge loaders) are used, Golden Gate can assign one drive to each port and operate all ports and devices simultaneously. For more information, contact <I>American International, 5520 Westlawn Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90066; (310) 305-8161; Fax: (310) 305-7965; WWW: http://www.ai-inc.com.<p>
</I><B>XDB Releases JetConnect</b><p>XDB Systems, Inc. has released JetConnect, a fully featured data connectivity solution for Java including both ODBC and JDBC standards and application and applet support. JetConnect augments the Java programming language with vendor-independent database connectivity that enables transaction-oriented access to corporate data stores from Internet/intranet applications. JetConnect provides a DBMS-independent solution for database access from Java applications, providing access between Java and any DBMS that supports the ODBC standard for database connectivity. Additionally, JetConnect includes class libraries that provide a high-level database programming interface and a set of database-aware GUI controls.<p>
JetConnect allows developers to choose and switch between JetConnect's ODBC interface and Sun's JDBC interface. The higher level tools provided with JetConnect can function using either interface. Developers who prefer the JDBC interface can target data sources supporting JDBC drivers, or they can use XDB's driver manager to access ODBC data sources using the JDBC interface. In either case, the Java application software is the same.<p>
JetConnect maintains persistent connections between the client application and the database, and avoids potential performance and resource usage problems of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts normally used to build Internet database applications. JetConnect further improves Web server performance by eliminating the need for multiple CGI programs to run concurrently for each active request.<p>
JetConnect provides ODBC functionality to applets as well. From a developer's perspective, the only difference is that a URL or TCP/IP address must be provided to identify the JetConnect Driver.<p>
XDB Systems has also announced JetAssist, a wizard-style point-and-click application builder for working with JetConnect to build Java database applications.<p>
JetConnect, for up to five concurrent users, may be downloaded from the Web free of charge. For additional users, pricing begins at $2,500. JetConnect is available for HP/UX, Solaris, Windows 95 and NT, with a port to AIX in process.
