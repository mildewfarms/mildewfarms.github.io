ON Technology Ships ON Guard Firewall v2.1</b><p>ON Technology Corporation has begun shipping ON Guard Firewall v2.1, its plug-and-play SMLI Firewall. ON Guard Firewall v2.1 supports 145 preconfigured applications and protocols for IP and IPX networks, providing users with access to network applications such as Java, RealAudio, PointCast, and Lotus Notes, as well as custom or in-house applications. ON Guard v2.1 also supports 56-bit encryption for creating Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The VPN module is based on DES for encryption and IPSec Tunnel Mode for key management, firewall authentication, and full packet encryption.<p>
Optional features of ON Guard Firewall v2.1 include URL Blocking and User Authentication. The URL Blocking application, which includes the CyberNOT list of Web sites that could be considered objectionable in the workplace, lets system administrators block access to specified Web sites by checking off predefined categories. These categories contain URLs for thousands of sites which make up the CyberNOT lists. The CyberNOT list is regularly updated and maintained by Microsystems Software, Inc. System administrators can also identify specific URLs to be blocked in addition to those provided by the list.<p>
The User Authentication Option, based on RADIUS and CHAP, provides password-level protection to remote users who require access to the internal network through the firewall. Using the User Authentication Option, system administrators configure security policies that specify the types of access permitted to remote users. The User Authentication software consists of a desktop client and authentication server for both Windows 95 and Windows NT machines. The software supports periodic session authentication and logs both valid and invalid authentication attempts.<p>
Prices for ON Guard Firewall v2.1 range from $4,995 to $14,995. Turnkey systems start at $6,495. Prices for the URL Blocking Option start at $795 for 50 users. The User Authentication Option is free from the company's Web site. Current ON Guard Firewall customers will receive the upgrade free. A 30-day evaluation copy of ON Guard Firewall is also available on the company's Web site.

</I><B>SMARTS Ships InCharge</b><p>System Management ARTS has begun shipping its InCharge Event Correlator. InCharge analyzes monitored network, system, and application data and events to determine their root cause. InCharge's analysis is based on Codebook Correlation and Object-Oriented Diagnostic Modeling. Codebook Correlation assumes that every problem causes particular symptoms in the networked system as a whole. These symptomatic events create a unique "code" that InCharge uses to identify that problem. Object-Oriented Diagnostic Modeling assumes that each type of element has characteristic problems and each problem has characteristic symptoms and propagation patterns. These properties are independent of the topology, which describes the actual elements in the managed system and the relationships between them. InCharge automatically computes the optimal problem codes specific to each networked system from diagnostic models and topology.<p>
Features of InCharge include cross-correlating network, system, and application data and events, and automatically generating correlation rules and updates. InCharge supports SNMP, CORBA, proprietary data and event sources, and a Web/Java-based GUI. InCharge runs on Sun Solaris and will be available on UNIX and Windows NT in the second half of 1997. InCharge, an add-on to existing management products, requires adapters to interface to sources of events and topology, and diagnostic models for the type elements being managed. SMARTS provides standard adapters and model libraries.<p>
For pricing and other information about InCharge contact <I>System Management ARTS, Inc., 14 Mamaroneck Ave., White Plains, NY 10601, (914) 948-6200; FAX: (914) 948-6270; WWW: http://www.smarts.com.<p>
</I><B>HP Introduces HP SoftBench OpenStudio</b><p>Hewlett-Packard Company has introduced HP SoftBench OpenStudio, a development environment that lets software engineers co-develop C++ applications for Windows NT, Windows 95, and HP-UX systems. With HP SoftBench OpenStudio, developers can write Microsoft Visual C++ applications for Windows-based clients and HP-UX servers. In addition, OpenStudio can perform simultaneous debugging sessions for HP-UX and Windows in two side-by-side views, and develop or maintain existing HP-UX applications from a PC. SoftBench can also create single source-stream applications for HP-UX and Windows through a pull-down menu option, which lets developers build source code for different target machines.<p>
OpenStudio is configured in two parts: client and server. The client works with Visual C++ v5.0, Microsoft's 32-bit application development tool for Windows NT and Windows 95. The server includes the HP-UX C and C++ compilers and the runtime system of HP's implementation of CORBA.<p>
