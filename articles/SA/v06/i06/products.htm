<H1>New Products</H1></b><p>GLOBEtrotter Software has announced two new versions of its electronic licensing software, FLEXlm 5.11 and FLEXadmin 1.3. GLOBEtrotter also announced the immediate availability of FLEXadmin-lite 1.3, as free software asset management from the <B>http://www.globetrotter.com</B> Web site. Product enhancements improve software asset management for large organizations that need to monitor or enforce user compliance with license terms. The tools also facilitate electronic commerce for software.<p>
According to GLOBEtrotter, FLEXlm is the de facto standard for license management, "Over 15,000 software products use FLEXlm, ..., in more than $20 billion of installed sofware products." GLOBEtrotter is looking to Internet distribution. They state: "in 1996, over $4 billion of software licenses were distributed via the Internet using FLEXlm." FLEXlm 5.11 increases the flexibility of the tool. FLEXlm 5.11 enhancements include extensions to the pay-per-use technology, an emerging software licensing approach; expansion of lenient licensing models, for software vendors who want to provide only software asset management to customers without controlling software use; and greater control for systems administrators in allocating license resources between different groups.<p>
FLEXadmin was introduced in 1995 as a tool to support software asset management as well as the management of license servers and certificates.<p>
FLEXadmin is designed for system and network administrators and provides services for installing, controlling, monitoring, and reporting on the use of license servers and software licenses across networks from a central graphical interface. Administrators can manage increasing numbers of licenses over worldwide heterogeneous networks from a single station. FLEXadmin 1.3 includes the addition of Project Accounting Capability; enhanced "Unattended Management" with more alarms and triggers; improvements to and broading of reporting capability; and integration of usage data across an enterprise - supporting consolidation of data from multiple license servers.<p>

<B>Transarc Introduces Internet DE-Light</b><p>Transarc Corporation has introduced Internet DE-Light, a Java-enabled client for standards-based distributed transaction processing. Internet DE-Light combines Secure Socket Layer (SSL) with Distributed Computing Environment's (DCE) security service and Transarc's Encina transaction monitor. DCE is an integrated suite of services for developing, deploying, and maintaining distributed applications in heterogeneous client/server environments. Encina provides platform-independent transactional integrity, record-oriented file storage, the XA standard database integration, and secure mainframe connectivity.<p>
Internet DE-Light lets standard Web browsers, such as Netscape's Navigator or Microsoft's Internet Explorer, access DCE and Encina services. Upon connection with the Web server, a Java applet is passed to the browser, making a direct connection between the browser and Internet DE-Light. From the browser to the Web server, SSL is used for data encryption and message integrity. Once the Internet DE-Light Java applet connects with the DE-Light gateway, the DCE security services take over. DCE security offers security on three levels: authentication, which establishes who the user is; authorization, which identifies file access on a user by user basis; and encryption, which ensures the privacy of a file as it travels through the network. Internet DE-Light also offers a Java client library that includes APIs that integrate Internet DE-Light with other application development tools.<p>
Internet DE-Light Gateway supports Solaris and AIX. According to Transarc, Internet DE-Light for Windows NT and HP-UX will become available during the second quarter of 1997.

</I><B>Haystack Integrates WebStalker-Pro with FireWall-1</b><p>Haystack Labs has integrated its WebStalker-Pro Web server activity monitoring software with Check Point Technologies FireWall-1. Integrating WebStalker-Pro into Check Point's Open Platform for Secure Enterprise Connectivity (OPSEC) architecture via SAMP lets corporations monitor, track, and automatically block suspicious Web server activity. By integrating WebStalker-Pro with FireWall-1, an unwanted Web server intrusion can be communicated to key firewalls. These firewalls can then selectively block intruder access to servers that might be subject to attacks or misuse. The attacker is prevented from accessing the system where WebStalker-Pro initially detected the intrusion but is also automatically blocked from accessing any system behind FireWall-1.<p>
For more information about WebStalker-Pro and Firewall-1, contact <I>Haystack Labs, Inc., 10713 RR 620 North, Suite 512, Austin TX 78726; (512) 918-3555; Fax: (512) 918-1265; WWW: http://www.haystack.com or Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd., Redwood City, CA; (415) 562-0400; Internet: info@checkpoint.com; WWW: http://www.checkpoint.com.<p>

</I><B>Ampex Ships Double-Density Tape Technology</b><p>Ampex Corporation has announced shipment of its double-density DST high performance tape storage systems. The new DST products double the data density at approximately half the cost per megabyte of previous models. A single cartridge can now store up to 330 Gb of data. The twofold increase was accomplished by doubling the track density while remaining fully compatible with tapes created by previous single-density DST models. Double-density capability reduces the cost per megabyte of storage to less than three cents; simplifies media management, and reduces the overhead required to track and house large numbers of cartridges. The storage density increase also improves file access times as well as backup and restore speeds for large data volumes by minimizing cartridge exchanges.<p>
According to Ampex, the double-density systems can retrieve individual files located within terabytes of data in an average time of 15 seconds, and then transfer the data uncompressed at 15 Mb/second or more than 50 Gb/hour. DST tape systems are suitable for a variety of data-intensive applications, such as very large databases (VLDB), hierarchical storage management (HSM) of network file systems, as well as dealing with multimedia data and high bandwidth data acquisition.<p>
The new line of Ampex DST systems includes: the Ampex DST 312 standalone tape drive, which can accommodate 50 Gb, 150 Gb, and 330 Gb cartridges, with a list price of $115,000. The Ampex DST 412 automated cartridge library can store 2.4 Tb of data on seven cartridges and occupies less than eight square feet of floor space. The Ampex DST 412 is priced at $160,000. The Ampex DST 812 automated cartridge library can be configured with up to four tape drives and can store up to 12.8 Tb of data and provide an aggregate data throughput of 60 Mb per second. The Ampex DST 812 starts at $320,000. For more information, contact <I>Ampex Corporation, 500 Broadway, Redwood City, CA 94063-3199; (415) 367-3888; Fax: (415) 367-4669.<p>
</I><B>NCE Storage Solutions Introduces AutoXpress Tape Libraries</b><p>NCE Storage Solutions has introduced three Emerald Systems AutoXpress tape library families designed to provide high-capacity network backup to a wide range of platforms including Microsoft NT, Novell, IBM, HP, UNIX, and DEC.
