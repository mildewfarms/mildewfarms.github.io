<H1>New Products</H1></b><p>P2 Software has announced Tape Management System for UNIX (TMS/IX) support for its STK Silo Module. The TMS/IX Silo Module uses StorageTek's Automated Cartridge System Library Software (ACSLS) for storage management on several UNIX platforms including AIX, HP-UX, Sun Solaris, Sequent Dynix Ptx, Unisys SVR4, and UnixWare.<p>
The TMS/IX Silo Module provides tape management and interface control for UNIX platforms attached to StorageTek Robotics Libraries. TMS/IX tape and device management routines have also been integrated with StorageTek's CSI libraries to establish and maintain the control path (messages for robotics action and information) while using standard data paths to the available tape devices. The control path interface to the StorageTek ACSLS lets the TMS/IX managed system automatically perform the silo commands.<p>
TMS/IX Silo Module manages UNIX hosts connected to the tape devices in the silo. By using the TMS/IX Remote General Tape Utility, supported network clients can remotely access the silo. TMS/IX also supports and provides validation for IBM or ANSI labels. Additionally, tape catalog records from mainframe tape management can be imported into the TMS/IX tape catalog, the TMS Database, for permanent or temporary control. TMS/IX also supports logical libraries that control TMS/IX volumes. It allows volumes owned by MVS, OS/2200, or other mainframes to be managed by their respective tape management system.<p>
TMS/IX Silo Module supports Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Sequent, Unisys SVR4, OPUS, Pyramid, UnixWare, and IBM AIX. For pricing and other information about TMS/IX Silo Module, contact <I>P2 Software, Inc., P.O. Box 2408, Richardson, TX 75085; (214) 340-1833; Fax: (214) 349-3765; WWW: www.p2soft.com.</I><p>
