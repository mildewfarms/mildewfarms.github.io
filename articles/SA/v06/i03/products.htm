<B>Heroix Announces RoboMon V7.0 for OpenVMS</b><p>Heroix Corp. has announced RoboMon Version 7.0 for OpenVMS, which supports OpenVMS V7.0 for both VAX and Alpha. RoboMon automatically detects and corrects system and application problems for OpenVMS, Windows NT, and UNIX data center operations. A feature of RoboMon V7.0 is the RoboMon's Omni-Collector. The Omni-Collector lets system managers instruct RoboMon to monitor problems and take action based on data that can be generated by the computer system. Examples include monitoring databases such as Oracle, Ingres, and Sybase; monitoring in-house applications; and testing key company data for anomalies. RoboMon evaluates the condition of the computer systems by collecting statistics directly from the operating system. With the Omni-Collector, users can define their own statistics (database statistics, application statistics, and corporate data from company databases) and pass these to RoboMon for evaluation. Once defined, these statistics are used by the RoboMon's Rule Engine in the same way any of RoboMon's preconfigured statistics are used.<p>
Additionally, RoboMon V7.0 supports a specific trap number on the SNMP action that it reports to network managers such as NetView, OpenView, and Sun NetManager. The user can specify what trap number to use, and it can be used as a severity indicator. Another feature of RoboMon V7.0 is the set of conversion functions available in the rule engine. Also numbers can be formatted as a hexadecimal or an octal. Using a TCP/IP server, RoboMon for OpenVMS can interoperate with RoboMon on Windows NT and on UNIX for transparent, multiplatform monitoring. Real time problems and events detected on a operating system can be centralized to a single RoboMon Event Monitor display.<p>
Prices for RoboMon V7.0 for OpenVMS range from $300 to $15,000. For more information, contact <I>Heroix Corporation, Newton, MA; (800) 229-6500; WWW: http://www.robomon.com.</I><p>
