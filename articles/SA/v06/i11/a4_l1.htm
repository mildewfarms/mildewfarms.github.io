# CheckNBack -- tar backup script that checks for operator negligence
# Author: Donald Bryson dbryson@tclock.com -- http://www.tclock.com
# For distribution by Sys Admin Magazine -- http://www.samag.com
# Last Revision Date: 7/31/97

BackupTime=`date +%y%d%m`
DayOfWeek=`date +%w`

# This holds the status of the backup.  Because there has not been an
# error condition yet, we are setting it to 0.

StatusOfBackup=0

# ************************************************************************
# Read CheckNBack.cfg, the configuration file, then load parameters.

# The variable, configdir, contains the directory that stores CheckNBack.cfg.
# This variable allows you to store CheckNBack in any directory.  However,
# most SAs will expect a file like this in /etc/default/
# Note: the script assumes the directory ends with "/".

configdir=/etc/default/

# NagNoConfig(): notifies root that CheckNBack is not setup correctly.

# Check to see if the ForgetMeNot/CheckNBack system is disabled and exit
# if it is disabled.
# Note the use of "&gt;" to redirect the output to the CheckNBack.err file.
# "&gt;" will create the file if it doesn't exist and overwrite the
# file if it does exist. The &gt;&gt; appends the output to CheckNBack.err file
# and will not overwrite an existing file.

# It does two things:

# backup) on disk and t_backup ( tonight's backup) file on the tape. If the
# two numbers are the same, then the tape has not been changed since

# the previous backup.

# changes every night, if t_backup is the same as tmpflag then we know
