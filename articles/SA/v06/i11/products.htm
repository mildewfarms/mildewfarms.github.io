</I><B>Storage Dimensions Ships SuperFlex 3000 DGR Ultra</b><p>Storage Dimensions has begun shipping SuperFlex 3000 DGR Ultra, an external, server-independent UltraSCSI RAID storage system for Windows NT and NetWare. SuperFlex 3000 DGR Ultra includes Dynamic Growth and Reconfiguration (DGR) technology, which lets a system administrator add capacity or change RAID levels while the system is in use. Another feature of SuperFlex 3000 DGR Ultra is the Configuration On Disk (COD) that stores controller configuration parameters on the storage system's disk drives. In the event of a server failure, COD lets the administrator move the storage system to a standby server that includes a standby DGR Ultra RAIDCard controller. When the standby server is initialized, the controller automatically recognizes the configuration on the storage system's disk drives. Also included in SuperFlex 3000 DGR Ultra is a SCSI repeater technology that enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, overcoming the cable-length limitation problem.<p>
SuperFlex 3000 DGR Ultra combines UltraSCSI technology with I/O caching and is scalable from 16 to 128 Mb. The Ultra SCSI disk drives and controllers support data transfer rates of 40 Mbps. SuperFlex DGR 3000 Ultra includes a three-channel UltraSCSI RAIDCard bus-based array controller. Each channel supports seven drives allowing up to 21 drives (191 Gb per controller) using three SuperFlex 3000 DGR Ultra enclosures. As many as four controllers can be supported per server for a total capacity of 764 Gb (RAID 0) or 655 Gb (RAID 3 or 5). Other features of the SuperFlex 3000 DGR Ultra include multiple hot-spare disk drives, dual redundant power supplies, redundant, cooling fans, and dual lockable A/C inputs. Optionally battery-backed cache can also be added.<p>
A SuperFlex 3000 DGR Ultra with four 9.1-Gb UltraSCSI drives is priced at $16,460. A complete seven-drive system is priced at $24,535.

</I><B>Aurora Upgrades SarCheck</b><p>Aurora Software Inc. has upgraded SarCheck for SCO UNIX. SarCheck, a performance management tool, identifies performance bottlenecks, runaway processes, and memory leaks, recommends changes to the tunable parameters and hardware configuration, and quantifies the amount of remaining system capacity. SarCheck then translates the output of various monitoring utilities into a "plain English" report. SarCheck Version 3 is Year 2000 compliant and supports UNIX 3.2v4.<p>
SarCheck makes detailed recommendations to an administrator rather than automatically trying to fix problems. SarCheck also explains the reasons for its recommendations so that the administrator can understand why SarCheck is making them. SarCheck reports consist of three sections and a summary. The first section contains recommendations, which can be used to improve system performance, including changes to tunable parameters, disk load balancing, and hardware upgrades. The second section is an analysis of all system resources monitored by SarCheck. The third section, Capacity Planning, can be used to approximate the amount of capacity left on a system, based on the sar data being analyzed.<p>
A single SarCheck license for SCO UNIX is priced at $199 with other licensing options available. For more information, contact <I>Aurora Software, Inc., PO Box 1033, Plaistow, NH 03865; (603) 382-4200; Fax: (603) 382-4247; Internet: 74013.1625@compuserve.com; WWW: http://www.sarcheck.com.</I><p>

</I><B>NIT Introduces UniShield 3.0</b><p>Network Information Technology has introduced UniShield 3.0, a suite of Intranet security modules for multiplatform UNIX environments. UniShield 3.0 protects Web server, file server, and database server applications such as Netscape, NFS, and Oracle. UniShield 3.0 prevents malicious Java applets from executing unauthorized commands and unknown ActiveX Controls from damaging resources.<p>
UniShield 3.0 comes in four software security modules. Each module operates as a standalone application or with other modules under one integrated GUI. The Enterprise Security Administrator (ESA) module implements a base-line level of security, controlling access to networks and hosts, centrally administers user accounts and passwords, provides realtime intrusion detection and alerts, and protects idle systems. The File Access Control (FAC) module protects files and programs on servers and protects the hosts connected to those servers. The Administrative Privilege Delegation (APD) module supports delegation of administrative privileges without giving away full root power or disclosing the root password. The Advanced Security Monitor (ASM) module uses keystroke monitoring and system call trace to transparently audit users, processes, programs, and file access on designated hosts. ASM also offers audit reduction based on user ID, resource, time, and host.<p>
UniShield 3.0 is scalable and the API lets users integrate third-party firewall, encryption, and strong authentication solutions such as tokens and smartcards. UniShield 3.0 integrates into system management frameworks such as OpenView, Tivoli, Solstice, and DCE. Pricing for UniShield 3.0 is based on a client/server model.
