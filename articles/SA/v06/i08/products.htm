</I><B>Innosoft Adds PMDF popstore</b><p>Innosoft International Inc. has announced PMDF popstore, a repository for storing email messages, to its PMDF-MTA e-Mail Interconnect product set.  The PMDF popstore lets users of various UNIX mailers and VMS Mail migrate to POP3 clients, such as Eudora and Netscape Mail. As a complement to the POP3 mail server, the PMDF popstore is separate from the VMS Mail and Berkeley mailbox message stores. PMDF's POP3 server migrates users of these two other message stores to the popstore facility where users have popstore accounts. The PMDF popstore then stores messages in a ready-to-download format.<p>
Administrators can manage the PMDF popstore via a command-line interface, or by using a reconfigurable Web-based management tool in conjunction with the supplied multi-threaded HTTP server. Other utilities include tracking user connect/disconnect times and cumulative storage usage. Using a management utility, administrators can designate "time-out" for old, unread messages that can periodically be returned or deleted. The PMDF popstore's underlying message store can be spread across numerous disks and since only one copy of any given message is stored for all recipients, overall need for disk capacity is reduced. PMDF popstore also includes an API for sites wanting to customize their own facilities.<p>
The PMDF popstore is available as part of the core product, PMDF-MTA, and supports all three PMDF platforms: Solaris (SPARC and Intel), Digital UNIX, and OpenVMS (VAX and Alpha AXP). PMDF-MTA licensing fees range from $6,000 to $15,000 or more depending upon the level of PMDF functionality. Current PMDF licenses for Digital UNIX or OpenVMS can be transferred to Solaris at no added cost. For more information contact <I>Innosoft International Inc., 1050 E. Garvey Ave. South., West Covina, CA 91790; (818) 919-3600; FAX: (818) 919-3614; Internet: sales@innosoft.com.<p>
</I><B>JSB Ships MultiView 2000</b><p>JSB Corporation has begun shipping MultiView 2000, a 32-bit terminal emulation suite, which provides Windows 95 and Windows NT PC-to-UNIX Web connectivity. MultiView 2000 supports SCO ANSI color, DEC VT100, VT220, and VT320 terminal emulation, and uses a "Rules Agent" to Web-enable UNIX applications. Using ActiveURL technology, the Rules Agent lets users integrate HyperLinks into UNIX applications. The HyperLinks can then invoke an Intranet Web page or a Microsoft Word document, and display the requested information. The Rules Agent can interpret URLs for creating embedded links to launch email, file transfer, or PC applications from the terminal emulation window. Support for Microsoft OLE2 and DDE technology lets MultiView 2000 transparently exchange remote UNIX information with OLE compliant Windows applications.<p>
Another feature of MultiView 2000 is the "Kiosk." The Kiosk lets users create an intuitive user interface, using any image or multiple images as the GUI. Other features of MultiView 2000 include drop-and-drag file transfer in a Windows 95 Explorer-style interface, LPR/LPD printing, and MultiPing, which verifies availability of remote hosts and their services.<p>
MultiView 2000 is priced at $199 for a single license. For more information contact <I>JSB Corporation, Riverside, Mountbatten Way, Congleton, Cheshire, CW12 1DY, United Kingdom; +44(0) 1260-296-230; FAX: +44(0) 1260-296-201; Internet: sales@jsb.co.uk. WWW:http://www.jsb.com.</I><p>
<B>NIT Announces UniShield 3.0</b><p>Network Information Technology (NIT) has announced UniShield 3.0, a security suite for multiplatform UNIX Intranets. UniShield 3.0 protects Web servers, files servers, and database server applications such as Netscape, NFS, and Oracle. UniShield 3.0 prevents Java applets from executing unauthorized commands and unknown ActiveX Controls from damaging resources.<p>
UniShield 3.0 includes four software security modules. Each operates as a standalone application or with other modules under one integrated GUI. The first module, the Enterprise Security Administrator (ESA), implements baseline security controlling access to networks and hosts. It centrally administers user accounts and passwords, provides real-time intrusion detection, and alerts (by pager or email) and protects idle systems. The second module, the File Access Control (FAC), protects files and programs on servers and their hosts. The third module, the Administrative Privilege Delegation (APD), enables administrative privileges by delegation without giving away full root power or disclosing the root password. The fourth module, the Advanced Security Monitor (ASM), uses key-stroke monitoring and system call tracing to transparently audit users, processes, programs, and file access on designated hosts. It also offers audit reduction based on user ID, resource, time, and host. <p>
UniShield 3.0's API integrates third-party firewalls, encryption, and strong authentication solutions such as tokens and smartcards. UniShield integrates into system management frameworks such as OpenView, Tivoli, Solstice, and DCE. For pricing and other information contact <I>Network Information Technology,  12930 Saratoga Ave., #B2, Saratoga, CA 95070; (408) 996-1688; FAX: (408) 996-1898; Internet: info@nit.com; WWW: http://www.nit.com.</I><p>

RoboMon NT automates Windows NT system administration by monitoring Microsoft's Windows NT Server, Exchange Server, Internet Information Server, SQL Server, and Systems Management Server. A feature of RoboMon NT v6.2 is the Rule Wizard. The Rule Wizard provides an integrated, graphical environment where users can customize RoboMon to monitor and solve site-specific problems. RoboMon monitors Windows NT based on rules that determine what condition to look for and what notification or corrective actions to take when RoboMon encounters problems.

Also added to RoboMon NT is a set of out-of-the-box rules. The Automation and Demo rule sets, which monitor systems and applications, have added rules for checking directories, application failures, and changes to security policy. A comparable set of rules has been added to the kit for the Rule Wizard.<p>
Other features of RoboMon NT include email notification support for Lotus CC: Mail, SMTP mail, and Microsoft Exchange; and personnel paging through an integrated paging action and email. RoboMon NT's SNMP Trap action lets severity and status information be sent to OpenView, NetView, and Sun NetManager. RoboMon NT also provides a native event display for centralized, multi-platform monitoring from any point in the network.<p>
RoboMon NT v6.2 is available for the Intel and Alpha architectures. Prices for RoboMon NT v6.2 range from $200 to $5,000. For more information contact <I>Heroix Corporation, Newton, MA; (800) 229-6500 ext. 232; Internet: pr@heroix.com; WWW: http://www.RoboMon.com.</I><p>
