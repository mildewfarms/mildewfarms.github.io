Candle Introduces Candle Command Center/SentinelManager for NT</b><p>Candle Corporation has introduced Candle Command Center/SentinelManager for NT, a systems management tool for NT-based workgroups. Candle Command Center/SentinelManager for NT automates the detection, correction, and prevention of NT performance problems across systems and applications. Using this tool, systems administrators can monitor the performance and maintain the availability of their NT-based systems, networks, databases, and applications.<p>
Candle Command Center/SentinelManager for NT automatically monitors NT performance metrics, databases, and system log files. It can take corrective action to resolve problems or alert the appropriate systems administrator. Candle Command Center/SentinelManager for NT includes log monitoring, which helps systems administrators locate security breaches, application errors, or hardware and network issues reported to the NT log files. Other features include an object-oriented user interface and historical data collection. Candle Command Center/SentinelManager for NT also includes cross-platform correlation from one standard interface.<p>
Candle Command Center/SentinelManager for NT can serve as a standalone tool or can be integrated with Candle's suite of system management solutions, providing enterprise-wide management capabilities across a variety of platforms including HP-UX, SunOS, Sun Solaris, NCR, Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, MVS, AIX, OS/2, and AS/400.

For pricing and other information about Candle Command Center/SentinelManager for NT, contact <I>Candle Corporation, 2425 Olympic Blvd., Santa Monica, CA 90404, (800) 843-3970 or (310) 829-5800; WWW: http://www.candle.com.<p>
</I><B>Legato Systems Announces NetWorker 5.0 for UNIX</b><p>Legato Systems, Inc. has announced NetWorker 5.0 for UNIX. NetWorker 5.0 for UNIX supports HP-UX, Solaris, and AIX platforms running backup, archive, and HSM. With NetWorker 5.0 for UNIX, the company introduces Saveset Staging and a Disk File as a supported device to storage management. Saveset Staging is implemented in HSM applications. All savesets (backup, archive, and HSM) can be staged from devices controlled by a NetWorker server, to other devices controlled by a NetWorker server. For customers with very short backup windows, NetWorker recognizes files as supported devices, letting administrators choose to do backup and recover from their hard disks instead of tape drives. As hard disks get filled, their savesets can be staged to a less expensive form of media.<p>
NetWorker 5.0 for UNIX also supports client backup to the first available device in their priority lists. When a group of clients is configured, it can be assigned a priority list of which storage nodes it should send the clients' data. If the first storage node in not available, the second storage node will be contacted to receive data. As part of the standard functionality of NetWorker, no additional licensing will be required.<p>
With NetWorker 5.0 for UNIX, storage devices can be placed throughout the network as NetWorker storage nodes, and can be managed as if they are locally attached. No indices are kept at the storage node. Indices can also span file systems. Other features of NetWorker 5.0 for UNIX include language localization for non-English speaking users and a Disaster Recovery manual.<p>
Pricing for NetWorker 5.0 for UNIX begins at $3,000. For more information, contact <I>Legato Systems, Inc., 3210 Porter Dr., Palo Alto, CA (415) 812-6000; Fax: (415) 812-6032; WWW: www.legato.com.</I><p>
