            <P> The scope of security vulnerabilities seems to get bigger every 
              day. Various Web sites and lists (e.g., SANS Top 20) frequently 
              identify the most common areas of weakness. These vulnerabilities 
              include databases, Web servers, wireless networks, misconfiguration 
              of enterprise services, and (topping the SANS list) the BIND Domain 
              Name System. (See <B>http://www.sans.org/top20/</B> for the complete 
              list of both Unix and Windows vulnerabilities.)
            <P> Within these varied topics, the threats range from simple to sophisticated, 
              and the configuration complexities are infinite. Recently, however, 
              a specific threat known as "pharming", which exploits weaknesses 
              in DNS software, has received a lot of media attention.
            <P> A pharm attack redirects a user's request for a legitimate URL 
              to a false Web site set up by the hacker. "Pharming is possible 
              because all URLs have to be translated into IP addresses, which 
              is the job of the DNS. A hacker who poisons a DNS server will cause 
              that server to answer a correct URL request with a phony IP address 
              and hijack a user's Web interaction, usually for nefarious purposes," 
              says Mark Leon in "The Looming Threat of Pharming" for InfoWorld 
              (<B>http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/06/06/23FEpharm_1.html</B>).
            <P> Hacking into a DNS server's cache memory and adding those false 
              IP addresses is called DNS "cache poisoning." One good way to protect 
              against such attacks is to make sure you (and your ISP) are running 
              BIND Version 9. Leon says "the first, best defense is to make sure 
              you have all the latest DNS software and all security patch updates 
              in place. The best, most succinct advice: If you're running BIND, 
              upgrade to Version 9 because it's pretty much impossible to poison 
              compared with earlier versions."
            <P> Another weapon to use against pharming attacks is DNSSEC. According 
              to Leon's article, "most experts agree that DNSSEC, the DNS security 
              protocol hammered out by the IETF 10 years ago, would make DNS close 
              to bulletproof." Implementing DNSSEC, however, is easier said than 
              done. For a good introduction, see "The Basics of DNSSEC" by Ibrahim 
              Haddad and David Gordon at OnLAMP.com (<B>http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/10/14/dnssec.html</B>). 
              For more detailed information about DNSSEC, see <B>http://www.dnssec.net/</B>.
            <P> Pharming may be the threat of the week, but the vulnerabilities 
              that allow such attacks to occur should not be underestimated. Sys 
              admins need to understand how these various attacks occur and take 
              steps to eliminate as many weaknesses as possible. This issue of 
              <I>Sys Admin</I> includes articles on using Nessus and Nmap to conduct 
              vulnerability assessments and tuning SELinux for your specific security 
              needs.
            <P> Please consider submitting an article detailing your own experiences 
              solving a tricky problem or implementing a useful tool. We're currently 
              looking for articles within the topics of Networking, Software Tools, 
              Open Source, and Security.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
