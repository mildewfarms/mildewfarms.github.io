            <P> <B>Sun Releases OpenSolaris Technologies</B>
            <P> Sun has open sourced the Solaris Operating System and launched 
              a new open source community at opensolaris.org. According to the 
              company, the OpenSolaris project includes source code for the core 
              operating system, networking, system libraries, and commands. It 
              also includes all the major innovations delivered in the Solaris 
              10 OS, such as Dynamic Tracing (Dtrace), Containers, Predictive 
              Self Healing, and both SPARC and x64/x86 (it's a single source base).
            <P> Solaris 10, the latest version of Sun's tested, certified, and 
              supported enterprise operating system, is now available free for 
              download. Future versions of Solaris will be based on technologies 
              from OpenSolaris. For more information, visit: http://www.opensolaris.org.
            <P> <B>IBM Announces New Server Based on X3 Architecture</B>
            <P> IBM is extending its eServer X3 Architecture-based family of servers 
              with the introduction of the IBM eServer xSeries 460, designed for 
              highly scalable, always-on environments. According to the company, 
              the x460 entry configuration starts as a four-way server and scales 
              up to 32-way processing in an eight-chassis configuration, allowing 
              customers the flexibility to upgrade on demand to greater capacity 
              as their business demands increase.
            <P> The dual-core-capable x460 features increased scalability, larger 
              cache processor performance, expandable memory and I/O resources, 
              systems manageability, and simultaneous support for both 32- and 
              64-bit applications.
            <P> The IBM eServer xSeries 460 entry price starts at $18,129 in the 
              U.S., and typical eight-way configurations start at $72,182 in the 
              U.S. IBM's eServer X3 architecture-based systems run new scalable 
              64-bit x86 operating system software from major technology vendors 
              including Microsoft, Red Hat, and Novell. For more information,

            <P> <B>PerfCap Introduces PAWZ Planner</B>
            <P> PerfCap Corporation announced PAWZ Planner, which automates the 
              process of capacity planning by performing saturation analysis for 
              each server on a daily basis. According to the company, the PAWZ 
              Planner will automatically produce saturation response time, device 
              utilization, device rate, throughput, and remaining headroom. A 
              headroom trending graph shows how remaining capacity has been used 
              over a period of time. It can run on demand or automatically at 
              a prescheduled time. 
            <P> PAWZ Planner uses the same analytic queuing network algorithms 
              as in PerfCap's eCAP Planner and is out of the box software that 
              requires no scripting. It can use pre-defined workloads or can be 
              customized for specific workload definitions.
            <P> PAWZ Planner supports IBM-AIX, HP-UX (PA RISC, Itanium), Sun Solaris, 
              HP-Tru64, HP OpenVMS, Windows NT/2000/2003/XP (x86, Itanium), and 
              Linux. For more information, visit: http://www.perfcap.com.
            <P> <B>Draconis Software Releases RSP v2.0</B>
            <P> Draconis Software announced the release of RSP version 2.0, a 
              fully featured server monitoring and analysis software package that 
              focuses on collaborative problem solving among IT team members. 
              To better coordinate efforts among team members, RSP utilizes an 
              incident-tracking interface, allowing team members to better coordinate 
              their efforts at solving problems, and to record their solutions. 
              RSP stores this organizational intelligence so IT professionals 
              can better apply past experiences to current conditions, making 
              diagnoses and solving problems faster and easier.
            <P> RSP is now available in two versions: an Enterprise Edition for 
              commercial organizations and a free Personal Edition, which, along 
              with open source-licensed monitoring modules, is designed to further 
              support the community of developers and systems administrators who 
              use RSP. For more information, visit: http://www.dracoware.com.
