              Your Backups with a Decision Point System</h1>
            <P> Ian Mahaney
            <P> Backup and restore policies can be difficult to define and understand. 
              While business priorities shift, new products are introduced, and 
              requirements change, administrators are faced with the task of managing 
              an effective backup solution that spans the entire enterprise. Today's 
              dynamic environments often result in uncertainty regarding the properties 
              of a backup policy and leave IT managers asking why? To simplify 
              the creation of backup policies and answer the question why, administrators 
              can utilize a Decision Point System when determining backup requirements.
            <P> The DPS (Decision Point System) is based on a set of tools that 
              have been developed to standardize and simplify the creation of 
              policy definitions. These tools offer an easy approach to determining 
              your backup requirements and the fixed costs associated with those 
              requirements. They also provide consistency when determining which 
              resources are allocated per policy and allow administrators to be 
              proactive in predicting resource utilization over time. Their use 
              creates a level of accountability that can be referenced when IT 
              managers ask why?
            <P> The fundamental tools that are the basis of the DPS include Policy 
              Decision Points, Decision Point Values, and Decision Point Policy 
              Tables. Each tool maintains a specific role within the DPS. These 
              roles will be discussed in detail and presented in a real-world 
              context to easily understand their implementation in relation to 
              the DPS.
            <P> Before beginning a DPS implementation, administrators must understand 
              the properties of a backup policy. All backup policies have an associated 
              window, run length, frequency, and retention period. These items, 
              in addition to backup size, are the key factors in how many resources, 
              what type of resources, and for how long resources are occupied. 
              They are collectively referred to as policy details. Determining 
              the value of policy details is accomplished through the use of policy 
              decision points.
            <P> Policy decision points usually consist of both business- and technology-based 
              rule sets. They are the foundation of the Decision Point System 
              and are always created first in a DPS implementation. Within the 
              rule sets, each decision point is relative to a policy detail. Therefore, 
              they are divided into two categories: Frequency and Retention along 
              with Run Length and Window.
            <P> Each decision point should also be assigned a percentage value 
              that will remain constant throughout the DPS implementation. The 
              sum of the percentage values within a category must equal 100. The 
              percentage is typically based on an assumed overall value with consideration 
              for company objectives and product importance. They are normally 
              created through discussions between business owners, such as product 
              managers, and administrators. This is often the most difficult task 
              of a DPS. As such, an example of a decision point set and associated 
              percentage values is provided below.
            <P> Decision Points and Their Percentages
            <P> Category 1: Frequency and Retention
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> 35% -- Revenue associated with the data being backed up 
              <li> 30% -- Loss projections in the event of a failure 
              <li> 20% -- Timeframe from which data may need to be restored 
              <li> 12% -- Modification and access of data 
              <li> 03% -- Type of data
            </ul>
            <P> 
            <P> Category 2: Run Length and Window
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> 40% -- Restore times in the event of a failure 
              <li> 40% -- Business cycle downtime impact 
              <li> 20% -- Performance impact of backup jobs
            </ul>
            <P> 
            <P> The policy decision points and their percentages are then used 
              in the calculation of decision point values. They can be applied 
              to existing or future policy definitions. Decision point values 
              ultimately determine the details of a policy definition. They are 
              easily defined by reviewing each decision point and how it relates 
              to the data set to be backed up. This relation is then translated 
              into a numeric value between 1 and 10 and assigned to the decision 
              point for that policy.
            <P> A score of 10 indicates that the decision point is critical and 
              should receive the full percentage associated with it. A score of 
              6 indicates that the decision point has a decreased value for this 
              backup policy and should receive only 60% of the total percentage 
              possible. The numeric value assigned to each decision point within 
              a category is then multiplied by the associated percentage. We then 
              sum the total of all decision point values and multiply by 10 to 
              receive a point total per category. These point totals are then 
              used in referencing the decision point policy tables to determine 
              an appropriate window, run length, frequency, and retention period.
            <P> <b>Decision Point Policy Tables</b>
            <P> To follow the DPS standard, policy definitions are created using 
              the decision point policy tables. The tables provide a simple alignment 
              of policy details and are arranged in order of category point totals. 
              They are typically based on business logic translated into a technical 
              representation through the use of a risk assessment. To further 
              understand how they are defined, we must look at each one individually. 
              The details of the frequency-retention table are based on the available 
              values within your backup solution and the overall risk assessment 
              of all the data to be backed up within the enterprise. For example, 
              a risk assessment may determine that the most frequently backups 
              should be performed is hourly and the least frequently is weekly.
            <P> In this scenario, the hourly value would be associated with the 
              greatest point total while the weekly value would be associated 
              with the lowest value. This logic also holds true for the retention 
              period; however, the retention periods are matched against the frequency 
              values. If the risk assessment has determined that data should be 
              stored for a minimum of 2 weeks and a maximum of 6 months, then 
              these values must be systematically defined in the table while matched 
              against a frequency value (see Table 1). Our risk assessment has 
              determined that are minimum and maximum retention periods are 2 
              weeks and 6 months, respectively. Because two identical frequency 
              values are defined within the table, we systematically match our 
              retention periods within the table as 2 weeks and 4 weeks or more.
            <P> The run-length and window table is defined similarly to the frequency-retention 
              table. However, this table must take into consideration a company's 
              business cycle. The business cycle allows administrators to determine 
              utilization trends over a specific period of time and can usually 
              be depicted as a wave or set of waves with peaks and valleys. Using 
              the risk assessment and business cycle, administrators can define 
              their windows and run-length values within the table. This can be 
              seen in the Table 2. The business cycle has determined that our 
              down periods are between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., while peak periods are 
              between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. To follow good practice, critical backups 
              should be performed during non-peak hours. Since critical backups 
              are typically calculated at high category point totals, we assign 
              our non-peak hours to the greatest values within the table and our 
              peak hours to our lowest values. These values should then be spread 
              over the point total rows defined within the table. As with the 
              previous table, we are then able to match run-length values against 
              defined window values.
            <P> In this example, it has been determined that the minimum run length 
              of any job during non-peak and peak hours should be 1 hour. This 
              value is then assigned to the greatest category point total during 
              non-peak hours and the greatest category point total during peak 
              hours. It has also been determined that the maximum run-length period 
              should be no longer than 8 hours. Using the range of 1 to 8 hours, 
              we then match the run-length values to the window values as we did 
              with the frequency-retention period. When all values have been determined, 
              the tables are then ready for use. To utilize the tables, an administrator 
              simply locates a data set's category point total within the table 
              and implements the policy detail associated with that category point 
              total in their backup policy. The examples provided in Tables 1 
              and 2 may be used as guidelines when determining your decision point 
              policy tables.
            <P> Calculating decision point values and using the decision point 
              policy tables is essential in standardizing and providing a successful 
              DPS implementation. However, one of the key advantages of standardization 
              and the DPS is the ability to gain a level of accountability for 
              backup policies. Accountability is derived from the use of the policy 
              decision points, decision point values, and decision point policy 
              tables but will be lost without the ability to record this information 
              for historical record, future trending, and analysis.
            <P> To record this data and simplify your calculations, a policy detail 
              form is included with the DPS. The policy detail form should include, 
              but is not limited to, policy name, data type, size, decision point 
              values, cumulative category scores, resource equation values, window, 
              current run length, allocated run length, frequency, retention, 
              date modified, and backup administrator.
            <P> Using the policy detail form along with the examples provided, 
              we can easily construct real-world scenarios to gain a better understanding 
              of how different decision point values affect the outcome of policy 
              details within the DPS. In the following scenarios, we'll review 
              two data sets and apply the DPS to both. Each case utilizes identical 
              data types but differentiates by access patterns and business importance.
            <P> <b>Scenario 1: Production Database</b>
            <P> In the first scenario, we'll review a new production database 
              environment. The environment will maintain a set of databases that 
              are to be used for Web form information, application processing, 
              and reporting features. A large number of products will depend on 
              the availability of these databases and the data they maintain. 
              Any downtime within this environment would contribute to significant 
              revenue loss. The total size of the databases is estimated to be 
              approximately 300 GB.
            <P> The characteristics mentioned previously provide enough information 
              for administrators to begin a DPS-based policy definition. To do 
              so, we must first review our policy decision points and determine 
              how relative each point is in regard to the data that must be backed 
              up. Because each decision point is outlined in the policy detail 
              form, it is easy for administrators to simply input the values they 
              believe to be valid for a specific decision point. The form shown 
              in Figure 1 depicts the decision point values associated with each 
              point in the DPS implementation. These values have also been used 
              with the decision point policy tables to determine frequency, retention, 
              run length, and window.
            <P> Now that the policy detail form has been completed, we can use 
              these values to determine the resource requirements necessary for 
              the policy. To do this, we use a set of resource equations that 
              are provided below:
            <P> <b>Equation 1: Storage Utilization</b>
            <P> Storage Utilization = (size)(growth% + 1)(frequency)(retention)<br>
              Size: Expressed in MB.<br>
              Growth%: Expected growth percentage based over time and expressed 
              in decimal notation.<br>
              Frequency: Number of jobs completed over a one week period.<br>
              Retention: Time period for which jobs will remain on tape expressed 
              in days.<br>
              Equation 2: Throughput Requirement<br>
              Throughput = size / (runLength * 3600)(1 - growth%)<br>
              Size: Expressed in MB.<br>
              runLength: Expected job completion time expressed in hours.<br>
              Growth%: Expected growth percentage based over time and expressed 
              in decimal notation.
            <P> 
            <P> Using the resource equations and the values provided from the 
              policy detail form, we can conclude that the policy requires a total 
              storage capacity of 8,601,600 MB, or roughly 8 TB. We can also determine 
              that an average throughput of 42.67 MBps must be achieved to back 
              up the entire policy within the allocated run length. Therefore, 
              all data paths from the client to the storage devices must support 
              an aggregate throughput greater than 42.67 MBps.
            <P> The resource equations also allow us to determine the number of 
              tapes or storage devices required to support the backup policy. 
              If the capacity of each storage device is 400 GB compressed, the 
              administrator can easily calculate that a total of 21 tapes will 
              be required for this backup policy. These values can then be translated 
              into fixed costs associated with the hardware required to support 
              this policy.
            <P> <b>Scenario 2: Test/QA Database</b>
            <P> The second scenario will focus on a similar configuration as scenario 
              1; however, it will be implemented in a test or QA environment. 
              The databases will be snapshots of production and, therefore, they 
              are identical in size. They will also be used for Web form information, 
              application processing, and reporting features. However, there will 
              be no revenue directly attributable to these databases. By moving 
              the system to a different stage of the product lifecycle, the decision 
              point values are altered drastically. Through the policy detail 
              form and subsequent resource equation values, we will show how system 
              properties affect decision point values and ultimately change the 
              policy details of a backup policy.
            <P> Based on the values provided in the policy detail form (Figure 
              2), the category totals are dramatically lower than the production 
              environment. By simply changing the databases from a production 
              to test environment, the value of the data has decreased significantly. 
              This causes a reduction in the decision point values and ultimately 
              the category totals. The decrease results in a distinct set of policy 
              details for the data set reviewed. Looking further at the resource 
              equations, we can determine that this scenario only requires a storage 
              capacity of 300 GB and a throughput capacity of 21.33 MBps. These 
              values translate into fewer resources and a reduced cost to support 
              the backup policy.
            <P> The examples provided illustrate how unique environments and varying 
              requirements can use a standard set of tools to define policies 
              within a backup implementation. These can be applied to existing 
              and future policies within your environment and offer a number of 
              advantages for administrators and IT managers.
            <P> <b>Conclusion</b>
            <P> By creating a simple and systematic approach to backup design 
              and implementation, we answer a number of questions that administrators 
              often face. The DPS creates a level of accountability that may be 
              referenced for historical purposes, trend analysis, scalability 
              concerns, and resource utilization. It gives IT managers the ability 
              to understand their backup environment without being required to 
              know the technical intricacies of the system. It is a standard-based, 
              visible representation of backup design and implementation.
