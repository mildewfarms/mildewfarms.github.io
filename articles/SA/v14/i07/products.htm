            <P> Asigra announced that the company's Televaulting for Enterprises 
              is an agentless solution that enables bare metal restore capabilities 
              across distributed enterprises. According to the company, Asigra's

              work and assist them in their analysis of system performance. It 
              translates the output of several monitoring utilities into a text 
              or HTML-formatted report. It identifies performance bottlenecks, 
              finds runaway processes and memory leaks, recommends changes to 
              various tunable parameters and hardware configurations, and quantifies 
              remaining system capacity. For more information, visit: http://www.sarcheck.com.
