            <P> The 2005 editorial survey results are in. After a panicky moment 
              or two when I thought our distributor had mailed all the surveys 
              without their postage-paid return envelopes (thankfully, that was 
              just a random occurrence for which I apologize...), we began to 
              receive completed surveys, and they're mostly tallied now.
            <P> I did hope we'd have a more high-tech survey system in place 
              this year, but, alas, our Web support did not permit that. So, I 
              apologize for the old-school method of paper and pen, and I'll 
              keep my fingers crossed that next time we'll be able to support 
              an online survey for greater convenience and (possibly) accuracy. 
              Here are some preliminary results from the 2005 returns.
            <P> 
            <P> Which Unix operating systems do you administer?
            <br> Linux (89%), Solaris (53%), Mac OS X (36%), HP (19%), BSD (16%), 
              AIX (16%)
            <P> What type of servers do you administer?
            <br> Web application (74%), Database (72%), File/print (69%), Application 
              (64%), Storage (56%)
            <P> Which languages do you use most often?
            <br> Shell (92%), Perl (87%), PHP (61%), C (61%), Python (37%)
            <P> Which topics are you most interested in:
            <br> Security (89%), OS-specific administration (73%), Scripting languages 
              (73%), Performance tuning (72%), System monitoring (72%), Network 
              management (68%)
            <P> 54% of respondents work for companies with fewer than 500 employees;
            <P> 36% work for companies with 501 or more employees. 
            <ul>
              <li> 12% of respondents support 1-10 users 
              <li> 19% support 11-50 
              <li> 12% support 51-100 
              <li> 23% support 101-500 
              <li> 35% support 501 or more users
            </ul>
            <P> On average, respondents personally administer about 30 servers.
