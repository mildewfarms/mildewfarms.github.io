              Solaris<sup>TM</sup> Installation CD: Part II</B></h1>
            <P> <I>Rytis Sileika</i>
            <p> In last month's issue, I looked at the basic setup for a custom 
              Solaris installation CD. This month, I'll show you several different 
              tricks for creating local customizations from the base install.
            <P> <B>Customize the Environment</b>
            <P> <b>Implement Security Policy Using JASS</B>
            <P> JASS is the Solaris Security Toolkit developed by Sun Microsystems 
              to harden and minimize a system. Detailed information about the 
              installation and configuration of JASS toolkit is beyond the scope 
              of this guide, therefore only rough guidelines are provided here:
            <P> 1. Obtain the latest JASS toolkit from Sun Microsystems Web site 
              (this manual assumes version 4.0.1; <B>http://www.sun.com/software/security/jass/</B>) 
              and unpack it to a temporary location:
            <P> 
            <pre>
# cd /var/tmp
# gunzip SUNWjass-4.0.1.pkg.Z
</pre>
            2. Extract the package contents from the package datastream:
            <P> 
            <pre>
# pkgtrans SUNWjass-4.0.1.pkg . SUNWjass
</pre>
            3. Copy JASS toolkit package tree to Software Product tree, so it 
            will be accessible for the Solaris Installer:
            <P> 
            <pre>
# cp -r SUNWjass /var/bootcd/s0/Solaris_8/Product
</pre>
            4. Add information about the JASS toolkit to the .packagetoc file. 
            The Solaris Installer needs this to find all necessary configuration 
            details.
            <P> Append the following text to the .packagetoc file, which can be 
              found in /var/bootcd/s0/Solaris_8/Product/:
            <P>

of a system running the Solaris OE.

            5. The most secure way to access the system remotely is to use SSL 
            for IP communication.
            <P> <B>Install OpenSSL and OpenSSH</B>
            <P> To install OpenSSL and OpenSSH, the following packages are necessary 
              and can be downloaded from the Sun Freeware site at <B>http://www.sunfreeware.com</B>:
            <P> 
            <pre>
libgcc-3.3-sol8-sparc-local.gz
openssh-3.8.1p1-sol8-sparc-local.gz
openssl-0.9.7d-sol8-sparc-local.gz
tcp_wrappers-7.6-sol8-sparc-local.gz
zlib-1.2.1-sol8-sparc-local.gz
</pre>
            1. Unpack all packages to a temporary directory (here /var/tmp/openssh 
            is used).
            <P> 2. Extract the package contents from the package data streams 
              and copy to Solaris Product directory:
            <P> 
            <pre>
# cd /var/tmp/openssh
# for i in 'ls'
&gt; do
&gt;   pkg='pkginfo -d ${i} | awk '{print $2}''
&gt;   pkgtrans ${i} . ${pkg}
&gt;   cp -r ${pkg} /var/bootcd/s0/Solaris_8/Product
&gt; done
</pre>
            3. Add information about the packages to .packagetoc file. The Solaris 
            Installer needs this in order to find all necessary configuration 
            details. Append the following text to the .packagetoc file, which 
            can be found in /var/bootcd/s0/Solaris_8/Product/:

            4. Define a package installation order by appending the following 
            lines to /var/bootcd/s0/Solaris_8/Product/.order file:
            <P> 
            <pre>
SMCossh
SMCossld
SMCzlib
SMClibgcc
SMCtcpwr
</pre>
            Note that in the same (or very similar) way, you can add any other 
            package that is not defined in the default .packagetoc/.clustertoc 
            configuration files. Sometimes it is useful to integrate any third-party 
            package closely into your Solaris installation because this allows 
            you to keep things tidy.
            <p> <B>Install Java JR package</B>
            <P> Create a directory /var/bootcd/s0/Solaris_8/Product/packages and 
              copy Java RE installer j2re-1.4.2.04-sol-sparc-CUSTOMISED.sh to 
              it. This file is a modified version of the original Java RE installer 
              available from java.sun.com. This installation script can be modified 
              by replacing its header with that shown in Listing 1.
            <P> This header is a modified version of the original one. Because 
              the original header script displays the license agreement text and 
              asks some question about the installation directories, it is not 
              very convenient to use in an automated manner. Before you actually 
              replace the original header with this one, carefully read the Sun 
              license agreement. This header script should be immediately followed 
              by the package binary (starting from the line 131. Use the Unix 
              <B>tail</B> command to extract the binary from the original file.
            <P> <B>Create Post-Install Network Configuration Script</B>
            <P> A system installed from the CD is not configured as a network 
              server. Therefore, after the installation, a simple network configuration 
              must be performed. Create the following two files in the /var/bootcd/s0/Solaris_8/Product/packages 
              directory (see Listing 2).
            <P> Network configuration script -- This script reads a configuration 
              file and sets up all system files accordingly. Note that the changes 
              are applied immediately; there is no need to restart the system. 
              The reason for creating this script is to have a centralized way 
              of configuring your system; you don't have to manually change things 
              in multiple locations and run multiple commands each time you want 
              to configure your system. This approach would also allow you to 
              create a set of configuration files for your systems even before 
              you actually install them.
            <P> At the moment, this is just a network configuration script, but 
              the possibilities here are not limited just to that. You could extend 
              it and make it perform more complicated configuration tasks, such 
              as connecting to a preconfigured server that holds configuration 
              data, retrieve it from there and configure the system by downloading 
              and installing appropriate packages.
            <P> <B>Create an ISO Image of a Bootable CD</B>
            <P> Once the configuration tasks are finished, an ISO image of the 
              installation CD must be created. Use the following command to create 
              an ISO image:
            <P> 
            <pre>
# mkisofs -R -D -d -L -l -sparc-boot \
  sol.8.s1,sol.8.s2,sol.8.s3,sol.8.s4,sol.8.s5 &gt; -o solaris_8.iso ./s0
</pre>
            Ignore the warning message that "filesystem does not confirm to ISO-9660", 
            and all file re-mapping messages.
            <P> Burn the Installation CD with any CD-burning software that is 
              capable of creating CDs from ISO images.
            <P> <B>Installing from the CD</B>
            <P> Follow these steps to install the system from the CD:
            <P> 
            <P> 1. Connect to the system console using serial RS-232 cable.
            <P> 2. Make sure that the system is at the OBP prompt and you can 
              get an 'ok' prompt Refer to the hardware installation and configuration 
              manual for the instructions.
            <P> 3. Issue the following commands at the OBP prompt:
            <P> 
            <pre>
ok setenv auto-boot? false
ok setenv local-mac-address? true
ok reset-all
</pre>
            4. Insert the CD into the CD-ROM drive of the server.
            <P> 5. Boot and install from the CD:
            <P> 
            <pre>
ok boot cdrom - install
</pre>
            Installation from the CD takes about 100 minutes to complete.
            <P> <B>Conclusion</B>
            <P> You can now create and test your "do-it-all-for-me" CD. It is 
              probably perfect (there might be some special packages missing), 
              but you also have a procedure and description on hand explaining 
              how to add and remove things from the CD. There should be approximately 
              150 MB free, so you can even add Apache for your Web servers, or 
              maybe MySQL for your database servers.
