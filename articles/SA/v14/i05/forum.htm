            <h1> <img src="../../resource/syslog.gif" width="215" height="85" align="right">syslog</h1>
            <P> An article I read recently, called "New Rules for the New World 
              of IT Employment", discussed the transformation of IT jobs that 
              has been taking place during the past few years. The article, written 
              by David Foote (<B>http://searchsmb.techtarget.com/</B>), states 
              that "there has been a renaissance and redefinition of IT roles 
              so pervasive that traditional job titles are becoming increasingly 
              meaningless. With the unrelenting pace of change in both business 
              models and technology, it's hard for both current and incoming IT 
              workers to keep up with the skills necessary to succeed in these 
              new positions."
            <P> Foote cites some of the forces that are acting upon IT and causing 
              these shifts, such as: the demand for highly specialized experience 
              and skills, confusion about compensation rates, offshoring, industry 
              consolidation, and expanding government regulation. Foote's comment 
              about redefinition of traditional job titles is pertinent especially 
              to systems administrators, who tend to be generalists with highly 
              diverse skills gained largely through self-training and experience. 
              The job titles held by those who perform systems administration 
              vary greatly, and this wide array of titles and descriptions results 
              in confusion and imbalance in areas of responsibility and compensation. 
              As Foote says, "IT pay has traditionally been tied to job titles. 
              However, traditional titles are rarely an accurate reflection of 
              what many IT workers actually do. As a result, the practice of defining 
              equitable pay has become a battlefield..."
            <P> A few guidelines defining job duties and responsibilities for 
              systems administrators can provide much-needed clarification. Making 
              sure that your title and job description fairly represent your duties 
              is in the best interests of both you and your employer. If you choose 
              to leave the company, for example, an accurate accounting of your 
              duties will be imperative both for the company in hiring a replacement 
              and for you in constructing a record of your skills and experience. 
              Such guidelines are available, for example, from SAGE, which maintains 
              a brief overview of job descriptions for various levels of administration 
              (viz., novice, junior, intermediate/advanced, and senior) at: <B>http://www.sage.org/field/jobs-descriptions.mm</B>.
            <P> These guidelines define basic terms, such as what constitutes 
              a "small" or "mid-sized" site, as well as what are considered appropriate 
              responsibilities for a senior-level administrator (e.g., managing 
              a large site or network, establishing/recommending policies on system 
              use and services, supervising technical staff, and having purchasing 
              authority). An excellent, more detailed, document ("Job Descriptions 
              for System Administrators -- Revised and Expanded Edition" edited 
              by Tina Darmohray) is also available online to SAGE members or can 
              be purchased from the organization. I recommend these guidelines 
              as one more useful tool to help you determine your career goals 
              as well as gauge your progress on the path of systems administration.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
