            <P> <B>Virtual Iron Software Unveils Virtual Iron VFe</B>
            <P> Virtual Iron Software, Inc. unveiled Virtual Iron VFe, a software-based 
              virtual computing platform. According to the company, Virtual Iron 
              VFe is the only solution that separates the physical computing hardware 
              from the operating systems and applications, allowing transparent 
              virtualization of a collection of interconnected physical servers. 
              It does this by transforming physical systems in an enterprise datacenter 
              into a set of computing building blocks processors, memory, and 
              storage, and then uses those blocks to create virtual servers. These 
              virtual servers, which can range from a fraction of a processor 
              to large-scale multi-processors that actually span physical systems, 
              can be dynamically reconfigured without interruptions.

            <P> <B>Coraid's EtherDrive Storage Blades Available with Redundant 
              Power Supply</B>
            <P> Coraid Inc. announced that their EtherDrive Storage Blade shelf 
              is now available with a redundant power supply feature. According 
              to the company, customers will now have the option of choosing Coraid's 
              standard 3U shelf with single power supply, or a shelf with redundant 
              power supply.
            <P> Coraid's EtherDrive Storage Blades provide a low-cost networked 
              storage solution using Ethernet connections between the server and 
              a shared storage array (pool). Multiple servers can access a common 
              disk storage system, eliminating wasted captive storage. With EtherDrive 
              Storage Blades, the storage pool can be expanded with Ethernet connections. 
              Storage array performance is limited only by the number of disks 
              configured for RAID striping and the speed of the Ethernet connection 
              at the server. EtherDrive Storage Blades are Direct Network Attached 
              (DNA) block storage. DNA provides an Ethernet interface for hard 
              disk drives. Each blade is hot swappable for easy maintenance. EtherDrive 
              storage blades are available in a 3U rack-mounted shelf with power 
              supply or a 4U shelf with redundant, hot-pluggable power supplies. 
              Coraid offers an optional EtherDrive RAIDBlade/20 Controller for 
              users who don't want to use Linux software RAID.
