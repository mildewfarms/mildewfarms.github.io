            <P><i> Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just installed the new release 
              of Solaris 10, and it looks really cool! One issue I'm having, however, 
              is that I can't figure out how to button down security and turn 
              off most of the services at boot time. It used to be that you'd 
              just delete the necessary files in /etc/rc*.d/, but that doesn't 
              seem to work for a lot of things in Solaris 10. How are you supposed 
              to disable stuff under this new version of the OS, and why did it 
              change?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The new Solaris 10 model is called 
              the Service Management Framework (SMF). The Service Manager controls 
              stopping, starting, and restarting services on the fly and can identify 
              dependencies on other services so that things always start in the 
              right order. Each service is controlled by an XML configuration 
              file, called a manifest. These manifests are stored in a repository 
              and can be viewed and modified by the repository daemon, <B>svc.configd</B>(1M). 
              The repository is read by the master restarter daemon, <B>svc.startd</B>(1M), 
              which evaluates dependencies and initiates the services as needed. 
              Traditional <B>inetd</B> services are now part of the service manager 
              as well. Any of the <B>inetd</B> services can be enabled, disabled, 
              or restarted via the same mechanism as any other service manager-enabled 
              program.
            <P> If you want to see all of the services controlled by the service 
              manager, run the command <B>svcs -a</B>. The command <B>svcadm</B> 
              will allow you to, among other things, enable and disable each service. 
              You can use the <B>svcs -x</B> command to list all of the services 
              that are not running and the reason why they are down.
            <P> The service manager also allows you to apply batch changes with 
              the command <B>svccfg</B>. Take a look in <B>/var/svc/profile/</B> 
              for a file called <B>generic_limited_net.xml</B> for a more restricted 
              set of services. To apply a different SMF profile than the standard 
              one, become a user that has Service Management rights and run the 
              command:
            <P> 
            <pre>
svccfg apply /var/svc/profile/generic_limited_net.xml
</pre>
            If you know what you want and none of the profiles supplied with the 
            OS meet your needs, you can always create your own and apply it, too. 
            Take a look at these two sections of the Solaris 10 System Administrator 
            Collection:

</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I just upgraded OpenSSH 
            from 3.7.1p2 to 3.8, and I'm having problems with X. Some of my applications 
            now spit out errors like the following:
            <P> 
            <pre>
warning, error event received:
X Error of failed request:  BadAtom (invalid Atom parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  18 (X_ChangeProperty)
  Atom id in failed request:  0x1a0
  Serial number of failed request:  44
  Current serial number in output stream:  46
</pre>
            Clearly I've munged something, but I'm not sure what. Do you have 
            any suggestions on how to fix things?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> This is actually a FAQ for OpenSSH 
              3.8. OpenSSH now uses untrusted X11 cookies by default, but some 
              applications require trusted. You can restore the default behavior 
              from versions previous to 3.8 by adding the following line to the 
              system-wide <B>ssh_config</B> file:
            <P> 
            <pre>
ForwardX11Trusted yes
</pre>
            You can also modify your personal <B>~/.ssh/config</B> file to have 
            the modification apply to one or more hosts. This example applies 
            it to all hosts:
            <P> 
            <pre>
Host *
  ForwardX11              yes
  ForwardX11Trusted       yes
</pre>
            If <B>ForwardX11</B> is not set to <B>on</B> either in the site-wide 
            <B>ssh_config</B> or in a personal <B>~/.ssh/config</B>, then the 
            <B>ForwardX11Trusted</B> setting has no effect at all.
            <P> You can instead modify the behavior of <B>ssh</B> on a per-connection 
              basis by using <B>ssh -Y</B> instead of <B>ssh -X</B>. From the 
              <B>ssh</B>(1) man page:
            <P> -X Enables X11 forwarding. This can also be specified on a per-host 
              basis in a configuration file.
            <P> X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the 
              ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's 
              X authorization database) can access the local X11 display through 
              the forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform 
              activities such as keystroke monitoring.
            <P> -Y Enables trusted X11 forwarding.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm using BIND 9.2.3 to serve 
              DNS info and accept info from a bunch of machines doing DDNS. We 
              have a large number of clients feeding DDNS requests to the BIND 
              server, and the journal file is growing quite large. Is there some 
              way I can tell BIND that the journal file should only grow to a 
              certain size, say 100M? I don't want to fill up this partition, 
              and I don't want to have to keep restarting BIND to force it to 
              roll the journal file. Thanks for any advice you can offer.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The functionality you desire 
              is available in BIND 9.3 but not BIND 9.2.x. In BIND 9.3.x you can 
              set the maximum size of the journal file with the configuration 
              file option <B>max-journal-size</B>. According to the documentation:
            <P> max-journal-size Sets a maximum size for each journal file (Section 
              4.2.1). When the journal file approaches the specified size, some 
              of the oldest transactions in the journal will be automatically 
              removed. The default is unlimited.
            <P> So you'd want:
            <P> 
            <pre>
options {
  max-journal-size 100M;
};
</pre>
            As a caveat for those early adopters who were running the beta versions 
            of BIND 9.3.0 up to beta 3, you'll want to remove the existing journal. 
            Journal compaction could leave it corrupted according to the first 
            item listed at:

</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have an old news server 
            running Highwinds Typhoon that we're looking to decommission. It doesn't 
            see a lot of use anymore, but we need to make sure that we're not 
            disabling news on someone important in the company. I've seen a bunch 
            of programs that will deliver general statistics on the article throughput, 
            but I need something that lists all of the IPs that are reading news 
            from the server. Has someone already written a program to do this, 
            or do I need to roll my own?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There are a lot of contributed 
              programs for the Highwinds products located at:

            will do what you need with a little modification. As written, the 
            script ignores a number of lines where the traffic is considered too 
            little. You can comment out these sections to get a full accounting 
            of every IP that contacts your server. Here's a context diff against 
            the twbw.pl script:

            The script is run with the <B>stats.detailed</B> file as input (e.g., 
            substituting the path to your stats.detailed log file):

</pre>
            To get the necessary data, you'll also need to turn on detailed logging 
            and generate the <B>stats.detailed</B> file by modifying Typhoon's 
            <B>start.conf</B> file to include the line:
            <P>

</pre>
            Then restart Typhoon for the changes to take effect.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running sendmail 8.12.11 on 
              An HP-UX 11i machine. We recently started experiencing issues with 
              some of our telecommuters using SMTP-AUTH. I used an outside account 
              to telnet to port 25 of the mail server, and I issued the EHLO command. 
              I got back a 502 error code without any explanation:
            <P> 
            <pre>
telnet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 25
Trying xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx...
Connected to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 smtp.my.domain ESMTP (UCE not allowed)
EHLO my.client.address
502
</pre>
            Because this didn't work, I tried a HELO instead, and that seemed 
            to work fine. Nothing has changed with the sendmail configuration 
            in months, and the machine has not been rebooted nor has the sendmail 
            process even been restarted. I'm not sure why things suddenly started 
            failing and would appreciate any insight you can offer.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You're probably having several 
              issues related to ESMTP, not just SMTP-AUTH. This kind of behavior 
              is seen when there's something filtering the SMTP connection such 
              as a Cisco PIX, Checkpoint, Raptor, etc. I'd check with the network 
              department to see whether they've installed some sort of new firewall 
              in front of your mail server that's doing a proxy connection. The 
              most popular culprit in this case is the Cisco PIX Mailguard (or 
              Mailhost, as it was known in earlier releases):
            <P>

  products_tech_note09186a00800b2ecb.shtml
</pre>
            You can disable the Mailguard feature in software version 4.2 and 
            later by issuing the following command while in configure mode on 
            the PIX:

</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a number of remote 
            FreeBSD servers that we'd like to power off after shutdown in preparation 
            for some power work in the data center. I've tried a couple of things, 
            but I can't seem to get the machines to shut off. Do you have a step-by-step 
            process I could use?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> I'm going to assume that you're 
              running FreeBSD on some sort of x86-based architecture. Your machine 
              must support either APM or ACPI and contain a motherboard (ATX, 
              not AT) capable of powering off when commanded to by said drivers. 
              If you have very old PCs, it's possible that they're AT based and 
              won't work. If your hardware supports power management, and you're 
              running FreeBSD 4, the easiest route will be to make sure that APM 
              is enabled. To compile APM support into your kernel, add the following 
              line to the configuration file (or remove the leading work disable 
              from in front of the line if you're working off the generic configuration 
              file):
            <P> 
            <pre>
device apm0 at nexus? disable flags 0x20 # Advanced Power Management
</pre>
            Recompile and install the new kernel, and put the following into /etc/rc.conf:
            <P> 
            <pre>
apm_enable="YES"
apmd_enable="YES"
</pre>
            Once you reboot, you should be able to perform a <B>halt -p</B> to 
            power off the machine. For more information on <B>apm</B>, see the 
            <B>apm</B>(4), <B>apm</B>(8), and <B>zzz</B>(8) man pages.
            <P> If you're using FreeBSD 5, you may want to opt to use ACPI instead 
              of APM. ACPI and APM cannot co-exist and should not be used on the 
              same machine, so you need to pick one or the other. APCI is handled 
              by a dynamic driver module, <B>acpi.ko</B>, in FreeBSD 5. The module 
              loads by default, and it's suggested that you don't compile it into 
              the kernel directly. ACPI configuration is handled by the command 
              <B>acpiconf</B> (see the <B>acpiconf</B>(8) man page for detailed 
              information). When ACPI is configured, the machine can be powered 
              off with either of the following two commands:
            <P> 
            <pre>
halt -p
acpiconf -s 5
</pre>
            If you desire, you can also enable ACPI for FreeBSD 4.9 and above 
            (remember to disable APM) by adding the following line to the kernel 
            configuration and rebuilding:
            <P> 
            <pre>
