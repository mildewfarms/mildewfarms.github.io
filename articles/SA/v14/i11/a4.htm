            <h1><img src="a4.gif" width="200" height="167" align="right">Net::Telnet::Cisco 
              Perl Module</h1>
            <P> Mihalis Tsoukalos
            <P> Because DSL prices are still very expensive in Greece, I use an 
              ISDN line to connect to the Internet for home use. For security 
              reasons, I prefer to connect to the Internet with the extra protection 
              of a Cisco 1603 router. I used to open and close the ISDN dialup 
              connection manually because I prefer to have as much control as 
              possible, but this method was quite time consuming so I began searching 
              for a smarter way. My first thought was "is there a Perl module 
              to help me?" As you might imagine, the answer is yes -- there is 
              a Perl module called Net::Telnet::Cisco. In this article, I'll present 
              the use of the Net::Telnet::Cisco Perl module to control Cisco routers 
              along with a complete Perl code example.
            <P> <b>Cisco IOS Introductory Information</b>
            <P> Cisco has developed Cisco IOS, which is its own operating system 
              for its full line of products. It is an advanced OS with a philosophy 
              that is very similar to that of Unix. Tab completes an abbreviated 
              command name, and "?" displays all possible options of a command.
            <P> Cisco IOS basically supports two levels of user access -- User 
              EXEC Mode and Privileged EXEC Mode. User EXEC Mode is similar to 
              the normal user Unix account, while Privileged EXEC Mode is similar 
              to root access. After connecting to Cisco equipment, the user is 
              automatically put into User EXEC Mode. To use the Privileged EXEC 
              Mode, the user must give a command called <B>enable</B>, which then 
              asks for the required password. After successfully providing the 
              password, the user operates in Privileged EXEC Mode.
            <P> Listing 1 shows a full SSH Cisco IOS session for bringing up and 
              down an ISDN dialup connection. Cisco IOS also supports telnet connections. 
              The command <B>configure terminal</B> puts you in terminal configuration 
              mode. The <B>Interface BRI 0</B> command denotes to Cisco IOS the 
              interface that we want to configure or alter. The <B>no shutdown</B> 
              command turns on the dial-up connection, whereas <B>shutdown</B> 
              turns off the ISDN connection. The <B>show ip route</B> command 
              is given for educational purposes, and it is not required. Ctrl+Z 
              returns the user to Privileged EXEC Mode, and if you press "q" from 
              the Privileged EXEC Mode, your current connection will terminate.
            <P> Please note that Net::Telnet::Cisco uses a telnet connection -- 
              that is insecure -- to interact with a Cisco router. For WAN connections, 
              telnet is not acceptable, but for trusted intranet (LAN) networks, 
              telnet is usually perfectly acceptable.
            <P> <b>The Net::Telnet::Cisco Module</b>
            <P> I have installed Net::Telnet::Cisco on my Mac OS X Tiger system 
              using CPAN, which I think is the easiest method of Perl module installation, 
              but you can install it either by downloading a precompiled package 
              for your particular distribution -- if it is available -- or, more 
              traditionally, by downloading the Perl module and compiling it by 
              hand. The more efficient way of checking whether a Perl module is 
              already installed and works properly is to execute the following 
              command:
            <P> 
            <pre>
big:~ mtsouk$ perl -e "use Net::Telnet::Cisco"
big:~ mtsouk$
</pre>
            If this returns a shell prompt without any error messages, then the 
            Perl module in question has been installed correctly; otherwise, you 
            will get an error message that looks like the following:
            <P> 
            <pre>
big:~ mtsouk$ perl -e "use Net::Telnet::Cisco"

</pre>
            Now I'll present and explain few of the commands found in Net::Telnet::Cisco. 
            For a full listing of the supported commands, refer to the Perl module 
            documentation:
            <P> 
            <P> <B>$session = Net::Telnet::Cisco-&gt;new(Host =&gt; $CISCO_IP 
              );</B> -- This command establishes the telnet connection.
            <P> <B>$session-&gt;login("username", "password");</B> -- This command 
              logs the user into the remote Cisco router. If no username is used, 
              you can put in whatever you want as a username. At this point, the 
              user is in User EXEC Mode.
            <P> <B>$session-&gt;enable("enable_password");</B> -- This command 
              puts the user into Privileged EXEC Mode. Be very careful in this 
              mode.
            <P> <B>$session-&gt;cmd('show version');</B> -- This is the way to 
              execute Cisco IOS commands. This command produces output that you 
              can use for debugging purposes.
            <P> <B>$session-&gt;close;</B> -- After finishing your work, you must 
              close the telnet connection to the Cisco machine by using this command.
            <P> <b>Examples</b>
            <P> To demonstrate the Net::Telnet::Cisco module, I've included two 
              Perl scripts that turn on and off the ISDN dialup connection of 
              a Cisco 1603 router. These scripts are used for my home dialup connection, 
              but the same rules apply to other Cisco models. Listing 3 shows 
              the Perl code for turning on the dialup connection, whereas Listing 
              2 shows the Perl code for turning off the dialup connection. These 
              two Perl scripts are quite similar but they are separated for reasons 
              of clarity. The <B>write memory</B> command that should be given 
              in Privileged EXEC Mode saves the current configuration into Cisco 
              router's memory.
            <P> <b>Conclusion</b>
            <P> Automating computer tasks is a nice approach, even for home use, 
              because it eventually saves time and energy. Do not forget to accurately 
              document what you are doing so you can easily make changes in the 
              future.
