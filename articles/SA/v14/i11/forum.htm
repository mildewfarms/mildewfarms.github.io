            <P> If we didn't already realize the importance of disaster recovery 
              plans, recent events have surely brought to the forefront the need 
              for carefully crafted, thoroughly tested, and effectively implemented 
              plans. We are accepting articles from systems administrators involved 
              in recovering data and restoring networks and generally solving 
              the types of problems sys admins can uniquely solve in areas affected 
              by disaster. What worked? What didn't? How did you fix it? If you 
              wish to contribute an article sharing your solutions and experiences, 
              you may submit your proposals to Rikki or me via email.
            <P> I'm not going to write about disaster recovery here, though. I'm 
              going to talk about the future -- specifically, the future of <I>Sys 
              Admin</I>. I'm the type of person who generally sees the future 
              as one big opportunity for improvement and who, especially in times 
              of stress, looks around to see what practical steps can be taken 
              toward that end. (Some judicious system cleanup, for example, can 
              do wonders to immediately improve one's outlook and calm frazzled 
              nerves.)
            <P> I think <I>Sys Admin</I> magazine can both be improved and be 
              an effective tool for improvement if we take advantage of some of 
              its unique properties. The unofficial tag line of this magazine 
              when it was founded was "by systems administrators, for systems 
              administrators". To me, this means that the magazine is your vehicle 
              to drive in the direction you need it to go.
            <P> Armed with the information that is typically provided in the magazine, 
              administrators can increase system performance, strengthen system 
              security, and ensure system reliability. And, because the magazine 
              is distributed globally, solutions and practices presented here 
              are applied around the world. By writing an article for <I>Sys Admin</I>, 
              you are contributing to a body of information used to manage interconnected 
              systems all over the map.
            <P> So, what information do you need? What problems need to be solved? 
              What's going to be important in the future? We make our monthly 
              themes fairly broad for a reason -- to encompass a wide range of 
              topics that might be particularly timely or significant to you. 
              What problems are you working on right now? I encourage you to share 
              those problems and solutions with your peers. Through the magazine, 
              we can advocate best practices in scripting, troubleshooting, backup 
              and recovery, and a multitude of other topics. This not only drives 
              the magazine but also creates an opportunity to improve the security, 
              performance, and reliability of future as well as existing systems.
            <P> I'm reminded of that bumper sticker slogan that says, "think globally; 
              act locally". We can do that with <I>Sys Admin</I>; solve a problem 
              locally and share your experience for the benefit of systems around 
              the world.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
            <P> <I>Amber Ankerholz</i><br>
