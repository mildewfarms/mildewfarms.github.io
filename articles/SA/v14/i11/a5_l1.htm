# The X10 module address that controls power to the modem.

HOUSECODE=A1

#
# These numbers have been adjusted to work with the WireSpeed Westlink 
# DSL modem provided by Verizon. 
#
# Adjust HOUSECODE_OFF_PAUSE so that the off power cycle is long 
# enough to guarantee that your equipment is reset.
#
# Adjust HOUSECODE_ON_PAUSE so that the equipment has enough time to
# synchronize with your line before attempting to start PPPoE.

HOUSECODE_OFF_PAUSE=15s
HOUSECODE_ON_PAUSE=30s

#
# The daemon is rigged to delay more and more time after failing an 
# attempted power cycle.  This keeps it from simply flipping the 
# switch incessently BUT it has the effect of slowing down response to 
# the line coming up. I figured that 1/2 hour was the maximum time I 
# would delay. Adjust it to suit your needs.  Most line outages are 
# pretty short where I am (the longest I've seen so far is 1.5 hours) 
# which got me to about a 15 minute delay for the next powercycle.
