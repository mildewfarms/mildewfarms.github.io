            <P> <B>MRV's LX Series Console Servers Supports FIPS 140-2 Security 
              Standard</B>
            <P> MRV Communications, Inc. announced new software for its LX Series 
              console servers. According to the company, the new software supports 
              the Federal Information Processing Standard ("FIPS") 140-2 security 
              standard and includes an upgraded Linux kernel. MRV's LX Series 
              products are console servers that provide out-of-band networking, 
              thus providing network managers a remote means to manage, configure, 
              and upgrade servers and other networking equipment via their serial 
              ports. The company also says the LX Series provides remote power 
              management and integrated infrastructure/security alarming through 
              a single management interface.
            <P> The LX Series includes the compact LX 1000S with up to four ports, 
              the rack-mountable LX 4000S with up to 48 ports, and the NEBS-compliant 
              LX 8000S with up to 40 ports. The new features are in the LX Series 
              system software Version 3.6.0, which is available now. Other new 
              features in Version 3.6.0 include support for IPv6 networks and 
              expanded support for SNMP v3, which provides encryption. A new Ethernet 
              redundancy capability allows one port to act as a backup to the 
              primary connection. Version 3.6.0 is based on the Linux 2.6 kernel.
            <P> LX Series Version 3.6.0 is currently shipping on all LX Series 
              console servers. It also supports MRV's 5150 Power Control series 
              and IR-7014 Alarm Master. It is a free upgrade for existing LX Series 
              customers via MRV's Web site.

              rackmount server, starting at $745, and includes the two-socket, 
              4-way Sun Fire X4100 and Sun Fire X4200 servers. Future servers 
              in this same family are being designed to accommodate up to eight 
              multi-core processors to achieve 16-way mid-range system performance 
              levels.
