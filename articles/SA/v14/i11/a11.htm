            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have several remote offices 
              that are connected by various kinds of pipes. We're looking for 
              a tool that can measure the available bandwidth and determine where 
              our bottlenecks might be. Do you have any suggestions for free software 
              that will run on FreeBSD?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Take a look at the program <B>pchar</B>, 
              a free reimplementation of Van Jacobson's old <B>pathchar</B>. It's 
              available from:

            and in the FreeBSD ports tree as <B>/usr/ports/net/pchar/</B>. The 
            default mode (no options) will probably get you what you want. To 
            give you a feel for the kind of data it supplies, here's the example

            Another program that might be of use is <B>netperf</B>, which is written 
            by people who work at HP and is available from:

            and Terry Slattery) might also work for you.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> As part of our JumpStart install, 
              we're adding the Sun SAN software to our Solaris 9 machines. After 
              the JumpStart finishes, these machines should have access to all 
              of our SAN volumes. We're installing the following packages:

            Then we reboot to configure the devices and run the following script

            Even though we've run a reconfig reboot, the machine comes back up

            Note that some of these are correct, but the first two are not. I 
            verified that the settings for <B>mpxio-disable</B> and <B>auto-failback</B> 
            were correct in <B>/kernel/drv/scsi_vhci.conf</B>, but no amount of 
            reconfiguration reboots seems to fix the drives with the problem. 
            Do you have any idea why we're seeing this weird behavior and how 
            we can correct it?<p>
			<b><font size="+2">A </font></b> In order for your 
            disks to appear correctly, you need to do a reconfiguration reboot 
            after you configure the controllers with cfgadm but before you enable 
            <B>mpxio</B>. You can split your script into two pieces, placing the 
            second half in <B>/etc/rc2.d</B> to be run when the machine boots 
            back up. Once it runs the first time after the reconfiguration reboot, 
            remove the <B>/etc/rc2.d</B> script so that you don't wind up in a 
            rebooting loop.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We just hired a new employee who's 
              supposed to be working from home most of the time, but he can't 
              seem to get SSH working from his home Linux machine. When he tries 
              to connect, he gets this error:
            <P> 
            <pre>
Disconnecting: Corrupted MAC on input.
</pre>
            I'm not sure what SSH would have to do with his MAC address, since 
            we're on drastically different networks, and the MAC address shouldn't 
            be seen by the server at all. Do you have any clue how we might get 
            around this?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You don't provide any version 
              numbers for the software you're running or what OS you're running 
              on the server, so it's difficult to give an absolute diagnosis. 
              I have heard of people getting the error you describe in a few different 
              cases, though. These seem to be the relevant OpenSSL bug reports:
            <P>

            In one case, there was an issue with OpenSSL for Linux being compiled 
            under the wrong architecture (<B>elf</B> vs. <B>ppc</B>) or using 
            the wrong versions. Recompiling OpenSSL and then OpenSSH fixed that 
            one. Another case reports that some old firmware revisions on Linksys 
            routers exhibit this behavior. In those cases, the fix was to upgrade 
            the firmware. Another report I've seen claims that removing the <B>Banner</B> 
            directive in the <B>sshd_config</B> file on the server fixed an issue 
            that reported the message you describe.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're in the process of moving 
              to Solaris 10 and are trying to convert our startup scripts and

  </pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're supporting some 
            developers who keep their source in CVS in another set of machines. 
            We're trying to figure out the name of a module that was used some 
            time ago, but no one remembers exactly what it was called. None of 
            us has a shell account on the CVS server, unfortunately, so we can't 
            just look at the files on disk. Is there any way to get a listing 
            of all the modules from the server from a remote machine?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> I don't know of a way to tell 
              CVS to give you a listing of everything it knows about, but you 
              can probably get the information you need (assuming you have some 
              idea of what you're looking for and not just completely guessing) 
              by looking at the CVS history. You can run the following to get 
              the history for the entire repository:
            <P> 
            <pre>
cvs history -a
</pre>
            If you have some idea of when your src was last checked in, you can 
            decrease the output by <B>grep</B>ing those results for a partial 
            date, too.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're running IP multipathing 
              on a couple of our Solaris 9 machines, and we keep getting the following 
              error on both machines:
            <P> 
            <pre>
in.mpathd[35]: [ID 398532 daemon.error] Cannot meet requested failure
detection time of 10000 ms on (inet ce0) new failure detection time for
group ipmp0 is 25790 ms.
</pre>
            What could be causing this error, and how do we correct it? It doesn't 
            seem to have much impact on the systems, but it worries me.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The error indicates that whatever 
              source your machines are pinging to verify network connectivity 
              is not returning ICMP within 10 seconds. Ideally, the machine you're 
              pinging (<B>/etc/defaultrouter</B> if you have one configured) should 
              be close enough that it's answering in a timely fashion. If that's 
              not possible, you can set the failure detection time in the file 
              <B>/etc/default/mpathd</B>. From the <B>in.mpathd</B> man page:
            <P> The FAILURE_DETECTION_TIME variable specifies the NIC failure 
              detection time for the ICMP echo request probe method of detecting 
              NIC failure. The shorter the failure detection time, the greater 
              the volume of probe traffic. The default value of FAILURE_DETECTION_TIME 
              is 10 seconds. This means that NIC failure will be detected by in.mpathd 
              within 10 seconds. NIC failures detected by the IFF_RUNNING flag 
              being cleared are acted on as soon as the in.mpathd daemon notices 
              the change in the flag. The NIC repair detection time cannot be 
              configured; however, it is defined as double the value of FAILURE_DETECTION_TIME.
            <P> The unit of measure in <B>/etc/default/mpathd</B> is milliseconds, 
              so to specify 30 seconds (which seems to be long enough for your 
              hosts), you'd change:
            <P> 
            <pre>
FAILURE_DETECTION_TIME=10000
</pre>
            to:
            <P> 
            <pre>
FAILURE_DETECTION_TIME=30000
</pre>
            The best plan is to find out why it's taking so long to hear back 
            from the host you're probing and fix that, though.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We use <B>sudo</B> extensively 
              at our site to allow people access to various commands as root, 
              and this works well. The problem we're running into is that there 
              are a bunch of files that non-root people need to modify (e.g., 
              application owners need to edit Web server and database config files), 
              but we don't want to give them access to a root shell from the editor.
            <P> For the time being, we have started installing <B>vim</B> everywhere 
              and making people use <B>sudo rvim</B> so that they can't break 
              out of <B>vi</B> and get a root shell. Unfortunately, not everyone 
              here uses <B>vi</B> as their editor, and we're getting flack for 
              not allowing people to use <B>pico</B>, <B>emacs</B>, <B>joe</B>, 
              whatever. Is there a better way to accomplish what we're trying 
              to do here?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you're running a reasonably 
              recent version (1.6.8) of <B>sudo</B>, you can allow people to use 
              the <B>sudoedit &lt;file&gt;</B> (or <B>sudo -e</B>) command instead 
              of <B>sudo &lt;editor&gt; &lt;file&gt;</B>. From the sudo man page:
            <P> -e The -e (edit) option indicates that, instead of running a command, 
              the user wishes to edit one or more files. In lieu of a command, 
              the string "sudoedit" is used when consulting the sudoers file. 
              If the user is authorized by sudoers the following steps are taken:
            <P> 1. Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the 
              owner set to the invoking user.
            <P> 2. The editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables 
              is run to edit the temporary files. If neither VISUAL nor EDITOR 
              are set, the program listed in the editor sudoers variable is used.
            <P> 3. If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied 
              back to their original location and the temporary versions are removed.
            <P> If the specified file does not exist, it will be created. Note 
              that unlike most commands run by sudo, the editor is run with the 
              invoking user's environment unmodified. If, for some reason, sudo 
              is unable to update a file with its edited version, the user will 
              receive a warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary 
              file.
            <P> So if you want to give your service owners the ability to edit 
              the file <B>/usr/local/apache/etc/httpd.conf</B> as root, construct 
              your <B>sudoers</B> entry to look like the following (where <B>serviceowner</B> 
              is your user, and <B>webserver</B> is the machine where <B>serviceowner</B> 
              should have permissions):
            <P> 
            <pre>
serviceowner     webserver=sudoedit /usr/local/apache/etc/httpd.conf
</pre>
            Be sure that you're running at least 1.6.8p9, because previous versions 
            contain a race condition that might allow a user with <B>sudo</B> 
            privileges to run arbitrary commands as root.
