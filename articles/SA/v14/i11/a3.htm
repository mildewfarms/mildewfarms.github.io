              Blocking with IP Tables: Some Common Sense Firewall Rules</h1>
            <P> Tony Howlett
            <P> How many legitimate visitors to your company's Web site/intranet 
              are you expecting from South Korea this month? How about legitimate 
              business emails from China? None, you say? Consider that a recent 
              study by Spamhaus showed that the following countries led as sources 
              of spam:
            <P> 
            <P> United States 42%<br>
              South Korean 13.43%<br>
              China 8.43%<br>
              Taiwan 1%
            <P> 
            <P> These statistics say that by blocking the IP address blocks associated 
              with the top three non-U.S. spam-producing countries, you could 
              lower your spam load by 23%. Given that spam comprises more than 
              90% of mail traffic these days, this could lower the load on your 
              mail server by a whopping 20% without any new software or hardware. 
              The same also holds true for worm attacks, phishing attempts, and 
              other attacks. Better results can be gained for companies willing 
              to block more countries or regions. This is the concept and purpose 
              behind Geo-IP blocking.
            <P> I'm going to go out a limb here with the radical premise that 
              just because the Internet is supposed to give us access to the whole 
              world, we don't have to reciprocate and give the whole world access 
              to our network. Call me Internet isolationist or a security reactionary, 
              but most firms have no reason to allow users from the entire world 
              to potentially access their servers. For the Fortune 1000 or truly 
              multi-national firms, this may not be true, but almost all firms 
              could benefit from exercising some caution in what IP addresses 
              they allow to contact their networks.
            <P> The reason this makes sense is that an increasing amount of spam, 
              viruses, worms, and other malware is coming from countries other 
              than the United States. In fact, it is concentrating in a handful 
              of countries that have lax or no laws governing Internet crime. 
              This allows organized gangs of hackers or spamming corporations 
              to thrive. Also, with the CAN-SPAM Act passed by the U.S. legislature, 
              which sets strict rules on how spam can be sent, spam operators 
              may increasingly move their bases of operations overseas.
            <P> There are multiple ways to use the Geo-IP blocking strategy. The 
              implementation can either be a monolithic wall or a mosquito net. 
              Even if you don't want to block any access to your Web or mail servers, 
              you can limit access to interactive services such as telnet and 
              SSH to U.S.-only IP addresses (assuming all your systems administrators 
              are located in the United States). Either way, you can prevent a 
              lot of trouble by blocking access from certain address blocks completely 
              from your network. You can do this with some simple rules in iptables, 
              the popular Linux firewall.
            <P> Even if you don't control the firewall within your organization, 
              you can still run these rules on a Linux-based server and at least 
              secure that machine from threats from these regions. The examples 
              provided here assume the machine is used as a dedicated firewall 
              with two Ethernet interfaces and enough horsepower to handle a fairly 
              robust rule set. This article also requires at least a minimal knowledge 
              of iptables. For a primer on iptables, see the Netfilter Web site 
              (<B>http://www.netfilter.org</B>) or the many past articles in <I>Sys 
              Admin</I>.
            <P> In this article, I will make recommendations on which regions 
              and countries to block and also describe service-related restrictions, 
              such as limiting interactive login traffic. I will include examples 
              of the proper iptables syntax as well as a quick automation script 
              to facilitate adding blocks of IPs. My examples use iptables, but 
              these principles will work with any firewall or even a router. Just 
              replace the iptables syntax with the appropriate commands for your 
              device or operating system. Using these rules, administrators can 
              eliminate a large portion of the malicious traffic headed for their 
              networks.
            <P> Reasons to Implement Geo-IP Blocking
            <P> There are many reasons why Geo-IP blocking may make sense for 
              your network and some why it may not. Let's start with the pros:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Quick -- You should be able to put these entries into your 
                firewall table within minutes, possibly an hour or longer if you 
                want to do all the zones mentioned. That's a small time investment 
                for a big return. There is some maintenance required to keep the 
                IP ranges up to date, but a little scripting can help you with 
                that. 
              <li> No cost -- There is no hardware to buy, no software to buy, 
                and probably the easiest ROI argument you ever made to your boss. 
              <li> Blanket protection -- Geo-IP blocking provides almost total 
                protection from attacks coming from the blocked areas. You don't 
                have to worry about a zero-day attack originating from these areas. 
                Granted, a truly talented hacker could spoof the IP addresses 
                and possibly foil this protection, but those attacks are a small 
                percentage of the cyber attacks that are hitting your public servers 
                every day. 
              <li> Easily reversible -- If you encounter problems with valid emails 
                not getting through, it is simple to remove the offending lines 
                from your iptables configuration. 
              <li> Blocking is only one way -- Users can still access sites in 
                the blocked regions; only inbound connections are prevented from 
                connecting. However, for increased protection and added benefits, 
                you can block outbound connections as well. 
              <li> Block access to objectionable sites -- If you make the rule 
                go both ways, this strategy will stop users from accessing any 
                sites in the region. Given that many hacking sites and call-home 
                Trojans go to offshore sites, this can help with security problems 
                that start inside your LAN.
            </ul>
            <P> <b>Reasons Not to Geo-IP Block</b> 
            <ul>
              <li> Large multi-national business -- Blocking entire regions wholesale 
                is probably not an option for administrators of multi-national 
                corporations. However, there are some strategies for using Geo-IP 
                blocking in a more limited manner, which are covered later. 
              <li> Doing business internationally -- If your company isn't large 
                but does conduct a lot of business overseas, then you'll need 
                to limit your Geo-IP blocking regimen. However, you can still 
                consider blocking countries or regions that you don't do business 
                with. 
              <li> Looking for a 100% solution -- Geo-IP blocking is not 100% 
                effective, but what is? Done correctly, however, Geo-IP blocking 
                provides you with an extra layer of protection to augment your 
                other spam-blocking measures.
            </ul>
            <P> 
            <P> Generally, the idea is to target countries known to be players 
              in the malware world. Because this method blocks all traffic, you 
              don't have to worry about new techniques being developed or your 
              software falling behind. You just block everything, period, end 
              of story.
            <P> <b>IP Addressing</b>
            <P> Before I get into the actual Geo-IP blocking strategies, an understanding 
              of how IP addresses are assigned is in order. IP address numbers 
              are originally delegated at the top level by an organization called 
              the Internet and Name Authority (IANA). This agency handles delegation 
              of large blocks of IP addresses to different entities (i.e., companies, 
              organizations, and countries). They don't actually have anything 
              to do with the way these addresses are used. They just keep track 
              of the numbers and delegate actual handling of the IP blocks to 
              the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) for each region of the world.
            <P> In the United States, the RIR that is responsible for our IP blocks 
              is called the American Registry for Internet numbers (ARIN). In 
              Asia, there is the Asian Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC). 
              For Europe, the Registry for IP European (RIPE) is the authority 
              for all IP numbers, and in Latin America, it's the Latin America 
              and Caribbean Network Information Center (LAPNIC).
            <P> Remember that, when using IPv4, the range of IP addresses is 1.1.1.1 
              to 255.255.255.255, making for just more than 4 billion possible 
              addresses. IANA has reserved large blocks of this space for private 
              use. These are as follows:
            <P> 
            <pre>
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255  
</pre>
            These ranges cannot be used to route traffic on the public Internet. 
            Other ranges are reserved for special or future use. This still leaves 
            a lot of address space to hand out. Each RIR gets a number of contiguous 
            blocks from which to assign address space. As time has passed and 
            the Internet has grown, these distinctions have broken down a little. 
            With globe-spanning communications networks based in the United States, 
            you might find ARIN IP addresses in other countries and vice versa. 
            But generally, the IANA number assignments hold true. 
            <P> <b>Blocking Geo-IP Addresses</b>
            <P> To get started, you must decide whether you want to block a complete 
              RIR or just a few countries in it. Blocking the whole region is 
              quick and easy and the appropriate ranges are listed in the next 
              section. However, this strategy can lead to unintentional blocking 
              and also might miss some regional address space that is registered 
              to a different RIR. If you want to be more thorough, you will need 
              to block country by country. You will need to do some research to 
              find all the addresses associated with the countries you want to 
              block.
            <P> An excellent site to get this information from is the IP to Country 
              database located at:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://ip.ludost.net
</pre>
            This wonderful, free site is run by Vasil Koslev and keeps track of 
            all IP addresses associated with each country, updated daily. It allows 
            you to poll the database and generate a text file for all the countries 
            you want to block. You can also download the whole file and parse 
            it yourself. To begin blocking these segments, a simple iptables command 
            is all that is needed. For example:
            <P> 
            <pre>
iptables -A INPUT -s 58.0.0.0/24 -j DROP
</pre>
            You must issue a separate iptables command for each discrete IP block. 
            Obviously, typing all those statements for each IP range could get 
            tiresome. But there are scripts you can use to import text files into 
            your iptables. In its simplest form, the script would look something 
            like this:
            <P> 
            <pre>
#!/bin/bash

if [ -f geo-ip-block.txt ]
then
        for BLOCKED_IP in 'cat geo-ip-block.txt'
        do
                iptables -A INPUT -s $BLOCKED_IP -j DROP
        done
else
        echo "No Geo-IP Blocking file exists"
fi
</pre>
            This script will read IP addresses from a file and add them to your 
            iptables. Just run the script at the command line or have it run at 
            startup to load your Geo-IP blocked addresses. This script doesn't 
            do any error checking on the IP format or anything fancy, but you 
            get the general idea.
            <P> Blocking IP ranges from any of the other RIRs works the same way. 
              Generate your list using the Ludost site (or any number of commercial 
              services that can do it for you). Note that the IP ranges listed 
              here are not guaranteed to be complete and are subject to change. 
              You should get an updated list before making your own rule sets. 
            <P> <b>APNIC</b>
            <P> A large percentage of malware originates from Asian countries 
              (number 2 and number 3 spammer countries in the study mentioned 
              previously). Just blocking APNIC alone could lower malware hits 
              on your servers by 20% to 30%. However, be careful because a shotgun 
              approach to the Far East will also block Japan, where many companies 
              do business. Also, some Australian and New Zealand sites use APNIC 
              space. For a minimalist approach, I would recommend starting with 
              China, South Korea, and Taiwan. You can add or subtract countries 
              based on your own company's requirements.
            <P> Here are the APNIC ranges according to IANA:
            <P> 
            <pre>
58.0.0.0/8
61.0.0.0/8
124.0.0.0/8
126.0.0.0/8
168.208.0.0/16
196.192.0.0/16
202.0.0.0/8
210.0.0.0/8
218.0.0.0/8
220.0.0.0/8
222.0.0.0/8
</Pre> <B>RIPE</b>
            <P> Blocking RIPE addresses is a little more risky because many multi-national 
              companies are based in Europe, and you may want access to their 
              Web sites, mail servers, etc. Russia is by far the top producer 
              of malware in the region along with Bulgaria, Hungary, Kazakhstan, 
              and Yugoslavia. Again, you can always adjust your settings if you 
              get complaints.
            <P> Here are the complete IANA ranges for RIPE:
            <P> 
            <pre>
80.0.0.0/8
81.0.0.0/8
82.0.0.0/8
83.0.0.0/8
84.0.0.0/8
85.0.0.0/8
86.0.0.0/8
87.0.0.0/8
88.0.0.0/8
89.0.0.0/8
90.0.0.0/8
91.0.0.0/8
193.0.0.0/8
194.0.0.0/8
195.0.0.0/8
212.0.0.0/8
213.0.0.0/8
217.0.0.0/8
</Pre> <B>AFRINIC</b>
            <P> The AFRINIC is a relatively new RIR taking over IP assignments 
              for the African continent. Given that it's new, a lot of existing 
              sites are going to be on the RIPE address space, but it comprises 
              a single, large IP range and blocking is pretty easy:
            <P> 
            <pre>
41.0.0.0/8
</Pre> <B>LACNIC</b>
            <P> Companies heavily involved in NAFTA trade should be very selective 
              about IP blocking in the LACNIC range. Countries to consider blocking 
              would be Brazil and Argentina, the biggest malware producers in 
              the region:
            <P> 
            <pre>
189.0.0.0/8
190.0.0.0/8
200.0.0.0/8
201.0.0.0/8
</Pre> <B>Limited Geo-IP Blocking Strategies</b>
            <P> So far, I have described a wholesale blocking policy. But what 
              if you still want to allow access to your Web server from these 
              countries? You can write a more specific rule letting through Web 
              traffic but blocking all other services.
            <P> Here is an iptables rule for the script above that would block 
              all but Web traffic from the offending IPs:
            <P> 
            <pre>
Iptables -A INPUT -s $BLOCKED_IP -p tcp -dport ! 80 -j DROP
</pre>
            Note that it uses the iptables NOT operator "!", which can come in 
            very handy in constructing complex iptables statements. Just replace 
            the iptables command in the script shown previously with this one.
            <P> Also, there is the school of thought that would allow most access 
              but block interactive services, such as telnet, ssh, ftp, etc. Here 
              is an example of a rule that would reject only those services coming 
              from the suspect IPs:
            <P> 
            <pre>
Iptables -A INPUT -s $BLOCKED_IP -p tcp -dports 21,22,23 -j DROP
</Pre> <B>Conclusion</b>
            <P> Some administrators might oppose this plan as having a limited 
              lifespan or being isolationist. However, if this approach protects 
              your network, even for a year or two, I think it is worth the minimal 
              effort of setting it up. If it causes problems or is no longer effective, 
              it can easily be removed.
            <P> Geo-IP blocking isn't a silver bullet by any means. It won't block 
              all malware headed for your network, and you will still need anti-virus 
              software, spam filters, and all the other tools necessary for a 
              healthy and secure network. This approach is just one way to lower 
              the chances that your network will be compromised and decrease the 
              load on your public servers. Used judiciously, Geo-IP blocking can 
              become one more tool in your security arsenal against the increasing
