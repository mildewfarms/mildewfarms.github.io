            <h2><B>Some p5 Virtualization Features</B></h2>
            <P> LPAR 5 is using Virtual SCSI to communicate with the SAN via the 
              VIO server.
            <P> LPAR 4 is using Virtual SCSI to communicate with the SCSI disks 
              attached directly to the VIO server.
            <P> LPAR 6 is also using a physical SCSI RAID adapter, but in this 
              case it connects directly to a RAID set. This is not virtualization 
              but is included for completeness.
            <P> LPAR 3 is using a physical SCSI adapter to connect to a JBOD (just 
              a bunch of disks). This is not virtualization either, but it too 
              is included for completeness.
            <P> LPAR 2 and LPAR 3 are using shared Ethernet to communicate to 
              the Ethernet network via the physical network adapter in the VIO 
              server.
            <P> LPAR 4 is using Virtual Ethernet to connect directly to LPAR 3 
              via the Hypervisor.
            <P> LPAR 4 is also using Virtual Ethernet to connect directly to LPAR 
              5 via the Hypervisor.
            <P> LPAR 6 is using a physical Ethernet adapter to connect directly 
              to the Ethernet network. This is not virtualization, but is included 
              for completeness.
            <P> The VIO server in LPAR 1 is using a dedicated partition with one 
              CPU available exclusively to the VIO server at all times.
            <P> LPAR 2 and LPAR 3 shared a capped pool of four CPUs. LPAR 2 has 
              a minimum of one whole CPU and a maximum of three CPUs. It will 
              try to use two CPUs unless circumstances dictate otherwise. LPAR 
              3 was configured in exactly the same way.
            <P> LPAR 4 has exclusive access to exactly five CPUs.
            <P> LPAR 5 and LPAR 6 share an uncapped pool of six CPUs. LPAR 5 has 
              a minimum of half a CPU and a maximum of three CPUs. It will try 
              to use two CPUs unless circumstances dictate otherwise. LPAR 6 has 
              a minimum of two CPUs and a maximum of 5.5 CPUs. It will try to 
              use four CPUs unless circumstances dictate otherwise. Because LPAR 
              5 has half of the weight of LPAR 6, LPAR 6 will get twice as many 
              leftover CPU cycles as LPAR 5.
            <P> The HMC can be seen directly attached to the Hypervisor.</table></table>&nbsp;
