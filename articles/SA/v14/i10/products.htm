            <p><B>HP Introduces Lower-Priced Disk Array</B></p>
            <P> HP has introduced the HP StorageWorks XP10000, a high-end disk 
              array at an entry-level price. According to the company, the XP10000 
              enables the implementation of tiered storage applications using 
              internal and external storage capacity and flexible partitioning 
              to simplify provisioning. Also, the disk array is completely heterogeneous, 
              offering support for multiple operating systems including HP-UX, 
              Windows, Linux, OpenVMS, NonStop, Mainframe, Tru64, AIX, and Solaris.
            <P> Additional benefits and features of the XP10000 include: excellent 
              price/performance ratio, increased productivity via higher throughput 
              speeds and virtually zero downtime, a compact footprint to conserve 
              floor space, fully redundant, hot-swappable components, robust local 
              and remote replication capabilities, and advanced disaster recovery 
              solutions.
            <P> Advanced crossbar, fault-tolerant architecture allows for random 
              and sequential I/O operations for database, OLTP, Oracle, SAP, and 
              Exchange workloads. Customers can scale from as few as five disks 
              up to 240 disks with 48 host ports enabling 69 TB of internal capacity. 
              External storage device support enables tiered storage environments 
              that support up to 16 petabytes (PB) of total capacity.

            <P> <B>Levanta Ships Linux Management Appliance</B>
            <P> Levanta announced the general availability of the Intrepid M, 
              its Linux management appliance. According to the company, a Linux 
              systems administrator with as little as two years of experience 
              can use the Intrepid M's intuitive interface to deploy, rollback, 
              and migrate RPM-based Linux servers (whether running Red Hat, SUSE, 
              or Fedora distributions) from a central location, without installing 
              the operating system or applications directly on computers.
            <P> The Intrepid M also ships "ready-to-go" templates for a variety 
              of workstations and servers, as well as the open source software 
              needed to deploy them. Users can also create their own templates 
              and add software of their choice to the repository.
            <P> The Intrepid M retails at $7,495, which includes 10 licenses. 
              Additional licenses are $250 per node. For more information, visit: 
              http://www.levanta.com.

              improved read compatibility, and a memory capacity of up to 8.5 
              GB dual-layer DVD-R media. The software allows data to be added 
              to a disc over several burning sessions. In addition to the new 
              features, NeroLINUX supports burning data and disc images to CDs/DVDs 
              (ISO9660, UDF, and UDF/ISO9660 Bridge), Bootable CDs/DVDs, Audio 
              CDs with CD text, Mixed Mode CDs, CD-EXTRA, Multi-session CD/DVDs 
              and Double Layer DVDs. It is provided as a standard Linux package 
              in RPM or DEB. Supported 32-bit distributions include Red Hat 7.2, 
              7.3, 8.0, 9.0, and Enterprise Linux 3.0, SUSE 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 9.0,

            <P> <B>Advanced Systems Concepts Introduces ActiveBatch Web Server 
              Version 5</B>
            <P> Advanced Systems Concepts, Inc. (ASCI) announced ActiveBatch Web 
              Server Version 5, the enhanced Internet client/server component 
              to its ActiveBatch job scheduling and management system. According 
              to the announcement, ActiveBatch Web Server Version 5 provides access 
              to the major components of the ActiveBatch feature set via Internet 
              Explorer, Netscape, or FireFox Web browsers, enabling administrators 
              to address their real-time batch processing requirements with "exceptional 
              ease and dependability". New capabilities in ActiveBatch Web Server 
              Version 5 include a new information filter that provides additional 
              security when working with objects. The filter reveals only the 
              data relevant to the customer's particular object list, and only 
              allows that person to view or change those objects to which he or 
              she has been given access. Unauthorized users cannot see any objects 
              but their own.
            <P> The company says that ActiveBatch Web Server for Version 5 also 
              monitors jobs and processes with greater immediacy. A Daily Activity 
              View enables users to review job status, while other reports provide 
              job instance histories and other performance details. Managers can 
              also use the ActiveBatch Web client to control all on-going operational 
              situations and even to initiate actions. ActiveBatch Web Server 
              Version 5 (like previous versions) provides operational control 
              for creating, modifying, submitting, holding, or deleting ActiveBatch 
              objects. For more information, visit: http://www.advsyscon.com.
            <P> <B>Funk Software Unveils Steel-Belted Radius for Linux</B>

              SUSE Enterprise Server 9 (SLES9) and Red Hat (Enterprise and Advanced 
              Server 3) versions of Linux. According to the company, Steel-Belted 
              Radius is a RADIUS/AAA server that lets administrators centrally 
              manage all remote/VPN, WLAN, and wired 802.1X users and equipment, 
              thus providing enhanced security, more streamlined management, and 
              granular control over who can access the network and how. It runs 
              on Windows, Solaris, and Linux and is fully compliant with the RADIUS 
              specification, the IEEE security standard 802.1X, and all popular 
              WLAN protocols, including EAP-TTLS, EAP-PEAP, EAP-TLS, and Cisco's 
              LEAP. The company says the Steel-Belted Radius integrates easily 
              into an organization's network infrastructure, and can authenticate 
              users accessing the network against a wide variety of authentication 
              databases, including Windows Active Directory, SQL databases, LDAP 
              directories such as Novell's eDirectory, and token systems such 
              as the RSA Authentication Manager.
            <P> Pricing for new customers is $4,995 per server for the Enterprise 
              Edition, $12,000 per server for the Global Enterprise Edition, and 
              $22,000 per server for the Service Provider Edition. For more information,
