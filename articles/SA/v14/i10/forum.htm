            <h1><img src="../../resource/syslog.gif" width="215" height="85" align="right">syslog</h1>
            <P> The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently 
              launched a comprehensive vulnerability database featuring daily 
              updates on the latest security problems in software products. According 
              to the Web site, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) "integrates 
              all publicly available U.S. government vulnerability resources and 
              provides references to industry resources". It is based on and synchronized 
              with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming standard.
            <P> At this time of writing, the site contains more than 12,000 vulnerability 
              entries, and the publication rate stands at nine vulnerabilities 
              per day. The home page also lists the 20 most recent CVE vulnerabilities. 
              The database, which is funded by the Homeland Security Department's 
              National Cyber Security Division, is searchable by CVE name, US-CERT 
              Technical Alerts, US-CERT Vulnerability Notes, and OVAL Definition.
            <P> The NVD's vulnerability information is available for free as an 
              XML feed, and the site also provides a statistics generation engine. 
              According to the site, this can be used "to graph and chart vulnerabilities 
              discovered within a product or to graph and chart sets of vulnerabilities 
              containing particular characteristics (e.g., remotely exploitable 
              buffer overflows)". You can check out the database at: <B>http://nvd.nist.gov</B>.
            <P> I need to mention a couple of updates to previously published 
              articles. When the article "Vulnerability Assessments with Nmap 
              and Nessus" (14(8):17-22) by Wyman Miles was written, the Nmap::Parser 
              module took the syntax noted in the scripts presented with the article. 
              The release of the 1.0 module in July, however, saw some changes 
              in the syntax, as follows:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> "register_host_callback" has been changed to "callback". 
              <li> "parse_filters" appears to no longer exist and can be omitted.</ul>
                <P> 
                <P> With these changes, the scripts will work with the current 
                  version of the module. We regret any inconvenience caused by 
                  this situation.
                <P> Also, we have posted some additional configuration scripts 
                  to accompany the "Enhancing Kickstart" article by Brian Boyd 
                  that appeared in the September issue. The scripts, which define 
                  public functions, configuration paths, and global variables, 
                  are now available from the <I>Sys Admin</I> Web site: <B>http://www.sysadminmag.com/code/</B>. 
                  Please send additional comments, suggestions, and corrections 
                  to me at: <B>aankerholz@cmp.com</B>. I look forward to hearing 
                  from you.
                <P>&nbsp; 
                <P> Sincerely yours,
                <P> <I>Amber Ankerholz</i>
