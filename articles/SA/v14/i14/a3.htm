            <h1>Console Servers Product Survey</h1>
            <P> Steve Michnick
            <P> The quintessential and critical requirement for managing any high-powered 
              and multiform data center is solid and secure console management. 
              Highly skilled sys admins require around the clock, secure remote 
              access to system consoles from any location to effectively and efficiently 
              manage the crucial assets in a distributed environment. System managers 
              require the features of data encryption, session monitoring, and 
              audit logging to meet increasingly strict security expectations 
              from customers and government regulators. Console servers are designed 
              to address these requirements and provide many other features that 
              simplify the task of operating a fleet of data processing equipment. 
              This survey will help you get to know many of the features available 
              when evaluating console server products and shows how vendors in 
              the marketplace are positioning themselves to meet the important 
              console server requirements.
            <P> <B>Console Access Methods</B>
            <P> The first and foremost features to consider when evaluating a 
              console server are the methods it will provide for accessing your 
              computer systems and network devices. There are two fundamental 
              methods -- terminal server and browser-based approaches. All surveyed 
              vendor products, except one, support both methods with moderately 
              varying degrees of features.
            <P> <B>Terminal Servers</B>
            <P> Terminal servers provide a command-line interface (CLI) that can 
              use secure shell (SSH) protocol for encrypting the console network 
              connection. The CLI approach to accessing consoles has been the 
              standard method for access for years and vendors provide a broad 
              range of terminal emulations to support a wide range of systems. 
              You should still check with the console server vendors about compatibility 
              if you have devices that do not support VT-100 interfaces.
            <P> One important limitation to terminal server access across SSH 
              is the need for sys admins to carry their SSH client licenses and 
              keys with them to successfully connect to a system console. Another 
              limitation to the CLI/SSH approach is the limits of the terminal 
              server's SSH client's ability to determine and cache critical alerts, 
              so they can be sent to the admin when he starts a console connection.
            <P> Finally, check whether a vendor's console server SSH-based client 
              will interact with your operations standards for Authentication, 
              Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) systems, such as Lightweight 
              Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), RADIUS, Active Directory, and 
              Cisco Systems TACACS+.
            <P> <B>Browser Access</B>
            <P> Web browser-based access is desirable since it provides access 
              to the console server through the Internet under the protection 
              of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol using a wide variety 
              of Java-enabled devices. This gives sys admins with 24-hour, on-call 
              responsibilities the capability to quickly respond to alerts from 
              anywhere in the world that has Web access. Browser access sets a 
              sys admin free from carrying a copy of an SSH client along with 
              the requisite server keys. Web-browser solutions also can take advantage 
              of the full potential of the console server operating system's ability 
              to cache and intelligently process system messages to provide a 
              full report of alerts and traps from a managed server. Browser solutions 
              also provide flexibility in implementing encryption algorithms and 
              AAA solutions for directory services due to the ease of sending 
              Java applets to the client browser. The main drawbacks to browser 
              access to console servers are the limitations to terminal emulation 
              and the lack of support for out-of-band access, which will be critical 
              when confronted with a denial-of-service attacks.
            <P> <B>How to Use the Survey</B>
            <P> This survey is organized into four categories: console server 
              features, platform specifications, connectivity, and security. Each 
              line time-categorizes some of the important aspects to consider 
              when developing specifications for evaluating console server vendors.
            <P> <B>Console Server Features</B>
            <P> This is a short summary of the platform, operating system, addressing 
              support, and redundancy features available from each of the vendors 
              that replied to requests for information about their products.
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Direct Port Addressing determines whether sessions can be established 
                directly to a console port, bypassing the console server command 
                interface. 
              <li> Redundancy features are critical given the central command 
                and control role a console server will play in data center operations.
            </ul>
            <P> <B>Platform Specifications</B>
            <P> This section provides the details of the number of CPUs, available 
              RAM, and Flash Memory capabilities of each vendor's products.
            <P> <B>Connectivity</B>
            <P> This section details the port capacity, data transfer rates, Ethernet 
              interfaces, protocols supported, and whether Web-browser access 
              is supported by the vendor's products.
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Out-of-Band Connections allow access to the console server 
                outside of the data center network, typically using a dial-in 
                modem. This provides access to the console server even when normal 
                network conditions do not exist.
            </ul>
            <P> <B>Security</B>
            <P> This section summarizes key security features offered by the vendors. 
              These features include encryption algorithms, authentication method, 
              session monitoring and logging capabilities, history buffering, 
              SSH compatibility, and method for sending critical system alarms.
            <P> <B>Vendor Notes</B>
            <P> Each of the vendors included in this survey replied with generous 
              information about all the console server products they offer. These 
              replies were condensed to show the common features available across 
              each vendor's product lines along with specific notes describing 
              where there are differences in the features available between the 
              ranges of vendor models. Please consult the vendor Web sites or 
              sales consultants for complete and specific details for each of 
              the models.
            <P> All but one vendor in this survey offer integrated hardware/software 
              console server solutions. Carlo Gavazzi provides software to turn 
              a Sun Solaris server, equipped with proprietary Asynchronous Multi-port 
              Controllers, into a console server. Carlo Gavazzi's unique approach 
              provides the ability to custom-build a console server with the level 
              of performance, redundancy, and number of console ports to suit 
              your needs.
