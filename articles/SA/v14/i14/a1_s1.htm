            <h1><B>Of Mice and Keyboards</B></h1>
            <P> Today, we have a variety of remote access methods for full, GUI 
              control of a remote device (both with software and hardware solutions). 
              However, for these to be useful, some fundamental things must be 
              working:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> The network cable must be properly connected. 
              <li> The network interface must be properly configured. 
              <li> The OS must be running properly. 
              <li> The remote access software must be correctly configured and 
                enabled.
            </ul>
            <P> 
            <P> If you take away any of those components, it's time to travel 
              to the "local" keyboard or mouse, unless you have remote serial 
              console access available. Even if you have full GUI control, remote 
              serial access can be a good safety net to save you time when trying 
              to restore the GUI access. (And, if you have a serial console service 
              implemented, you may have already noticed an alarm about the disconnected 
              cable. SNMP could have told you that the host isn't answering, but 
              a serial console can tell you whether the device is on and whether 
              the IP settings are correct.)
            <P> Let's think outside the server room. With a standard KVM (keyboard/video/mouse) 
              switch, you have some fairly strict length limitations on the cables. 
              These switches also mean that only one machine can be actively monitored 
              at a time, because there is only a single screen and keyboard. (The 
              basic cost-per-port for a basic KVM is also only 20-30 dollars less 
              than for a basic remote serial port.)
            <P> Do you have servers located in an external data center? Although 
              there are ways to remotely manage a screen image across the Internet, 
              the price-per-port quickly exceeds 2.5x that of a remote serial 
              port.
            <P> In some cases, you need a KVM to get things started. With many 
              Linux and Unix servers and desktop machines, you may need to do 
              the initial configuration using a "local" keyboard and mouse console. 
              After that, you can set up a JumpStart service or make a disk-image 
              installation CD, which will minimize the need for a local screen, 
              and automatically configure the devices to use a serial port for 
              their consoles.
            <P> Windows operating systems don't readily allow management via a 
              serial port. However, for the past few years, most BIOS makers have 
              been adding an option to redirect the Power-On Self Test information 
              to a serial port. (There are also efforts being made for managing 
              via Ethernet, with Intel's IPMI spec being a good example:
