            <h1><B>Terminal Server versus Console Server</B></h1>
            <P> Historically, there were terminal servers designed to allow serial 
              devices such as modems and CRT terminals to connect to network resources 
              (typically mainframe computers), with the terminal server handling 
              all of the network protocol tasks. Later, the "Reverse-TCP" feature 
              was added, allowing users on the network to gain access to a specific 
              serial port on the terminal server, typically to allow many users 
              to share the limited number of outbound modem devices and to allow 
              the mainframe to directly access a serial printer.
            <P> Because the original core features set for terminal servers was 
              to connect to modems, these devices often sent serial BREAK to the 
              modem at the end of a session, as a way to reset a modem to its 
              non-volatile RAM settings. One side effect of those early hardware 
              designs was that these devices also usually sent the BREAK signal 
              to all of the serial ports when the power to the terminal server 
              was turned off. If you are using older Sun Microsystems hardware 
              or some SGI servers, you know that this signal will cause these 
              computers to halt, causing Sun computers to go to the "ok&gt;" prompt. 
              More information about serial BREAK can be found online at:

            Console servers are the new generation of hardware, designed with 
            remote access to serial consoles as a primary task. They often come 
            with default settings already configured for such service, and most 
            come with SSL and/ or SSH security features built-in. (Note: I did 
            write "most" come with security features built-in. You still need 
            to read the specs to see whether a device has these features, and 
            to see how current their SSL/SSH versions are. Ask how quickly they 
            update their versions when an SSH hole is found, if that's an important 
            issue for your shop.) Most console servers are also advertising that 
            they are "Sun Safe", meaning that they should only send serial BREAK 
            to a serial port when a user invokes it, so that Sun computers are 
            not unexpectedly halted.
            <P> It can take a fair bit of configuration effort to make an older 
              terminal server work properly for remote access to serial consoles. 
              You may be able to find user documentation on the Web, but you may 
              have trouble finding the software for the terminal server on the 
              Web. Most older devices are no longer supported by their manufacturers 
              (if the maker is still in business). If you can get software, it's 
              probably going to be an old version. If the software has any security 
              features, they will be old versions, and they may well have some 
              old, well-known bugs.
            <P> If you are buying a used terminal server, you may not get the 
              manuals or firmware to make it work. You might be able to find these 
              resources online and make the unit boot using TFTP or BOOTP, but 
              there is a significant "soft cost" of the time to find the resources 
              and set up the infrastructure to make them useful.
            <P> In my opinion, older terminal server hardware should be confined 
              to deployments where there is no need for security and where the 
              connected devices do <I>not</I> care about serial BREAK.</table></table>&nbsp;
