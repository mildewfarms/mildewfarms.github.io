            <P> <B>CrossTec Introduces NetOp Desktop Firewall</B>
            <P> CrossTec Corporation announced the release of the NetOp Desktop 
              Firewall, developed by Danware Data A/S and designed to protect 
              enterprises from the vulnerabilities associated with the use of 
              laptop machines on a corporate network. According to the company, 
              NetOp Desktop Firewall is a driver-centric firewall and addresses 
              the security needs that corporations encounter when their employees 
              take their corporate laptops outside the protection of the perimeter 
              firewall. The NetOp Desktop Firewall offers process and application 
              control, protecting computers on the corporate network and ensuring 
              laptop security.
            <P> The centrally managed firewall restricts traffic in to and out 
              of network machines via port, protocol, and IP address. Additionally, 
              the NetOp Desktop Firewall provides process control to limit which 
              applications run on each user's machine. Only applications significant 
              to a user's needs are run on their computers, controlling the execution 
              of malicious applications such as viruses, worms, spy-ware, and 
              ad-ware. The firewall's centralized management utility enables the 
              creation of corporate policies that provide protection whether on 
              or off the corporate network.
