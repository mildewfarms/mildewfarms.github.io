            <P> <I>Sys Admin</I>'s online sister publication, <B>UnixReview.com</B>, 
              has been updated to a new format. If you haven't visited <B>UnixReview.com</B> 
              in a while, I invite you to visit and see what you think. You can 
              check out Peter Salus's book reviews, Zonker's reviews of open source 
              tools, Emmett Dulaney's certification news, Ed Schaefer's shell 
              corner, and more on <B>UnixReview.com</B>. If you see broken links 
              or other problems with the new design, please let us know.
            <P> One of the featured articles in this March issue of <I>Sys Admin</I> 
              is "Intrusion Prevention and Active Response: Implementing an Open 
              Source Defense" by Angela Orebaugh and Eric Cole. As the article 
              states, "while commercial intrusion prevention products are often 
              technologically diverse and contain a rich feature set, they also 
              often come with a hefty price tag." Orebaugh and Cole's article 
              describes free, open source alternatives for implementing intrusion 
              prevention systems.
            <P> Eric Cole will be presenting more security tips at the upcoming 
              SANS 2005 Conference, April 5-12 in San Diego, CA, where he will 
              be teaching "Management 414: SANS +S Training Program for the CISSP 
              Certification Exam." This review course will cover the security 
              concepts needed to take the CISSP exam. It's an accelerated course 
              that assumes a basic understanding of networks and operating systems.
            <P> Hal Pomeranz will also be presenting at the SANS Conference. He'll 
              be teaching "Security 506: Securing Unix/Linux", which provides 
              in-depth coverage of Unix security issues. In this course, participants 
              will "examine how to mitigate or eliminate general problems that 
              apply to all Unix-like operating systems including vulnerabilities 
              in the password authentication system, file system, virtual memory 
              system, and in common network protocols such as NFS, NIS, and the 
              Unix RPC mechanism." You will learn the exact steps necessary to 
              secure the two most common Unix flavors -- Solaris and Linux -- 
              and get specific advice for securing some of the most common Internet 
              services on the Unix platform, including Apache, WU-FTPD, Sendmail, 
              and BIND.
            <P> Also, don't forget about the <I>Sys Admin</I> tracks at the upcoming 
              Software Development Conference &amp; Expo, March 14-18 in Santa 
              Clara, CA. Randal Schwartz will be on hand to teach "Learning Perl" 
              and "Intermediate Perl". &AElig;leen Frisch will teach "Beyond Shell 
              Scripts: 21st Century Automation Tools" and "Essential Python for 
              Systems Administrators". Hal Pomeranz will present "How They Do 
              It: Unix Hacking 101" and "Simple Unix Tricks: Spotting Break-ins". 
              And, Peter Galvin will present "New Security Features in Solaris 
              X" as well as "Surveying the Current Computer Security Landscape". 
              See page 56 for more information. I hope you'll be able to attend.
