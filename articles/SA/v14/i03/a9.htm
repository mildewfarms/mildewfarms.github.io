            <h1><img src="../../resource/1_questions.gif" width="245" height="130" align="right">Questions 
              and Answers</h1>
            <P><i> Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just started a new job and 
              inherited a Solaris 8 machine running <B>ipfilter</B>. This machine 
              acts as the company's gateway to the Internet. I've used <B>ipfilter</B> 
              and Solaris 8 together before, so I'm not a complete novice here. 
              The log file is filled with lines claiming that there's a <B>gethostbyaddr</B> 
              mismatch, though, and I'm not sure what's causing the issue. It 
              seems to log this error for every host, not just one or two. And 
              I've verified several of them using dig. Both the A and PTR records 
              for these hosts match perfectly without any errors. Here are a couple 
              sample log entries separated by about 12 hours. I've deleted the 
              different hosts and IPs, since they don't seem to be significant. 
              Do you know what the issue might be?
            <P> 
            <pre>
Dec  1 00:13:29 gateway.my.domain ipmon[186]: \
  [ID 484914 local0.notice] gethostbyaddr: HOST != IP
Dec  1 12:26:05 gateway.my.domain ipmon[186]: \
  [ID 484914 local0.notice] gethostbyaddr: HOST != IP</pre> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Since you don't provide 
            the hostnames and IPs, I can't independently verify that the A and 
            PTR records match. Since you said that this happens with all packets, 
            though, you're likely right that it's not the cause of the problem. 
            I've seen <B>ipfilter</B> act this way if it was compiled for a kernel 
            that's different from the one running.
            <P> Perhaps an OS patch was applied or the machine was upgraded since 
              the last time <B>ipfilter</B> was built? You might want to turn 
              down the logging level so that you're only seeing blocked packets, 
              or, better yet, upgrade/recompile <B>ipfilter</B> on the gateway 
              machine. If you don't have a compiler on the gateway machine, be 
              sure to build the software on a reasonably identical machine so 
              you don't run into the same kernel patch level or library issues.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Is there a GUI interface I could 
              use to configure sendmail instead of modifying the cf file directly?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You should never modify the cf 
              file directly. Any modern version of sendmail should be using <B>m4</B> 
              to generate the cf file from an mc file. That said, Sendmail switch, 
              from sendmail.com, has a Web-based front end for doing common sendmail 
              configuration tasks. Various other Sendmail products also integrate 
              with the GUI front end if you're looking for add-on features.
            <P> Some people also opt to use Webmin:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://www.webmin.com/
</pre>
            with the sendmail module:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://www.webmin.com/download/modules/
</pre>
            However, this is not an integrated part of sendmail like the commercial 
            product is. On the other hand, if you're running an MTA other than 
            sendmail, Webmin might be your best bet for GUI configuration tasks.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running FreeBSD 4.9 with Apache 
              2.0.45 from the ports collection. I installed Apache ages ago, and 
              it's been running fine ever since. Recently we had a power outage 
              in our data center and when the machine came back up, Apache wasn't 
              started. I was able to log in and start it from the script <B>/usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache2.sh</B>, 
              though. I looked through the log files and couldn't see anything 
              suspicious. I installed Apache on one of the clone test boxes and 
              rebooted it to see if I could reproduce the problem. Indeed, Apache 
              didn't start at boot time but would start when I ran the init script 
              by hand. I'm rather baffled here, so any pointers would be useful.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> I suspect your problem might 
              be that you haven't enabled apache2 in <B>/etc/rc.conf</B>. If your 
              /usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache2.sh looks like the following:
            <P> 
            <pre>
/usr/local/etc/rc.subr

name="apache2"
rcvar='set_rcvar'
command="/usr/local/sbin/httpd"
pidfile="/var/run/httpd.pid"
required_files=/usr/local/etc/apache2/httpd.conf

[ -z "$apache2_enable" ]       &amp;&amp; apache2_enable="NO"
[ -z "$apache2ssl_enable" ]    &amp;&amp; apache2ssl_enable="NO"
[ -z "$apache2_flags" ]        &amp;&amp; apache2_flags=""
[ -z "$apache2limits_enable" ] &amp;&amp; apache2limits_enable="NO"
[ -z "$apache2limits_args" ]   &amp;&amp; apache2limits_args="-e -U www"

load_rc_config $name

checkyesno apache2ssl_enable &amp;&amp; apache2_flags="-DSSL $apache2_flags"

checkyesno apache2limits_enable &amp;&amp; \
  start_precmd="usr/bin/limits ${apache2limits_args}
sig_reload=SIGUSR1

run_rc_command "$1"
</pre>
            you should have added something like the following to /etc/rc.conf 
            when you installed apache2:
            <P> 
            <pre>
# APACHE2

# Set to "NO" by default.  Set it to "YES" to enable apache2
apache2_enable="YES"

# Set to "NO" by default.  Set it to "YES" to start apache with SSL
# if &lt;IfDefined SSL&gt; exists in httpd.conf)
apache2ssl_enable="NO"
  
# Set to "NO" by default.  Set it to yes to run limits $limits_args
# just before apache starts.
apache2limits_enable="NO"

# Set to "" by default. Extra flags passed to start command
apache2_flags=""

# Default to "-e -U www". Arguments of pre-start limits run.
apache2limits_args="-e -U www"
</pre>
            You might also want to verify that you're not experiencing temporary 
            DNS issues when the machine first boots. If you're using hostnames 
            to bind Apache, then those names must be resolvable when Apache starts. 
            That sort of problem should show up in error output, though.
            <P> If you're still having issues, you might try modifying your startup 
              script to turn on debugging and/or trace the execution of httpd.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're running sendmail 8.12.11 
              on our primary mail servers, and we're using a number of DNSBLs 
              to reject spam from various bad hosts. This is working fine, but 
              I want to customize the error message that people receive when we 
              bounce their mail. I've achieved the simple case of this, but I 
              want to expand it to be a multi-line response. Right now we have 
              the following example in our <B>sendmail.mc</B> file:
            <P> 
            <pre>
FEATURE('dnsbl', 'dnsbl.njabl.org', '"550 5.7.1 ACCESS DENIED \
  to "$&amp;{client_addr}" by dnsbl.najbl.org \
  (see http://njabl.org/)"', '')dnl
</pre>
            I'd like to change it to something like the following so people stop 
            contacting us directly about their rejected email. As you can see, 
            I've added <B>\n\n</B> to indicate newlines:
            <P> 
            <pre>
FEATURE('dnsbl', 'dnsbl.njabl.org', '"550 5.7.1\n\nYour message 
to our server has been rejected because your IP 
address,\n\n$&amp;{client_addr}, is listed in the database at 
dnsbl.najbl.org. We here at\n\n(ISP NAME) do not have the 
ability to remove you from this list.\n\nIf you feel that this 
listing is in error, please visit\n\nhttp://njabl.org/ and 
contact them directly.', '')dnl
</pre>
            The<B> \n</B> characters are not recognized as newlines, though, so 
            I was hoping you could point me at something that would work.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Stock sendmail does not support 
              multi-line messages as part of a dnsbl feature line. You can use 
              a milter to obtain this behavior, or you can upgrade and try one 
              of the experimental patches to 8.13 that Joe Maimon posted to Usenet. 
              Documentation on the patch and how to recompile sendmail to use 
              it is available at:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://www.jmaimon.com/sendmail/

            The patches themselves can be found at:

</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're trying to come up 
            with a solution to do backups of one of our filesystems. I suggested 
            <B>tar</B>, but I'm not certain that will do the job adequately. Does 
            <B>tar</B> handle sparse files correctly? If not, is there something 
            that will, besides doing a full dump/restore? We only want to back 
            up partial data sets, not the entire filesystem.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You don't mention which operating 
              system or version of <B>tar</B> you are using, and the answer is 
              heavily dependent on that information. If you are using a sparse 
              file-compatible <B>tar</B>, the option to preserve sparse files 
              is often <B>-S</B>. Generally, the information about the location 
              of holes in sparse files is something provided by the kernel. The 
              program <B>star</B>, available from:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://freshmeat.net/projects/star/
</pre>
            will read this data when available, such as in earlier versions of 
            Solaris. From the <B>star</B> documentation:
            <P> * accurate sparse files star is able to reproduce holes in sparse 
              files accurately if the OS includes the needed support functions. 
              This is currently true for Solaris-2.3 to Solaris-2.5.1. 
            <P> From <B>star</B> manpage:
            <P> On Solaris-2.3 ... Solaris-2.5.1 there is a special ioctl() called 
              _FIOAI that allows root to get the allocation info more efficiently. 
              Other operating systems lack support to get the real allocation 
              list and force star to scan the files to look for blocks that only 
              contain null characters. This may cause star to assume more holes 
              to be present than the number that the file really contains.
            <P> On some OSs, the <B>cp</B> and <B>mv</B> utilities will preserve 
              sparse files, but these may not fit your needs if you're trying 
              to bundle/compress your backups into a single file. Other possibilities 
              you might want to look at include <B>pax</B> and <B>cpio</B>.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just inherited a SunFire 
              V880 with a 3310 array attached to it. The filesystem on the array 
              is out of space, so I need to increase its size. From the documentation, 
              I can't figure out whether the 3310 is a JBOD or a true hardware 
              RAID, though, or how many of them I can daisy chain together (if 
              any). Can you offer some insight on what configurations will work?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The 3310 array is available in 
              a few different configurations, so you may have a JBOD or actual 
              hardware RAID depending on your box(es). The first configuration 
              is just a vanilla 3310 with 12 disk slots. This is a JBOD and must 
              be controlled by some sort of RAID software like Sun Volume manager 
              if you don't want to access each disk separately.
            <P> The second configuration is a true hardware RAID unit. You get 
              the same box, but it can have one or two RAID controllers installed. 
              The third configuration is a combination of the first two. You have 
              one 3310 with RAID controllers in it and one 3310 with none (effectively 
              a JBOD, but controlled by the RAID controllers in the first box). 
              You can add up to two expansion units for a total of 36 disks.
            <P> You can tell whether you have a JBOD or a RAID unit by using the 
              <B>sccli</B> command and querying the unit. The following is partial 
              output from a <B>show configuration</B> issued to a 3120 JBOD unit, 
              for example:

</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running sendmail 
            8.12.11 and I've separated my queue directory into multiple different 
            directories so that the queue containing supposed spam messages is 
            handled differently from those containing first run messages. I'm 
            trying to change the number of processes per queue so that the spam 
            queue has fewer processes and doesn't swamp the machine. Here's the 
            change I've made to my mc file so far:
            <P> 
            <pre>
define(QUEUE_DIR,'/var/spool/mqueue/qd*')dnl
QUEUE_GROUP('mqueue','F=f, R=75, I=5m, P=/var/spool/mqueue/qd*')dnl
QUEUE_GROUP('spam','F=f, R=75, I=60m, P=/var/spool/mqueue/spam*')dnl
</pre>
            I'd like to limit the spam queue to 25 processes total without limiting 
            the rest of the queue directories at all, but I'm not sure how to 
            do that.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> From the 8.12.11 documentation 
              in doc/op/op.txt:
            <P> The maximum number of queue runners for an individual queue group 
              can be controlled via the Runners option. If set to 0, entries in 
              the queue will not be processed, which is useful to "quarantine" 
              queue files. The number of runners per queue group may also be set 
              with the option MaxRunnersPerQueue, which applies to queue groups 
              that have no individual limit. That is, the default value for Runners 
              is MaxRunnersPerQueue if set, otherwise 1.
            <P> Your mc file excerpt above shows that you've set both queue runners 
              at 75. If you want to change the spam queue to 25, change your lines 
              to:
            <P> 
            <pre>
QUEUE_GROUP('spam','F=f, R=25, I=240m, P=/var/spool/mqueue/spam*')dnl
</pre>
            You can't explicitly say that there should be no maximum number of 
            queue runners for a group. You can set the number sufficiently high 
            by changing the <B>R=</B> value or you can use the <B>MaxRunnersPerQueue</B> 
            option to set a default that will be applied to any queue group without 
            a specified <B>R=</B> value. The following example sets the default 
            value, which is then applied to mqueue, to 1000:
            <P> 
            <pre>
define('confMAX_RUNNERS_PER_QUEUE','1000')dnl
