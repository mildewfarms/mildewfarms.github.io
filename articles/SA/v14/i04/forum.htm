            <P> I'm fascinated by maps and all types of information visualization. 
              I've mentioned before that one of my favorite maps is "The Internet: 
              01.01.00" by Hal Burch and Bill Cheswick. I have a poster of it 
              in my office, and it looks to me at different times like a representation 
              of a neural network or some type of coral or algal formation. According 
              to the poster text, the graph shown "was created by plotting the 
              shortest path between a networked computer in Murray Hill, New Jersey 
              and the 100,121 networks listed in the global Internet register 
              of Merit Network, Inc. The data were collected on January 1, 2000." 
              More recent versions of the poster are available (<B>http://www.peacockmaps.com</B>), 
              but this one remains for me an intriguing (and somewhat inscrutable) 
              snapshot of the Internet at that time.
            <P> A recent article in Science News Online (<B>http://www.sciencenews.org</B>) 
              states that researchers have discovered that "a remarkable diversity 
              of complex networks" exhibit a common architecture. The article, 
              "Sizing Up Complex Webs: Close or Far, Many Networks Look the Same" 
              by Erica Klarreich, describes this common architecture as consisting 
              of "a few major hubs with many connections and many minor nodes 
              with only a few connections". According to the article, this similarity 
              of structure is seen in at least "four types of complex networks: 
              the World Wide Web, a network of actors who have been in films together, 
              networks of proteins with links between those that can bind to each 
              other, and networks of other cellular molecules with links between 
              molecules involved in the same biochemical reactions."
            <P> In the World Wide Web, for example, the patterns of links between 
              individual nodes are similar to the patterns of links between clusters 
              of nodes, between clusters of clusters, etc. Researchers discovered 
              these similarities by "zooming out" and looking at the networks 
              from farther and farther away. The article goes on to say that understanding 
              the architecture of complex networks is important in applications 
              as diverse as protecting the World Wide Web from hacker attacks 
              and designing drugs with minimal side effects.
            <P> Any tool that helps systems administrators see their systems more 
              effectively is valuable in dealing with capacity planning, backup 
              and recovery, and security problems. In this issue, John Ouellette 
              describes a method of logging and graphing database size to facilitate 
              capacity planning, and James Price provides an equation to help 
              you predict the likelihood that your Unix backup tape will contain 
              readable, usable data. James Pinson describes the "list" utility 
              -- a variation of "ls" that not only lists files but provides a 
              file description as well. I hope that these articles along with 
              the tools and techniques presented elsewhere in this issue will 
              help you visualize, understand, and manage your systems more effectively.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
