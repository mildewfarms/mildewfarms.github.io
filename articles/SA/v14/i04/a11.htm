            <h1><B><img src="a11.gif" width="200" height="167" align="right">Manipulating 
              Floppy Disk Images on Solaris<sup>TM</sup></B></h1>
            <p> <I>Ed Schaefer and John Spurgeon</i>
            <p> With the advent of CD and DVD burners, USB flash drives, and high 
              speed networks, floppy drives are becoming pass&eacute;. For some 
              administrators, however, floppies are still a convenient way to 
              transfer and store small amounts of data. Moreover, a floppy drive 
              may be required to install hardware drivers and other software that 
              is still distributed on diskette.
            <P> On Solaris, the floppy drive may be controlled with the following 
              commands:
            <P> <b>volrmmount</B> -- Call rmmount to mount or unmount media. 
            <P> <B>volcheck</B> -- Check for media in a drive and by default check 
              all floppy media.
            <P> <B>eject</B> -- Eject media such as CD-ROM and floppy from the 
              drive.
            <P> 
            <P> Because we access the floppy drive infrequently, remembering what 
              commands to use and how they work is a challenge. To simplify the 
              process, we created three Korn shell scripts that can be used to 
              manipulate floppy disk images:
            <P> 
            <P> ls_floppy (Listing 1) -- Lists the contents of a diskette.
            <P> dd_to_floppy (Listing 2) -- Copies an image to a diskette (from 
              a file).
            <P> dd_from_floppy (Listing 3) -- Copies an image from a diskette 
              (to a file).
            <P> <B>Listing the Contents of a Diskette</B>
            <P> The ls_floppy script lists the contents of a diskette in the floppy 
              drive referenced by nickname:
            <P> 
            <pre>
ls_floppy  [  -aAbcCdfFgilLmnopqrRstux1  ]  [ nickname ...  ]
</pre>
            If no operands are supplied, the nickname defaults to floppy. The 
            nickname is an alias for a device's pathname. For example, floppy 
            refers to /dev/rdiskette. For a list of valid nicknames, see volrmmount.
            <P> If a diskette is detected in the floppy drive, the script executes 
              the <B>cd</B> command to change to a directory corresponding to 
              the floppy drive, and the directory's contents are listed. The process 
              is repeated for each operand.
            <P> Note that ls_floppy supports the same options as the <B>ls</B> 
              command. For example:
            <P> 
            <pre>
ls_floppy -lr
</pre>
            provides a long listing in reverse order of the default floppy drive.
            <P> <B>Copying an Image to a Diskette</B>
            <P> The dd_to_floppy script copies an image from a file to a diskette. 
              Assume we want to copy an image in the current directory named DISK4 
              to a floppy. To begin, insert a floppy into the drive. (Make sure 
              there's nothing you want to keep on the floppy since it will be 
              overwritten.) Then execute:
            <P> 
            <pre>
dd_to_floppy DISK4
</pre>
            The script first unmounts the drive in case it was left in a mounted 
            state. Next, it mounts the drive using volcheck.
            <P> On our system, a new block file is created in the directory /vol/dev/diskette0/. 
              Because we've hard-coded this pathname in the script, you may need 
              to change it, or you might want to parameterize the value depending 
              on your hardware configuration.
            <P> The name of the block file is derived from the contents of the 
              diskette, so the script searches the directory and displays the 
              available block devices, forcing the user to select one before continuing. 
              For example, one of our diskettes generates the following prompt: 
            <P> 
            <pre>
1) mlx_0109134
Select block file:
</pre>
            When the user selects 1), DISK4 is copied to the floppy using the 
            <B>dd</B> command. Substituting the values in our example for variables 
            in the script, the <B>dd</B> command that is executed looks like this:
            <P> 
            <pre>
dd if=DISK4 of=/vol/dev/diskette0/mlx_0109134
</pre>
            When the <B>dd</B> command completes, the floppy drive is unmounted.
            <P> <B>Copying an Image from a Diskette</B>
            <P> The dd_from_floppy script copies an image from the floppy drive. 
              To copy an image from a floppy to /home/eds/floppies/DISK4, execute:
            <P> 
            <pre>
dd_from_floppy /home/eds/floppies/DISK4
</pre>
            After the floppy is mounted, the user is prompted to select a block 
            file; remember that the name of the block file may vary depending 
            on the diskette:
            <P> 
            <pre>
1) no_name
Select block file:
</pre>
            After the user chooses 1), the following <B>dd</B> command is executed:
            <P> 
            <pre>
dd if=/vol/dev/diskette0/no_name of=/home/eds/floppies/DISK4
</pre>
            Again, when the <B>dd</B> command completes, the floppy drive is unmounted.
            <P> <B>Copying Files to a Diskette</B>
            <P> Because the ls_floppy script leaves the floppy drive in a mounted 
              state, we can use it to copy files to an existing filesystem on 
              the floppy using the <B>cp</B> command. Simply source the ls_floppy 
              script:
            <P> 
            <pre>
. ls_floppy
</pre>
            This mounts the drive and makes /floppy/floppy0 the working directory. 
            To copy the file /tmp/a.out to the floppy disk, execute:
            <P> 
            <pre>
cp /tmp/a.out .
</pre>
            Finally, we think the following alias is cute:
            <P> 
            <pre>
cd_floppy='. ls_floppy'
