              Site Setup within the Prison Environment</B></h1>
            <P> <I>Lee Ratzan</i>
            <p> In this article, I will discuss some issues encountered by systems 
              and network administrators when a major health care provider network 
              becomes responsible for integrating their services into a highly 
              restrictive security-conscious prison environment. The job mandate 
              involves information access and cooperation in a setting not necessarily 
              known for either. Two large organizations concerned with different 
              aspects of security must work together. These issues pose challenges 
              to routine remote site setup.
            <P> <B>The Setting</B>
            <P> Bringing up a remote site or adapting a series of remote sites 
              should be a straightforward task. To be sure, each site has its 
              own economic, logistical, and political headaches, but most problems 
              are usually dispatched in due course of time. Problems become challenges 
              when the task involves communicating information in and out of jails.
            <P> By its very nature, a prison setting is an enclosed, strictly 
              defined, standalone, self-contained environment. A prison is specifically 
              designed for isolation from all influences both internal and external, 
              from within and without. Prison network administrators do not share 
              their router addresses or their network easily.
            <P> There is relatively little public information available regarding 
              prison networking or prison computers. Many prisons operate with 
              an implicit siege mentality even to the point of maintaining their 
              own heat, light, power, electricity, food, and water. Even a mighty 
              search engine (e.g., Google) does not find many detailed relevant 
              Web sites or technical documentation. If public online documents 
              dealing with prison networking or prison computer systems administration 
              exist, then they may lie deep within the <I>Invisible Web</I> (Sherman 
              and Price, 2001).
            <P> University Behavioral HealthCare (UBHC) supports the largest online 
              mental health network in New Jersey and one of the largest in the 
              country. The system configuration consists of multiple Windows 2003 
              servers, Windows 2000 servers, several residual dedicated Windows 
              NT machines, and two legacy SCO Unix servers. There is a production 
              domain and a test domain. Most workstations have new or upgraded 
              Dell hardware running Microsoft Windows XP. Users generally do not 
              have administrative access to their own machines. (The latter policy 
              is in place for reasons of command and control. Illicit downloads 
              are a serious problem and certainly would be so within a prison 
              setting as well.)
            <P> The network configuration uses a gamut of telecommunications features 
              ranging from ISDN lines to SMDS clouds to 100-Mb optical fiber and 
              wireless connections. Dynamic IP addressing applies to most of the 
              network. Static IP addresses are used primarily in mixed turf, dual-jurisdictional 
              environments within the University of Medicine and Dentistry of 
              New Jersey. Routine dial-up is not supported due to HIPAA regulations. 
              (Note that a few very select staff members -- such as the CEO, CIO, 
              Director, and NetOPS support -- do have remote VPN access.)
            <P> UBHC operates dozens of servers supplying distributed file sharing 
              (DFS), remote terminal administration, electronic mail, Web mail, 
              an online clinical pharmacy, an online clinical laboratory, an online 
              clinical medical records system, an online registration system, 
              a crisis alert center, distributed print services, continuous anti-virus 
              protection, and backup services. UBHC maintains a private intranet 
              corporate Web site (ubhcweb) and a general Web site for the public 
              (<B>http://ubhc.umdnj.edu</B>). All services are provided 24 hours 
              a day, 7 days a week to a score of large and small satellite sites 
              across the state.
            <P> <B>The Challenge</B>
            <P> UBHC recently received a contract for up to $50 million per year 
              for 2 years to supply networked mental health services to the New 
              Jersey State penal system of the Department of Corrections (DOC), 
              including maximum and moderate security institutions. According 
              to the <I>Newark Star Ledger</I> (October 24, 2004), there are currently 
              3400 mentally ill inmates in 14 state facilities. An additional 
              14,000 people are evaluated each year as they interact with the 
              DOC. On average, one of every six New Jersey prison inmates is diagnosed 
              as mentally ill.
            <P> UBHC created a new corporate unit called University Correctional 
              HealthCare (UCHC) to affect this contract. Corporate enthusiasm 
              rapidly gave way to the stark reality of systems administrators 
              and network operations as it was their mandate to make it happen. 
              These administrators were faced with major issues imposed in a security 
              environment not accustomed to sharing or cooperation.
            <P> These issues included but were not limited to:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Network 14 prisons with reliable secure high bandwidth connectivity. 
              <li> Create hundreds of new staff computer accounts quickly. 
              <li> Create electronic mailboxes for new staff. 
              <li> Install LanDesk remote management agents on all relevant desktops. 
              <li> Administer email for new staff. 
              <li> Provide desktop support for 154 older jail machines (Windows 
                98). 
              <li> Allocate file space for dozens of new network shares. 
              <li> Back up data from the influx of new work. 
              <li> Fund staff positions to accommodate all of the above. 
              <li> Track tasks and work assignments dynamically, both projected 
                and actual.</ul>
                <P> 
                <P> Did I mention resetting users' forgotten passwords several 
                  times a day?
                <P> <B>Getting Physical Access</B>
                <P> The first step involved physical examination of the environment, 
                  so we scoped it out. To gain access, two forms of photo ID are 
                  required. Everyone must pass through metal detectors, magnetic 
                  wands, body frisking, and searching. Bags and briefcases are 
                  carefully searched item by item. Sharp objects, such as penknives 
                  or pocket multi-function tools, are not routinely permitted. 
                  UCHC computer and network diagnostic equipment may not be carried 
                  in unless cleared, authorized, delineated, checked, scheduled, 
                  and verified well in advance. If you suddenly realize you need 
                  a tool that's out in the van, but it was not included within 
                  the approved equipment list, then the tool might as well be 
                  at the North Pole. (Most of the time DOC on-site equipment was 
                  readily available so the need for our own tools was not as severe 
                  as once anticipated.) Our networking and systems staff must 
                  wear blue or black pants to distinguish themselves from the 
                  inmates. Khaki-colored clothing is not permitted.
                <P> Cell phones, pagers, and Blackberry devices are forbidden. 
                  Telephone access is highly controlled. Some inmates are desperate 
                  for surreptitious phone communication. (According to one anecdotal 
                  tale, several years ago a conspirator on the outside used a 
                  bow and arrow to shoot a cell phone over the barbed wire fence 
                  and adjoining brick wall. To no avail, the recipient was caught 
                  immediately.) Clearly, standard commercial ISP dial-up and DSL 
                  are not viable telecommunication options.
                <P> <B>Getting Network Access</B>
                <P> Many New Jersey State agencies connect to each other via the 
                  Garden State Network through the Office of Information Technology 
                  (OIT: <B>http://www.state.nj.us/it/oit/index.html</B>) and NJEdge 
                  service (<B>http://www.njedge.org</B>). The former boasts 450 
                  mission-critical applications including various aspects of the 
                  Office of Criminal Justice. The latter serves most state schools 
                  and universities. NJEdge supports a robust, readily available, 
                  well-maintained, high-bandwidth network. Nevertheless, NJEdge 
                  and OIT were rejected as not sufficiently secure for prison 
                  applications. A prison router is too tempting a target for hackers.
                <P> Networking options resolved to choices between ISDN, VPN, 
                  Citrix, or Frame Relay T1 connections. ISDN offered inadequate 
                  bandwidth and limited growth potential. Citrix was rejected 
                  for reasons of compatibility. VPN has the distinct advantage 
                  of exploiting communication across the ubiquitous Internet. 
                  This method was initially the mode of choice but later dismissed 
                  when analysis showed too many security concerns. Additionally, 
                  many jail networks had formerly locked down VPN access as a 
                  general policy, thus making a virtual private network virtually 
                  unavailable. Prison administrators only reluctantly open the 
                  gates.
                <P> VPN access in this environment had other deficiencies for 
                  general-purpose connectivity. There was a definite need for 
                  more advanced firewall rules agreed upon at both ends of the 
                  connection. The Internet may be convenient, but it is not fundamentally 
                  secure. Also, in our experience, VPN operation is often too 
                  complicated for the typical user, and too much time is spent 
                  helping users log on.
                <P> A direct Frame Relay T1 circuit became the best option. UCHC 
                  machines working on the periphery of the DOC network would receive 
                  an Internet Protocol (IP) address directly from the UMDNJ name 
                  space:
                <P> 
                <pre>
UMDNJ    Class B network    IP = 130.219.XXX.YYY
</pre>
                We would assign reserved IP addresses from one of 15 existing 
                UBHC subnets. Dynamic addressing via DHCP was chosen because it 
                is more easily managed when remote desktops move. Static IP addressing 
                might involve multiple visits, and physical access is cumbersome. 
                As far as our users were concerned, their desktops would be connected 
                directly to our network and servers. They would see no functional 
                difference. DOC workstations would maintain their own IP addresses 
                within their own network.
                <P> UCHC staff receives email from the Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
                  feature of Microsoft Exchange Server via Internet Explorer as 
                  desired. A DOC proxy server includes the UMDNJ Web server address 
                  in its exception list. Additionally, DOC and UCHC operate with 
                  a cooperative extranet agreement via the Garden State Network 
                  sharing Web-based applications and exchanging LDAP address files.
                <P> A Frame Relay solution has additional benefits. It is easier 
                  to manage and maintain. We can manage it remotely. There are 
                  fewer security bottlenecks. We monitor network activity 24 hours 
                  a day and maintain an on-call network engineer. (A second one 
                  will be funded.) Lastly, and possibly more importantly, the 
                  prison IT administrators would more easily cooperate with us 
                  since much of the support would emanate from our turf, not theirs.
                <P> <B>UCHC Back Office Server Issues</B>
                <P> Current file server storage is adequate for existing needs 
                  but may not be so with the influx of several hundred new users. 
                  Three deployment strategies were considered:
                <P> 
              <li> Dedicated DOC servers interface with other systems on demand. 
              <li> On-site servers with scheduled synchronization back to some 
                master. 
              <li> DOC supports their people, and we support ours.
                <P> 
                <P> The last method is simple, effective, and especially cogent 
                  in an environment where security is a dominant mandate.
                <P> Remote printing must be secured and cannot be misdirected. 
                  The following simple script embedded in the startup folder with 
                  appropriate permissions assigns a specific printer from the 
                  print server to the workstation:
                <P> 
                <pre>
Rem Install Remote Printer Script
 If not exist C:\Docume~1\%username%\Printer.txt got to run
Go to EOF
:run
start \\server\pZZZ
copy y:\helpdesk\Printer.txt c:\Docume~1\%username%
goto EOF
:EOF
exit
</pre>
                Loss of connectivity must be detected quickly in this diverse 
                distributed network.
                <P> In addition to full-scale network monitoring tools, our systems 
                  administrators can run a simple on-demand, in-house checking 
                  utility developed in the WinBatch scripting language (<B>http://www.windowware.com</B>). 
                  A ping-able server may or may not be working properly, but servers 
                  that cannot be pinged have certainly lost connectivity. The 
                  script pings each server, posts results, and then moves on. 
                  A sample code snippet for one server is cited below. It is easily 
                  embellished and adapted for auto-alerts by email or pager to 
                  notify relevant personnel:
                <P> 
                <pre>
ip="server_name"
GoSub pingme
Exit

:pingme
TimeOut=2
Check= IpPing(ip,timeout)
If check ==1
    Display (1, "Successful ping", ip)
End if
If check ==0
    Message ("Cannot ping", ip)
End if
Return
</pre>
                The current backup system consists of nightly online copies to 
                disk and offline copies to DLT media. Older tape images are stored 
                off site. The disk copy refreshes daily for immediate file restores. 
                On-site local backups are carefully guarded.
                <P> Mailbox administration blocks many potentially dangerous attachment 
                  types (.zip, .exe, .com, .bat, etc.). User mail operates on 
                  a three-tiered quota system. The user may send or receive below 
                  a mailbox of size M, can receive but not send if the size increases 
                  to size N, and cannot send when the mailbox exceeds size O (for 
                  overload!). This strategy discourages users from sending massive 
                  attachments because of the immediate impact on their mailbox 
                  operations.
                <P> UCHC scans incoming mail using Symantec anti-virus software 
                  updated daily. The University itself also imposes a spam filter, 
                  which has become steadily more restrictive.
                <P> DOC manages electronic medical records using the Logician 
                  system (<B>http://www.medicalogic.com</B>). UBHC manages their 
                  online medical records using the Clinical Work Station (<B>http://www.csmcorp.com</B>). 
                  Each agency maintains its own secure database server environment. 
                  No effort is being made to merge records across agencies.
                <P> <B>Getting User Access</B>
                <P> The user account creation process involves setting a unique 
                  user name according to a prescribed naming policy, granting 
                  user membership to appropriate access control groups, building 
                  a login script with proper network share mappings, creating 
                  an internal electronic mail mailbox, designating an Internet 
                  address, coordinating with the UMDNJ Human Resources personnel 
                  and billing databases, and assigning a temporary password valid 
                  for one initial login.
                <P> The temporary password must be changed at first login. User 
                  names remain consistent across applications although some applications 
                  require separate passwords. (Single sign-on capability is not 
                  available at this time.) Basic login script templates expedite 
                  account setup and are adapted as necessary. Note that in the 
                  prison environment no physical personal authentication token 
                  or ID device (e.g., swipe card, magnetic reader) is acceptable 
                  because it has the potential of being stolen:

                Password resets are a major disruption. Users balk at good password 
                practices such as password expiration (every 90 days), password 
                complexity (mixed case with digits), account lockouts (three wrong 
                tries). They try password recycling (password A then password 
                B then back to password A). Many users try passwords based on 
                names. (You might as well give an inmate a key.)
                <P> We enforce best practices where passwords must be a minimum 
                  of eight characters long, mixed case, contain at least one digit, 
                  no names or common words. Many new users have difficulty typing 
                  their password properly. Many devise clever excuses for simple 
                  passwords. One user assured us that there was no Shift key on 
                  her keyboard. Such issues result from a mindset in which computers 
                  are seen as impositions and not as tools. We expend a great 
                  deal of time training staff.
                <P> <B>Calling for Help</B>
                <P> For better or worse, our Help Desk has a 300:1 user to staff 
                  ratio. Helpers are reachable by phone, pager, email, and Blackberry. 
                  The prison site setups may add another 400 new users all of 
                  whom need new accounts, passwords, privileges, permissions, 
                  logins, mailboxes, network shares, and home directories. Given 
                  the cumbersome nature of physical access, it was agreed that 
                  each prison would use its own staff as the first level of support 
                  for its own routine day-to-day operations (broken keyboards, 
                  unplugged cables, bad monitors, etc.)
                <P> The Help Desk expects funding for one new staff member. This 
                  strategy will maintain the user-to-support staff ratio. It remains 
                  to be seen whether the project is best served by locating that 
                  individual on-site (the largest prison with the most users), 
                  on the road (travelling between sites), or at the main UBHC 
                  office armed with multiple remote administration consoles.
                <P> Tasks are assigned, tracked, and recorded using the HEAT help 
                  desk control system (<B>http://www.frontrange.com/heat</B>). 
                  HEAT is currently being used successfully by the U.S. Navy, 
                  Lucent, Shell Oil, Electricite de France, and other major organizations. 
                  The system issues and monitors work tickets by project, date, 
                  assignee, and task. A sophisticated report generator provides 
                  executive management decision support. This information can 
                  justify additional funding or staffing levels. The Department 
                  of Corrections requires a thorough and complete documentation 
                  trail.
                <P> <B>Summary</B>
                <P> Setting up a remote site should be a routine straightforward 
                  task. Although each site has its own peculiar problems, attributes, 
                  and headaches, putting a remote site online is a common systems 
                  administration function. Problems become more challenging when 
                  the task involves a highly secure prison environment.
