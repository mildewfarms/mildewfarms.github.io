            <h1><B><img src="a2.gif" width="200" height="167" align="right">The 
              smbbackup Utility</B></h1>
            <P> <I>Sandor Patocs</i>
            <p> Although Linux has enjoyed tremendous growth and increased popularity, 
              many organizations still heavily favor the use of Windows. CostWare, 
              the company I work for, provides a cost recovery system for professional 
              organizations such as law firms. It is not uncommon for CostWare 
              to be the only Linux-based application server in a firm.
            <P> For larger firms, the task of backing up a Linux system is not 
              a problem. However, for smaller firms with small or non-existent 
              IT departments, this can be a daunting task. The backup software 
              used by smaller organizations often does not provide a backup solution 
              for Linux. In cases like this, CostWare uses a utility called smbbackup 
              to back up the CostWare server to a shared Windows drive. This allows 
              the firm to use its existing Windows-based backup software to archive 
              critical files. One advantage to using this utility is that the 
              Linux system does not need to join the Active Directory domain to 
              back up files to the Windows server.
            <P> The smbbackup utility was originally designed to provide a means 
              of backing up Linux systems. It can also be used to back up any 
              other Unix-based system that has a minimal Samba installation in 
              place. smbbackup uses tools that are part of the Samba suite to 
              back up Unix files to a SMB/CIFS (Windows) share. The program uses 
              the smbclient program to perform the actual operations needed to 
              transfer files and directories. Directories and their contents, 
              including sub-directories, are copied to the remote server. Entire 
              directory trees are copied by default. The utility's include/exclude 
              options may be used to include or exclude specific files and directories.
            <P> <B>Installation</B>
            <P> Installation of the utility is straightforward. Simply download 
              the tar file from <B>http://www.costwareinc.com/freesoftware/</B>. 
              The utility is packaged as a self-extracting executable. Simply 
              run the installer as root and answer a few questions.
            <P> The following is a sample installation session:
            <P> 
            <pre>
$./smbbkup.installer

Installation directory [/usr/local/sbin]:
Installng SmbclientParser  ... OK
Installing smbbackup utility  ... OK
Installation complete
Command-Line Options
</pre>
            The smbbackup utility reads options from the command line or from 
            a file using the "directions" option (direction files will be discussed 
            later):
            <P> 
            <pre>
-a /root/authfile, -auth /root/authfile
</pre>
            This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username, 
            domain name, and password used in the connection. The format of the 
            file is:
            <P> 
            <pre>
username = &lt;value&gt;
password = &lt;value&gt;
domain = &lt;value&gt;
</pre>
            If the domain parameter is missing, then the current workgroup name 
            is used instead. Be sure that the permissions on the file restrict 
            access from unwanted users:
            <P> -c, -clean -- New files and directories are copied to the location 
              specified using the <B>--to</B> option. Existing files and directories 
              on the destination server are not removed by default. This means 
              that the "to" location will continue to grow as new files and directories 
              are copied to it. This option causes a remote file or directory 
              to be removed before a new copy is transferred. Directories are 
              removed in their entirety, including sub-directories. Existing files 
              are overwritten when this option is not used.
            <P> -d directions, -directions directions -- Instead of specifying 
              options on the command line, all options can be saved in a "directions" 
              file. The options in the file are stored as key/value pairs. The 
              "key" is the name of a command-line option with the leading hyphen(s) 
              optionally removed. The "values" are the same as those used on the 
              command line (see File 1 below):
            <P> 
            <pre>
clean = 1
include = /
exclude = /proc
exclude = /dev
make = 1
auth = /etc/smbbackup/nt_auth
</pre> <b>File 1 -- Sample Directions File</b>
            <P> <b>-e pattern, -exclude pattern</B> -- Files and directories that 
              match "pattern" are not transferred. The pattern may be a regular 
              expression.
            <P> <B>-f back_this_up, -from back_this_up</B> -- The file or directory 
              to be backed up. If a directory is specified, all of its sub-directories 
              are backed up by default. Use the <B>--exclude</B> option to exclude 
              sub-directories. Use a combination of a directory name and an <B>--include</B> 
              pattern to select multiple files for backup.
            <P> <B>-i pattern, -include pattern</B> -- Only files and directories 
              that match the given pattern are transferred. The pattern may be 
              a regular expression. "Exclude" directives override "include" directives. 
              You can select multiple files using a wildcard with the <B>--include</B> 
              option and then selectively filter out individual items using <B>--exclude</B>.
            <P> <B>-l logfile, -log logfile</B> -- The "logfile" contains a list 
              of all of the files transferred as well as any error messages from 
              the smbclient program.
            <P> <B>-p password, -password password</B> -- The "password" for the 
              username used to log in to the remote server. This option is passed 
              to the smbclient program.
            <P> <B>-t to_here, -to to_here</B> -- "To_here" is the service name 
              of the remote SMB/CIFS share. The value is in the form //host/share/subfolder 
              where "host" is the name of the remote server and "share" is the 
              share name. This "//host/share" portion of this option is passed 
              to the smbclient program. The subfolder section causes smbackup 
              to backup files to the subfolder indicated, which means that a single 
              share can be used to provide access to multiple backup subfolders.
            <P> <B>-u username, -user username</B> -- The username used to log 
              in to the remote server. This option is passed to the smbclient 
              program.
            <P> <B>Directions Files</B>
            <P> The "directions" option can be used to store backup directions 
              in a file. The options used in the file are the same as those available 
              on the command line. Direction files can be chained together, which 
              is helpful when attempting to put together a complex backup system.
            <P> The samples shown in Listings 1-6 are fairly simplistic and reflect 
              how smbbackup can be configured to perform a full and a partial 
              backup for a Linux and Mac OS X system. The name of the full backup 
              file (Listing 1) is passed to the smbackup utility to perform a 
              full backup. The name of the partial backup file (Listing 2) is 
              used when performing a partial backup. Note that the partial backup 
              file relies on the local include files (Listings 4 and 6) to limit 
              the files that are actually backed up. In both cases, user home 
              directories and local application directories are backed up.
            <P> The Linux exclude file (Listing 3) excludes items such as /dev 
              and /proc. With these directories excluded, it is safe to use the 
              full backup file (Listing 1) on either the Linux or Mac system.
            <P> Also note the date specification in the <B>to</B> directive (see 
              Listings 1 and 2). This means that new backup destination folder 
              names that include the date and time can be generated automatically. 
              The <B>make</B> directive must be used whenever the date is to be 
              embedded into a destination folder's name.
            <P> The one-letter variables that begin with a <B>%</B> are expanded 
              using the <B>strftime</B> function. These date conversion specifications 
              are the same as those used by the <B>date</B> command available 
              on most Unix-like systems. See the man page for <B>date</B> or <B>strftime</B> 
              for a complete list of available variables.
            <P> <B>Examples</B>
            <P> The use of files containing directions is ideal for someone wanting 
              to put together a complete backup system. However, sometimes a quick 
              backup of a local directory or system is all that's needed. Below 
              are a few simple examples that can be run from the command line 
              or from "cron".
            <P> To copy all of the files in the Unix directory /home/foobar to 
              the share //server/share:
            <P> 
            <pre>
smbbackup --from /home/foobar --to //server/share --username
Administrator --password password
</pre>
            To copy the files in the Unix directory /home/foobar to the share 
            //server/share, while excluding core files:
            <P> 
            <pre>
smbbackup --from /home/foobar --to //server/share --exclude core
--username Administrator --password password
</pre>
            To copy all files to the share //server/share (this excludes device 
            files, the /proc filesystem, and /tmp):
            <P> 
            <pre>
smbbackup --from / --to //server/share --exclude /dev
--exclude /proc --exclude /tmp --username Administrator --password
password
</pre> <b>Restoring Files</B>
            <P> Restoring files is accomplished using the smbrestore utility. 
              The command-line options used with smbrestore are virtually the 
              same as those used with smbbackup. The main difference is that the 
              meanings of the <B>from</B> and <B>to</B> options are reversed. 
              The <B>from</B> option is used to refer to a remote Windows share, 
              and <B>to</B> refers to a local directory.
            <P> smbrestore accepts the following options:
            <P> 
            <pre>
-a, -auth
-f, -from
-t, -to
-u, -username
-p, -password
-d, -directions
</pre> <b>Shortcomings</B>
            <P> The smbbackup utility cannot back up special files such as character 
              or block device files, named pipes, and so on. There is no way to 
              make such files on a Windows system. Smbbackup is best suited for 
              backing up regular files and directories that may need to be restored 
              to an already running system. It should not be relied upon for bare-metal 
              restores.
            <P> <B>Conclusion</B>
            <P> The smbbackup utility provides an easy to use command-line interface 
              for backing up files to an SMB/CIFS share. Through the use of direction 
              files, a systems administrator can configure a fairly complete backup 
              scheme. The utility does not back up device files or other types 
              of special files, so it is not a good tool for a bare-metal recovery. 
              However, when a simple backup of user files and applications is 
              needed, it can be very useful.
