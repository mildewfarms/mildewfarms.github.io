            <P><b> Guardian Digital Enhances Secure Mail Suite </b>
            <P> Guardian Digital, an open source Internet security company, has 
              announced the availability of the first anti-spam software tool 
              designed specifically to diminish the threat of Trojan zombie attacks, 
              which can cause serious problems within corporate email infrastructures. 
              Known to take over unsuspecting computers and utilize its resources 
              to send out spam messages, zombie-type attacks use the domain name 
              of the victimized computers ISP to send messages that appear as 
              if they are coming directly from the ISP, making it very difficult 
              for customary anti-spam solutions to block them. 
            <P> Guardian Digital Secure Mail Suite incorporates "outbound purification" 
              technology. According to the company, this innovation allows the 
              system to filter outbound mail to ensure all messages exiting through 
              the server are legitimate and not products of a "zombie" system. 
              Administrators can either choose to discard all messages marked 
              as spam or quarantine and log messages to locate internal offenders 
              and dispose of the problem from the source. Guardian Digital says 
              this latest enhancement will provide a permanent fix to these types 
              of attacks and will keep their customers protected from the latest 
              email threats. For more information, please visit: http://www.guardiandigital.com.
            <p> <b>CXL Releases AZScan</B>
            <P> CXL announced AZScan, a PC-based application providing cross-platform 
              security reviews for Unix, OS/400, and OpenVMS systems. According 
              to the company, CXL developed AZScan to review these systems quickly 
              and without disruption to the live systems. Because CXL's AZScan 
              runs on an independent, standalone PC, it cannot interfere with 
              the mid-range systems. There is no software to load onto the system; 
              copy two or three key files onto the Windows PC and AZScan produces 
              the detailed security reports in text, Word, or HTML format. For

              to a safe operating temperature even in environments as low as -40C, 
              while also cooling in warmer environments via dual 44 CFM 12VDC 
              fans that pressurize from front to rear.
            <P> The 794 Series Platform's processing power comes from Intel's 
              SE7501WV2ATA ATX motherboard, running Linux kernel 2.4.7 or later.

              operating system upon request.
            <P> The 794 Series includes custom I/O rear panels, a front circuit 
              breaker, an AC indicator, a time meter, and a power supply fuse. 
              A 350-watt power supply is standard. The 794 Series Platform provides 
              users the ability to mount an industry standard HDD, floppy drive, 
              and CD-ROM accessible through a hinged front panel. For more information,
