              scalable solution capable of discovering more than 50,000 devices 
              per server and supporting up to 500,000 devices per server group. 
              Enterprise Discovery 2.0 provides software inventory scanners for 
              AIX, HP/UX, Solaris, Linux, Windows, and legacy platforms. Discovered 
              files are reconciled against a library of more than 12,000 known

            <P> Carlo Gavazzi Computing Solutions released ControlTower Console 
              Management System, Version 3.L for Linux platforms. According to 
              the company, ControlTower 3.L is solution for monitoring and controlling 
              multiple devices through an RJ-45 or DB-25 interface from a central 
              location or by remote access. It enables a single Linux-based system 
              to function as a common console (monitor and keyboard) for managed 
              devices. ControlTower 3.L is integrated into the distributions of 
              Mandriva, Red Hat, and SUSE.
            <P> The company says ControlTower 3.L offers security options, error 
              handling, and logging features for greater customization and flexibility. 
              ControlTower 3.L uses Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to 
              authenticate users. ControlTower 3.L allows systems administrators 
              to configure security at the level of the individual user. To ensure 
              that sensitive data is not accessible over the network, ControlTower 
              3.L allows remote users to exchange data with the server using 128-bit 
              Twofish encryption. System access also can be restricted by IP address, 
              password, or Unix account. Systems administrators can create and 
              maintain managed device configuration files in a group.
            <P> Pricing for the ControlTower 3.L software starts at $800. For 
              more information, visit: http://www.gavazzi-computing.com.

            <P> <B>Cyclades Unveils AlterPath OnBoard</B>
            <P> Cyclades Corporation announced the AlterPath OnBoard, a service 
              processor manager for out-of-band management of servers. According 
              to the company, the AlterPath OnBoard with Secure Rack Management 
              consolidates and securely manages service processor technologies 
              available in today's next-generation servers. The AlterPath OnBoard 
              delivers SRM by isolating and protecting the connected servers from 
              the production network to provide secure, efficient rack-level management 
              with seamless integration into the Out-of-Band Infrastructure (OOBI).
            <P> According to the company, the AlterPath OnBoard combines hardware 
              and software into an appliance designed to act as a protocol gateway 
              and enable the secure integration of servers so they can be operated 
              in a consistent manner, regardless of protocol type. The AlterPath 
              OnBoard physically consolidates and logically secures the Ethernet 
              connections needed for access to service processors embedded in 
              servers and blade servers offered by all major system vendors, including 
              Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Sun Microsystems. With the AlterPath 
              OnBoard, systems administrators can locally or remotely perform 
              operations such as power cycle, remote console access, hardware 
              monitoring and management, and event management across servers using 
              one simplified user interface.
            <P> The AlterPath OnBoard will be available in December 2005 with 
              pricing starting at approximately $3,000. For more information,
