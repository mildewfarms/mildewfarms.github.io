            <P> The IETF is nearing completion of a new protocol aimed at minimizing 
              problems resulting from misconfigured network devices, thereby easing 
              part of the systems administration load. This XML-based protocol, 
              NetConf, is intended to reduce the programming effort required to 
              automate device configuration.
            <P> According to the NetConf Working Group Web site, "configuration 
              of networks of devices has become a critical requirement for operators 
              in today's highly interoperable networks. Operators from large to 
              small have developed their own mechanisms or used vendor-specific 
              mechanisms to transfer configuration data to and from a device, 
              and for examining device state information which may impact the 
              configuration. Each of these mechanisms may be different in various 
              aspects, such as session establishment, user authentication, configuration 
              data exchange, and error responses."
            <P> The Netconf Working Group aims to produce a protocol suitable 
              for network configuration that includes the following characteristics 
              (taken from the Web site):
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Provides retrieval mechanisms that can differentiate between 
                configuration data and non-configuration data. 
              <li> Is extensible enough that vendors will provide access to all 
                configuration data on the device using a single protocol. 
              <li> Has a programmatic interface (avoids screen scraping and formatting-related 
                changes between releases). 
              <li> Uses a textual data representation that can be easily manipulated 
                using non-specialized text manipulation tools. 
              <li> Supports integration with existing user authentication methods. 
              <li> Supports integration with existing configuration database systems. 
              <li> Supports network wide configuration transactions (with features 
                such as locking and rollback capability). 
              <li> Is as transport-independent as possible. 
              <li> Provides support for asynchronous notifications.
            </ul>

            Also this month, <I>Sys Admin</I> magazine and the SANS Institute 
            are working together to gather the data for the annual salary survey 
            from SANS, and we need your help to be sure the survey represents 
            as much of the community as possible. We would appreciate it if you 
            would take a few minutes to complete the 2005 Information Security 
            Career Advancement Survey form online at:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://www.sans.org/2006CareerSurvey
</pre>
            After all the data has been collected and tallied, we will publish 
            the results of the salary survey in an upcoming issue of <I>Sys Admin</I>.
            <P> As always, if you an idea for an article, please send a proposal 
              to Rikki Endsley at: <B>rendsley@cmp.com</B>. And, if you have any 
              comments or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me at:
