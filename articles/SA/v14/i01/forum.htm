            <p> The first issue of the new year is typically the one we dedicate 
              to open source topics. This issue is no exception, and it features 
              articles describing open source tools that, among other things, 
              scan your network for viruses, perform disk-to-disk backups, enforce 
              IP access policy, and distribute DNS data to multiple servers. Also 
              in this issue, Bryan Smith begins a two-part article examining the 
              terms open and proprietary, which are generally used to categorize 
              software. He proposes new, more distinct labels and assesses the 
              associated deployment risks of the various types of software.
            <P> If you're interested in following other open source vs. proprietary 
              battles, the Groklaw site at: <B>http://www.groklaw.net</B> provides 
              daily updates and commentary along with historical perspective on 
              the machinations surrounding the SCO controversy and related issues. 
              It's worth a moment to check out the current state of affairs there.
            <P> <I>Sys Admin</I> magazine recently adopted a new online look. 
              I invite you to visit the <I>Sys Admin</I> Web site at: <B>http://www.sysadminmag.com</B> 
              and see what you think. We're still fixing a few trouble spots, 
              so be sure to send feedback if you see broken links or other problems. 
              We're in the process of converting UnixReview.com to this new format 
              as well, so look for it to be updated in the near future.
            <P> Also, just in time for holiday shopping, Version 10 of the <I>Sys 
              Admin</I> back issue CD-ROM is now available. It includes complete 
              articles and code from the magazine's premiere issue in 1992 through 
              December of 2004. It also includes <I>The Perl Journal</I> archives 
              from 1996 through 2002 and offers both HTML and ASCII versions of 
              the content. As in the past, a few articles do not appear on the 
              CD either because we couldn't track down the authors to request 
              permission or because they chose not to have their content included. 
              The back issue CD can be ordered online through the <I>Sys Admin</I> 
              Web site for $49.95 ($24.95 for registered owners of the previous 
              version). See page 58 for more information.
            <P> If you'd like to see an article of yours included in a future 
              <I>Sys Admin</I> CD, you can begin by sending a manuscript proposal 
              to our managing editor, Rikki Endsley, at: <B>rendsley@cmp.com</B>. 
              Currently, we're looking for articles on spam management, clustering, 
              remote access, and database management, but other topics will be 
              considered. Please send questions or comments to Rikki or to me 
              at: <B>aankerholz@cmp.com</B>.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
            <P> <I>Amber Ankerholz</i><br>
