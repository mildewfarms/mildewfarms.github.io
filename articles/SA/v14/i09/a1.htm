              Virtual Tape Libraries</h1>
            <P> Bryan J. Smith
            <P> For a company that will never have a data loss event, backup is 
              optional. For companies that will experience a data loss event, 
              recovery is not optional. So, invariably, backup of any and all 
              data that may need to be recovered is not optional. Backup strategies 
              are still widely debated, with many beginning to claim tape is a 
              legacy solution that can and should be completely replaced by disk. 
              Keeping recovery clearly in mind, while disk may solve many backup-time 
              issues, disk still has serious environmental, longevity, and portability 
              issues.
            <P> The focal point for the debate does not begin with media/medium. 
              Given advancements in both operating system and networking technologies 
              over the past decade, all recovery strategies now basically fall 
              into three main categories:
            <P> 
            <ul>
              <li> Online -- Transparent solutions such as redundant array 
                of independent disk (RAID) storage and system clustering/failover, 
                as well as the availability of filesystem snapshots. 
              <li> Off-line -- System storage or removable media for both 
                short-term and long-term recovery needs. Traditionally, this is 
                removable tape cartridge and, increasingly, both fixed and removable 
                disk. 
              <li> Remote -- An online variant, mirror data to systems on 
                a remote network (typically over the Internet).</ul>
                <P> 
                <P> Online recovery is still at the mercy of filesystem corruption, 
                  let alone physical disaster, which negates RAID, clustering, 
                  and snapshots. Remote backup solves the physical disaster issue, 
                  but bandwidth is proportional with cost, which results in most 
                  remote backups being only a subset required for nominal operation. 
                  So, while both newer online and remote recovery solutions are 
                  a welcome supplement to the traditional, off-line recovery procedures, 
                  they can only augment off-line recovery, not replace it. This 
                  leaves most systems administrators still requiring a traditional 
                  backup, typically an off-line media.
                <P> <b>Real-Time Tape Backup</b>
                <P> Tape cartridge is still the preferred media for traditional 
                  backup and for taking data off line. The overwhelming majority 
                  of corporate data is still hosted in tape cartridges -- 
                  85% according to a 2004 study by the Enterprise Storage Group. 
                  Tape cartridges are portable and fairly long-lasting, at least 
                  when compared to magnetic disk (and even most magneto-optical 
                  standards), especially fixed disk. These attributes are why 
                  tape continues to be the preferred media for off-line storage 
                  and recovery, typically in a sole and unified backup strategy.
                <P> Legacy experience has resulted in both tape backup products 
                  and procedures being built around complete, real-time backup. 
                  This is becoming more and more unmanageable due to four compounding 
                  issues, as illustrated in Figure 1.
                <P> 
           <ul><li> Capacity -- Individual disk and total disk capacity deployed 
                now far exceeds even the leading edge of tape or typical tape 
                resources to back it all up. Initial cost of tape is at least 
                one order of magnitude greater than disk. 
              <li> Distribution -- Companies are deploying more application-specific 
                servers, and the initial cost of tape devices prevents each one 
                having their own tape device. Centralized backup results in the 
                common N:1 system to tape device ratio, with N steadily increasing. 
              <li> Window -- More data to back up from more servers, backup 
                times have been extended, while the common 12/60-hour, daily/weekly 
                window has not. Even if the system interconnects on backup servers 
                and can handle the throughput to feed a tape device, the increased 
                load on the network is typically detrimental. 
              <li> Saturation -- The network is becoming saturated with just 
                distributed backups. A network stream that cannot keep up with 
                the tape drive not only uses the tape drive inefficiently, but 
                it also introduces tape head and cartridge wear with excessive 
                stop-rewind-write operations.</ul>
                <P> 
                <P> This traditional, "in real-time" approach to centralized 
                  tape backup is clearly not a viable backup strategy. While some 
                  problems can be mitigated by only backing up a subset of the 
                  data, this only re-introduces administrative and user headaches, 
                  all while still not backing up all data. Is tape the culprit? 
                  Or is it how tape is typically deployed? I'll come back 
                  to those questions in a minute.
                <P> Note that in this article, I will not discuss concepts such 
                  as of out-of-band or storage area networks (SAN), which some 
                  readers will point out can be used to address backup window 
                  and other constraints. Such discussions of network topology 
                  and options are beyond the focus of this article, and that topic 
                  has been covered in many other networking and storage articles. 
                  The primary goal of this article is to introduce sys admins 
                  (the primary audience, not network or storage administrators) 
                  to the idea of not directly backing up to tape from end-servers 
                  in real-time, as the rest of this article will dissect and expand 
                  upon.
                <P> <b>Commodity Disk Issues</b>
                <P> Online disk recovery is already an established staple and 
                  augments off-line media usage. The price of commodity, fixed 
                  disk drives -- hereafter referred to simply as "commodity 
                  disk" -- is driving its adoption for online and even 
                  off-line recovery media. Beyond just solving the initial tape 
                  device cost for smaller firms, the capacity, performance, and 
                  recovery speeds of commodity disk are also driving adoption 
                  among larger firms (see Table 1).
                <P> Unfortunately, commodity disk has some major issues for both 
                  online and off-line recovery. Looking past the immediate backup 
                  advantages, from a recovery standpoint, there are serious deficiencies 
                  with both the long-term online usage as well as off-line storage 
                  of a commodity disk.
                <P> 
              <ul><li> Online commodity disks are designed for desktop systems with 
                8-to-5 operation, rated for only 50,000 restarts at 8 hours per 
                operation (400,000 hours MTBF). This is due to many factors: leading-edge 
                density, materials, and the precision of their mechanics (resulting 
                in increased vibration). See the sidebar for a further discussion. 
              <li> Off-line commodity disks are not designed to be transported 
                or shut down for extended periods of time after initial operation, 
                as mechanics will fail after minimal shock or periods of inactivity 
                (e.g., a "knock" directly above the spindle is often 
                required to start either a long inactive or previously unused, 
                but aged, commodity disk).</ul>
                <P> 
                <P> Although a few, removable rigid disk (RRD) devices have entered 
                  the market and address some of the environmental issues, they 
                  lose much of their performance advantage and reintroduce capacity 
                  and cost issues. As such, RRD media is finding little use for 
                  anything other than end-user, point backups (like most consumer 
                  optical formats) where the initial cost of enterprise tape is 
                  cost prohibitive.
                <P> <b>Near-Line Meets Tape</b>
                <P> Despite the environmental issues in using commodity disk for 
                  online, 24x7 storage, it has been adopted in many network attached 
                  storage (NAS) and even a few storage area network (SAN) products. 
                  Typically, these have been limited deployments where cost is 
                  an issue and size is limited. Greater capacities and densities 
                  only worsen the environment for commodity disk, while increasing 
                  their number and the static cost realities that come with their 
                  increased failure over enterprise disk.
                <P> A newly reintroduced term in the storage world is near-line 
                  storage, with commodity disk (reborn as a "near-line" 
                  enterprise disk -- see sidebar) replacing the older definition 
                  typically referring to tape or other online media libraries. 
                  Today's near-line storage concept defines data available 
                  in tens of seconds to minutes from request, instead of the assumed 
                  millisecond from request made of online storage. By its very 
                  nature, near-line storage is an ideal application for commodity 
                  disk where only a number of devices are in use, thus reducing 
                  vibration, heat, and operational period.
                <P> A major application for near-line storage has always been 
                  backup/recovery, and today's commodity disk enhances the 
                  solution. A common, non-transparent, online recovery solution 
                  is filesystem snapshots, which allow administrators and even 
                  users to easily recover accidentally deleted files. A near-line 
                  recovery solution offers almost the same level of convenience 
                  (given a similar interface) with little added delay. A near-line 
                  solution also stores multiple, independent (or incremental) 
                  backups like near-instantaneous tape, but without relying on 
                  the consistency of the local filesystem.
                <P> It was not long before someone added tape devices directly 
                  to these near-line storage solutions and realized they could 
                  solve many problems associated with always relying on tape media 
                  for all backups. The near-line storage component becomes an 
                  ideal buffer for tape backup, something only today's most 
                  advanced backup servers already offer, by removing both the 
                  real-time and full capacity needs of most off-line recovery 
                  solutions with three, increasingly significant, advantages:
                <P> 
              <ul><li> Window -- The actual system backup window does not have 
                to match the commit to tape device device window. This also removes 
                the requirement of an available tape device during the window. 
              <li> Performance -- A near-line storage device with tape backup 
                always receives data from systems and writes data to tape as fast 
                as the interfaces allow. The bottleneck of one does not affect 
                the other. 
              <li> Non-Saturating -- This is the ultimate advantage, which 
                heavily augments the other two. Every backup after the initial 
                only needs to be an incremental backup of the filesystem, even 
                when committing an actual, full backup to tape.</ul>
                <P> 
                <P> Compared and contrasted are Figure 2, an advanced, buffering 
                  backup server with tape devices, and Figure 3, the evolution 
                  of near-line storage with both virtual tape volumes and physical 
                  tape devices. Depending on the intelligence and buffering capability 
                  of the backup server, it may be able to reduce the amount of 
                  data actually transferred, increase the number of backup connections 
                  over the number of actual, physical tape devices, and can commit 
                  actual data to tape locally and a full 168 hours/week without 
                  affecting the network or its systems. But the near-line storage 
                  can offer several, additional backup and, more importantly, 
                  restore capabilities.
                <P> An administrator must consider the actual limit of how much 
                  data can be committed to physical tape in a full 168-hour week. 
                  In a traditional backup server, even if it has advanced buffering 
                  and other capabilities, it is still solely focused on committing 
                  any and all backups to tape. The near-line device offers up 
                  to six additional and compounding advantages over even the most 
                  advanced backup servers, depending on implementation:
                <P> 
              <ul><li> Certainty -- No backup is ever missed; some backups just 
                never get committed to tape. 
              <li> Discretionary -- Tape committal is defined by necessity 
                of data in off-line form, instead of being rushed by time-limited 
                necessity to commit all backup to tape. 
              <li> Priority -- Tape committal can also be prioritized by off-line 
                data needs, off-line period frequency, or other off-line data 
                requirements. 
              <li> Hindsight -- There is always the option to off-line any 
                previous backup as long as the near-line solution still stores 
                it. 
              <li> Recovery -- Any near-line store is still available for 
                near-line recovery. 
              <li> Verification -- Can be used to verify off-line tapes at 
                any time, without any restore.</ul>
                <P> 
                <P> The small combination of taking the best features of near-line 
                  storage using disk and pairing them with the continued necessity 
                  of off-line recovery with tape results in huge gains over not 
                  only forced, real-time tape backup, but even advanced, buffering 
                  tape backup servers.
                <P> <b>FalconStor IPStor</b>
                <P> The Virtual Tape Library (VTL) was invented the second a Unix 
                  programmer hacked /dev/rmt to write to a remote disk buffer, 
                  or even earlier when an administrator piped a tarball through 
                  a remote shell that managed multiple files for multiple volumes. 
                  The "turn key" VTL solution invented over the past 
                  few years has married a more formalized version of this software 
                  approach to a near-line storage device with optional, physical 
                  tape devices (possibly tape libraries) attached. Implementations 
                  vary, with limited support for both virtual devices (as viewed 
                  from the client side) and physical devices (on the near-line 
                  storage side, or possibly sister backup servers), but most are 
                  based on Linux with entry-level solutions starting at just over 
                  $5,000.
                <P> For an evaluation of eight solutions ranging from $7,000 to 
                  more than $70,000, see the article "Storage Pipeline: Virtual 
                  Tape Libraries" by Mark Howard published in CMP Media's 
                  <I>Network Computing</I> magazine last fall. At the entry level, 
                  there will be limited virtual and physical device emulation 
                  (maybe only a few devices, 1-2 libraries), limited or generic 
                  expansion (single 1-5U rack appliance), and limited client support 
                  (i.e., little more than popular Windows client, maybe a generic 
                  Unix/Linux interface and/or NDMP) as standard. The most flexible 
                  VTL solutions in both virtual/physical tape devices and client 
                  support by a wide margin (i.e., the most universal Unix/Linux 
                  flavor compatible) are based on the VirtualTape Library solution 
                  in the FalconStor IPStor suite of products.
                <P> The primary host platform for FalconStor VTL is Red Hat Linux 
                  7.3. FalconStor continues to provide OS updates for the end-of-life 
                  Red Hat Linux 7.3 product as a standard part of the VirtualTape 
                  Library product updates. The Linux command-line interface (CLI) 
                  aspects of the system are well hidden by the IPStor suite's 
                  graphical configuration and maintenance tools. It can be implemented 
                  as an IP node or iSCSI (storage over IP) or Fibre Channel (FC) 
                  SAN target appliance (internal as well as external storage via 
                  iSCSI and FC are supported for actual disk storage). A redundant, 
                  dual-VTL host configuration is supported as standard in all 
                  editions.
                <P> Depending on the edition, dozens of backup sessions can be 
                  supported with hundreds of virtualized devices simultaneously. 
                  Backup sessions may be instantiated by remote backup hosts, 
                  or the VTL may host the backup software directly (an option 
                  for system designers since the system is Linux). Although the 
                  purpose of any VTL is to emulate legacy, remote tape devices 
                  for virtually any software, FalconStor's solution is certified 
                  to support backup servers from BakBone, Computer Associates, 
                  Legato, Tivoli, Veritas, and many others (this will vary by 
                  end-user product implementation), along with NDMP and IBM iSeries 
                  protocols. The device/library support is extensive (EMC's 
                  CLARiiON implementation is in the hundreds), and direct, back-end 
                  export/import (between virtual and physical tapes) is supported 
                  to/from IBM 3494 and StorageTek ACSLS systems.
                <P> End-user product implementations of the FalconStor VTL include 
                  Copan Systems' Revolution 200T, EMC's CLARiiON solutions, 
                  MaXXan Systems' VT100 as well as custom solutions from 
                  Network Engines. Although the list price for FalconStor's 
                  VTL software is listed at $15,000-30,000, most end-user product 
                  implementations, as an integrated hardware and software solution, 
                  start at just over $20,000 -- scaling $2-3 per GB.
                <P> <b>Massive Array of Idle Disks (MAID)</b>
                <P> The commodity density, interconnect, and power design that 
                  is used today for online storage is also how the overwhelming 
                  majority of near-line storage solutions, including VTL, are 
                  implemented. Eight or more, hot-swappable, 3.5" disks are 
                  housed in a traditional 3U rackmount, connected via SCSI, SATA, 
                  or Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), possibly with an intelligent 
                  backplane that appears as a SCSI target or possibly SAN target 
                  via Fibre Channel or iSCSI. As such, most VTL implementations 
                  from the majority of vendors are either server appliances that 
                  take arbitrary, external SCSI, iSCSI or FC storage (e.g., MaXXan 
                  Systems), or are merely an implementation of existing cabinet 
                  system-storage solution (e.g., EMC CLARiiON) already offered 
                  as online storage solutions.
                <P> If "blades" are the most efficient density, interconnect, 
                  thermal, and power solution for rackmount, load-balancing server 
                  management, then the Massive Array of Idle Disks (MAID) as implemented 
                  by Copan Systems in their Revolution 200T product may very well 
                  be the model to follow for rackmount, near-line storage management. 
                  MAID was born out of research done at the University of Colorado, 
                  Boulder, based on an analysis of cost, density, and power consumption 
                  options in storing of massive amounts of data (100+TB) for Unix 
                  supercomputing applications. Ironically, although the whitepaper 
                  (presented at USENIX January 2002) exposed some concepts for 
                  solving the problems of near-line storage for supercomputing 
                  clusters, the concept was clearly applicable to the growing 
                  market for near-line solutions, such as VTL systems. Dr. Aolke 
                  Guha, former VP and Chief Architect at StorageTek, founded Copan 
                  Systems the same year.
                <P> Copan Systems introduced a physical form-factor and thermal/power 
                  distribution approach for near-line, application-specific storage 
                  in a very high density. No more than 25% of storage is powered 
                  at any time and is physically interleaved among canisters and 
                  shelves for optimal thermal distribution. Instead of using single 
                  or even multi-drive hot-swap bays, 8 hot-swap canisters of 14 
                  drives are loaded in a single, 4U, 19" rackmount shelf.
                <P> The 3.5"x1" drives sit vertically, 2x7, connecting 
                  to the SATA backplane on bottom of the canister. The resulting 
                  density is 896 drives for every 32U, the typical aggregate unit 
                  size, leaving 8-10U for dual-redundant host systems in a typical 
                  40-42U cabinet. Compare this to traditional storage density 
                  in 33U (using 11x3U storage shelves of 8 drives across), where 
                  only 88 drives can be accommodated -- 176 drives if mounted 
                  front and back of an adequately deep cabinet. Even an ultra-dense 
                  setup of 15 drives across shelves will only give a maximum of 
                  165 drives or 330 mounted front and back.
                <P> By applying MAID principles in a managed, application-specific 
                  form-factor, not only are the power usage (5.8 KW/h) and thermal 
                  characteristics (20,000 BTU/h) nominal for a storage cabinet 
                  of the same size with only 1/3 to 1/5 the drive density, but 
                  power and thermal properties are distributed so commodity disks 
                  will never exceed their environmental specifications (8x5, &lt;40C, 
                  vibration, etc.).
                <P> On the software end, Copan Systems' MAID approach typically 
                  limits each fixed disk to 5,000 power-ons in its warrantied, 
                  5-year lifespan (1/10 the typical rating of commodity disks). 
                  It also manages mounts and even ensures that unused devices 
                  are periodically powered on and exercised to prevent extended 
                  off-line periods and to verify data integrity -- another 
                  key issue when deploying commodity disks designed for desktops 
                  used regularly. The only drawback to the solution as a whole 
                  seems to be the weight. A Copan Systems Revolution 200T weighs 
                  approximately 1350 kg (3,000 lb) for the full, 896-drive, 224-448 
                  TB (using 250-500 GB drives) configuration. The entry point 
                  for a single blade solution involves an investment of several 
                  servers. The same is true of MAID near-line storage as the Copan 
                  Systems' Revolution 200T starts at 56TB (2x112 drive shelves, 
                  plus the 2 redundant hosts).
                <P> <b>Conclusion</b>
                <P> Most systems-oriented trade magazines have been debating traditional 
                  tape media versus online or even off-line disk storage for backup 
                  and recovery. Given the online environmental and off-line longevity 
                  issues of commodity disk storage or costs involved with remote 
                  site backup, the reality is that portable tape cartridge media 
                  still remains the only cost-effective way to ensure long-term 
                  data retention and disaster recovery. The problem with tape 
                  backup is not the media but its common, legacy implementation 
                  -- real-time directly from end-systems to end-tape devices, 
                  which puts the entire backup operation at the mercy of the increasing 
                  issues of capacity limitations and distribution load in the 
                  same 12/60-hour backup window from years earlier.
                <P> Tape is an off-line recovery solution. End-systems should 
                  never back up directly to tape, which will always be a capacity 
                  and scheduling nightmare. End-systems should always back up 
                  to near-line storage systems, which then have attached tape 
                  devices/libraries. Those near-line systems then commit backups 
                  to tape in non-real-time as the rotation and retention policies 
                  dictate for off-line storage.
                <P> Immediate recovery is offered by the near-line storage, while 
                  off-line, disaster recovery is still offered by tape. Pairing 
                  near-line and off-line medias against near-line and off-line 
                  recovery requirements is why virtual tape library (VTL) solutions 
                  are always the most effective solutions over traditional, real-time 
                  centralized backup, even those that offer some advanced capabilities 
                  like buffering and local storage at the centralized server.
                <P> Apply this dissection of VTL solutions to your next backup 
                  or disaster recovery need or to a problem in your existing implementation. 
                  VTL products are the most transparent solutions that provide 
                  the best of both near-line disk recovery and off-line tape recovery 
                  in one. But, regardless of solution, any complete and well-designed 
                  backup strategy always ensures both complete and timely backups 
                  online with the guaranteed availability of a portable and long-lasting 
                  off-line recovery option.
