            <h2><B>Near-Line Enterprise Disk</B></h2>
            <P> Fixed disk has gone through many evolutions. Its reliability, 
              especially in more commodity disk, is always debated. Some users 
              have had excellent experiences with both online and off-line commodity 
              disk reliability, while others have repeatedly run into failure 
              with commodity disks in a 24x7 operating environment or when the 
              drives are left on the shelf too long. Even interface is not a guarantee 
              of reliability, as some lower cost (and higher density) SCSI drives 
              roll off the same mechanical fabrication lines as ATA or SATA.
            <P> The good news is that commodity disks are becoming more reliable. 
              Some vendors have introduced new commodity drive models rated for 
              60-degree Celsius operation, a full 20 degrees higher than recent 
              generations. They can also stay unused on the shelf longer, and 
              improved fabrication techniques have brought vibration down some 
              (thus increasing drive life). Several vendors have returned to the 
              practice of offering 3- or even 5-year warranties on their commodity 
              disks sold in the retail channel, further asserting that reliability 
              has improved on new commodity disk lines.
            <P> Unfortunately, the bad news is that even these newer commodity 
              disks are still rated by vendors for only 50,000 restarts and are 
              not designed for 24x7 operation. Their reduced precision in fabrication 
              versus enterprise disk (for clear reasons of fabrication cost), 
              still results in increased vibration. As such, the mean time between 
              failures (MTBF) remains 400,000 hours -- 50,000 starts for 8 
              hours of operation (see Table 2). Manufacturers will not sell commodity 
              disk products to partner vendors for products designed for use outside 
              of these operational limitations. Integrators are also hesitant 
              to look at initial cost savings when it means they will be visiting 
              clients to replace drives more often than with enterprise disks.
            <P> The cost of commodity disk in an enterprise environment has never 
              been due to the lack of warranty coverage. The aggregate failure 
              rate of 1,000 commodity disks is more than 12 per year -- before 
              even considering the increased rate of failure due to a hot, 24x7 
              environment with increased vibration. The real number is likely 
              much higher, as any desktop support department will attest to in 
              the number of disk replacements required annually. What enterprise 
              environments have been waiting for is a near-commodity priced, leading-edge 
              density fixed disk for a 24x7 network-connected, but managed, environment 
              where the disk is often idle, not operating.
            <P> This new "middle ground" between commodity disk and 
              enterprise-rated disk in the network-attached era of IT is the "near-line" 
              enterprise storage. Near-line disk is designed with a MTBF of 1,000,000 
              hours when operated in a near-line device. The idea is that the 
              device is network attached and operating 24x7, while the disk may 
              not necessarily be. In fact, this solves the other issue with commodity 
              disk -- recoverability in long-term, off-line storage. Such 
              a network device would "exercise" a disk that has been 
              idle or powered-down for an extended period, while the near-line 
              disks themselves are never unplugged (not taken completely off-line) 
              from the system itself.
            <P> Although different near-line disk products will vary in their 
              design/selection, most near-line products roll off the same mechanical 
              fabrication lines as commodity disk units -- possibly those 
              that test to better tolerances, vibration, etc. Thus explaining 
              why they are typically offered in the same capacity as commodity 
              disk (for only a slight premium). Although end-users may debate 
              whether the "near-line" enterprise product is of interest, 
              vendor partners and system integrators find it to their advantage 
              to pay the small premium for the "near-line" enterprise 
              products from a support and replacement aspect.</table></table>&nbsp;
