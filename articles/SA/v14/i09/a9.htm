            <P> Amy Rich
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running Solaris 10 on 
              a V120, and it's acting as one of our DNS servers. Unfortunately, 
              every time the machine reboots, the DNS server is disabled. To check 
              diagnostic output, I ran:
            <P> 
            <pre>
svcs -x dns/server
</pre>
            which showed the following output:
            <p> 
            <pre>
   svc:/network/dns/server:default (?)
 State: disabled since Tue Jun 19 13:37:44 2005
Reason: Disabled by an administrator.
   See: http://sun.com/msg/SMF-8000-05
   See: named(1M)
Impact: This service is not running.
</pre>
            To fix it, I do:
            <P> 
            <pre>
svcadm enable dns/server
</pre>
            which brings up the service just fine, and everything works until 
            the machine is rebooted again. How do I permanently tell the service 
            manager to start BIND at boot?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> This is actually a known bug 
              with Solaris 10 and is described in docid 6226796, available to 
              support customers at:

            There's a patch that's been rolled into Solaris Express 
            and should be making its way to the userbase as a Solaris 10 patch 
            as well.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've decided to take the 
              plunge and start testing the fink unstable tree for OS X 10.3.9. 
              Our users want newer versions of software than are available in 
              the stable tree. I added <B>unstable/main</B> and <B>unstable/crypto</B> 
              to the Trees: line of <B>/sw/etc/fink.conf</B> and then used Fink 
              Commander 0.5.3 to do a <B>selfupdate</B>. Everything looked great, 
              and I updated a bunch of packages to the unstable versions. A week 
              later, though, I clicked <B>Update</B> in Fink Commander and received 
              the following output:

            I looked for the files that it complained about, and they weren't 
            there. I would have figured that the download would have picked them 
            up, but that appears to have failed as well. Where can I pick up these 
            files so that I can get updates without having to do a <B>selfupdate</B> 
            every time?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You missed a step when making 
              your modifications. After you add the necessary lines to <B>/sw/etc/fink.conf</B> 
              and run <B>selfupdate</B>, you must also run <B>scanpackages</B> 
              to build the files that you're missing. If you want to do this 
              from Fink Commander, it's under the <B>Source</B> menu. You 
              can also do this from the command line by running:

            I've run <B>test net1</B> from the OBP, and everything checks 
            out okay. I've also run <B>watch-net-all</B>, and we're 
            definitely seeing packets going by. If we let the machine boot off 
            the internal disk, we can bring up both Ethernet interfaces just fine, 
            and we don't see any errors. I'm rather at a loss to determine 
            and correct the problem. If you have any suggestions, I would very 
            much appreciate them.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The V100s come with two onboard 
              Ethernet devices, <B>dmfe0</B> and <B>dmfe1</B>. If you look at 
              your error output, you'll notice that it is referencing <B>dmfe2</B>, 
              which doesn't exist. There is a problem with some revisions 
              of Solaris 8 where the <B>getminor()</B> routine returns the wrong 
              value and thereby makes other routines fail. For the Sunsolve bug 
              reports, see the following (for x86 and SPARC, respectively):
            <P> 
            <pre>

            The workaround is to try network boots from only the first interface, 
            <B>dmfe0</B>. You can also try to use the boot image from a version 
            of Solaris 8 that did not have this problem, such as 05/03.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We run Solaris 9 and Sun Cluster 
              3.1u2 on a two-node cluster. We have an in-house failover application 
              that provides service to clients on the service name at a given 
              port. Sometimes we want to block service to certain users, but we 
              aren't certain how to go about this. Is there a way to handle 
              this in the cluster itself? I also see that Solaris 10 has a package 
              for <B>ipfilter</B>; can we just build the open source version for 
              Solaris 9 and use that?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> While <B>ipfilter</B> is now 
              available as a Solaris package under 10 and the non-Sun version 
              will work for most circumstances under earlier versions of Solaris, 
              you can not use it in conjunction with a cluster. A cluster works 
              by migrating the IP and associated services from one node to another 
              during a failure. <B>ipfilter</B> works by keeping the state of 
              packets on a per-machine basis.
            <P> Unfortunately, there's no way for one machine in a cluster 
              to share filtering state information with another machine in a cluster. 
              If you want to filter connections to a service IP, place a device 
              in front of the cluster (a firewall, or maybe a router, if you only 
              want to filter machines outside your segment) and filter there. 
              The most redundant solution is to place a pair of devices that are 
              capable of sharing filtering information in front of your cluster 
              nodes.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm writing some automated 
              installation scripts for some software we need to install on various 
              OS types. Unfortunately, this software requires input from a human 
              at the keyboard. I haven't really found a way around this, 
              since I don't know of a way that will make the binary install 
              program read from my script instead of STDIN. Do you have any suggestions?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You don't really give a 
              lot of details about what the installer is looking for or what scripting 
              language you're trying to use. The answer to your problem could 
              be as simple as echoing the input to the installer script (this 
              assumes some sort of shell scripting language like bourne, bash, 
              ksh, csh, tcsh, zsh, etc.):

            Most likely, though, you'll want to use something more complex, 
            like the program <B>expect</B>, which will look for certain strings 
            and then respond with answers. Expect, available from <B>http://expect.nist.gov/</B>, 
            is written in <B>Tcl</B> and can also be linked with <B>Tk</B> to 
            create X11-based applications. You can call expect from a shell script 
            or possibly write your entire install script in expect.
            <P> There's a utility called <B>autoexpect</B> that watches your 
              interaction with a program and then creates an expect script based 
              on your input. <B>autoexpect</B> does not always create a perfect 
              script, because it must do some guesswork. The <B>autoexpect</B> 
              man page lists some of the most common problems with scripts generated 
              this way: 
            <ul>
              <li> Timing. A surprisingly large number of programs (rn, ksh, zsh, 
                telnet, etc.) and devices (e.g., modems) ignore keystrokes that 
                arrive "too quickly" after prompts. If you find your 
                new script hanging up at one spot, try adding a short sleep just 
                before the previous send. 
              <li> Echoing. Many programs echo characters. Without specific knowledge 
                of the program, it is impossible to know if you are waiting to 
                see each character echoed before typing the next. If autoexpect 
                sees characters being echoed, it assumes that it can send them 
                all as a group rather than interleaving them the way they originally 
                appeared. This makes the script more pleasant to read. However, 
                it could conceivably be incorrect if you really had to wait to 
                see each character echoed. 
              <li> Change. Autoexpect records every character from the interaction 
                in the script. This is desirable because it gives you the ability 
                to make judgments about what is important and what can be replaced 
                with a pattern match. On the other hand, if you use commands whose 
                output differs from run to run, the generated scripts are not 
                going to be correct. For example, the "date" command 
                always produces different output. So, using the date command while 
                running autoexpect is a sure way to produce a script that will 
                require editing in order for it to work.</ul>
                <P> Workarounds for each of these issues are described in the 
                  man page as well.
                <P> If you're using Perl instead of a shell-based language, 
                  there are several modules/programs you might want to investigate:

                <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a SunFire V240 that's 
                been having problems booting up correctly. I want to get to the 
                OBP to run some diagnostics, but I can't seem to be able 
                to send the machine a break signal to get it there. I've 
                tried using the LOM to power the machine off and back on, but 
                it always boots back into multi-user mode. I've also tried 
                issuing a break once the machine is fully up and running, but 
                that also fails. It looks like it's getting the break sequence 
                and not doing anything with it. I see the following message when 
                trying to send the break:
                <P> 
                <pre>
SC Alert: SC Request to send Break to host.
</pre>
                So, why isn't the break working, and is there a way to force 
                it to the OBP?
                <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Without being able to see 
                  the configuration of your machine, I'm guessing that you've 
                  set the alternate break sequence in <B>/etc/default/kbd</B>. 
                  Look for a line that says:
                <P> 
                <pre>
KEYBOARD_ABORT=alternate
</pre>
                This is a good idea for machines hooked up to a console server, 
                so that disconnecting the console cable (or the keyboard, if you're 
                not using a console) does not cause the machine to drop to the 
                OBP. This setting takes affect after the OS is loaded and takes 
                control of the machine.
                <P> To actually get to the OBP, you can do one of several things:
                <P> 
                <P> 1. Send the break sequence before the OS loads and the alternate 
                  break sequence takes affect.
                <P> 2. From the running OS, issue an init 0 to bring the machine 
                  back to the OBP.
                <P> 3. From the running OS, issue the alternate break sequence, 
                  the following commands in succession:
                <P> 
                <pre>
return
~
control-b
</pre>
                Once you get to the OBP, you'll want to set the <B>auto-boot?</B> 
                variable to false for the time being so you can do a reset and 
                not need to break out. Many diagnostics you'd want to run 
                from the OBP do not deal well with a machine that's been 
                brought to the OBP with a break. When you're done running 
                your diagnostics, set the "auto-boot?" variable back 
                to true, so your machine will automatically boot after a crash.

                  10 on an old Netra T1 200 we use for testing, and I'm trying 
                  to get the DHCP client on it functioning. Our DHCP server is 
                  an old BSD box that's not handing out hostnames, so the 
                  Netra keeps setting its hostname as <B>unknown</B>. I googled 
                  for this problem and found a suggestion that says to put the 
                  hostname in <B>/etc/nodename</B> as a fallback. I've tried 
                  this, and I have a blank <B>/etc/hostname.eri0</B> and <B>/etc/dhcp.eri0</B>. 
                  I can see the machine register itself with the DHCP daemon on 
                  the BSD box and it gets the correct IP, but it's apparently 
                  still trying to set its hostname with the information gained 
                  from the DHCP server (i.e., nothing). The steps to make this 
                  work aren't that difficult to understand, and I think I've 
                  followed them all correctly. Did I miss something fundamental?
                <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It sounds like you have the 
                  setup configured correctly, but since you didn't post your 
                  config file or your <B>nodename</B> file, I can't be absolutely 
                  sure. There was a series of posts in <B>comp.unix.solaris</B> 
                  from someone who was having a similar problem. In his case, 
                  it turned out that he was missing the newline character after 
                  the hostname in the <B>/etc/nodename</B> file. The thread discussing 
                  this can be found here:
