            <P> Rarely will you find such a diversity of topics as we offer this 
              month. In the September issue, Bryan Smith examines virtual tape 
              libraries in depth, Ryan Matteson describes some utilities for monitoring 
              the health and performance of a PF firewall, Randal Schwartz shows 
              how to match common things with Perl, Roger Feldman begins a brief 
              series providing practical DBA knowledge for sys admins, and Peter 
              Galvin looks through the now-open door of Solaris, just to name 
              a few. This issue provides all that <I>and</I> Amy Rich's ever-popular 
              Q&amp;A column.
            <P> But wait there's more!
            <P> Besides the regular issue, we're including a bonus supplement 
              focusing on console servers. Console servers (although they do not 
              slice or dice) can simplify the task of managing crucial assets 
              in a distributed environment. We have compiled a console server 
              product guide, which provides an overview of the server products 
              and vendors to help you understand this market, as well as contributed 
              articles and vendor-sponsored technical information.
            <P> Along with the console server product guide, this supplement contains 
              an article titled "The Value Proposition for using Console 
              Servers" by Zonker Harris, who maintains Zonker's Greater 
              Scroll of Console Knowledge at: <B>http://www.conserver.com/consoles/</B>. 
              In this article, Harris examines the benefits of console server 
              application deployment and details both the "hard" and 
              "soft" costs of implementation. The supplement also includes 
              "Conserver: A Flexible, Mature Console Management System" 
              by Bryan Stansell, who maintains the Conserver project (see <B>http://www.conserver.com/</B>). 
              Stansell explains the history of the project, describes what conserver 
              can do, and shows how to configure and use it. These articles provide 
              straightforward information for setting up your own console server 
              system and helpful tips for making it a beneficial part of a distributed 
              environment.
            <P> As always, <I>Sys Admin</I>'s goal is to provide an array 
              of articles solving problems you may encounter in your real, working 
              world, and I hope you find the supplement content and feature articles 
              useful in that regard. If you have suggestions for topics that you'd 
              like to see covered in future supplements or ideas for contributed 
              articles, please let me know. I look forward to hearing from you.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
