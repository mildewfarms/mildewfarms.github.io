            <P> <b>Permeo Announces Base5</b>
            <P> Permeo Technologies, Inc. announced Base5, an integrated software 
              appliance delivering "zero-touch" SSL VPN, endpoint security services, 
              and advanced information controls. According to the company, Base5 
              eliminates the administrative and integration complexity in delivering 
              access and security services to managed and unmanaged devices. The 
              result is a decrease in operational costs of more than 50%, based 
              on total cost of ownership analysis.
            <P> Permeo's Base5 extends SSL VPN and endpoint security services 
              to any user and virtually any application, without integrating multiple 
              vendor solutions. It provides a unified policy enforcement and management 
              framework that integrates SSL VPN, information control, browser 
              security, malware protection, and host integrity checks. Base5's 
              patent-pending session layer technology enables a "zero-touch" deployment 
              model in which no remote client administration is required for the 
              delivery of connectivity and endpoint security capabilities.
