            <h1><img src="../../resource/syslog.gif" width="215" height="85" align="right">syslog</h1>
            <P> I recently read an article by Michael Hawley on the Technology 
              Review Web site, titled "Whither the Renaissance Man?" (<B>http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/05/issue/megaphone.asp</B>). 
              In that article, Hawley writes "Our current age of information has 
              rightly been called a second renaissance. But what ignites a renaissance? 
              It has to do with bringing together ideas and cultures in fresh 
              ways and with unprecedented intensity. ...the printing press, the 
              new technologies that enabled its invention, and a burgeoning shipping 
              trade were the Internet of their day. Ideas began to move en masse 
              and with a momentum that was unimaginable before. ... The digital-media 
              revolution enabled our current renaissance. From Ethernet to Internet 
              to World Wide Web to Google, from silicon biology to nanoscience, 
              worlds of ideas have collided. Just as a 16th-century Renaissance 
              man felt empowered by a bundle of books in his saddlebag, a 21st-century 
              renaissance woman with a laptop feels she has the entire store of 
              human knowledge at her fingertips."
            <P> Hawley laments, however, that renaissance men and women are in 
              short supply. He says, "such an intense global mix of cultures, 
              ideas, and innovations, all apparently a mouse click away, would 
              seem to demand broad educational perspectives. Yet most schools 
              persist in turning out laser-focused young professionals."
            <P> That may be true, but some sys admins I know certainly could be 
              described as renaissance men and women. I've noted before that sys 
              admins tend to be generalists with highly diverse skills gained 
              largely through self-training and experience, and most are continually 
              seeking greater breadth and depth of knowledge and expertise in 
              order to meet the changing demands of their jobs. This information 
              is acquired from many sources, such as conference courses, books, 
              online seminars, man pages and documentation, technical Web sites, 
              and other outlets of the vast store of accumulated knowledge.
            <P> <I>Sys Admin</I>, of course, strives to contribute to this body 
              of information by providing a diverse set of articles every month. 
              This issue, for example, covers such topics as setting up a branded 
              VPN, remote logging, monitoring LDAP performance, and migrating 
              to Mozilla Thunderbird. Additionally, we've included a brief supplement 
              focusing on spam management issues. These articles cover new features 
              of SpamAssassin 3.0, tips for successful spam filtering, cleaning 
              up mailing lists, and spam graphing and logging.
            <P> In his essay, Hawley asks "will the enriched pool of online knowledge 
              promote more specialization, or will it promote more sharing among 
              fields?" He says the answer is up for grabs, and I agree it's difficult 
              to predict. In the meantime, however, we'll do our part by supplying 
              some of the practical systems administration information you seek 
              and providing a way for you to share your knowledge and experience 
              with others. If you have ideas for future articles, suggestions 
              for improvement, or other comments, please let us know.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
            <p> <I>Amber Ankerholz</i><br>
