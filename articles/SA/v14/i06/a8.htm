            <P><i> Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to compile aspell 0.60.2 
              on a Solaris 8 machine with gcc 2.95.3. The configure and build 
              processes seem to go fine until this line:
            <P> 
            <pre>
g++ -shared -nostdlib  &lt;lots of object files&gt;  -ldl    \
  -L/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/2.95.3 \
  -L/usr/ccs/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lstdc++ -lm -lgcc   \
  /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/2.95.3/crtend.o \
  /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/2.95.3/crtn.o   \
  -Wl,-h -Wl,libaspell.so.15 -o .libs/libaspell.so.15.1.2
</pre>
            When the operation tries to link here, it spits out pages and pages 
            of errors that look similar to the following:
            <P> 
            <pre>
Text relocation remains            referenced
  against symbol         offset    in file
&lt;unknown&gt;                0xac8     /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/ \
                                   2.95.3/libstdc++.a(iovfscanf.o)
&lt;unknown&gt;                0x584     /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/ \
                                   2.95.3/libstdc++.a(outfloat.o)
&lt;unknown&gt;                0x1bc4    /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.8/ \

                                   2.95.3/libstdc++.a(iostream.o)
</pre>
            Presumably I'm missing a library directory or something like that. 
            The error output doesn't even list the symbol it's missing in the 
            first few pages (although it does for later ones), so I'm not certain 
            how I should track each of them down. Any hints on where I should 
            start?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Your problem is that your libstdc++ 
              was not built as a shared library. Whenever you try to compile something 
              shared, it will fail quite verbosely. The best answer is to rebuild 
              gcc/libstdc++ with shared library support. For aspell in particular, 
              though, you can disable building shared libraries by running configure 
              with the switch:
            <P> 
            <pre>
--disable-shared
</pre>
            This will create a statically linked libaspell (libaspell.a) instead 
            of a dynamic library (libaspell.so).
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Our internal network is firewalled 
              from the rest of the world and is sitting in an RFC 1918 address 
              space. From the outside, we need to connect to the firewall host 
              and then connect to internal machines. Our firewall host is running 
              FreeBSD 4.10, and our internal machines run a mix of Unix variants. 
              On each of these machines, we've installed screen 4.00.02 so that 
              we don't lose a session if the external ssh connection fails. My 
              problem with this is that I ssh to the bastion host and run screen, 
              and then I ssh to multiple internal machines and also run screen. 
              This seems not to work because one screen session takes over the 
              previous ones. Is there a way around this, or can I not use screen 
              in this way?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The cleanest solution, and the 
              easiest one to keep track of, is to run one screen session on the 
              bastion host and then run multiple ssh connections to the other 
              internal hosts from there. Your internal network should be reliable 
              enough that your ssh sessions will not drop, and you won't have 
              to remember which screen session you're currently in.
            <P> If you really want to have a screen session on the bastion host 
              controlling screen sessions on other machines, you can work around 
              the command character issue in two ways. Screen has a built-in method 
              of allowing you to send the command character to the window instead 
              of to the window manager screen itself. From the screen man page:
            <P> 
            <pre>
C-a a       (meta)    Send the command character (C-a) to window. 
                      See escape command.
</pre>
            So you could switch between client screen sessions by sending <B>C-a 
            a</B> to the screen session on the bastion host.
            <P> The second method is to use a different command key on the bastion 
              host than on the client hosts. The previous reference to the escape 
              command can define this new key:
            <P> <B>escape xy</B>
            <P> Set the command character to x and the character generating a 
              literal command character (by triggering the "meta" command) to 
              y (similar to the -e option). Each argument is either a single character, 
              a two-character sequence of the form "^x" (meaning "C-x"), a backslash 
              followed by an octal number (specifying the ASCII code of the character), 
              or a backslash followed by a second character, such as "\^" or "\\". 
              The default is "^Aa".
            <P> So on each client, you would use the default command key sequence 
              of <B>C-a</B> and, on the bastion host, you could set the command 
              key to something like the back quote key:
            <P> 
            <pre>
escape "''"
</pre>
            To switch between clients on the bastion host, you would use <B>'n</B> 
            and <B>'p</B>, and to switch between windows on each client, you would 
            use <B>C-an</B> and <B>C-ap</B>.
            <P> If you're doing multi-user screen sessions, then you'll want to 
              use the <B>defescape</B> command:
            <P> <B>defescape xy</B>
            <P> Set the default command characters. This is equivalent to the 
              "escape" except that it is useful multi-user sessions only. In a 
              multi-user session "escape" changes the command character of the 
              calling user, where "defescape" changes the default command characters 
              for users that will be added later.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've taken the plunge and upgraded 
              sendmail on my Solaris 9 machine from 8.12.11 to 8.13.3. I kept 
              the same mc files and the same site.config.m4 from the 8.12.11 install 
              so that things would be pretty much the same. The build and the 
              install went fine, and all of the permissions look fine. When I 
              try to start sendmail, however, it complains with the following 
              error:
            <P> 
            <pre>
Mar 14 13:42:21 smtp.my.domain sendmail[417]: unable to write pid to
/var/run/sendmail.pid: file in use by another process
</pre>
            It seems that sendmail creates the PID file anyway, though, because 
            it does exist and has been recently modified:
            <P> 
            <pre>
-rw-------    1 root    smmsp      42 Mar 14 13:42:20 /var/run/sendmail.pid
</pre>
            So why is sendmail complaining when it's clearly succeeding?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Starting with sendmail 8.13.0, 
              sendmail locks the PID file so that other processes do not overwrite 
              it. If you take a look at the RELEASE_NOTES file that came with 
              your distribution, you'll see the following:
            <P> 
            <pre>
8.13.0/8.13.0   2004/06/20
  Keep daemon pid file(s) locked so other daemons don't try to 
  overwrite each other's pid files.
</pre>
            You've managed to start up more than one sendmail daemon, so the second 
            one is complaining that it can't create its lock file. If you're using 
            different configuration files for each daemon, you can set the PID 
            file name via m4 in each file with the following statement:
            <P> 
            <pre>
define('confPID_FILE','/var/run/sendmail-1.pid')
</pre>
            In the second mc file, you'll obviously need to pick a different PID 
            file name, like sendmail-2.pid.
            <P> If you're using the same sendmail.cf file for both instances, 
              then you can specify the PID file name on the command line with:
            <P> 
            <pre>
-OPidFile=/var/run/sendmail-1.pid
</pre>
            If you're running multiple daemons on different ports or in different 
            modes, you might want to create PID file names that include the port 
            number or mode (for example, sendmail-25.pid and sendmail-2525.pid 
            for ports 25 and 2525, or sendmail-d.pid and sendmail-q.pid for a 
            listening daemon and a queue runner).
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're going to be running a lot 
              of cat 5 cable in the near future, and I would like to find some 
              place that will distinctively label the cables for us so we don't 
              have to do it ourselves. Are there places that offer this kind of 
              service?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can buy pre-labeled cables

            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Since Solaris 10 has finally hit 
              FCS, I've downloaded a copy and installed it on a test machine. 
              So far I'm really impressed by what I've seen. I've been compiling 
              a bunch of software on the machine, and I've run into an issue compiling 
              OpenSSH. I know that Sun ships a version of ssh with Solaris, but 
              I want to stick with OpenSSH because I'm running it on a number 
              of platforms and I want the same version on all machines. I've configured 
              OpenSSH with the following options:
            <P> 
            <pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --localstatedir=/var \
     --with-xauth=/usr/openwin/bin/xauth  --with-tcp-wrappers \
     --with-ssl-dir=/usr/local/ssl --with-random=/dev/random  \
     --with-default-path="/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/local/bin:/ \
     sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/X/bin:/usr/openwin/bin"
</pre>
            Everything compiles and installs fine, but when I start up ssh, I 
            get the following output:
            <P> 
            <pre>
Starting the ssh daemon
PRNG is not seeded
</pre>
            I'm using Sun's random devices, so why wouldn't there be enough entropy? 
            I can compile and start using the internal random stuff for OpenSSH, 
            but that's not very secure.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> I've seen several reports of 
              this problem, and it has to do with OpenSSL, not OpenSSH. You seem 
              to be using OpenSSL because you specify the path to SSL as /usr/local/ssl 
              and not the system default libraries. The /dev/*random devices are 
              actually symlinks under Solaris. This wasn't a problem before Solaris 
              10, but Solaris 10 sets O_NOFOLLOW, which causes the OpenSSL entropy 
              seeding to fail. Until the fix makes it into a distribution of OpenSSL, 
              you can work around this by specifying the actual device name pointed 
              at by /dev/random, /devices/pseudo/random@0:random.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to set up my environment

            Every time it tries to fetch the file, it times out. If I try to ftp 
            the file manually, I can log into the site and do an <B>ls</B>, but 
            if I try to transfer any data, it times out. Is there some other setting 
            I can use to get CPAN working correctly? Something I should have chosen 
            differently in the manual configuration?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It sounds like you're using ftp 
              behind some sort of firewall that's not allowing you to pass all 
              of the packets. The way around this is to use passive mode ftp. 
              Assuming your ftp supports it, you can set this in your .cshrc or 
              .tcshrc by specifying the following environment variable:
            <P> 
            <pre>
setenv FTP_PASSIVE 1
</pre>
            You can also do this from the command line if you only want it to 
            last for that specific shell session. If you try to connect to CPAN 
            after doing this, you should be able to finish your configuration.
            <P> Another option is to use a tool such as ncftp, which will do passive 
              ftp automatically.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a Solaris 8 machine with 
              the latest Recommended patch set on it. I'm trying to set up Disk 
              Suite to mirror the boot drive. I've done this a bunch of times 
              before in various environments, but this time I'm having trouble. 
              I've set up / and swap successfully, and I'm trying to set up the 
              third slice as a data partition. These all work fine:
            <P>

metainit -f d112 1 1 c0t1d0s0
</pre>
            Then I attempt to set up one half of the data partition mirror by 
            issuing the same <B>metainit</B> command, and I receive an error:
            <P>

</pre>
            So why is it having an issue finding the disk in just this instance?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Disk Suite isn't having an issue 
              finding your disk; it can't find the metadevice. By default, Disk 
              Suite is configured to have 128 metadevices. Your naming scheme 
              requires that you have a metadevice named d131 (and presumably d132, 
              too, if your other metadevices are any indication). To go above 
              the default of 128 metadevices, you need to edit /kernel/drv/md.conf 
              and change nmd=128 to a higher number (up to 1024). After making 
              the change to the device configuration file, reboot the machine 
              with the <B>-r</B> flag to reconfigure the devices. You can also 
              configure the number of disksets in this file by tuning the md_nsets
