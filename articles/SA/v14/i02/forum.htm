            <P> <I>Sys Admin</I> magazine is again partnering with the Software 
              Development Conference to provide scripting and security tracks 
              at the SD West 2005 Conference &amp; Expo, March 14-18 in Santa 
              Clara, CA.
            <P> There are more than 164 new classes at SD West 2005 this year, 
              and the <I>Sys Admin</I> offerings include all-day tutorials on 
              "Learning Perl" and "Intermediate Perl" taught by Randal Schwartz. 
              The first session presumes no prior knowledge of Perl, and you will 
              learn the most important parts of Perl -- those items that are needed 
              to accomplish many common tasks and to lay the groundwork for more 
              advanced study. The second course is suitable for those who have 
              a good background in the basics of Perl.
            <P> &AElig;leen Frisch will be teaching two courses: "Beyond Shell 
              Scripts: 21st Century Automation Tools", which focuses on Cfengine, 
              Expect, and RRDTool, and "Essential Python for Systems Administrators", 
              which introduces Python in the context of systems administration 
              utilities, teaches Python syntax by example, and presents some advantages 
              of Python over other scripting options.
            <P> In his security-related courses, Hal Pomeranz will present "How 
              They Do It: Unix Hacking 101", which explores stack smashing, session 
              hijacking, and other tricks for breaking into Unix systems. He will 
              also examine how attackers use rootkits to maintain access to systems 
              and avoid detection. Hal will also be teaching "Simple Unix Tricks: 
              Spotting Break-ins", which describes a simple set of checks that 
              systems administrators can perform to monitor the status of their 
              Unix systems.
            <P> Also, Peter Galvin will be on hand to present "New Security Features 
              in Solaris<sup>TM</sup> X" as well as "Surveying the Current Computer 
              Security Landscape", which explores the current problems for a typical 
              enterprise and suggests some "best practices" solutions for dealing 
              with these issues.
            <P> The conference is now in its 18th year and is designed to help 
              you enhance your expertise in the languages, tools, technologies, 
              and trends you need to be successful. If you register by January 
              14th, you qualify for a Super Early Bird Discount and can save up 
              to $500. I hope to see you there.
            <P> 
            <P> Sincerely yours,
            <P> <I>Amber Ankerholz</i><br>
