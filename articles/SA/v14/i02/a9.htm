            <h1><img src="../../resource/1_questions.gif" width="245" height="130" align="right">Questions 
              and Answers</h1>
            <P><i> Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a number of Netra T1 105 
              machines that we purchased from a company that was going out of 
              business. Unfortunately the company that previously owned these 
              machines set the eeprom password and put them into command-secure 
              mode and we can't get beyond it. How can we reset the prom password 
              so that we can reinstall the OS?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Since <B>security-mode</B> is 
              only set to command, not full, and you have physical access to the 
              machine, you can access the eeprom from the running OS. If you have 
              the root password to the machine, simply boot it and use the <B>eeprom</B> 
              command to turn off <B>security-mode</B> and/or change the <B>security-password</B>. 
              If the disk was wiped clean before it was sold to you, you can try 
              booting and hope that the <B>diag-device</B> is set to network (where 
              you can put an OS image -- especially easy if you already have a 
              jumpstart server set up) or the CDROM.
            <P> If there's an existing OS image but you don't have the root password, 
              or if the machine has no useful diag device set, you can relocate 
              the boot disk to a machine with no eeprom password. Then you can 
              either zero out or reset the root password on the Netra's boot disk, 
              or you can just use the spare machine to install an entirely new 
              OS image with a root password that you know.
            <P> If all else fails, you can replace the NVRAM chip with a new one, 
              but that's generally an unnecessary last resort.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I come from a Linux background, 
              but I've just been hired as a sys admin at a site that's primarily 
              HP-based. I'm looking for information on creating snapshot volumes 
              on HP/UX 11.00 like I would under Linux. Is there something similar 
              to the following Linux command for HP:
            <P> 
            <pre>
lvcreate -s -L 256m -n snap /dev/vg00/lvol1
</pre>
            The above creates a snapshot linked to the lvol1 volume in the vg00 
            group.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you want to create snapshots 
              with HP/UX 11.00, search for the OnlineJFS documentation and the 
              documentation on using a Snapshot Filesystem for backups at <B>http://docs.hp.com</B>. 
              OnlineJFS is essentially an HP re-branded version of Veritas Volume 
              Manager. With OnlineJFS, a snapshot filesystem is created with the 
              mount command:
            <P> 
            <pre>
mount -F vxfs -o snapof=special|mount_point,snapsize=snapshot_size \
snapshot_special snapshot_mount_point
</pre>
            Once the filesystem is un-mounted, the snapshot ceases to exist. If 
            the filesystem is re-mounted, a fresh snapshot is taken.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running OS X 10.3.5 on my 
              laptop and using the Fink Commander GUI to help me install/upgrade 
              third-party freeware. I've been doing this ever since the 10.2 days 
              with no problems, but recently when I've tried to do a <B>self-update</B>, 
              I've gotten errors and it dies. Here's the output of the <B>self-update</B> 
              command from within Fink Commander:
            <P> 
            <pre>
I will now run the cvs command to retrieve the latest package 
descriptions. The 'su' command will be used to run the cvs command 
as the user 'arr'. After that, the core packages will be updated 
right away; you should then update the other packages using 
commands like 'fink update-all'.

            No matter what cvs commands I try, or whether I try them from the 
            command line or from within the GUI, nothing seems to get past that 
            point. As far as I know, nothing changed between the last time I built 
            packages and now, so I'm not sure why it's failing. Do you have any 
            hints?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Since you aren't getting any 
              specific errors from the cvs command, it's likely that there's a 
              problem with a file in the <B>/sw/fink/dists</B> tree. There are 
              three irregularities in your output, the lines:
            <P> 
            <pre>
C 10.3/stable/crypto/finkinfo/gaim-ssl.info

</pre>
            In CVS, the leading tags have special meaning. From the man page:
            <P> M file The file is modified in your working directory. M can indicate 
              one of two states for a file you're working on: either there were 
              no modifications to the same file in the repository, so that your 
              file remains as you last saw it; or there were modifications in 
              the repository as well as in your copy, but they were merged successfully, 
              without conflict, in your working directory.
            <P> C file A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes 
              to file with changes from the source repository. file (the copy 
              in your working directory) is now the result of merging the two 
              versions; an unmodified copy of your file is also in your working 
              directory, with the name .#file.version, where version is the revision 
              that your modified file started from. (Note that some systems automatically 
              purge files that begin with .# if they have not been accessed for 
              a few days. If you intend to keep a copy of your original file, 
              it is a very good idea to rename it.)
            <P> The most likely culprit is the file 10.3/stable/crypto/finkinfo/gaim-ssl.info. 
              Perhaps you've made a manual change to that file and now the maintainer 
              of the gaim-ssl package has also changed it. You should move that 
              file aside and try running the update again to see if that fixes 
              the issue:
            <P> 
            <pre>
sudo rm /sw/fink/10.2/unstable/main/finkinfo/libs/db31-3.1.17-6.info
sudo fink selfupdate-cvs
</pre>
            You might also want to check the two kde info files to see why they're 
            tagged with an M and/or move them aside as well.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're running sendmail 8.13.1 
              on Fedora Core. I've configured sendmail so that it should be limiting 
              the number of connections per second differently for specific domains 
              and IP ranges. Our base rate is set at 50, but we have some offsite 
              machines under the same corporate umbrella with which we exchange 
              a lot of email and therefore need to bump up the maximum connection 
              rate. Unfortunately, everyone seems to be getting throttled at 30. 
              Here's the access file:
            <P> 
            <pre>
ClientRate:other.corp.domain    100
...
ClientRate:192.168.100          100
...

ClientRate:                     50
</pre>
            The following should be the only pertinent line in my mc file:
            <P> 
            <pre>
FEATURE('ratecontrol')dnl
</pre> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You're using the wrong 
            syntax for the <B>ClientRate</B> statements. This snippet from the 
            sendmail 8.13 <B>cf/README</B> file explains the correct usage:
            <P> ratecontrol Enable simple ruleset to do connection rate control 
              checking. This requires entries in access_db of the form
            <P> <B>ClientRate:IP.ADD.RE.SS LIMIT</B>
            <P> Instead of specifying domain names, FQDNs, or IP blocks, you need 
              to specify specific IP addresses. It is hopefully that the sites 
              from which you need to accept heavier mail loads are using a handful 
              of relay servers so that you don't need to specify a large number 
              of IPs in the mc file.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running Solaris 8 on a SunFire 
              4800 and trying to apply some patches to the system. Every time 
              I try to run <B>patchadd</B>, regardless of patch, I get the following 
              message (with the full path to the specific <B>checkinstall</B> 
              program omitted since it happens with all of them):
            <P> 
            <pre>
checkinstall: cannot open
pkgadd: ERROR: checkinstall script did not complete successfully
Dryrun complete.
No changes were made to the system.
</pre>
            The <B>checkinstall</B> file is in fact there, so I'm not sure what 
            it's saying it can't open. Any clues what the problem might be?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> When you receive <B>checkinstall</B> 
              errors during a <B>patchadd</B>, it usually indicates that all of 
              the files in the patch cannot be read by the user <B>install</B>, 
              or <B>nobody</B>, or that neither user exists. <B>Patchadd</B> will 
              attempt to execute the <B>checkinstall</B> script as the user <B>install</B> 
              and then fall back to the user <B>nobody</B> if the <B>install</B> 
              user doesn't exist.
            <P> If you have an <B>install</B> user, make sure that all directories 
              leading up to and including all the patch files, as well as the 
              files themselves, are readable by <B>install</B>. If you're storing 
              patches in an unreadable directory, either change the permissions 
              as needed or move the patches to someplace like <B>/tmp</B> where 
              the permissions are relaxed. If you don't have an <B>install</B> 
              user, make sure the <B>nobody</B> user is in both the <B>/etc/passwd</B> 
              and <B>/etc/shadow</B> files. Also apply the same rules for directory 
              and file readability as described above for the <B>install</B> user.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Recently our company's DNS server 
              started having issues resolving addresses on the first try. The 
              first attempted resolution results in a "host not found" error. 
              If the address is tried a second time, though, it appears to work 
              fine. This server is an OS X 10.3.5 machine running BIND 9.2.2, 
              and it's serving a variety of different machines. Might you have 
              any idea what the issue is and how I could fix it?
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You don't provide any debugging 
              output from <B>named</B> or <B>dig</B>, but based on the date your 
              question was submitted, I'd hazard a guess that you are being bitten 
              by an issue that's plaguing a number of OS X administrators. The 
              two possible problem/answers seem to be that the firewall is blocking 
              large EDNS udp packets, and you need to allow for those queries 
              to be passed or add the following to the options subcategory of 
              the <B>named.conf</B> for newer versions of bind:
            <P> 
            <pre>
edns-udp-size 512;
</pre>
            The second issue is conjectured to be one with the IPv6 implementation 
            on some BSD-based operating systems. To work around this, upgrade 
            to BIND 9.3 and force only IPv4 resolution by invoking <B>named</B> 
            as:
            <P> 
            <pre>
named -4
</pre> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a new Netra 440 
            server running Solaris 9 that we're using to handle Web services for 
            our department. Things go fine for a while, but then the machine mysteriously 
            reboots with no errors logged to syslog. To track down the issue, 
            I hooked up a console server and logged the output to that as well, 
            just in case the machine was dying before it had a chance to throw 
            an error and log it to disk. The only output it logged before each 
            crash was the following:
            <P> 
            <pre>
Fatal Error Reset
SC Alert: Host System has Reset
</pre>
            You probably can't tell what the issue is from this little information, 
            but I was hoping that you might point me in the right direction when 
            it comes to exploring this problem further.
            <P> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> For starters, you might want 
              to guarantee that you have core dumps saved after you reboot. Take 
              a look at the file <B>/etc/dumpadm.conf</B> and make sure it says 
              something along the lines of:
            <P> 
            <pre>
DUMPADM_DEVICE=/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s1
DUMPADM_SAVDIR=/var/crash/you.host.name
DUMPADM_CONTENT=kernel
DUMPADM_ENABLE=yes
</pre>
            The last line shows that <B>savecore</B> is enabled. If you're using 
            Veritas Volume Manager or Solaris Volume Manager, you'll need to set 
            the dump device to one of the mirrors to make sure it doesn't get 
            overwritten when the filesystem drivers take over. For Solaris Volume 
            Manager, the <B>DUMPADM_DEVICE</B> line would look more like:
            <P> 
            <pre>
DUMPADM_DEVICE=/dev/md/dsk/d1
</pre>
            To modify the <B>dumpadm.conf</B> file, use the command <B>dumpadm</B>(1m) 
            instead of editing the file directly.
            <P> If you get a core file, you can send it to Sun Support for analysis 
              once you open up a case, or you can try to analyze it yourself.
            <P> Because you specifically mention the hardware as a Netra 440, 
              though, there's a good chance that you're seeing the issue described 
              in Document 57618:
            <P> 
            <pre>
http://sunsolve8.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-57618-1
</pre>
            If you don't have a Sunsolve account, the document basically states 
            that there are problems with the <B>ce0</B> or <B>net0</B> interfaces 
            on those machines. The error message matches what you're seeing exactly. 
            To gather more diagnostic data to determine whether this is the issue, 
            they suggest setting the following from the OBP:
            <P> 
            <pre>
diag-switch?    true
post-trigger    none
obdiag-trigger  none
</pre>
            You're experiencing this issue if the reset reason includes PBM FATAL 
            with a PCI IO-BRIDGE register output similar to:
            <P>

            To work around the issue, they suggest disabling the <B>ce0</B> (<B>net0</B>) 
            interface and from the OBP and only using the <B>ce1</B>/<B>net1</B> 
            interface:

</pre>
            If you definitely need another network interface, the document suggests 
            adding another PCI network card to the machine. A permanent fix for 
            the issue is still in the works according to the document.
