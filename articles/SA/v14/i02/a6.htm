              Back Your Mailbox with Greylisting</B></h1>
            <P> <I>Sean Reifschneider</i>
            <p> Unsolicited commercial email, a.k.a. spam, is an attack on the 
              Internet. It's as simple as that. Until we start really treating 
              it as such, the problem is only going to get worse. In the meantime, 
              we've got greylisting.
            <P> Greylisting combines many desirable attributes. It's incredibly 
              low maintenance. It has not misclassified a single legitimate message 
              in the 3 months I've been using it, and it has reduced the number 
              of spams I need to look at by 5 to 10 times. When I first heard 
              about greylisting, I dismissed it as too easy for spammers to circumvent. 
              However, in the 18 months since Evan Harris proposed the idea (July 
              2003), greylisting seems to be as effective as ever.
            <P> In this article, I'll provide details of how greylisting works, 
              offer information to help you decide whether it's right for you, 
              and suggest pointers for installation.
            <P> <B>What Is Greylisting?</B>
            <P> Greylisting works because the vast majority of spammers and email-propagated 
              worms cheat. To get their messages out quickly and easily, they 
              take shortcuts. One of the biggest shortcuts is that most message 
              deliveries are attempted only once. If a delivery attempt fails 
              for any reason, the sender ignores that delivery and tries other 
              addresses.
            <P> Greylisting relies on spammers using software that does not queue 
              messages with temporary failures to try them again at a later time. 
              Real mail servers will continue trying to deliver a message for 
              at least several hours, and usually several days if it doesn't go 
              through the first time. Implementing this functionality significantly 
              complicates the mailing software and uses resources on the sender's 
              computers, which is probably why so many spammers are neglecting 
              to do it.
            <P> In general terms, greylisting works by creating a "triple" of 
              remote IP address, envelope sender, and envelope recipient for every 
              incoming recipient. I say "recipient" instead of "message" because 
              in the case of carbon copies, a single message can have multiple 
              recipients. This triple is then looked up in a database. For the 
              first hour that a new triple is seen, it is rejected with a temporary 
              failure (400-series SMTP response), requesting that the remote Mail 
              Transfer Agent (MTA) try again later. After that, the recipient 
              is allowed for delivery.
            <P> Some of the greylisting implementations also limit the window 
              of opportunity. After the first hour, if a message is not received 
              within the next three hours, the entry is removed and the remote 
              sender must start all over again. This further ensures that the 
              remote system is queuing the message instead of sending another 
              campaign.
            <P> <B>Benefits</B>
            <P> The primary benefits of greylisting are its effectiveness and 
              low requirements for maintenance. It's the single most effective 
              technique I've found for cutting down on the spam that makes it 
              into my mailbox. I've been using SpamAssassin, ClamAV, outsourced 
              spam blocking companies, and other techniques, and the addition 
              of greylisting has reduced the amount of spam in our mailboxes by 
              5 to 10 times. Additionally, with it we've been able to entirely 
              eliminate our quarantine folders.
            <P> The low maintenance requirements are a huge benefit for the already 
              overworked sys admin. After the initial install and a few tweaks, 
              I haven't had to touch the greylisting system at all. Unlike other 
              techniques, it doesn't require rulesets to be updated, quarantine 
              folders to be reviewed, lists to be preened, decisions about which 
              RBLs (Real-time Black-hole Lists) to use, etc. It just works.
            <P> Even if spammers start queuing more of their messages, there are 
              advantages to delaying the initial message from a particular sender. 
              That delay gives other anti-spam techniques such as DCC, Spamcop, 
              and RBLs a better chance of detecting the message as spam. When 
              the spam or virus delivery is retried, it is more likely to be caught 
              by these other mechanisms.
            <P> <B>Drawbacks</B>
            <P> The biggest complaint against using greylisting is that it will 
              almost certainly cause some email to be delayed. The first message 
              from a particular sender at a particular location will, under most 
              circumstances, take at least an hour to be delivered. If a user 
              is on the telephone with the recipient and an email is sent, the 
              email won't immediately come through unless the sender is already 
              in the greylist. This has happened to me only once in the 3 months 
              we've been using greylisting. Some users may be intolerant of this 
              delay. The good news is that some greylist implementations allow 
              you to configure the greylisting on a per-user basis.
            <P> Many greylisting implementations have a "learning" mode to help 
              decrease delayed email from legitimate senders when greylisting 
              is first turned on. In learning mode, the greylist goes through 
              all the motions but never rejects messages. The database is then 
              primed with frequent senders. Run in learning mode for the first 
              few days or weeks to reduce the impact to your users.
            <P> Outgoing mail may also be delayed because of a technique called 
              "SMTP callbacks". SMTP callbacks are used by some mail servers to 
              try to combat forged sender addresses. When a mail server gets a 
              message claiming to be from a particular user, a connection is made 
              to a mail server for that domain to check that it will accept email 
              for that sender address. If this happens from one of your users, 
              the greylisting software may cause the remote server to deny the 
              message until after the greylisting period expires.
            <P> SMTP callbacks should be made obsolete by SPF (Sender Policy Framework), 
              so this will become less and less of a problem for greylisting hosts.
            <P> A bigger problem is caused by mail servers that randomly use IP 
              addresses in a pool for sending a particular message or that vary 
              the sender address with every message or every mail attempt. For 
              example, Google's Gmail will usually connect from a different IP 
              address each time it tries to re-deliver a message. Some mailing 
              lists will try to track bounces to individual messages so that every 
              message sent will have a different sender address.
            <P> A whitelist is kept of the known addresses for which this is an 
              issue, so that messages from affected providers can bypass greylisting. 
              Another recommendation is that, instead of using the literal IP 
              address of the sender as part of the triple, one could mask off 
              the address to the top 24 bits, for example, without dramatically 
              reducing the effectiveness.
            <P> The final drawback to consider is that greylisting MUST be implemented 
              on ALL outward-facing SMTP servers for a domain. This is because 
              the remote IP address is an important part of greylisting.
            <P> If you have one or more secondary MXs (Mail eXchangers), they 
              must all implement greylisting, or messages to those servers will 
              circumvent the greylist. This also prevents the use of many outsourced 
              or third-party spam-blocking services, unless they implement greylisting 
              in their system.
            <P> <B>Performance</B>
            <P> Having every incoming recipient trigger a database lookup -- and 
              probably a database insert -- seems like a fairly expensive operation. 
              However, most databases are optimized for exactly these sorts of 
              operations and can perform them quickly.
            <P> I ran some performance tests with the greylisting implementation 
              that I'm using. On a 2.66-GHz P4 system using 2 Hitachi 7200RPM 
              80GB drives in a RAID-1 array, the system was able to handle 384 
              greylist requests per second. This was with a real-world dataset 
              of more than 50,000 greylist requests from our production mail server 
              logs.
            <P> This greylist implementation uses the filesystem for the database 
              and, therefore, is not as fast as it could be. We selected this 
              option because the performance is more than three orders of magnitude 
              higher than our typical mail load. The lack of database configuration 
              and maintenance is why this implementation was selected.
            <P> My experience has been that using greylisting to drop 6 out of 
              7 incoming message attempts has freed up a majority of cycles on 
              our system. Before greylisting, our modest 1-GHz server was often 
              unable to meet demands. We were regularly running into mail delays 
              of several hours because the system simply couldn't keep up. Even 
              after we upgraded to a much newer 2.66-GHz system, the system was 
              still struggling. Adding greylisting has completely eliminated the 
              instances of spam clogging of the email server.
            <P> <B>Countermeasures</B>
            <P> A common argument against greylisting is that spammers can employ 
              countermeasures to work around it. That's certainly true and, in 
              fact, some spammers already do get past greylisting. However, my 
              experience has been that the vast majority of spam messages sent 
              are currently getting caught by greylisting. I could imagine that 
              if significant numbers of hosts implemented greylisting, the effectiveness 
              would drop off within 6 to 18 months.
            <P> In the meantime, your users' mailboxes and quarantine folders 
              will be dramatically smaller. Six to 18 months will also allow some 
              other technologies to mature to the point where we can start relying 
              on them. SPF, Sender-ID, and trust networks are up-and-coming techniques 
              that will be effective for the long term but need additional maturing 
              to be fully effective.
            <P> <B>Case Study</B>
            <P> In early August, I implemented greylisting on our company mail 
              server. We are a company of five people and have been on the Internet 
              a very long time. Our addresses are all over, making us a huge target 
              for spam. Our quarantine folder has had as many as 20,000 messages 
              per day in it, averaging 6,000 per day before we started getting 
              tough on spam.
            <P> The quarantine folder is simply a collection of the messages that 
              scored between 4 and 10 in SpamAssassin. Anything with a score greater 
              than 10 is thrown away because it's almost certainly spam, but we 
              like to review the marginal ones.
            <P> Figure 1 shows the number of messages in our quarantine folder 
              that are less than 24 hours old. The trend is pretty clear from 
              November to May, going from 2,000 per day up to 6,000 per day. In 
              May, we added an outsourced spam prevention company, which cut the 
              spam back down to 2,000 per day. However, within a month it had 
              jumped back up to more than 4,000 per day. During the next month, 
              I was able to get that back down to "only" 2,000 per day by spending 
              15 to 30 minutes per day tweaking the settings on the third-party 
              system.
            <P> In August, I enabled greylisting. Since then, we've been between 
              50 and 150 messages in the quarantine per day. Additionally, the 
              spam coming into our individual mailboxes has dropped by a factor 
              of ten. Instead of 20 or 30 (of another 30 to 60 legitimate messages 
              per day, not counting mailing lists), we're now down to 1 to 3 spams 
              per day that we have to deal with.
            <P> All without the aggravation of legitimate messages getting stuck 
              in quarantine folders, having to devote a fraction of the day to 
              maintenance, and other problem areas we've seen before greylisting.
            <P> Here are some statistics from our mail server over the past four 
              days:
            <P> 
            <P> 114852 SMTP connections<br>
              26502 message delivery attempts<br>
              22904 new greylist database "triple" entries<br>
              10711 unique hosts making new greylist entries<br>
              2576 messages delivered to users<br>
              1210 deliveries allowed by greylist entries<br>
              403 messages that were delayed by greylisting, but then delivered<br>
              39 legitimate messages delayed<br>
              0 false positives
            <P> 
            <P> The number of SMTP connections is high for a number of reasons. 
              Primarily, it's because we have one domain that regularly receives 
              dictionary attacks. Those connections get rejected before they get 
              to the greylisting, making that number artificially high.
            <P> About 86% of message attempts hit the greylist as new entries. 
              Of those, only about 2% attempt a second delivery and make it past 
              the greylist. Roughly 10% of those 2% are legitimate messages.
            <P> <B>Summary</B>
            <P> Greylisting is an incredibly effective tool for helping to block 
              spam and some email transmitted worms. We have seen high performance 
              combined with low maintenance and few (if any) legitimate rejected 
              messages. Although there are some drawbacks that make it unsuitable 
              in some cases, it can provide very dramatic results.
            <P> While 86% effectiveness means that greylisting is not suitable 
              as an only line of defense, it is relatively cheap. Rejecting 6 
              out of 7 messages with greylisting gives you the cycles to run other 
              more expensive anti-spam systems to get rid of the rest. Greylisting 
              is very good at getting rid of the obvious spam quickly.
