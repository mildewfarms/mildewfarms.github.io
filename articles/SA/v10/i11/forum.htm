            The scope of the Internet is difficult to conceptualize, and attempts 
            to graph it are often too simplistic or too dry to capture my imagination. 
            I do admire the Internet map produced by Peacock Maps (<b>http://www.peacockmaps.com</b>) 
            based on work by Bill Cheswick and Hal Burch. They've now released 
            the 2001 version of this Internet poster that you may have seen at 
            trade shows or in magazines. Quoting the site, "It's a graph 
            of how the Internet might look if you were a packet of data like an 
            e-mail message. The lines show the paths you might take, network-by-network, 
            if you started at a computer in the U.S. and visited almost every 
            known network around the world. The lines branch at each network switch 
            or router along the way." 
            <p> "The latest graph was made by recording the shortest path 
              taken by test messages sent on June 1, 2001, from a computer in 
              Murray Hill, New Jersey, to each of the 168,000 odd networks registered 
              in the routing databases kept by Merit Network Inc and other authoritative 
              sources. The data were then graphed using special software developed 
              by Hal Burch, while a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, 
              and Bill Cheswick, while a scientist with an affiliate of Lucent 
              Technologies. Their research into large-scale network mapping is 
              now being applied commercially by Lumeta Corporation." The 
              map is rather mysterious and striking on the black background, and 
              the 01.01.00 version hangs in my office.
            <p> Mappa Mundi Magazine (<b>http://mappa.mundi.net</b>) also showcases 
              interesting maps in the "Map of the Month" section of 
              their site. As I write this (in September), the featured map is 
              "Map of the Market" from SmartMoney.com (<b>http://www.smartmoney.com</b>). 
              It's a cool conceptualization of the stock market that can 
              show daily stock prices for more than 500 publicly traded companies 
              at a glance.
            <p> More fascinating maps can be found at the Atlas of Cyberspaces 
              site (<b>http://www.cybergeography.org/atlas/</b>), maintained by 
              Martin Dodge. This site contains maps and graphic representations 
              of the Internet, the Web, and other cyberspaces, including information 
              spaces and multi-user dimensions. As stated on the Web site, "these 
              maps of Cyberspaces -- cybermaps -- help us visualize and 
              comprehend the new digital landscapes beyond our computer screen, 
              in the wires of the global communications networks and vast online 
              information resources. The cybermaps, like maps of the real world, 
              help us navigate the new information landscapes, as well being objects 
              of aesthetic interest." <i>Atlas of Cyberspace</i> is also 
              the title of a new book by Martin Dodge &amp; Rob Kitchin, published 
              in August 2001 by Addison-Wesley. In the book, the authors explore 
              more than 30 years worth of maps depicting various cyber-landscapes. 
              Some of these maps are works of art that allow us to see the world 
              from a different perspective. As always, I welcome your comments 
              on this and other matters at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
