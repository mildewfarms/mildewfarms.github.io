            <p><i> </i><b>Ponte Announces Network Security Control Software Platform</b>
            <p> Ponte announced the release of nsControl, a software solution 
              that enables enterprises and managed service providers to centrally 
              control security policy across all network devices, regardless of 
              vendor or device type. According to the company, the Ponte nsControl 
              platform helps organizations systematically control policy for any 
              type of network security service (e.g., packet filtering, VPN, intrusion 
              detection) and to automate the deployment of that policy to any 
              type of network device (e.g., firewall, router, VPN appliance, broadband 
              CPE).
            <p> The platform can control an organization's existing network 
              without requiring changes to the network's architecture or 
              to the current inventory of network devices. The platform's 
              scriptable interface enables integration with an organization's 
              existing business and operations support systems. Ponte's nsControl 
              platform control server manages all of the information about the 
              security policy and network devices controlled by the platform. 
              The control server schedules, coordinates, tracks and logs the progress 
              of all change requests. The control server allows operators to change 
              device behavior by changing the device attributes stored in the 
              vendor-independent device profile.
            <p> The Ponte nsControl platform is available immediately for Sun 
              Solaris servers, with pricing based on the number of network devices 
              and security services under management. For more information, contact:

            <p><i> </i><b>Crossroads Releases Crossroads 8000 Storage Router and 
              Management Software</b>
            <p> Crossroads Systems, a provider of storage networking solutions, 
              announced the Crossroads 8000 storage router and management software, 
              which integrates SCSI storage devices into Fibre Channel SANs. The 
              8000 is designed to connect storage devices into Fibre Channel and 
              SCSI storage networks, and InfiniBand fabrics.
            <p> According to the company, storage router configuration and management 
              can be simplified by the Crossroads 8000's embedded Web server 
              and Crossroads Visual Manager (CVM) software. Through the CVM's 
              graphical user interface, network administrators can view and alter 
              the configuration and status the storage router and the attached 
              SCSI and Fibre Channel devices. Management tasks can be handled 
              remotely and securely through a standard Web browser.
            <p> The Crossroads 8000 uses a common hardware architecture and common 
              software, the Crossroads Router OS, a modular, scaleable code base. 
              The Crossroads 8000 is capable of virtually no unscheduled down 
              time. Dual power supplies and power cords, dual fans and dual Fibre 
              Channel ports enable the 8000 to continue operating despite a major 
              component failure, a power grid failure or power cord pull, or a 
              Fibre Channel network failure or cable pull. The 8000 features eight 
              SCSI ports in a space-efficient, 1U form factor. The Crossroads 
              8000 has an internal bus architecture capable of more than 500 Mbytes 
              per second. For more information, contact: <i>Crossroads Systems,
