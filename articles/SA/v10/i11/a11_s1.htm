            <H1>Archiving Saves the Day</h1><p>
              I know of one company that had a 250-GB database that did not use 
              archiving at all. The biggest downside to this was that they could 
              not do hot backups, and a cold backup took too long. The result 
              was that they didn't do any backups! The DBAs didn't want 
              to turn on archiving because they said that it would make the batch 
              loads take too long. They also believed that having archiving turned 
              on would somehow cause database corruption. This is just not possible. 
              Again, the only difference between running and not running archiving 
              is whether the old redolog is copied to the archive destination. 
              The rest of the database works exactly the same.<p>
              I tried to convince them to turn on archiving. I even bet them that 
              turning on archiving would not add more than a three percent overhead 
              to their load times. In other words, a five-hour load would take 
              only five hours and nine minutes. I lost the bet because it took 
              five hours and ten minutes. The DBAs agreed to turn on archiving, 
              and the database received its first backup ever in five years. Two 
              weeks later that database lost five disks -- believe it or not. 
              We were able to recover the database overnight with no downtime 
              to the users.<p>
