            <p> <i>Elizabeth Zinkann</i>
            <p> My August column contained a review of the first edition of <i>Networking: 
              A Beginner's Guide</i>, which coincided with the release of 
              <i>Networking: A Beginner's Guide</i>, Second Edition. The 
              latest release modifies numerous topics and adds a very important 
              chapter on Disaster Recovery. I have included a review of the second 
              edition in this column, in addition to reviews of the new Perl Bookshelf 
              and a certification guidebook. The book titles, authors, and publishers 
              of this month's selections include: <i>SAIR Linux/GNU Installation 
              and Configuration Exam Cram</i> by Michael Jang (Coriolis); The 
              Perl CD Bookshelf; Version 2.0 (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 
              Inc.); and <i>Networking: A Beginner's Guide</i>, Second Edition 
              by Bruce Hallberg (Osborne McGraw-Hill).

            <p> Certification acknowledges the achievement of a recognized level 
              of expertise, whether attained through study, experience, or a combination 
              of the two. In this Coriolis Exam Cram book, author Michael Jang 
              demonstrates the structures and procedures of the SAIR Linux/GNU 
              certification tests and examines the content of the Installation 
              and Configuration Level One Exam 3X0-101. The Introduction, Self-Assessment, 
              and Chapter 1 (Sair Linux/GNU Certification Exams) provide the reader 
              with fundamental information about the certification process, how 
              to prepare for the exam, the best way to use this book, and the 
              mechanics of the Sair Linux/GNU test administration. The author 
              also examines the subjects that this test includes.
            <p> In Chapters 2 through 14, Jang addresses the following topics: 
              A Short History of Linux, Linux Structure, Hardware Configuration, 
              Installation Options, Startup and Shutdown, Commanding the Shell, 
              Using the Shell, Managing Printers, The X Window, System Administration, 
              Network Configuration, Applications, and Troubleshooting. The concluding 
              chapters contain a Sample Test and Answer Key, and the Appendix 
              reprints the GNU General Public License followed by a detailed 23-page 
              Glossary and the Index.
            <p> As Jang presents each aspect of the test subjects, he explains 
              the underlying concept, outlines its implementation, and demonstrates 
              its use through numerous examples. The descriptions and explanations 
              are effectively discussed and clearly illustrated. This Exam Cram 
              book furnishes the reader with several aids and resources for certification 
              testing: a four-sided reference card, a specialized Web site (<b>http://www.examcram.com</b>), 
              an optional newsletter from <b>http://www.coriolis.com</b>, sample 
              questions and answers, and the author's tips and alerts, which 
              are highlighted throughout the book.
            <p> The beginning of the book helps the reader establish his or her 
              individual status, what to expect during the test, and how to prepare 
              for testing. The format of each chapter begins with "Terms 
              you'll need to understand" and "Techniques you'll 
              need to master", followed by a short introduction and chapter 
              overview. The chapters end with Practice Questions, thorough answers 
              that explain why each of the multiple choice answers is right or 
              wrong, and additional references. The Practice Questions and Answers 
              not only give the reader a feel for the exam, but also emphasize 
              the importance of carefully reading each question and answer. The 
              <i>SAIR Linux/GNU Installation and Configuration Exam Cram</i> by 
              Michael Jang is an informative and well-written guide to the Sair 
              Linux/GNU Installation and Configuration exam. It is an excellent 
              preparation tool and also a superb Linux reference.

              Book Included<br>
              http://www.oreilly.com
            <p> Most new revisions or editions contain modifications to reflect 
              changes in software or hardware. The latest release of The Perl 
              Bookshelf changed the book selections on the CD-ROM. The original 
              version included both the hard copy and the electronic versions 
              of <i>Perl in a Nutshell</i>, <i>Programming Perl</i> Second Edition, 
              the <i>Perl Cookbook</i>, <i>Advanced Perl Programming</i>, <i>Learning 
              Perl</i> Second Edition, and <i>Learning Perl on Win32 Systems</i>. 
              That selection addressed Perl Programmers, novices, systems administrators, 
              and users on several platforms and varied levels of expertise.
            <p> The new, improved release contains: hard copy and electronic versions 
              of <i>Perl in a Nutshell</i> (by Ellen Siever, Stephen Spainhour, 
              and Nathan Patwardhan, ISBN 1-56592-286-7, $29.95); <i>Programming 
              Perl</i>, Third Edition (by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, and Jon 
              Orwant, ISBN 0-596-00027-8, $49.95); the <i>Perl Cookbook</i> (by 
              Tom Christiansen and Nathan Torkington, ISBN 1-56592-243-3, $39.95); 
              <i>Advanced Perl Programming</i> (by Sriram Srinivasan, ISBN 1-56592-220-4, 
              $34.95); and <i>Perl for System Administration</i> (by David N. 
              Blank-Edelman, ISBN 1-56592-609-9, $34.95). This substitution effectively 
              transforms The Perl CD Bookshelf from a reference for all levels 
              to a resource and utility for Perl programmers and systems administrators.
            <p> The easily transportable CD-ROM can be used on any Web browser 
              software with Java Version 1.1.2 or later. Users can search through 
              any of the five books separately or all of them simultaneously, 
              either by using the Table of Contents to find the section and chapter 
              or by entering a search term. The user can then choose to read the 
              answer, the section in which the answer appears, the entire chapter, 
              or any cross-references that may apply. The Perl CD Bookshelf's 
              interface is easy to navigate and provides a quick method to finding 
              that elusive phrase or solution. It is an ideal way to access several 
              resources from a remote location without carrying ten pounds of 
              books to the site. The Perl CD Bookshelf is an excellent utility 
              for anyone who uses Perl.
            <p> <b>Networking: A Beginner's Guide</b><br>
              Second Edition<br>
              Bruce Hallberg<br>
              Osborne McGraw-Hill<br>
              ISBN 0-07-213231-0<br>

            <p> The fundamentals of network implementation and configuration have 
              become essential tools for computer professionals and hobbyists 
              alike. Whether you are a systems administrator, a programmer, a 
              certification student, or a user setting up a home network, you 
              utilize the same networking concepts and procedures. Hallberg's 
              second edition of <i>Networking: A Beginner's Guide</i> demonstrates 
              both the abstract principles and the practical techniques required 
              to design and establish a network. Three completely new chapters 
              stand out among the numerous modifications and additions within 
              the second edition: The Business of Networking, Laying the Foundation, 
              and Network Disaster Recovery.
            <p> The first of the new chapters, The Business of Networking, describes 
              a company network from a corporate viewpoint and defines some of 
              the network-related positions within the business framework and 
              their respective job descriptions. In Laying the Foundation, Hallberg 
              briefly explains the different numbering systems (binary, octal, 
              and hexadecimal) used in networking plus bandwidth terminology. 
              The most technically oriented of the recent additions is the Network 
              Disaster Recovery chapter. It analyzes Disaster Recovery Plans and 
              Network Backup and Restore contingencies; technical editor Tony 
              Ryan contributed a valuable section describing the Seattle 2001 
              earthquake and the recovery that followed it. The NetWare chapters 
              (Installing and Setting Up NetWare 5.1, Administering NetWare: The 
              Basics, and Understanding Other NetWare Services) have been revised. 
              NetWare 5.1 replaces the NetWare 5.0 procedures described in the 
              original version. Linux users will notice that Hallberg uses Red 
              Hat 7.0 and the accompanying figures display the 7.0 screens. (Red 
              Hat 7.1 processes basically remain the same, although some of the 
              GUI screens and menus differ.)
            <p> Hallberg's <i>Networking: A Beginner's Guide</i>, Second 
              Edition is an excellent selection for anyone interested or involved 
              with the design and configuration of a network. The author discusses 
              the essential components, policies, and plans for consideration, 
              and features unique to the most popular operating systems. The result 
              is an informative guide and reference for the experienced computer 
              user.
