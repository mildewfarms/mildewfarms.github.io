			<p>As you may already know, <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine recently acquired 
              <i>The Perl Journal</i> from its owner, Jon Orwant, who is President 
              of Readable Publications and CTO of O'Reilly &amp; Associates. 
              Jon launched <i>The Perl Journal</i> in 1996, and most recently, 
              <i>TPJ</i> was part of EarthWeb Inc. Earlier this year, however, 
              EarthWeb divested itself of all editorial products, and control 
              of <i>TPJ</i> reverted to Jon.
            <p> I'm excited about the addition of <i>TPJ</i>. I think it 
              will provide an excellent complement to <i>Sys Admin</i>'s 
              editorial coverage. <i>TPJ</i> will be published quarterly as a 
              supplement to <i>Sys Admin</i>. We're working on the next <i>TPJ</i> 
              now, and it will be delivered in the polybag along with an upcoming 
              issue. All current and future subscriptions to both <i>TPJ</i> and 
              <i>Sys Admin</i> will include both magazines.
            <p> I'm pleased to say that Jon Orwant will continue to collaborate 
              on <i>TPJ</i> as a Senior Contributing Editor. Since Jon is not 
              only the founder of <i>The Perl Journal</i> but also author or co-author 
              of three Perl books, including <i>Programming Perl</i>, otherwise 
              known as the "Camel book" (O'Reilly &amp; Associates), 
              he's an invaluable resource to the <i>Sys Admin</i> team. Jon 
              and I are currently working through the backlog of proposals and 
              manuscripts that he developed before the change of ownership. If 
              you care to submit a new article proposal, please email it to me.
            <p> In the meantime, this issue of <i>Sys Admin</i> features several 
              articles related to backups and storage. Adam Anderson describes 
              a cost-effective alternative to SANs, Primitivo Cervantes explains 
              the use of the Disaster Recovery Module of Tivoli Storage Manager, 
              and Michael Watson provides scripts for a backup solution implementing 
              Sun's E250 server. The Web-only articles this month include 
              an explanation of SSA and a Perl package for monitoring traffic. 
              Note also that the <i>Sys Admin</i> Web site has recently been redesigned. 
              We're still working out some bugs and making additions, so 
              if you see any problems with the new site, please let us know. You 
              can write to our Webmaster, Randy Reames at: <b>rreames@cmp.com</b> 
              with specific Web glitches or write to me as always at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <p> Amber Ankerholz<br>
