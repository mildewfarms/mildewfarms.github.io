# This option is important for security. It allows you to
# restrict connections to machines that are on your local network.
# The following example restricts access to one C class network
# and the "loopback" interface. For more examples of the syntax
# see the smb.conf man page
   hosts allow = 192.168.0. 127.

# Put a capping on the size of the log files (in Kb).
   max log size = 50

# You may wish to use password encryption. Please read
# ENCRYPTION.txt, Win95.txt and WinNT.txt in the Samba
# documentation. Do not enable this option unless you
# have read those documents.
  encrypt passwords = yes

# Configure Samba to use multiple interfaces.  If you have
# multiple network interfaces then you must list them here.
# See the man page for details.  Note that we are using our
# shared IP address.
   interfaces = 192.168.0.100/24

# Browser Control Options:
# set local master to no if you don't want Samba to become a
# master browser on your network. Otherwise the normal election
# rules apply
   local master = yes

# Preferred Master causes Samba to force a local browser election
# on startup and gives it a slightly higher chance of winning
# the election
   preferred master = yes

# Enable this if you want Samba to be a domain logon server for
# Windows95 workstations.
   domain logons = yes

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba
# to enable its WINS Server
   wins support = yes

# A publicly accessible directory, read/write to all users. Note
# that all files created in the directory by users will be owned
# by the default user, so any user with access can delete any
# other user's files. Obviously this directory must be writable
# by the default user. Another user could of course be specified,
# in which case all files would be owned by that user instead.
