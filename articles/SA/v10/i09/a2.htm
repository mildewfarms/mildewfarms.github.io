              Recovery with Tivoli Storage Manager</h1>
            <p> <i>Primitivo Cervantes</i>
            <p> Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) from Tivoli is an enterprise-wide 
              backup and recovery software package that is frequently used by 
              small and large companies to back up their critical data. The TSM 
              software runs on a server connected to the client's network, 
              and the other systems' data are backed up to this server through 
              the client's network. The data can also be restored to any 
              system through the network. Because the TSM server is a critical 
              resource, a process is needed to ensure the TSM server and any other 
              system's data are restored in the event of a disaster. In this 
              article, I will discuss how to use the Disaster Recovery Module 
              (DRM) of TSM to recover the TSM server and its database to restore 
              other systems' data. I will also discuss how off-site tapes 
              are created and managed in preparation for such a scenario.
            <p> A typical TSM server scenario will include the server hardware, 
              a tape library, two or more tape drives within the tape library, 
              the TSM software, a network connection, and other systems that need 
              to be backed up (TSM clients). The TSM server hardware and the TSM 
              clients can vary greatly (e.g., HP, Sun, IBM, etc.). The storage 
              devices can also vary (e.g., IBM tape libraries, STK silos, DLT 
              tape libraries, etc.).
            <p> For purposes of this article, I will describe the TSM and DRM 
              functions using the example of an IBM RISC System/6000 model H80 
              as the server system and an IBM 3494 tape library with two IBM 3590 
              tape drives as the storage devices. The IBM 3590 tape drives are 
              connected to the IBM H80 using a SCSI connection. The client network 
              is a 100-Mb Ethernet network. This TSM server will have a hostname 
              of "tsmserver1". I will also include an AIX system (IBM 
              RISC System/6000 model F80) as a TSM client. This TSM client will 
              have a hostname of "aixclient1".
            <p> <b>Function of DRM</b>
            <p> DRM serves two particular functions within TSM. It provides a 
              way of managing the TSM off-site tapes. It also creates a DRM report 
              that can be used to recreate the TSM server in the event of a disaster. 
              This DRM report is really a set of scripts and logs in a single 
              text file. This text file can be separated out to scripts, and these 
              scripts can be executed to recreate the TSM server.
            <p> <b>Some Basic Terminology</b>
            <p> A TSM "client" refers to a system that can back up to 
              the TSM "server". This TSM client system may be a file 
              server or SQL database server or other type of server. This TSM 
              client has a "nodename" associated with it in TSM. When 
              a client backs up data to the TSM server, the TSM server will store 
              it in tape in our example. These tapes belong to a "primary 
              storage pool". These primary storage pool tapes are duplicated 
              to another set of tapes to create the off-site tapes. These off-site 
              tapes belong to a "copy storage pool".
            <p> <b>Configuring Base DRM Parameters</b>
            <p> For our purposes, I will configure the base DRM parameters with 
              the following values:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Recovery Plan Prefix=/var/adm/tsm
Primary Storage Pools=BKUP_TAPEPOOL
Copy Storage Pools=OFFSITE_TAPE
DB Backup Series Expiration Days=14 Day(s)
Recovery Plan File Expiration Days=14 Day(s)
</pre>
            There are other fields, but those can be ignored for our purposes. 
            The fields have the following purposes:
            <p> 
            <p><b>Recovery Plan Prefix</b> -- The recovery plan is the DRM 
              report. By default, the DRM report has the format <b>&lt;DATE&gt;.&lt;TIME&gt;</b> 
              where the <b>&lt;DATE&gt;</b> is the date the DRM report was generated 
              and <b>&lt;TIME&gt;</b> is the time the DRM report was generated. 
              For a DRM report that was generated on May 23, 2001 10:40:30 P.M., 
              the DRM report name is <b>20010523.204030</b>. With the value that 
              we will insert in this field, <b>/var/adm/tsm</b>, this same report 
              will have a filename of <b>/var/adm/tsm.20010523.204030</b>.
            <p> <b>Primary Storage Pools</b> -- The primary storage pool contains 
              the original tapes to be copied. In this case, we will call that 
              <b>BKUP_TAPEPOOL</b>.
            <p> <b>Copy Storage Pools</b> -- The copy storage pool contains 
              the copies of the <b>BKUP_TAPEPOOL</b> and, therefore, off-site 
              tapes. We will call this <b>OFFSITE_TAPE</b>.
            <p> <b>DB Backup Series Expiration Days</b> -- This parameter 
              determines how many days TSM will keep the TSM database backup information. 
              We will set this to 14 days.
            <p> <b>Recovery Plan File Expiration Days</b> -- This parameter 
              determines how many days TSM will keep the DRM reports. We will 
              set this to 14 days.
            <p> 
            <p> To set these fields, run these commands from the TSM administrative 
              client shell. To start the TSM administrative client, run <b>dsmadmc</b> 
              and enter the TSM administrative ID and password. You'll notice 
              that most of the commands are case insensitive, even though the 
              AIX operating system itself is case sensitive. There are exceptions, 
              such as when you are specifying file locations (as when specifying 
              the <b>drmplanprefix</b>). To set the recovery plan prefix:
            <p> 
            <pre>
set drmplanprefix /var/adm/tsm
</pre>
            To set the primary storage pool:
            <p> 
            <pre>
set drmprimstgpool bkup_tapepool
</pre>
            To set the copy storage pool:
            <p> 
            <pre>
set drmcopystgpool offsite_tape
</pre>
            To set the TSM <b>db</b> backup series expiration days:
            <p> 
            <pre>
set drmdbbackupexpiredays 14
</pre>
            To set the recovery plan file expiration days:
            <p> 
            <pre>
set drmrpfexpiredays 14
Defining Machines to DRM
</pre>
            When you define a "machine" to DRM, DRM will include that 
            system in the DRM report. DRM does not automatically include all of 
            its clients in the DRM report. You must manually input them into DRM. 
            This is not usually a problem but can be annoying if you have many 
            clients to include in DRM. In this example, we will include the TSM 
            server "tsmserver1" and the TSM client "aixclient1".
            <p> There are several machine fields that can be customized, and we 
              will focus on the "name", "description", and 
              "adsmserver". The "name" is the machine name, 
              often the TSM nodename. The "description" comprises a 
              sentence about the system and perhaps its function. The "adsmserver" 
              field tells DRM whether the system is the TSM server. TSM used to 
              be called ADSM, and there are still references to this in many places. 
              To define the machines to DRM:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Define machine tsmserver1 description="The actual TSM server" adsmserver=yes
Define machine aixclient1 description="The AIX TSM client" adsmserver=no
</pre>
            After we create the machine definition, we need to associate this 
            machine with its TSM nodename. Since a single system can have several 
            TSM nodenames, this is how DRM keeps track of the actual system. To 
            define the machines associates to DRM:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Define machnodeassociation tsmserver1 tsmserver1
Define machnodeassociation aixclient1 aixclient1
Defining Recovery Media to DRM</pre>
            In general, TSM is used to back up critical data but is not used to 
            install the systems themselves. In the event of a disaster, the system 
            is first rebuilt and then TSM is used to restore the data. There are 
            ways to use TSM to install the actual system, and this is called a 
            "bare-metal restore". I will not focus on that type of restore 
            because this procedure differs with different types of systems. I 
            usually recommend that a single system be set up as an install server 
            for AIX, another for Sun, etc., so that the number of systems needing 
            actual bootable backups can be minimized.
            <p> When you define "recovery media" to DRM, you are telling 
              DRM the location of the system-bootable media so that DRM can include 
              that information in the DRM report. To define recovery media to 
              DRM:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Define recoverymedia aix_433_boot_cds volumenames=cds1-4 \
  description="AIX 4.3.3 install CD's" location="top shelf of \
  the 3rd floor cabinet" type=boot
</pre>
            After creating the recovery media definition, we must associate this 
            with the TSM machines. To define this association:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Define recmedmachassociation aix_433_boot_cds tsmserver1
Define recmedmachassociation aix_433_boot_cds aixclient1
</pre>
            <b>What to Do Before a Disaster</b>
            <p> To restore the TSM server and hence any data that it contains, 
              you will need at least three things: the TSM database backup tape, 
              the DRM report, and the off-site tapes that contain the TSM client 
              data. To prepare for a disaster, daily TSM activities must include 
              the following steps in order:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Backup the TSM client data. 
              <li> Create the off-site tapes. 
              <li> Backup the TSM database. 
              <li> Create the DRM report. 
              <li> Perform an AIX-bootable backup (<b>mksysb</b>) to include the 
                DRM report. 
              <li> Send the off-site tapes, the TSM database backup tape, and 
                the TSM server <b>mksysb</b> tape to an off-site vault. 
              <li> Send additional recovery media (such as AIX installation CDs) 
                to the vault.
            </ul>
            <p> Backing up the TSM client data can differ depending on the type 
              of data. For example, a TSM agent can be used to back up an Oracle 
              database while it is online. For regular AIX files:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsmc inc
</pre>
            To create the off-site tapes, we back up the primary storage pool 
            tapes to the copy storage pool tapes. We do this with the TSM administrative 
            client, <b>dsmadmc</b>. After starting the <b>dsmadmc</b> shell:
            <p> 
            <pre>
backup stgpool bkup_tapepool offsite_tape
</pre>
            The DRM report in our case will be in the <b>/var/adm</b> directory 
            and will have a format of <b>tsm.&lt;DATE&gt;.&lt;TIME&gt;</b>, as 
            mentioned previously. To create the DRM report:
            <p> 
            <pre>
prepare
</pre>
            To recover the TSM server, we will need the AIX install CDs, the TSM 
            install CDs, and the DRM report. The DRM report contains scripts to 
            recreate the TSM database, logs, options files, etc. We can combine 
            these into one by creating a bootable install tape (AIX <b>mksysb</b>). 
            All we need in this case is the AIX <b>mksysb</b> tape, which will 
            contain everything else. As we will see later, this lets us ignore 
            many of the scripts in the DRM report, saving a lot of time and effort. 
            To create the AIX <b>mksysb</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/bin/mksysb -i /dev/rmt0
</pre>
            where <b>/dev/rmt0</b> is the tape device to back up to.
            <p> After performing all of the above actions, the AIX <b>mksysb tape</b>, 
              the TSM database backup tape, and all of the off-site data tapes 
              must be sent to the off-site vault for safe keeping. Additionally, 
              keep a copy of the installation media for restoring specific clients, 
              such as AIX installation CDs, HP installation CDs, etc. This is 
              done in case other ways of rebuilding the TSM clients fail and we 
              have to rebuild the system.
            <p> <b>Using DRM to Manage Off-Site Tapes</b>
            <p> Without DRM, there are basically only a couple of states for the 
              tapes, where access is equal to <b>readwrite</b> or <b>offsite</b> 
              depending on whether it is in the tape library of out of the tape 
              library. DRM adds more states that are useful for managing off-site 
              tapes. Here are the more important states in the order that they 
              would be used:
            <p> 
            <p> <b>Mountable</b> -- The tape is in the tape library and can 
              be mounted into a tape drive for reading and writing.
            <p> <b>Courier</b> -- The tape has been ejected from the tape 
              library and is in transit to the off-site vault.
            <p> <b>Vault</b> -- The tape is in the off-site vault.
            <p> <b>VaultRetrieve</b> -- The data on the tape has expired or 
              been moved to another tape so it no longer contains any data. It 
              can be retrieved from the vault and used again. It is important 
              to note that the TSM server automatically sets the tape to this 
              state. It cannot manually be set to this state. The only way to 
              manually set a tape to this state is to move the data from the tape 
              or to delete the data contained in the tape.
            <p> <b>CourierRetrieve</b> -- The tape has been recalled from 
              the vault and is in transit back to the office.
            <p> <b>OnsiteRetrieve</b> -- The courier has returned the tape 
              to the office. Note that as soon as the tape is move to <b>onsiteretrieve</b>, 
              TSM removes it from its database. As far as TSM is concerned, the 
              tape no longer exists. This is because as the tape is returned to 
              the office, it can actually be used on other systems and does not 
              necessarily have to be returned to this particular TSM server.
            <p> 
            <p> All of the following commands are performed in the TSM administrative 
              client shell, <b>dsmadmc</b>. In order for a tape to be mountable, 
              it is inserted into the tape library and checked into TSM. In the 
              following command, <b>IBM3494</b> is the name of the tape library 
              as defined to TSM. To check in the tapes:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Checkin libv IBM3494 status=scratch search=yes checklabel=yes devtype=3590
</pre>
            After creating the off-site tapes, those tapes need to be ejected 
            from the library and marked as <b>courier</b>. The following command 
            will do it in one step:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Move drmedia * stgpool=offsite_tape remove=yes tostate=courier
</pre>
            Once the tapes have arrived at the vault, they need to be changed 
            to <b>vault</b> status:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Move drmedia * wherestate=courier tostate=vault
</pre>
            Again, when the data in the off-site tapes expires and the tape contains 
            no more data, TSM automatically changes the tape status to <b>vaultretrieve</b>. 
            In order to find out which tapes are available to be retrieved from 
            the vault and reused:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Query drmedia * wherestate=vaultretrieve
</pre>
            After contacting the vault with a list of tapes that need to be retrieved 
            from the vault, we can change the status of the tapes to <b>courierretrieve</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Move drmedia * wherestate=vaultretrieve tostate=courierretrieve
</pre>
            Once the courier has delivered the tapes to the office from the vault, 
            we can change the status of the tapes to <b>onsiteretrieve</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Move drmedia * wherestate=courierretrieve tostate=onsiteretrieve
</pre>
            After the tapes arrive back at the office and are changed to <b>onsiteretrieve</b> 
            status, TSM will remove the information about the tape from its database. 
            It can then be checked into the server again, and the cycle repeats.
            <p> <b>Automating the Management of Off-Site Tapes</b>
            <p> It's important to note that all of the tape management commands 
              can be combined into scripts so that most of the process can be 
              automated. It all depends on your requirements. Some clients like 
              to have total control and accountability, so they require their 
              operators to perform everything manually. Other clients automate 
              the process as much as possible. It all depends on your requirements 
              and on your confidence that the courier will deliver all of the 
              off-site tapes to the vault.
            <p> <b>Format of the DRM Report</b>
            <p> To understand how to use the DRM report to recover the TSM server, 
              we need to understand its format. The DRM report is really a single 
              text file that contains entire scripts, logs, and configuration 
              files, etc. all in the same text file. The format is best described

            As you can see, the DRM report is broken down into sections. Each 
            section is a file, log, or script. The section begins with the key 
            word "<b>begin</b>" followed by the file name, in the first 
            file <b>PLANFILE.DESCRIPTION</b>. A blank line follows this, and the 
            contents of the file are then included. After the file contents, the 
            section ends with three lines. The first ending line starts with the 
            key word "<b>end</b>" followed by the file name, a blank 
            line, and a line with "<b>*-*-</b>" repeated across the 
            line.
            <p> The names of the files are important because they are used within 
              the scripts that DRM creates in the DRM report. The scripts within 
              the DRM report expects those names to be there along with the "<b>DRM 
              plan prefix</b>" we had configured before. For example, the 
              file above <b>PLANFILE.DESCRIPTION</b> would be appended to the 
              DRM plan prefix we configured of <b>/var/adm/tsm</b> to get the 
              filename <b>/var/adm/tsm.PLANFILE.DESCRIPTION</b>.
            <p> I've written a small Perl script to extract the files and 
              break them into the appropriate filenames. This is a fairly simple 
              script so I won't go through it here. The code for this article 
              is available for download at the <i>Sys Admin</i> Web site. This 
              script will take the DRM report and separate it into the appropriate 
              filenames using the <b>tsm</b> as a DRM plan prefix. Simply <b>cd</b> 
              to the <b>/var/adm</b> directory, and run the following command:
            <p> 
            <pre>
cat &lt;DRM REPORT&gt; |  perl prepare_extract_files.pl
</pre>
            where "<b>&lt;DRM REPORT&gt;</b>" is the name of the report. 
            Those files are broken down in your current directory. In addition 
            to the above Perl script, I have included an actual DRM report so 
            you can see how this script extracts files. The Perl script has a 
            filename of <b>tsm_prepare_extract_files.pl</b>, and the DRM report 
            has the name <b>tsm.20000915.130005</b>.
            <p> <b>What to Do in the Event of a Disaster</b>
            <p> Now that we have all of this information, what happens if we lose 
              the computer room and have to rebuild everything at another location? 
              The assumption here is that we have another site where we can recover 
              systems. Also, we will assume that the recovery site has identical 
              hardware. Because we have taken time to prepare for this event, 
              the recovery process will be remarkably simple. We will proceed 
              with the recovery with the following steps:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Retrieve the off-site tapes, including the TSM database backup 
                tapes and the AIX <b>mksysb</b> tape. 
              <li> Rebuild the TSM server using the AIX <b>mksysb</b> tape. 
              <li> Insert all of the off-site tapes into the tape library. 
              <li> Break out the latest DRM report into scripts and files using 
                the Perl script mentioned above. 
              <li> Use the DRM scripts to rebuild the TSM server database. 
              <li> Install the TSM clients. 
              <li> Rebuild the TSM clients using TSM.
            </ul>
            <p> It is generally best when retrieving off-site tapes to retrieve 
              all of them. Depending on where the vault is, it will probably be 
              unfeasible to keep calling the vault to retrieve tapes during a 
              recovery process. That is because assuming that a major disaster 
              has occurred, it will be quite urgent to get these systems up and 
              running.
            <p> Once the tapes are at the recovery location, the first step is 
              to rebuild the TSM server. Using the AIX <b>mksysb</b> tape and 
              using the regular AIX <b>mksysb</b> installation procedures, reinstall 
              the AIX operating system on the TSM server. During this time, the 
              tapes could be inserted into the tape library.
            <p> After the server has been rebuilt, it will not be in a state that 
              we can use to start TSM. We will have to rebuild the TSM database 
              first. This is where the DRM report and its scripts come into play. 
              Break out the DRM report into scripts using the Perl script mentioned 
              above. The script that we are interested in will be called <b>/var/adm/tsm.RECOVERY.SCRIPT.DISASTER.RECOVERY.MODE</b>. 
              When you run this script, it will use several of the other scripts 
              and files to:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Rebuild the TSM server configuration files. 
                <p> 
              <li> Rebuild the TSM volume history and device configuration files. 
                <p> 
              <li> Create and format and initialize the TSM database and TSM log 
                files. 
                <p> 
              <li> Recreate the TSM database from the TSM database backup tape. 
                <p> 
              <li> Start the TSM server. 
                <p> 
              <li> Up until this point, you could use this procedure to rebuild 
                a TSM server in which all of the tapes are available including 
                all of the primary storage pool tapes. 
                <p> 
                <p> In case of an actual disaster, where the primary storage pool 
                  tapes are not available, you will also be prompted to do the 
                  following:
                <p> 
                <p> 
              <li> Register the TSM server licenses. 
                <p> 
              <li> Tell TSM the copy storage pool tapes are available. 
                <p> 
              <li> Mark the primary storage pool tapes as "destroyed". 
                <p> 
                <p> That's it! One script does it all. All of the preparation 
                  makes this possible. DRM does a great job of creating this script 
                  and doing the hard work for you. This would normally be the 
                  hard part since the TSM server rebuild is a prerequisite to 
                  rebuilding all of the TSM clients' data.
                <p> After rebuilding the TSM server, just install the clients 
                  using the installation media or bootable install tapes. Again, 
                  my recommendation is to create an install server for each type 
                  of system, rebuild the install server first, and then use that 
                  to rebuild the individual client operating systems. Once the 
                  client operating systems are operational, we can use TSM to 
                  restore all of the data using the normal TSM restore procedures.
                <p> <b>Summary</b>
                <p> I have introduced the DRM component of TSM and shown how to 
                  configure it. Also, I have introduced how DRM manages tapes 
                  and discussed what to do to prepare for a disaster. Additionally, 
                  I have talked about the DRM report and how to use that to rebuild 
                  the TSM server. Once this TSM server is rebuilt, we can use 
                  it to restore all of the TSM client's data.
