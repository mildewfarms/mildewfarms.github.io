            <p> One of my favorite aspects of UNIX systems administration is shell 
              programming. According to a recent issue of <i>Sys Admin</i>, many 
              readers share this interest with me. Whether it is an affinity for 
              the programming itself, or for the streamlined procedures it creates, 
              the advantages of the shell are well worth learning. In the Third 
              Edition of this Korn shell programming manual, Olczak has updated 
              the text to reflect changes in "Korn Shell 93". He presents 
              the basic <b>ksh</b> commands and interface, demonstrates how to 
              program shell scripts, and includes coverage of <b>pdksh</b> for 
              Linux.
            <p> The first chapter introduces Korn shell and describes where to 
              get it and how to access it, both automatically and from the command 
              line. In the succeeding chapters, Olczak addresses Korn Shell Basics, 
              Variables and Parameters, Editing Commands, Job Control, Performing 
              Arithmetic, The Environment, Writing Korn Shell Scripts, and Miscellaneous 
              Commands. The Appendices contain A) Sample .profile File; B) Sample 
              Environment File; C) C Shell Functionality; D) Sample Korn Shell 
              Scripts; E) Korn Shell Man Page; F) Pdksh; G) Pdksh Quick Reference; 
              and H) Pdksh Man Page. The Accompanying CD-ROM includes a .pdf file 
              of the book, a 90-day evaluation copy of U/Win (which provides a 
              <b>ksh</b>-like environment within a Windows 9x/NT system), an upgrade 
              to U/Win, <b>pdksh</b> (the public domain version of the Korn shell, 
              frequently used on Linux systems), and an informative text file.
            <p> The Korn shell is a versatile utility; it provides an interface 
              to the operating system, a scripting and programming tool, and command-line 
              editing capabilities. Olczak effectively describes each of its features, 
              presenting each concept with any applicable options, variables, 
              operators, or examples in a straightforward and well-written style. 
              The inclusion of the <b>ksh</b> and <b>pdksh</b> man pages (as well 
              as the <b>pdksh</b> quick reference) furnishes a valuable resource 
              for the user. Olczak's superb approach and explanations coupled 
              with the software and Adobe Acrobat version of the book make <i>The 
              Korn Shell: UNIX and Linux Programming Manual</i>, Third Edition, 
              an excellent resource. This is an ideal choice for anyone learning 
              <b>ksh</b>, upgrading to the Korn Shell 93 Standard, or simply wishing 
              to know more about shell programming in general.
            <p> <b>Tru64 UNIX File Administration Handbook</b><br>
              Steven M. Hancock<br>
              Digital Press<br>
              ISBN 1-55558-227-3<br>
              533 Pages<br>

            <p> Each variant of the UNIX operating system has some of its own 
              unique terminology (i.e., HP-UX's SAM versus AIX's SMIT). 
              In some cases, administration procedures may also differ slightly. 
              The Compaq Tru64 UNIX system (a.k.a. Digital UNIX) is an excellent 
              example of this trend. In the <i>Tru64 UNIX File System Administration 
              Handbook</i>, author Steven Hancock, who is also a Compaq Tru64 
              UNIX support engineer, explains the processes that this system utilizes, 
              emphasizes the concepts administrators need to know, demonstrates 
              how the Tru64 UNIX file system works, and discusses some of the 

              advanced techniques implemented by Compaq's TruCluster.
            <p> Each chapter begins with an introduction, presents several major 
              concepts or practices, and ends with a summary and notes. Each concept 
              is further divided into smaller sections. For example, UNIX File 
              Types contains Regular Files; Directories; Symbolic Links; Device 
              Special Files; Named Pipes; and Local Sockets. The individual sections 
              contain a description and an example, when applicable. Hancock begins 
              the book with a preface and Introduction, which outlines the definitions 
              and terminology as well as some UNIX commands and UNIX File Types. 
              The following chapters examine: Storage and Device Management; Logical 
              Storage Manager; Tru64 UNIX File Systems Architecture; UNIX File 
              System; Advanced File System: The Basics; Advanced File System: 
              Advanced Topics; File Systems Configuration and Tuning; and File 
              System Troubleshooting and Recovery. The Appendices contain A) Freeware 
              Tools; B) Advanced AdvFS Commands; C) The <b>fsck</b>(8) Command 
              Operation; and a Glossary.
            <p> A recurring theme of the book discusses storage, backup, and recovery 
              of large amounts of data or hard drives -- one of the purposes 
              of the Advanced File System, which was specifically designed for 
              64-bit file systems. <i>Tru64 UNIX File System Administration Handbook</i> 
              is an exceptional addition to existing UNIX/Linux systems administration 
              references. Steven Hancock takes the time to thoroughly explain 
              what you need to effectively administer a Tru64 UNIX system and 
              why you need it. He also addresses some problems facing the Tru64 
              UNIX administrator (and UNIX administrators in general) and the 
              best ways to solve them. This is a superb book on a topic seldom 
              addressed for administrators.

            <p> The most effective way to explain anything starts with a common 
              denominator. It's important to describe it in terms that both 
              sides understand. Finding that shared vocabulary is the most challenging 
              part of the process. It is particularly difficult when the other 
              person understands the underlying concepts, although not in the 
              same language. This is the essential problem facing Windows NT or 
              Windows 2000 administrators trying to learn Linux. They are familiar 
              with many of the procedures, but not the individual commands that 
              Linux uses.
            <p> Minasi, York, and Hunt solve this problem by demonstrating where 
              Linux procedures differ from the Windows NT/2000 techniques and 
              by showing how Linux handles the same tasks that NT and 2000 can 
              also achieve. After Minasi's Overview, the authors address 
              the following topics: Why Learn About Linux?; What's in It 
              for Me?; What Do People Do with Linux?; How the Linux World Operates; 
              Getting Linux on Your System; Linux Hands-On: Doing Basic Things 
              with Linux; User Accounts and File Permissions; Desktop Linux: Handling 
              Graphics and GUI Applications; Setting Up Linux's Server Services; 
              Linux/Microsoft OS Interoperability; and Conclusions: Linux versus 
              Microsoft, Linux and Microsoft. The Appendix lists various types 
              of Linux resources. The accompanying CD-ROM includes Linux-Mandrake 
              7.1 plus additional server and workstation applications.
            <p> The amount of information contained in this book is amazing. The 
              authors not only delve into installation procedures, basic Linux 
              commands, installing new applications, and recompiling the kernel, 
              but they also present some of the history, the essence of Open Source, 
              plus how to use DNS, Apache, and FTP, to mention just a few of the 
              topics.
            <p> <i>Linux for Windows NT/2000 Administrators</i> (subtitled The 
              Secret Decoder Ring) is an extremely well-written book. Minasi, 
              York, and Hunt address the essential topics in a clear, straightforward 
              manner, utilizing numerous examples. This is a helpful book for 
              any administrator who needs to learn Linux or for a Linux administrator 
              faced with the task of integrating systems. <i>Linux for Windows 
              NT/2000 Administrators </i>will provide an excellent reference for 
              any administration library.

            <p> The Apache Web Server is unsurpassed in its popularity and reliability. 
              Anyone who installs, configures, or troubleshoots Apache installations 
              and configurations will discover that Engelschall's book an 
              indispensable tool. My initial reaction to this book is that I wished 
              I had it when I first installed Apache. However, Engelschall included 
              more than the configuration directives within this slim volume. 
              He begins with an Introduction that includes its history plus a 
              description of the Apache Group. Succeeding chapters explore Apache 
              Functionality; Building Apache; Configuring Apache; Running Apache; 
              and Apache Resources. Ideally, after reading this, you will know 
              its history and architecture, how to build and install it, how to 
              configure any and every directive and module, and where to look 
              for the most current references. Realistically, you will know where 
              to look to find all of the above information.
            <p> The <i>Apache Desktop Reference</i> is a superbly written and 
              well-organized book. The reader will know exactly where to look 
              for a specific topic, module, or directive without assistance from 
              the Index or Table of Contents. Engelschall's side notes are 
              humorous, informative, and insightful. If you are in charge of maintaining 
              an Apache configuration, or want to set one up, get this book! It 
              is an extraordinary guide to the Apache Web Server and the essential 
              instruction manual to any Apache configuration.
