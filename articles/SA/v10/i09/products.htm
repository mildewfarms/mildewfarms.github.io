            <p><b> iXsystems Inc. Releases Internet Server Appliance </b>
            <p> iXsystems Inc., formerly BSDi, released its first Internet server 
              appliance. The iXtreme Internet Hosting Server is a server appliance 
              that combines browser-based administration and an Internet operating 
              system in a 1U rack-optimized chassis. Service providers can choose 
              the processor, memory, and disk that best meet their needs and can 
              upgrade components as their businesses grow. 
            <p> According to the company, the iXtreme Internet Hosting Server's 
              browser-based administration interface is two-thirds the size of 
              conventional 1U servers and appliances. The iXtreme Internet Hosting 
              Server enables service providers to host sites on a single system, 
              and lets clients manage their own domains. The new server appliance 
              also has snap-in, snap-out components that minimize downtime. The 
              iXtreme Internet Hosting Server uses eight fans to cool the CPUs, 
              disk drive, and power supply. In its high-end configuration, the 
              iXtreme Internet Hosting Server Model 140S includes two Pentium 
              III processors and up to 4 GB of memory. 
            <p> The high-performance models 140 and 140S come in the 1U form factor 
              described above, and can be configured with dual Pentium III 1-GHz 
              processors and up to 4 GB of memory. Model 120 comes in a standard 
              1U form factor and features a single Intel Celeron 600-MHz processor 
              with support for up to 512 MB of memory. Model 140S features an 
              internal/external dual-channel Ultra 160 LVD SCSI controller. Prices 
              for the iXtreme Internet Hosting Server begin at $1400.

            <p> <b>Armored Networks Releases ArmoredServer</b> 
            <p> Armored Networks Corporation announced the release of ArmoredServer, 
              which addresses server protection issues at all layers: network, 
              operating system, application, configuration, and user. 
            <p> According to the company, ArmoredServer provides security modules 
              for each layer and additional security modules can be added to any 
              layer in the future. At the network layer, ArmoredServer provides 
              an access control mechanism (a system-level network firewall). Also 
              at the network layer, ArmoredServer monitors, displays, and logs 
              selected network traffic in real-time. At the operating system layer, 
              ArmoredServer provides a hardened kernel that tightens accesses 
              to system resources. 
            <p> At the server application layer, ArmoredServer imbeds security 
              codes in the applications to detect and defend against buffer overflow 
              attacks. Also at the application layer, ArmoredServer monitors the 
              server applications to stop any unauthorized server applications 
              from running, and restarts any authorized server applications that 
              failed. At the system configuration layer, ArmoredServer finds and 
              fixes existing vulnerabilities and insecure settings, as well as 
              monitors and enforces new settings. 
            <p> At the user layer, ArmoredServer provides a secure SSL-based browser 
              interface with many systems administration tools, including key 
              and certificates management that offers secure, ubiquitous remote 
              management of the server. 
            <p> ArmoredServer currently runs on Red Hat Linux version 6.1, 6.2, 
              and 7.0. Future releases of ArmoredServer are planned for Solaris 
              and Windows NT/2000. ArmoredServer for Linux is licensed annually, 
              including unlimited technical support and software upgrades. The 
              pricing starts at $595 per single CPU server. Site license and partner 
              discounts are available.

            <p> SANcastle Technologies has announced its first product offering, 
              the GFS-8. According to the company, this global fabric switch for 
              high-performance storage networks also translates IP protocols for 
              both Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) and Fibre Channel (FC). The GFS-8 is 
              a multi-protocol, full-function switch that integrates disparate 
              networks and protocols. 
            <p> For users who want to interconnect SAN islands, GFS-8 can be configured 
              to provide point-to-point SAN island integration across MANs or 
              WANs. It also supports e-port for inter-switch connectivity with 
              other Fibre Channel switches and autonomous region naming, and guarantees 
              delivery and order of packets. The ability to dynamically map VLAN 
              tagging into Fibre Channel zones enables users to segregate traffic 
              for management and security without increasing port counts or deploying 
              redundant infrastructures. For enterprises that have already deployed 
              Fibre Channel campus environments, the GFS-8 will support low-latency 
              IP and iSCSI traffic across their FC backbones. 
            <p> The switch will be priced between $32,000 and $38,000 depending 
              on port configuration. It can be configured with 1, 2, or 4 Gigabit 
              Ethernet ports and the remaining ports Fibre Channel.
