            <H1><img src="a5.gif" width="200" height="174" align="right">Why Energy 
              Consumption Matters</h1>
            <p> <i>Gilbert Held</i>
            <p> Serious energy problems are facing residents of California and 
              other western states. Commencing with utility companies reducing 
              voltage by a few percent during the summer of 2000 that resulted 
              in brownouts, the electrical situation rapidly deteriorated to rolling 
              blackouts during the beginning of the year 2001. With the summer 
              of 2001 upon us, it is apparent that both business and residential 
              electrical consumers will continue to face a challenging situation. 
              What may not be as apparent is that, as the cost of energy increases, 
              so does the need to examine the operational energy cost of computer 
              equipment during the equipment acquisition cycle. In this article, 
              I will review the manner by which energy is billed and explain why 
              a small change in the cost per kilowatt hour (kwh) can significantly 
              affect the operating cost of data center equipment. I will examine 
              the energy consumption of several general types of equipment and 
              note how a small difference in the consumption level can affect 
              the lifetime cost of equipment.
            <p> <b>Overview</b>
            <p> Consider the three key components that define an electrical circuit. 
              Those components are the current flowing through a circuit, the 
              voltage potential used to drive the current through the circuit, 
              and the resistance to the flow of electrons in the circuit. The 
              relationship between current (I), voltage (V), and resistance (R) 
              is given by Ohm's Law where:
            <p> 
            <p> I = V/R or V = R x I
            <p> 
            <p> The resistance unit is the ohm, while current and voltage are 
              expressed in terms of amperes and volts. As current flows through 
              a circuit, heat is generated based upon the current flow and resistance. 
              This heat represents the power expended due to resistance and is 
              expressed as:
            <p> 
            <p> P = IV = I2R = V2R
            <p> 
            <p> where P is expressed in watts. Because power is formally defined 
              as the rate at which work is performed, we would measure power expended 
              during a time interval (1 hour). Thus, a watt-hour is used to define 
              work performed by a device at a constant rate of 1 watt for a period 
              of 1 hour. Because the watt is inconveniently small, the kilowatt 
              (1kw = 1000w) and the megawatt (1mw = 1000kw = 1,000,000w) are more 
              commonly used. A kilowatt-hour (kwh) is the unit by which an electric 
              power company typically bills its consumers. It should be noted 
              that a kwh technically represents a unit of work or energy and not 
              a unit of power. Thus, the bill we receive each month for consuming 
              a certain number of kwh is for energy consumed.
            <p> <b>KWH Cost Variations</b>
            <p> The cost per kwh varies considerably from state to state and even 
              within a state based upon a number of factors. Those factors include 
              the cost of fuel used to generate electricity, the distance of a 
              power plant from the location of the fuel, property taxes the utility 
              pays to the local community, and a potential range of taxes the 
              ultimate consumer finds added to their monthly bill. The end result 
              is a cost per kwh that varies from approximately $.05 per kwh in 
              the Pacific Northwest where hydroelectric power generation represents 
              both a renewable and economical source of electric generation, to 
              over $.10 per kwh in the Northeastern portion of the United States 
              where generators primarily depend upon imported oil.
            <p> <b>24/7 Operations</b>
            <p> When I was growing up, my parents followed me around the house 
              turning off unneeded lights. Although we cannot walk around a modern 
              data center turning off servers, we can appreciate the need to compare 
              the operational costs of different devices.
            <p> Most devices in a modern data center operate almost continuously, 
              being turned off only for an upgrade, repair, or planned maintenance. 
              Equipment such as routers, hubs, access controllers, gateways, and 
              Web servers are normally referred to as 24/7 devices, indicating 
              that they operate all day, each day of the week. To illustrate the 
              energy operational cost of a 24/7 device, let us assume you install 
              a small server which typically consumes 250 watts of energy. On 
              an annual basis, excluding leap years, there are 8760 hours. Thus, 
              the server would consume 2,190,000 watt hours in a year. Because 
              utilities normally bill based upon kwh consumed, the electrical 
              bill would reflect the use of 2190 kwh.
            <p> If we assume the server is located in the Pacific Northwest, we 
              might be billed $.05 per kwh or $109.50 annually to keep the server 
              operating. However, several utilities in the Pacific Northwest had 
              to import energy and raise their rates between 20-40 percent.
            <p> At a more common rate of $.10 per kwh, operational cost of the 
              server doubles to $219 annually. The operational energy cost at 
              $.05 per kwh or $.10 per kwh may not appear significant on an individual 
              server basis for one year, but consider the rest of the story. To 
              obtain a bigger picture of the operational costs in the data center 
              we need to examine the cost of operating each device over its expected 
              life. For example, assume the server has an expected life of 4 years. 
              Then, at a cost of $.05 per kwh, the energy operational cost of 
              the server would be $109.50/year x 4 years or $438; at $.10 per 
              kwh, the cost would be $876 over 4 years. In fact, every penny per 
              kwh increase or decrease results in a change of $21.90 per year, 
              or $87.60 over the expected life of the server.
            <p> Note that the server for which we just computed several basic 
              energy operational costs would probably be classified as an entry-level 
              product. Thus, the one-time cost of this server (to include perhaps 
              50 to 100 GB of online storage) would be approximately $3000. Table 
              1 summarizes the energy operational costs for an entry-level server 
              and includes the one-time cost of the server for comparison.
            <p> In Table 1, note that the expected 4-year operational energy cost 
              approaches one-third of the purchase price of a low-end server. 
              Consider the increases in wholesale power prices during the first 
              few months of this year. During February 2001, California energy 
              costs averaged over $300 per megawatt hour at the wholesale level. 
              This is equivalent to $.30 per kwh and perhaps provides the key 
              reason why it is probably a matter of foregone conclusion that electricity 
              rates can be expected to increase. As they increase, the cost of 
              operating 24/7 devices within a data center will represent an ever 
              growing percentage of the purchase price of data center equipment.
            <p> <b>Facilitating the Cost Computation Process</b>
            <p> To facilitate the computation of the annual cost associated with 
              24/7 always-on equipment, a spreadsheet was used to determine the 
              relationship between watts consumed and cost per kilowatt hour on 
              the yearly operating cost of equipment (Table 2). The intersection 
              of a column and row in Table 2 indicates the annual cost for an 
              always-on device based upon its level of energy consumption and 
              cost per kwh. Through the use of this table, you can easily determine 
              the annual operational energy cost for devices that have a consumption 
              range outside of the wattage column or beyond the cost per kwh. 
              For example, assume your new server consumes 3700 watts and will 
              be installed in a data center where the cost per kwh is $.12. Note 
              that there is no $.12/kwh column nor is there a 3700 watt row. Thus, 
              you would first move along the 1000 watt row until it intersects 
              with the $.10/kwh column and note the annual energy cost is $876. 
              Multiplying by 3 results in an annual cost of $2528 for 3000 watts 
              at a cost of $.10/kwh. Noting that the operating cost for 700 watts 
              consumed is $613.20 on an annual basis at a cost of $.10/kwh, for 
              a total cost of $3,241.20, again at a cost of $.10/kwh. Now all 
              we need to do is multiply $3241.20 by 1.2 to compute the operational 
              energy cost at $.12/kwh instead of $.10 per kwh. Doing so results 
              in the operation energy cost becoming $3,889.44 when our organization's 
              bill for energy consumption is based on $.12/kwh for a high-end 
              server with RAID disks that consume 3700 watts. See Table 2.
            <p> <b>Examining Equipment</b>
            <p> If you carefully examine your data center equipment, you may notice 
              a label on many devices stating their power supply value in watts. 
              That value typically represents the maximum energy load the power 
              supply will consume, but not its steady state rate of energy consumption. 
              Engineers designing equipment typically use a power supply that 
              is between 20 and 30 percent beyond the device's steady-state 
              condition. However, before celebrating that the actual cost to operate 
              your server farm may be less than expected, you also need to consider 
              the heat dissipation of your equipment.
            <p> Every device that consumes energy generates heat, which explains 
              the need for fans in many types of computer and communications products. 
              The literature for routers, gateways, access controllers, and servers 
              may contain a heat dissipation figure for each device. That heat 
              dissipation is given in terms of British Thermal Units (BTUs) per 
              hour, where the BTU was originally defined as the energy required 
              to raise the temperature of one pound (.45 kg) of water one degree 
              Fahrenheit (F) from a temperature of 59.5&deg; F to 60.5&deg; 
              F. (There is now a more formal definition because the amount of 
              energy required to heat water differs based upon the current temperature 
              of water.)
            <p> You or your air-conditioning engineer probably had to compute 
              the BTUs generated by equipment when the tonnage of the building's 
              air conditioner was sized. Thus, the heat generated by servers, 
              routers, gateways, and other devices must be removed from the data 
              center. Due to this, the air-conditioning system has to work harder, 
              which increases the cost of maintaining the building.
            <p> Instead of becoming immersed in computations, simply consider 
              the cost of operating each device and the cost of removing heat 
              generated by the device by using the heat dissipation value. This 
              simplification works well for most locations, since during the winter 
              the extra heat can be recirculated in many buildings. However, if 
              your data center is located in a hot and humid location, you may 
              need to reexamine the heat dissipation as a separate entity.
            <p> <b>Considering a Total Acquisition Cost</b>
            <p> Until recently, when we evaluated the acquisition of such equipment 
              as routers, gateways, and servers, we focused on functionality and 
              purchase price. If we examined products from two or more vendors 
              and only one vendor provided the functions and features required 
              by our organization, life was simple and we would justify what was 
              a sole-source procurement request. If two or more products satisfied 
              our requirements, we would then turn our attention to the one-time 
              cost of the equipment, assuming we were only considering purchasing 
              and such additional costs as shipping and annual maintenance. Because 
              most data center managers might have a single line item for utilities, 
              rarely did organizations use the operational energy cost as a factor 
              in considering products from different vendors. However, over the 
              past few years, the growth in the use of the Internet has resulted 
              in server farms that may consume more than 4 percent of all electricity 
              generated in the United States. When you add in the basic Internet 
              infrastructure of routers, hubs, access controllers, etc., conservative 
              estimates place the Internet as responsible for more than 6 percent 
              of all energy consumed. As energy consumption increased, the not-in-my-backyard 
              (NIMBY) syndrome against building power-generation plants resulted 
              in an energy surplus migrating into a shortage in many locations, 
              with the cost per kwh beginning to significantly increase. As the 
              cost per kwh jumps by 20 to 30 percent or more annually, it now 
              becomes important to consider the operational energy cost of products 
              as they are being acquired. Thus, I will now focus on how we can 
              use the operational energy cost as decision criteria in an equipment-acquisition 
              process.
            <p> For that sake of simplicity, we will use the old illustrative 
              standby of Vendor X and Vendor Y for comparison purposes, comparing 
              the total cost of ownership of a medium-range server from each company. 
              We will also assume that both vendors provide equipment that satisfies 
              our basic organizational requirements. Assume we examined the financial 
              aspects of each server and recorded relevant information, as indicated 
              in Table 3.
            <p> Based upon the initial financial comparison of servers from Vendors 
              X and Y, it appears that Vendor Y provides a lower total cost of 
              ownership, but does it? Table 3 does not reflect the cost of operating 
              the equipment. Assume we contacted each vendor and determined that 
              the server from Vendor X consumes 2800 watts while the server from 
              Vendor Y consumes 3300 watts and the cost of electricity is $.10 
              per kwh. What affect does this difference in energy consumption 
              have upon the total cost of ownership of each server?
            <p> At an energy consumption level of 2.8 kw, the server from Vendor 
              X consumes 2.8 kw x 8760 hours/year, or 24528 kwh per year. At a 
              cost of $.10 per kwh, the operational energy cost to keep the server 
              from Vendor X ticking on a 24/7 schedule would be $2,452.80. For 
              the server from Vendor Y, the consumption of 3600 watts results 
              in the consumption of 3.6 kw x 8760 hours/year, or 31536 kwh. Using 
              a cost of $.10 per kwh, the annual charge to keep the server from 
              Vendor Y running would be 31536 kwh x $.10/kwh, or $3,153.60. On 
              a 4-year life cycle, the cost for the server from Vendor X becomes 
              $2,452.80/year x 4 years, or $9,811.20, while the 4-year cost for 
              powering the server from Vendor Y becomes $3,153.60/year x 4 years 
              or $12,614.40.
            <p> If we now add the energy operating cost for each server to the 
              total cost shown in Table 3, we obtain a more valid life-cycle cost. 
              Thus, the Vendor X life-cycle cost becomes $33,411.20, while the 
              Vendor Y life-cycle cost becomes $35,084.40. Note that although 
              it initially appeared that the server from Vendor Y was a more economical 
              purchase, when we considered the energy consumption level of each 
              device, Vendor X had a lower life-cycle cost. While the 4-year difference 
              is only $1,673.20 in this example, if you were acquiring several 
              servers, the cost difference would become more meaningful. Additionally, 
              do you believe the cost of electricity will not continue to rise 
              in the future? If you, like me, expect the cost to increase, then 
              it is reasonable to consider that cost in your acquisition process.
