            <p><i> In last month's issue, we had a question regarding the 
              differences between SAN and NAS. The answer given had the explanations 
              of the two reversed. NAS (like NetApp) are storage devices attached 
              to the network and SAN (like EMC) are storage devices attached to 
              a computer via fiber/SCSI. We regret any confusion resulting from 
              this error </i>--<i> the editors.</i> 
            <p><i> </i><b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to put 
              a Perl script into my <b>.forward</b> to handle a bunch of spam 
              that I get. My <b>.forward</b> looks like the following: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
|/home/jr/scripts/spamcull.pl
</pre>
            When I get mail, I receive a message stating "Service Unavailable". 
            Is there some other way I should be calling the script from my <b>.forward</b>? 
            I'm using Red Hat Linux 6.2. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You may want to consider something 
              like Procmail (<b>http://www.procmail.org/</b>) to do spam culling 
              for you instead of trying to roll your own script. <b>procmail</b> 
              is a powerful recipe-based filter that you can stick in as the LDA 
              or call from <b>.forward</b>. As to why you're getting "Service 
              Unavailable", this sounds like it may be a <b>smrsh</b> problem. 
              Are you using <b>smrsh</b> in conjunction with Sendmail? If so, 
              you may need to symlink your script into your <b>smrsh</b> directory 
              (often <b>/etc/smrsh</b> or <b>/etc/mail/smrsh</b>). 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I want to write a quick Perl script 
              that takes a bunch of file names, reads them in, and stores them. 
              I know how to do this sequentially, but it seems like this would 
              be the right place to put in a function. Is there a quick "read 
              and assign" function to which you can point me? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You'll want to iterate through 
              a loop of file names and perhaps do an array of arrays for the actual 
              assignments in the main loop. Your read/assign function will probably 
              look something like the following, however: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
sub readfile {
  my ($fname) = shift;  # name of the file, passed from the main loop
  local (*FILEH);       # the file handle

  open (FILEH, $fname) || die "Can't open $fname: $!\n"; # open or die
  my (@filea) = &lt;FILEH&gt;;      # read in the file to an array
  close (FILEH);              # close the file
  return @filea;              # return the array
}

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> What does <b>rc</b> stand for in a 
            UNIX context? Does it stand for run-level command or run command, 
            or something like that? Is there any authoritative documentation? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> I'd consider Brian Kernighan 
              and Dennis Ritchie fairly authoritative, and the UNIX FAQ (<b>http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/faq/part1/</b>) has the following to say: 
            <p> rc (as in ".cshrc" or "/etc/rc") = "RunCom" 
            <p> "rc" derives from "runcom", from the MIT CTSS 
              system, ca. 1965. 
            <p> "There was a facility that would execute a bunch of commands 
              stored in a file; it was called "runcom" for "run 
              commands", and the file began to be called "a runcom." 
            <p> "rc" in Unix is a fossil from that usage." 
            <p> Brian Kernighan &amp; Dennis Ritchie, as told to Vicki Brown 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We are using <b>jumpstart</b> 
              to automate our Solaris installs. At the end, the <b>jumpstart</b> 
              finish script installs a script that runs after reboot to install 
              the custom software packages via executing <b>pkgadd</b> commands. 
              These <b>pkgadd</b> commands in turn have pre- and post-install 
              scripts and want to interact with the installer. When trying to 
              install, the <b>pkgadd</b> has errors and fail because the pre- 
              and post-install scripts don't get that user interaction. Do 
              you know how I could automate this? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can have <b>pkgadd</b> use 
              an alternate administrative file and do installs without manual 
              intervention. Your <b>pkgadd</b> command will look something like 
              the following: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
pkgadd -n -a $adminfile $package
</pre>
            <b>$adminfile</b> will be another file in your <b>jumpstart</b> setup 
            that contains the following text (or you can tailor to taste): 
            <p> 
            <pre>
mail=
instance=quit
partial=nocheck
runlevel=nocheck
idepend=nocheck
rdepend=nocheck
space=ask
setuid=nocheck
conflict=nocheck
action=nocheck
basedir=default
</pre>
            This gives the <b>pkgadd</b> command all the answers it needs to do 
            the installation without intervention, unless you don't have 
            enough space. The default administration file is located in <b>/var/sadm/install/admin/default</b>, 
            and specifies <b>ask</b> for most of the above questions: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
mail=
instance=unique
partial=ask
runlevel=ask
idepend=ask
rdepend=ask
space=ask
setuid=ask
conflict=ask
action=ask
basedir=default
</pre>
            See the man page for <b>pkgadd(1M)</b> for more information on the 
            available flags, and <b>admin(4)</b> for more information on the parameters 
            in the admin file. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a script that I want to 
              run unattended, but occasionally it may prompt the user for input. 
              I'm never sure how many times it will prompt (it changes based 
              on the OS it's running on), but the answer should always be 
              "yes". Is there an easy way to automate this so that no 
              one has to sit at the window and input "yes" at random 
              times? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If your answer should always 
              be yes, it sounds like you may just be better off removing the conditions 
              from the script. However, there are a couple ways you can automate 
              this. For flexibility's sake (in case you ever want to answer 
              "no" or something else), you could wrap your script with 
              <b>expect</b>. If you're sure you're always going to say 
              "yes", you can just pipe the output of the <b>yes</b> 
              program to your script: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
yes yes | ./script
</pre>
            The <b>yes</b> program takes an argument that it will continuously 
            print out. If you don't give it an argument, it will continuously 
            print out the letter "y". 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> How can I tell which Perl modules 
              I have installed with my Perl distribution? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can get a complete listing 
              of the third-party modules installed by doing a: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
perldoc perllocal
</pre>
            The output should list the module name, where it was installed, the 
            linktype, the version, and any executable files. Here's an example 
            for CPAN: 
            <p> 
            <pre>

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to set up <b>fetchmail</b> 
            to retrieve mail from an ISP account via IMAP, but it seems to want 
            Sendmail running on the local machine. I don't really want to 
            open up Sendmail to the outside world because it's an unnecessary 
            security risk (since I'm just pulling down mail from other places 
            and not actually accepting SMTP requests from the outside world). 
            Is there a way to use <b>fetchmail</b> without enabling an MTA? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> <b>fetchmail</b> must have an 
              MTA to connect to in order to deliver your mail. What you can do 
              is bind Sendmail to the loopback interface only, and not your public 
              (or private) interface. In your <b>fetchmailrc</b> file, set the 
              following so that <b>fetchmail</b> tries to connect to the loopback 
              interface instead of another interface on your machine. It should 
              try the loopback interface anyway if you're not using ETRN, 
              ODMR, or Kerberos <b>auth</b> (where the domain name is added), 
              but it doesn't hurt to explicitly set it here: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
smtphost 127.0.0.1
</pre>
            In your Sendmail <b>mc</b> file, add the following lines: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
FEATURE(`no_default_msa')dnl
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Name=MTA',`Addr=127.0.0.1')dnl
</pre>
            This makes it so that the daemon will only answer on the loopback 
            interface, and it deletes the default entry for MSA. Be sure to rebuild 
            your <b>cf</b> file and test it before putting it into place. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> On a Solaris 7 SPARC machine, 
              how do I increase the security of the TCP random number generator? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you're talking about 
              the way selected TCP ports are randomized, you want to change the 
              file <b>/etc/default/inetinit</b> to be the following: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
# @(#)inetinit.dfl 1.2 97/05/08
#
# TCP_STRONG_ISS sets the TCP initial sequence number generation 
# parameters.
# Set TCP_STRONG_ISS to be:
#     0 = Old-fashioned sequential initial sequence number generation.
#     1 = Improved sequential generation, with random variance in increment.
#     2 = RFC 1948 sequence number generation, unique-per-connection-ID.
#
TCP_STRONG_ISS=2
</pre>
            If you're talking about random number generation in general, 
            64-bit Solaris doesn't have a <b>/dev/random</b> or a <b>/dev/urandom</b>, 
            so you would want to install something third party or freeware like 
            <b>egd</b> (which I've had problems with because it doesn't 
            generate enough entropy to run both OpenSSL and OpenSSH), <b>prngd</b>, 
            or <b>ANDIrand</b>. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> For security purposes, I want 
              to track down all of the world-writable files on my AIX system. 
              How would I go about this? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The best tool for this is <b>find</b>. 
              You can search for world-writable files with the following command 
              (you should be root or you'll receive a lot of "permission 
              denied" errors): 
            <p> 
            <pre>
find / -type f -perm +0002 -print
</pre>
            If you want to look for group-writable files as well, you can do: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
find / -type f -perm +0022 -print
</pre>
            You may also want to look for SUID and SGID executables while you're 
            at it. Take a look at the man page for more information on <b>find</b>. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an Ultra 10 running Solaris 
              8. When I take a look at the routing table, I see a lot of routes 
              that are seemingly useless. If I flush the routing table, most of 
              them disappear but then come back again later. There's obviously 
              something messing with the routing table. What is it, and how do 
              I stop it? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There are two likely candidates 
              for your problem. Solaris comes with two binaries that may start 
              at boot time and will edit your routing table on the fly -- 
              <b>in.routed</b> and <b>in.rdisc</b>. You can shut off routed by 
              giving your machine an explicit default route in <b>/etc/defaultrouter</b>. 
              The router discovery daemon (rdisc) is started if you have multiple 
              interfaces not configured by DHCP. You can turn it off by touching 
              the file <b>/etc/notrouter</b>. Both of these processes are started 
              as part of <b>/etc/init.d/inetinit</b> (hard-linked to by <b>/etc/rc2.d/S69inet</b>). 
              Take a look at the man pages for <b>in.rdisc</b>, <b>in.routed</b>, 
              and <b>defaultrouter</b> and the <b>/etc/init.d/inetinit</b> script 
              for more information. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running Sendmail 8.11.3, 
              and I'm seeing a huge number of Sendmail processes sending 
              mail outbound. Is there some way I can cut down on the number of 
              processes Sendmail forks? This is killing my poor machine. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can limit the number of daemon 
              children with <b>MaxDaemonChildren</b>. You'll probably also 
              want to queue all outgoing mail and then run the queue to deliver 
              mail. This will order your processes sequentially instead of forking 
              for every new outbound mail delivery. Add the following to your 
              <b>mc</b> file and rebuild your <b>cf</b> file (adjust the maximum 
              number of processes and the minimum queue age to suit your machine): 
            <p> 
            <pre>
define(`confMAX_DAEMON_CHILDREN',`10')dnl
define(`confDELIVERY_MODE',`queueonly')dnl
define(`confMIN_QUEUE_AGE',`10m')dnl
</pre>
            The <b>MinQueueAge</b> macro defines the time between delivery attempts 
            of any one message. So, if your message can't be delivered the 
            first time around, it waits another 10 minutes in this case (default 
            is 30 minutes). Tweak this variable to taste, depending on whether 
            you have a lot of transient delivery issues. 
            <p> When you start Sendmail, you'll want to run the queue at 
              some frequent interval (say every 10 minutes), so your mail doesn't 
              sit on your machine for too long: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
sendmail -q10m -bd
</pre>
            The <b>-bd</b> is optional if you're not running a daemon (e.g., 
            you're only sending mail out, not accepting mail). 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running a 4.3-Release 
              FreeBSD machine. Hooked to it is an Overland Data Loader Express 
              DLT Tape Library. I can access whatever tape I happen to load manually. 
              Is there any way to have it automatically load a specific tape? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You'll want to take a look 
              at the man page for <b>chio</b>. This should handle most generic 
              loaders. For example, you can move slot 2 to drive 0, do a dump 
              of <b>/</b>, <b>/usr</b>, <b>/var</b>, and <b>/home</b>, and then 
              move the tape back out to its original slot with the following commands: 
            <p> 
            <pre>

            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You don't actually have 
              to remove Sendmail. Later versions of FreeBSD have a <b>config</b> 
              file called <b>/etc/mail/mailer.conf</b> that determines what binary 
              gets called when the following programs are run: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
sendmail
send-mail
mailq
newaliases
</pre>
            Install <b>postfix</b> from the ports collection as root and configure 
            to your liking: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
cd /usr/ports/mail/postfix
make install
</pre>
            If you aren't familiar with the ports collection, take a look 
            at the packages and ports section of the FreeBSD Handbook: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO_8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html
</pre>
            Once you have <b>postfix</b> working the way you want, change <b>/etc/mail/mailer.conf</b> 
            to point to your <b>postfix</b> binary (usually installed in <b>/usr/libexec/postfix</b>) 
            instead of the Sendmail binary. You may also want to edit <b>/etc/make.conf</b> 
            so that future upgrades of FreeBSD do not upgrade Sendmail as well: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
NO_SENDMAIL=yes
</pre>
            You may also want to take Sendmail out of <b>/etc/rc.conf</b>, depending 
            on how you plan on running <b>postfix</b> (or at least change the 
            Sendmail options): 
            <p> 
            <pre>
sendmail_enable="NO"
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an old Sun IPX running Solaris 
            2.5.1 with the recommended patch set from 05/04/2001. I'm seeing 
            some weirdness when I do an <b>ls</b> or a <b>ps</b>. An <b>ls</b> 
            shows no files at all (as if the filesystem is completely invisible), 
            and <b>ps</b> claims it can't execute. Here's some real 
            output: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
$ echo "this is a test" &gt; foo
$ ls foo
$
$ cat foo
this is a test
$ mv foo bar
$ ls bar
$
</pre>
            So, I did a <b>ps</b> to see what was going on, and I got: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
$ ps -elf
/usr/local/bin/bash: ps: cannot execute
</pre>
            However, <b>/usr/ucb/ps</b> works just fine. Have you seen anything 
            like this before? Did the system somehow manage to get corrupted? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It looks as though you've 
              been hacked and someone has installed an improperly implemented 
              rootkit. Instead of just hiding some files with <b>ls</b>, it's 
              hiding them all, and instead of hiding some processes with <b>ps</b>, 
              it's just refusing to execute (probably installed with the 
              wrong permissions). You'll want to find out how they broke 
              in, when they broke in, and restore from known backups and patch 
              from there. I hope you've been doing some sort of security 
              monitoring all along, or it's going to be very difficult to 
              track down the hole and fix it. You may just be better off upgrading 
              to Solaris 7 (the IPX isn't supported for Solaris 8) and restoring 
              only your data. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to script some 
              <b>jumpstart</b> stuff to comment out lines in a Solaris startup 
              file. The text of the file looks something like: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
echo "Setting default...
&lt;some other lines&gt;
    -netmask 240
</pre>
            I want to comment out all the lines in between those two lines. I 
            can't use Perl because the <b>jumpstart</b> stuff all has to 
            be done in bourne shell. Any clues? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can use <b>sed</b> to do 
              this if you have unique begin and end strings in the file. Try the 
              following (where <b>$file</b> is the file you want to modify): 
            <p> 
            <pre>
sed -e '/^echo "Setting default/,/^    -netmask 240/ s/^/#/' \
 &lt; $file &gt; /tmp/newfile
cp /tmp/newfile $file
rm -f /tmp/newfile
</pre>
            If you'd rather just delete the lines instead of commenting them 
            out, you can do: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
sed -e '/^echo "Setting default/,/^ -netmask 240/d' \
 &lt; $file &gt; /tmp/newfile cp /tmp/newfile $file rm -f /tmp/newfile
 </pre>
