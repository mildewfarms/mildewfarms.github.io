            <p> Examples, integration, and certification are the keywords to describe 
              this month's column and the reviews. I've included reviews 
              of an entire book of examples, a book that describes integration 
              procedures, and a certification guide for HP-UX. The specific reviews 
              include: <i>Java Examples in a Nutshell</i>, Second Edition by David 
              Flanagan (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.); <i>Integrate Linux 
              Solutions into Your Windows Network</i> by Dustin Puryear (Prima 
              Tech); and <i>HP Certified: HP-UX System Administration</i> by Rafeeq 
              Ur Rehman (Hewlett-Packard Professional Books, Prentice Hall).

            <p> One of the most effective ways to learn a new skill, whether it 
              is the design and creation of a stained glass window or of a computer 
              program, is through the use of examples. This reliable method demonstrates 
              the processes to use and factors to consider during each phase. 
              Following an example is a prelude to independently utilizing any 
              newly acquired craft or knowledge. In <i>Java Examples in a Nutshell</i>, 
              author David Flanagan devotes an entire book to different types 
              of examples using Java. The original edition was created as a supplement 
              to the <i>Java in a Nutshell </i>book. The second edition, also 
              subtitled <i>A Tutorial Companion to Java in a Nutshell</i>, presents 
              updated examples for Java 2, Version 1.3. Flanagan also included 
              some new chapters and has reorganized and expanded the existing 
              material. 
            <p> The second edition features three major sections: Core Java APIs, 
              Graphics and GUIs, and Enterprise Java. The initial part, Core Java 
              APIs, addresses the fundamental topics in the following order: Java 
              Basics; Objects, Classes, and Interfaces; Input/Output; Threads; 
              Networking; Security and Cryptography; Internationalization; Reflection; 
              and Object Serialization. In Part II: Graphics and GUIs, the author 
              provides examples and exercises relating to: Graphical User Interfaces, 
              Graphics, Printing, Data Transfer, Java Beans, and Applets. Enterprise 
              Java features Remote Method Invocation, Database Access with SQL, 
              Servlets and JSP, XML, and an Example Index. The Example Index Chapter, 
              the XML chapter (also available online at <b>http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jenut2/chapter/chap19.html</b>), 
              and The Servlets and JSP chapter are new additions. 
            <p> <i>Java Examples in a Nutshell</i> actually complements three 
              books: <i>Java in a Nutshell</i>, <i>Java Foundation Classes in 
              a Nutshell</i>, and <i>Java Enterprise in a Nutshell</i>. Flanagan 
              introduces the topic or topics within each chapter, provides essential 
              information about them, illustrates how to implement the concepts 
              through programming examples, and concludes each chapter with exercises. 
              (The examples can also be accessed online to reduce both typing 
              time and errors.) <i>Java Examples in a Nutshell</i> features useful 
              examples, from filtering lines of text or character streams to a 
              clock applet and image processing. This is an excellent book and 
              a superb learning aid for Java programmers at every level.

            <p> Today's networks may employ a diverse collection of computers 
              and operating systems. One or more computers running Linux, UNIX, 
              Windows, Novell, and Macintosh are often combined within a single 
              network structure. The systems administrator's job is to seamlessly 
              integrate the different platforms for printing, sharing peripherals, 
              and sharing files with optimum performance and a minimum of user 
              inconvenience. (That's why administrators are also known as 
              magicians.) In <i>Integrate Linux Solutions into Your Windows Networks</i>, 
              author/administrator/magician Dustin Puryear examines the concepts 
              and implementations related to maintaining multiple platforms within 
              a network. Although Puryear specifically addresses Linux and the 
              Windows environment, he also describes each topic in general terms, 
              so that the discussions are also applicable to non-Windows systems. 
            <p> The author approaches the various aspects of integration through 
              four sections: Part I: Knowing, Using, and Configuring Linux; Part 
              II: File and Print Services; Part III: Networking and Security Services; 
              and Part IV: Databases and Dynamic Web Sites. The Appendix contains 
              the GNU General Public License. Part I: Knowing Using, and Configuring 
              Linux includes Getting to Know Linux, Using Linux, and Understanding 
              Linux Administration. (Puryear does not include specific installation 
              instructions; they will differ depending on the selected distribution.) 
              The information provided in these chapters could easily comprise 
              a smaller book on configuration options. The author presents bottom-line 
              analyses of computer hardware plus operating systems comparisons, 
              noting their strengths and weaknesses. He also describes the components 
              of the Linux operating system, encompassing the file system, memory 
              and process control, and TCP/IP services and networking. Puryear 
              details and demonstrates BASH (the Bourne Again Shell) programming 
              and techniques plus the fundamentals of Linux systems administration. 
            <p> Part II: File and Print Services discusses Samba installation, 
              configuration, features, and use through: Integrating Windows and 
              Linux SMB/CIFS Services Using Samba; Using Samba for Windows Access 
              Control, Files, and Printers; and Introducing Advanced Samba Services 
              and Techniques. Puryear explains the Samba essentials plus some 
              of its more advanced capabilities and troubleshooting methods. In 
              Part III: Networking and Security Services, the author describes 
              Securing Your Network with Linux, Enabling Secure Remote Access 
              and PPP Networking, and Offering Electronic Mail and Directory Services. 
              Through the content in these chapters, the reader easily progresses 
              from good security practices to firewall construction, secure remote 
              access using OpenSSH, electronic mail basics and configurations, 
              and Directory Services. In the final section, Part IV: Databases 
              and Dynamic Web Sites, the author explores Serving Up Databases 
              with MySQL, Offering Web Services, and Creating Web-Based Applications 
              and Dynamic Sites. Puryear outlines MySQL installation and administration 
              procedures and demonstrates how to create and modify MySQL databases. 
              In the Offering Web Services chapter, the author discusses the installation, 
              configuration, and features of the Apache Web Server. He also creates 
              a sample server configuration and presents some useful tools. The 
              final chapter introduces PHP and explains how to use it plus how 
              to combine PHP and MySQL for a Web site. 
            <p> <i>Integrate Linux Solutions into Your Windows Network</i> by 
              Dustin Puryear is a superb book. The author presents each topic's 
              concepts, describes how it works, and shows how to implement it 
              through a step-by-step procedure. The contents of the book are wonderfully 
              complete, covering almost every topic that an administrator could 
              possibly need. Puryear augments his straightforward textual descriptions 
              with numerous notes, diagrams, figures, tables, and examples. The 
              result is an excellent book and reference for anyone integrating 
              systems, contemplating integration, or curious about how different 
              platforms can work together.

            <p> The quest for system certifications continues to be a popular 
              education option. Whether the system is Solaris, Linux, or HP-UX, 
              certification can be a quick way to convey familiarity and knowledge 
              of a system. Additionally, most certification books (ignoring the 
              questions and sample quizzes designed to help anyone gain certification) 
              provide excellent resources and references for routine tasks. In 
              <i>HP Certified</i>, Rehman has compiled and organized the information 
              required for Hewlett-Packard's three part System Administration 
              exam (3H0-002). He presents the topics covered by the tests, describes 
              what they entail and how they work, and structures each chapter 
              to conclude with a chapter summary, chapter review questions, and 
              sample test questions entitled Test Your Knowledge. The Preface 
              also includes How to Register for the HP-UX Certification Examination 
              and Strategies for Taking the Test. The author approaches the different 
              aspects covered by the examinations through three major sections: 
              Part I: Fundamentals of UNIX Systems, Part II: HP-UX System Administration, 
              and Part III: HP-UX Network Administration. 
            <p> The first section discusses basic UNIX concepts and procedures. 
              The individual chapters detail: Getting Started with UNIX, Working 
              with Files and Directories, Environment Variables, Input/Output 
              Redirection and Pipes, Using the vi Editor, Regular Expressions, 
              File Permissions, UNIX File System Hierarchy, Working with the POSIX 
              Shell and Job Control, Introduction to Shell Programming, and Advanced 
              Shell Programming. The second section, Part II: HP-UX System Administration, 
              examines the processes specific to systems administration and HP-UX 
              systems through the following chapters: The System Administration 
              Manager (SAM), Installing HP-UX, System Startup and Shutdown, Software 
              and Patch Management, Reconfiguring the HP-UX Kernel, Peripheral 
              Devices, HP-UX File Systems and Logical Volume Manager (LVM), User 
              and Group Management, Dealing with HP-UX Processes, Printing on 
              HP-UX, Memory and Swap Space Management, System Backup and Recovery, 
              Automating Jobs, and System Performance Monitoring. Although all 
              three sections of the book are important, this is the most HP-UX-intensive 
              section. Rehman not only addresses the greatest number of topics, 
              but he also explains the subjects that are unique in some way to 
              HP-UX. 
            <p> Part III: HP-UX Network Administration, analyzes networking fundamentals, 
              theories, and implementations through: Basic Network Concepts, Network 
              Components and Topologies, Introduction to the TCP/IP Protocol, 
              Configuring LAN Interface Adapters, Configuring and Managing ARPA/Berkeley 
              Services, Host Name Resolution and Domain Name Server, Configuring 
              and Managing NIS, Configuring and Managing the Network File System, 
              HP-UX Automounter, Network Time Protocol, and System and Network 
              Administration: Final Thoughts. The Appendices contain: A) Chapter 
              Review Answers, B) Test Your Knowledge Answers, C) HP-UX Command 
              and Configuration Files, and D) Sample HP-UX Certification Exam. 
            <p> <i>HP Certified</i> by Rafeeq Ur Rehman provides an important 
              guide to the HP-UX certification procedures and tests for systems 
              administration. The author demonstrates the information covered 
              by each of the three tests and provides test questions and situations 
              as exercises for the reader. Rehman establishes an excellent study 
              regimen, with sample questions and tests to ensure successful certification 
              results.
