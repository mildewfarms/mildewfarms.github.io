            <p> <i>Jim McKinstry and Amy Rich</i>
            <p> Here's a problem and solution that was sent to me by Bryce 
              Nutter and Steve Harad of u1.net in Marlton, New Jersey. Please 
              keep these coming. Thanks -- Jim.
            <p> We are running Solaris 2.5.1 with the latest patches on a Sun 
              UE4500, with a Sun 5200 storage array, six 9-GB disks, and are running 
              Veritas 3.0.3 with DMP. DMP is Dynamic Multi-Pathing, which provides 
              host bus adapter failover, as well as load balancing across the 
              host bus adapters. We ran a test where we did a <b>tar</b> of a 
              large filesystem that was on the 5200 array. We pulled the fiber 
              connection from the storage array while the <b>tar</b> was running. 
              The time to "find and take" the alternate path was consistently 
              40-50 seconds; we tested this a half a dozen times. Our question 
              was: Why is DMP taking so long to failover to the alternate path?
            <p> We tried setting the DMP restore interval (<b>vxdmpadm start restore 
              interval=10</b>) to 10, 30, 60, and 500 seconds. These values had 
              no effect on the failover time. It was always 40-50 seconds. This 
              makes sense because this value defines the restore time. When we 
              plugged the fiber connection back in, it took <b>interval</b> seconds 
              to re-enable the path.
            <p> We worked with Sun, Veritas, and asked Jim McKinstry. The general 
              consensus is that it does take at least a minute for it to failover. 
              The reason is that the lost connection is not detected until the 
              I/O request times out. This can be a "long" time. The 
              error detection is passive (i.e., the DMP software does not actively 
              poll devices for errors. It waits for I/Os to timeout and then searches 
              for the failover device). Check the kernel driver for your FC card. 
              It should have a timeout parameter. Don't set it too low or 
              you will failover every time there is contention on the card/bus, 
              which would really degrade your progress.
            <p> The details, based on the message logs, are as follows: When the 
              cable is pulled, the <b>ssd</b> driver fails the I/O. This is normal 
              and the I/O is retried:
            <p> 
            <pre>    WARNING: /sbus@2,0/SUNW,socal@d,10000/sf@1,0/ssd@w21000020376fd7a1,0 (ssd13):
     SCSI transport failed: reason 'tran_err': retrying command</pre>
            Almost 50 seconds later, the device drivers that maintain connectivity 
            with the array try to re-establish the link and finally give up. The 
            devices on that loop are "offlined":
            <p> 
            <pre>    WARNING: /sbus@2,0/SUNW,socal@d,10000/sf@1,0 (sf1):
    Offlining AL-PA 0xe0. Reason: Marked (OFL_RSN)</pre>
            At virtually the same time, the disk device driver identifies the 
            queued I/Os as failed:
            <p> 
            <pre>    WARNING: /sbus@2,0/SUNW,socal@d,10000/sf@1,0/ssd@w21000020376fd7a1,0 (ssd13):
    1381 Oct 17 11:23:10 depd52 unix: requeue of command fails (fffffffe)
    1382</pre>
            Also, at the same time, the disk device driver rejects the transport 
            request. At this point, the DMP driver does the failover. The failover 
            is almost instantaneous:
            <p> 
            <pre>    WARNING: /sbus@2,0/SUNW,socal@d,10000/sf@1,0/ssd@w21000020376fd7a1,0 (ssd13):
    transport rejected (-2)
    NOTICE: vxvm:vxdmp: disabled path 118/0x68 belonging to the dmpnode 130/0x38
    NOTICE: vxdmp: Path failure on 118/108^</pre>
            Because our applications can not wait over 40 seconds for an I/O to 
            complete, it looks like we will not be able to use DMP for failover. 
            We will probably go with a split-loop configuration and mirror across 
            the loops. Unfortunately, we will be giving up the performance benefits 
            of the DMP load balancing.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm looking for a tool to 
              generate random pronounceable passwords so that it's easier 
              for users to remember them. Is there a tool out there that will 
              do this?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The problem with pronounceable 
              passwords is that they're usually all alphabetic characters 
              (no numbers or symbols). This makes your passwords easier to crack, 
              but it's certainly better than having your users set their 
              passwords to dictionary words. A Java password generator (along 
              with source) can be found at <b>http://www.best.com/~thvv/gpw.html</b>. 
              This password generator is based on Morrie Gasser's password 
              generator.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> How do I change the speed of my 
              Ethernet card on an Ultra 1?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Let's assume, for example, 
              that you want to force full duplex (FDX) at 100 MB on hme0. Using 
              <b>ndd</b> will temporarily change settings till the next reboot, 
              and you can put lines into <b>/etc/system</b> to make it persist 
              through reboots.
            <p> First, choose hme0:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ndd -set /dev/hme instance 0
</pre>
            Set it to 100 MB, full duplex:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ndd -set /dev/hme adv_100fdx_cap 1
</pre>
            <p> Next, make it so that the card does not auto-negotiate:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ndd -set /dev/hme adv_autoneg_cap 0  
</pre>
            <p> When we modify <b>/etc/system</b>, this will apply to all <b>hme</b> 
              interfaces:
            <p> 
            <pre>
set hme:hme_adv_100fdx_cap=1
set hme:hme_adv_100T4_cap=0
set hme:hme_adv_autoneg_cap=0
</pre>
            <p> If each <b>hme</b> interface must be set separately, then you 
              must modify <b>/kernel/drv/hme.conf</b>. The settings in this file 
              override those in <b>/etc/system</b>.
            <p> First, use <b>prtconf -v | less</b> and find the section that 
              relates to the <b>SUNW,hme</b> instance that you wish to modify, 
              because the register values will need to be entered in the <b>hme.conf</b> 
              file; the output will differ if you're using different hardware:
            <p> 
            <pre>
SUNW,hme, instance #0
    Driver software properties:
        name &lt;pm_norm_pwr&gt; length &lt;4&gt;
            value &lt;0x00000001&gt;.
        name &lt;pm_timestamp&gt; length &lt;4&gt;
            value &lt;0x30743b26&gt;.
    Register Specifications:
        Bus Type=0xe, Address=0x8c00000, Size=108
        Bus Type=0xe, Address=0x8c02000, Size=2000
        Bus Type=0xe, Address=0x8c04000, Size=2000

        Bus Type=0xe, Address=0x8c07000, Size=20
</pre>
            <p> Next, modify <b>/kernel/drv/hme.conf</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>

            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm looking for calendaring 
              software that will run on our UNIX systems. The other half of out 
              IT department is pushing for Exchange because we have a lot of Outlook 
              users, but we want to keep reliability and stability.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Take a look at the calendar products 
              put out by Steltor (<b>http://www.cst.ca/</b>). A client-side DLL 
              makes your Outlook client think the calendar server, combined with 
              an IMAP server, is actually a Microsoft Exchange server. You can 
              also add Web clients, WAP editions, a wireless dataserver, and more. 
              There are also clients for platforms other than Windows. It's 
              handy software if you're trying to avoid Microsoft Exchange.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to install a Solaris 
              8 machine, but I keep running into errors that tell me it can't 
              find a suitable boot disk. It keeps telling me that the "magic 
              number" is bad. The machine has two 9-GB disks in it, so I'm 
              not sure what the problem is. I've tried both from CD and with 
              Jumpstart, and the install always bombs out. What's the problem, 
              and how do I fix it?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It sounds like your disks have 
              not been labeled. Jumpstart will leave you at a # prompt from which 
              you can invoke <b>format</b>, or you can boot single user from the 
              CD-ROM and use <b>format</b>. When you choose your disks in <b>format</b>, 
              it should ask you to <b>label</b> them. After you <b>label</b> the 
              disks, you can retry your installation via either method; they should 
              both work.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running Debian Linux, 
              and my Ethernet card is not detected on boot, yet loading the module

              it to load at boot so all of this is automatic?
