              RIP?</h1>
            <p> <i>Ron McCarty</i>
            <p> The routing information protocol (RIP) is a topic of discussion 
              among network administrators, and whether the protocol still has 
              a place in enterprise networking especially in new deployments instigates 
              many debates. Most network administrators seem to love or hate the 
              protocol, based upon their previous experiences with RIP. Due to 
              the high speed LAN connections and superior switching products, 
              many networks are flattened and include more nodes per logical (IP) 
              network than in the past. Thus, it is argued that with fewer routes 
              per host, static routes on routers are acceptable. Most smaller 
              and mid-sized organizations would typically have several routes 
              for local network, and possibly more for remote locations, with 
              the default route taking care of most routes until the IP traffic 
              gets closer to the edge or egress of the network.
            <p> Furthermore, Layer 2 redundancy provides many of the features 
              on local area networks that were served with redundant Layer 3 paths 
              in previous generation networks. I tend to agree with these arguments, 
              and have seen this trend and implemented (or helped implement) such 
              a structure to simplify management of networks. Figure 1 depicts 
              such a network.
            <p> The weakness with such a solution occurs when it is forced upon 
              an organization that, although relatively small, has a complex network. 
              Remote offices, ExtraNets, multiple Internet gateways, VPN gateways, 
              and instant complex networks created by mergers require a solution 
              that is both manageable, easy to learn, and supported on a wide 
              range of networking equipment.
            <p> Many of us are tempted to use the latest tool to create the solution. 
              However, modern but more complex routing protocols, such as Open 
              Shortest Path First (OSPF), may not be the best choice, especially 
              when legacy equipment or limited IT support are issues.
            <p> The IETF revisited RIP in 1998 with RFC 2453, "RIP version 
              2", and stated:
            <p> "While it is true that the newer IGP routing protocols are 
              far superior to RIP, RIP does have some advantages. Primarily, in 
              a small network, RIP has very little overhead in terms of bandwidth 
              used and configuration and management time."
            <p> <b>RIP Overview</b>
            <p> RIP primarily functions as an interior gateway protocol, and it 
              can perform very well in small to medium networks. RIP version 2 
              uses the network multicast address (224.0.0.9) to advertise the 
              network architecture to its neighbors; RIP version 1 used the broadcast 
              address. These broadcasts are to UDP port 520, regardless of the 
              RIP version. Most of the discussion here covers RIP 2, which has 
              features, including subnetting and variable length subnet masks, 
              necessary in most modern networks. RIP is a distance vector protocol, 
              which means that it only keeps track of the the networks, the gateways, 
              and the metric, which is typically the number of hops to the destination 
              RIP neighbor. This also means that the protocol is not aware of 
              better paths that may exist based upon larger bandwidth or congestion. 
              However, most implementations support manual configuration of the 
              vector for limited administrative granularity. For example, a router 
              with two interfaces to the same WAN may assign the lower bandwidth 
              connection a metric of two, as opposed to the normal metric of one.
            <p> RIP is limited to networks with 15 hops or less from any particular 
              RIP node. This was created by the original RIP and has been maintained 
              in RIP version 2 for compatibility with the older version. One of 
              the added features of version 2 is the support of triggered updates, 
              which means that a router can notify its neighbors of an outage 
              by sending a triggered update with a route containing a metric of 
              infinity (defined as 16). Therefore, network changes can converge 
              much quicker. Since I am talking about time, I'll review RIP's 
              timers.
            <p> <b>Timing and Numbers</b>
            <p> RIP advertisements are broadcast to the network every 30 seconds, 
              with a minimum of about a 5-second jitter to keep the complete network 
              updates from becoming synchronous with each other and causing undo 
              network processing. (PNNI signaling, a very modern protocol for 
              ATM networks, also includes a similar jitter for hello packets.) 
              These updates include the networks directly connected as RIP networks 
              and any networks learned from other RIP advertisements. Before sending 
              the learned routes, the broadcasting node will add one to all the 
              metrics to make the hop count go up. Thirty seconds may seem like 
              too often for network managers that are responsible for very stable 
              networks; whereas, 30 seconds may seem too long for unstable networks 
              for VPN solutions that use the Internet.
            <p> The +/- 30 second RIP advertisement is sent to the multicast address 
              224.0.0.9 on UDP port 520 as previously mentioned. Although the 
              address is a multicast address, it is sent out on the local network 
              and is not forwarded by routers. The distinct advantage of this 
              "local" multicast over a broadcast is that hosts or nodes 
              not configured for RIP will not examine the packet, whereas a broadcast 
              is looked at by every host on the segment.
            <p> Each route entry on each node also has timers associated with 
              it. The 180-second timeout keeps a routing entry active as long 
              as no new entries are received for the route. Should an update be 
              received, the timer is reset to 180 seconds.
            <p> As opposed to simply flushing the route, a 120-second garbage 
              collection timer is set for the route, and the route's metric 
              is set to infinity (16). During the next 30-second advertisement 
              stages the route is distributed with the infinity metric. Should 
              the "bad" route become "good" during this interval, 
              the route entry currently being timed for garbage collection is 
              replaced with the good entry, and all timers are reset.
            <p> <b>Protocol Messaging</b>
            <p> RIP messaging is very simple and is made up of two message types: 
              requests and responses. Since RIP is known for its broadcasting 
              or advertising method of distributing routes, the response packet 
              is usually the most well known because it is used for advertisements. 
              The response packet is also used as an answer to a request message 
              and for triggered update. Request messages are used to request specific 
              entries for specific networks or to request the whole network table.
            <p> This simplicity of message types makes the protocol easy to implement 
              and is one of the reasons for support of RIP by most router and 
              OS vendors.
            <p> <b>New Generation Features</b>
            <p> The original version of RIP came under fire for many reasons, 
              including lack of support for subnetting and variable length subnets. 
              As mentioned, RIP version 2 supports these features. In addition 
              to the changes required to support current IP networking practices, 
              the protocol also lacked features that would encourage quicker convergence 
              and avoid routing loops. RIP version 2 supports two distinct features 
              that provided the quicker convergence and routing loops avoidance.
            <p> Triggered updates, alluded to earlier, provide a mechanism of 
              telling RIP neighbors that there has been a change in the network 
              topology, without waiting on the next advertisement interval.
            <p> Split Horizon is simply a rule that tells the routing protocol 
              process not to send out learned entries onto the network (on broadcast 
              networks) or to the neighbor (point-to-point networks) to which 
              they were learned. Split Horizon with Poison Reverse is the same 
              thing on steroids; as opposed to not advertising the route, the 
              route is advertised with an infinity metric. Examine the Split Horizon 
              and Split Horizon with Poison Reverse to see them in a network. 
              Split Horizon, although not perfect in avoiding routing loops, is 
              a definite plus for most networks.
            <p> <b>Summary</b>
            <p> RIP, although aged, is a proven technology and available from 
              all router vendors, as well as most OS vendors. Additionally, there 
              are freely available solutions, such as Zebra (<b>http://www.zebra.org</b>). 
              Next month, I'll look at RIP configuration with Zebra and take 
              a closer look at the protocol in action with <b>tcpdump</b> (<b>http://www.tcpdump.org/</b>).
