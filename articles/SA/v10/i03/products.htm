            <p> <b>Dirig Software Unveils Product for Application Server Management</b> 
            <p> Dirig Software, a developer of applications and systems management 
              solutions, announced it is developing a new product for managing 
              e-business transactions. According to the company, the product (code 
              named Fenway) is capable of managing a complete e-business environment 
              from front-end Web server, through the application server to the 
              backend database on both the Microsoft and Java 2 Enterprise Edition 
              platforms. Fenway is scheduled for a second quarter release and 
              supported platforms include application servers, such as BEA WebLogic, 
              Allaire JRun, IBM Websphere, Sun-Netscape iPlanet, and ATG Dynamo. 
            <p> Fenway comprises several different sections, with a major distinction 
              placed upon the type of application server (J2EE or COM+ based). 
              COM+ based application servers will use the Windows NT/2000 event 
              subscriber mechanism to learn about Web applications and COM+ objects. 
              J2EE-based application servers will be managed through accessing 
              a series of management servlets designed to reside within the application 
              server. Fenway monitors and manages all aspects of the application 
              server, front-end Web server and back end database, which allows 
              the user to examine statistics from each area including: 
            <p> 
            <p> Web server -- Number of pages requested, error log entries, 
              HTTP response time 
            <p> Application server -- Connection pool utilization, number 
              of delayed requests, and number of rollbacks 
            <p> Database -- Cache hit ratio, table space utilization, and 
              physical reads. 
            <p> 
            <p> Once connected, individual Web applications and their components 
              will be automatically discovered, delivering detailed component 
              statistics across Web applications. These new statistics are exposed 
              for thresholding, corrective actions, and historical reporting, 
              which allows for virtually uninterrupted e-business transactions. 
            <p> Fenway will have full compatibility with Dirig's current 
              product offerings. Users of the RelyENT and xSPress solutions can 
              integrate Fenway into their environments, and Fenway customers can 
              extend the e-business solution to their larger infrastructure.

            <p> <b>ADIC Releases Version 5.0 of AMASS for UNIX Storage Management 
              Software</b> 
            <p> Advanced Digital Information Corporation announced a new release 
              of its AMASS for UNIX storage management software that enables IT 
              departments and integrators to leverage the capacity of automated 
              optical and tape libraries for a variety of large-scale storage 
              tasks. According to the company, the new 5.0 release of AMASS for 
              UNIX provides faster user access to mission-critical data by providing 
              a new advanced intelligent caching utility, it provides a broader 
              range of long-term file protection by extending ADIC's Infinite 
              File Life to new platforms, and it adds support for LTO Ultrium 
              technology. 
            <p> AMASS for UNIX 5.0 includes new intelligent cache management, 
              which speeds end-user access to data through improved configuration 
              features. With intelligent cache management, administrators can 
              customize the way their cache handles files by using a rule-based 
              priority system that determines the policies for retaining files 
              in cache. Because cached files can be accessed more quickly than 
              files stored only in the automated library, intelligent cache management 
              can improve system performance for user-defined file sets and allow 
              AMASS-enabled libraries to be used in more demanding application 
              environments. AMASS 5.0 supports cache sizes ranging from a few 
              megabytes up to one terabyte. 
            <p> The new version of AMASS also extends platform support for ADIC's 
              Infinite File Life (IFL) utility, which automatically migrates files 
              from older to newer media before data is lost due to age or wear. 
              The IFL utility tests media on a user-defined schedule, tracks read/write 
              error rates, and renews the files by writing them to new media. 
              This capability is an option for industries that require long-term 
              records retention, including banks, hospitals, insurance companies, 
              government agencies, and media companies. AMASS for UNIX 5.0 extends 
              this utility to cover a range of platforms, including HP-UX, Compaq 
              Tru64, and IBM AIX, and new storage media, including DTF1 and AIT 
              tape formats. 
            <p> AMASS for UNIX 5.0 also extends its support to devices, including 
              ADIC storage products, which use the new LTO Ultrium tape technology. 
              A complete list of supported platforms, drives, and libraries is 
              available on the company's Web site.

              tools, such as RSA SecurID, Kerberos 5, and PAM (Pluggable Authentication 
              Modules), Secure Shell 2.4 provides transparent authentication over 
              any IP-based connection for both client and server applications 
              by encrypting terminal connections and file transfers over the Internet. 
            <p> According to the company, SSH Secure Shell 2.4 includes several 
              new features designed to increase ease-of-use and functionality 
              for end users: 
            <p> 
            <ul>

                this feature offers a comprehensive range of authenticator options 
                including hardware tokens, smart cards, and software tokens 
              <li> Kerberos 5 -- This network authentication protocol is used 
                to provide strong authentication for client/server systems for 
                the UNIX platform 
              <li> PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) -- PAM allows systems 
                administrators to maintain a flexible security policy management. 
              <li> SSH2, SFTP2, SCP2, and SSH-KEYGEN2 command-line tools -- 
                These tools help manage the Secure Shell systems with fast non-graphical 
                interfaces 
              <li> Configurable Windows client menus and toolbars -- Users 
                can ''redesign'' the toolbars and menus by 
                dragging and dropping them to a new location
