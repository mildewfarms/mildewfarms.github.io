            <p>I was impressed with the number of responses to the Call for Papers 
              for this issue. Not surprisingly, the topic of Perl and Shell is 
              of keen interest to <i>Sys Admin</i> readers. As those of you who 
              submitted articles already know, I received too many articles to 
              fit into this issue. Some of the articles therefore are featured 
              on the Web site for June, and others will be published in later 
              issues. One particular Web-only feature article to note is PICA 
              by Miguel Armas and Esteban Manchado. This article describes the 
              authors' Perl Installation and Configuration Agent project, 
              which will soon be added to <b>freshmeat.net</b>. PICA is used to 
              distribute configuration files and alarm scripts to various servers 
              and uses SSH to establish secure connections to the remote servers. 
              Other interesting articles in this issue include "Fuzzy Text 
              Searches with agrep and afind" by Alexander Golomshtock, "The 
              Art of Spidering" by Reinhard Voglmaier, and "Tools for 
              Sorting Through Snort" by Kristy Westphal. Thank you all for 
              contributing!</p>
            <p> The editorial survey returns are trickling in. If you haven't 
              completed yours yet, it's not too late to submit it, and I 
              do thank those of you who've responded. According to these 
              very preliminary responses, 67% of you frequently (more than once 
              a month) write shell scripts, and about 50% frequently write Perl 
              programs.
            <p> In addition to the regular June magazine with all its fine content, 
              you probably also noticed the AIX supplement that mailed with this 
              issue. Thanks also to those who contributed articles for this supplement. 
              As I mentioned previously, we intend to continue to offer OS-specific 
              content in the form of these bonus issues. I understand that AIX 
              administration articles do not appeal to every reader, just as Solaris- 
              or Linux-related articles do not. We've always tried to provide 
              diverse articles in every issue, in the hope that at least one will 
              intrigue you, and we'll continue to provide a wide variety 
              of technical information. By the way, according to this year's 
              preliminary returns, Solaris is still the most commonly administered 
              operating system, followed by Linux. In third place so far is BSD. 
              In past years, third place has alternated between AIX and HP-UX. 
              I'll let you know more when all results have been tallied.
            <p> As always, don't hesitate to contact me if you have comments 
              about the magazine. I hope you enjoy this issue!
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> 
            <p>
