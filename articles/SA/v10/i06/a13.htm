            <p> <i>Jim McKinstry and Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've heard that you should 
              not run your authoritative name servers on the same machines as 
              your caching name servers. Why not, and how do I separate the two?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> An authoritative server is one 
              that's listed as an NS record for a given domain. It doesn't 
              need to know anything about querying the root nameservers, only 
              answering queries from other machines. A caching name server should 
              be used by a smaller set of people (i.e., employees of Company Foo) 
              to look up many requests for varying domains. The caching nameserver 
              needs to know how to query the root nameservers, expire cache data, 
              and walk delegation chains.
            <p> While the authoritative server must accept connections from the 
              entire Internet, you can protect the caching server so that connection 
              requests are limited to the IP range of Company Foo. If you put 
              your caching server and your authoritative server on the same instance, 
              then you run the risk of forged information corrupting your cached 
              data (known as cache poisoning).
            <p> The other reason to separate caching and authoritative servers 
              is mostly important if you have a large number of people using your 
              name server for cached data. If the caching server and the authoritative 
              server for <b>domain foo.com</b> are on the same machine (let's 
              call the machine <b>ns.bar.com</b>), and <b>foo.com </b>changes 
              its name servers over to another provider (<b>ns.baz.com</b>), <b>ns.bar.com</b> 
              will still think its authoritative for <b>foo.com</b> if the defunct 
              zone file for <b>foo.com</b> is not removed. Anyone using <b>ns.bar.com</b> 
              as a caching server will get the wrong information. If <b>ns.bar.com</b> 
              were a caching-only server, it would no longer think that it was 
              authoritative for <b>foo.com</b>. It would go to the root nameservers 
              and find that the correct authoritative server for <b>foo.com</b> 
              could be found at <b>ns.baz.com</b>.
            <p> To separate the caching and the authoritative name server instances, 
              you generally run <b>named</b> (or whatever DNS server software 
              you use) on two different machines. Here's some examples for 
              BIND 8:
            <p> 
            <pre>
named.conf on a caching only nameserver:

  options {
    directory "/etc/named";
  };

  zone "." {
    type hint;
    file "db.root";
  };

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
  type master;
  file "db.local";
};
</pre>
            <b>named.conf</b> on an authoritative only server (turn off recursion 
            and glue-fetching):
            <p> 
            <pre>
options {
  directory "/etc/named";
  recursion no;
  fetch-glue no;
};

zone "." {
  type hint;
  file "db.root";
};

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
  type master;
  file "db.local";
};

zone "foo.com" {
  type master;
  file "db.foo.com";
  allow-transfer {
    192.168.1.2;        // our secondary nameserver
  };
};
</pre>
            If you're stuck running authoritative and caching server on the 
            same machine, you may want to restrict recursive queries to a limited 
            number of IPs:
            <p> 
            <pre>
options {
  directory "/etc/named";
  allow-recursion {
    192.168.1.0/29;
  };
};

zone "foo.com" {
  type master;
  file "db.foo.com";
  allow-transfer {
    192.168.1.2;         // our secondary nameserver
  };
  allow-query {
    any;                 // let anyone query for our zone
  };
};

</pre>

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a Solaris 8 machine connected 
            to a switch with other Solaris 8 machines. This Solaris 8 server NFS 
            exports several filesystems to the other Solaris 8 machines. I'm 
            seeing really wretched NFS performance and frequent timeouts when 
            I try to move even small chunks of data around on the client, no matter 
            what NFS filesystem I'm using on the server. What's the 
            issue? Is NFS really this slow?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There are several things you'll 
              want to look at. First, I'd check <b>nfsstat</b> to see what 
              kind of throughput it thinks you're getting. You may also want 
              to use <b>snoop</b>, <b>nfswatch</b>, or <b>nfstrace</b> to get 
              a better idea of what's happening on the wire. For example, 
              <b>snoop</b> may show that you're having DNS issues. Also use 
              <b>iostat</b> to see whether you're bottlenecking at your disk 
              and <b>netstat</b> to see if there are any network problems between 
              the server and the other hosts.
            <p> One network tip: make sure that the Suns and the switch all have 
              the wire speed locked in at 100 full duplex. Do <i>not</i> let either 
              side try and auto-negotiate the speed or the mode. There are many 
              Ethernet cards out there that have a difficult time getting auto-negation 
              right.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm getting a lot of "file: 
              table full" error messages on my FreeBSD 4.2-STABLE box. How 
              do I make the file table bigger?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can increase the value of 
              maxusers in your kernel configuration and recompile and install 
              a new kernel (reboot needed for the changes to take effect, of course). 
              This will have the benefit of increasing a number of system defaults. 
              You can also just modify <b>kern.maxfiles</b> itself on the fly 
              by doing:
            <p> 
            <pre>
sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=&lt;value&gt;
</pre>
            If you're changing maxusers, 64 is often a decent value for a 
            well-used single-user machine. If you're supporting a lot of 
            users, you probably want to increase that even more (up to 256). Setting 
            <b>kernel.maxfiles</b> to 2088 would be equivalent to setting maxusers 
            to 64.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a DHCP server running 
              on Windows NT. All of the clients that obtain addresses are supposed 
              to send their hostname to the DHCP server so it can update DNS. 
              We recently acquired a Sun Ultra 10 machine running Solaris 8, and 
              it refuses to send its hostname. Is there some configuration variable 
              to Solaris's DHCP client to tell it to send the hostname?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Solaris's DHCP client doesn't 
              send a hostname -- it expects one to be provided by the server. 
              If you look in <b>/etc/init.d/inetsvc</b>, you see where it tries 
              to set the hostname based on <b>dhcpinfo</b> calls (if <b>/etc/dhcp.&lt;interface&gt;</b> 
              exists and <b>&lt;interface&gt;</b> is the primary interface). You 
              may want to take a look at a third party DHCP client (like ISC's 
              <b>http://www.isc.org/products/DHCP/</b> for your Sun machines.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm used to using Linux and 
              getting colored output for different types of files when using <b>ls 
              -G</b>. I've now switched over to FreeBSD and only seem to 
              get the base color set in my <b>.Xdefaults</b>. Is there a way to 
              get color <b>ls</b> again?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The color capable <b>xterm</b> 
              is part of XFree86 (used by both Linux and FreeBSD). Make sure that 
              you're running <b>xterm</b> with "<b>xterm-color</b>" 
              set as the terminal type. You can do this in two ways. Set the TERM 
              environment variable in your shell:
            <p> 
            <pre>
export TERM=xterm-color    (for bourne shell variant users)
setenv TERM xterm-color    (for csh variant users)
</pre>
            Or you can explicitly start up <b>xterm</b> with <b>xterm-color</b> 
            as the terminal type:
            <p> 
            <pre>
xterm -tn xterm-color
</pre>
            In both cases,<b> ls -G</b> should now produce color output.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an Ultra 220R that I'm 
              trying to jumpstart from our Ultra 10 Jumpstart server. The 220R 
              has two internal disks, one 9-Gb disk we want to use as the boot 
              disk, and one 36-Gb disk want to use for data. The Jumpstart installation 
              uses the wrong disk as the boot disk when we boot from the network. 
              Why does it keep choosing the bigger disk, and how do we make it 
              choose the 9-Gb disk?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Since you don't provide 
              your profile, I'm going to guess that you're not specifying 
              the <b>root_device</b>. If the <b>root_device</b> or <b>boot_device</b> 
              is not set in the Jumpstart profile, then the root disk is chosen 
              based on the kernel search order of the SCSI bus. I'm guessing 
              that you have the 36-Gb disk first in the search order, and it's 
              therefore being picked up as the root disk. There are a couple workarounds 
              you can do in the Jumpstart profile. You can set <b>root_device</b> 
              or <b>boot_device</b>, or you can use explicit partitioning by using 
              <b>cWtXdYsZ</b> instead of <b>rootdisk.Z</b>. This example assumes 
              that your 9-Gb disk is <b>c2t0d0s0</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Is there any way I can have a script 
            modify a crontab entry on the fly? I want to run a little Bourne shell 
            script that modifies the crontab file if it sees a certain process 
            running.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The easiest way is probably to 
              print out the crontab information, add your new line, and then read 
              the new crontab back in its entirety. I suggest writing this file 
              out to some place other than<b> /tmp </b>(some place writable only 
              by the user you're running this script as), but I'll use 
              <b>/tmp</b> in the example below. If you're expecting more 
              than one process to be doing this at a time, add some file-locking 
              code around the block so that an inconsistent crontab doesn't 
              get read in by another process.
            <p> 
            <pre>
crontab -l &gt; /tmp/file;
echo "0 2 * * * /bin/command" &gt;&gt; /tmp/file;
crontab /tmp/file
</pre>
            If you're modifying the crontab of someone other than the UID 
            that the script is running as, don't forget to add the <b>-u 
            &lt;user&gt;</b> switch to the two crontab commands above.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> What's the difference between 
              a Solaris MU (maintenance update) and the Solaris recommended patch 
              set? If I apply the MU, do I also need the recommended patch set?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The MU and the recommended patch 
              set are two different things, and you'll still need the recommended 
              patch set if you install an MU. The recommended patch set is a collection 
              of security and prominent bug patches, and is updated every time 
              a new recommended patch comes out. The MUs are feature upgrades 
              (like support for the sunblade 100, or IDE drives as a boot disk, 
              or CPUs faster than 400 MHz) that are generally released every three 
              to six months or so. If you have a Solaris OS package, note that 
              versions of Solaris come with a date on them (Solaris 8 06/00, Solaris 
              8 10/00, etc.). The different dates on the CDROMs correspond with 
              different MUs.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm setting up a database 
              on a Solaris 2.6 machine, and I want to create a raw partition for 
              it. How do I go about this, and, once it's set up, how do I 
              tell how big the raw partition is and how much space is being used?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Assuming you're just using 
              a directly attached disk without any software mirroring/striping 
              layer (SDS or Veritas Volume Manager) sitting in the middle, you 
              can simply use the <b>format</b> utility to create your new disk 
              slice. Unlike setting up a new ufs filesystem, though, you don't 
              need to do a <b>newfs</b> on the newly created slice.
            <p> If the raw partition already exists and you want to find out how 
              much space it has, you can use <b>format</b> and print out the partition 
              table, or you can use <b>prtvtoc</b> with the raw disk device as 
              an argument. For example:
            <p> 
            <pre>
prtvtoc /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0
</pre>
            If you're using the raw partition for a database, the OS no longer 
            has any concept of free space because the database looks like it's 
            using the entire slice. Generally, there are tools that come with 
            the database that will tell you how much space it thinks is left on 
            the raw device.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm in the process of setting 
              up a Netapp filer for our internal user space (home directories). 
              We're supporting both UNIX users and NT/2000 users, and some 
              users use both. We have the filer set up to do mixed security, but 
              the UNIX users see everything as mode 777. If we restrict the UNIX 
              side to 755, then the Windows users have problems. How do we secure 
              files on both ends?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> In a mixed environment of NTFS 
              and NFS where both types of clients will be accessing the same files, 
              Netapp suggests that you use UNIX-style security instead of mixed 
              security. In a UNIX-style security model, files newly created by 
              CIFS clients inherit permissions from the parent directory, and 
              the group is set to the parent directory's group if it has 
              the SGID bit. This is similar to standard UNIX security behavior, 
              except that the permissions also inherit from the parent because 
              they are not passed in with the create as they would be for UNIX 
              clients.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> How do I know what version of 
              SPARC processor (Sparc 9, Sparc 8, Sparc 7) my Sun box has in it?

              you can run the command <b>/usr/bin/isainfo -v</b>. This will tell

              there's also a correlation between the machine type (<b>/usr/bin/uname

            times getting the SMTP banner when going from localhost to localhost. 
            <b>Nslookup</b> seems to resolve things just fine, <b>identd</b> isn't

            This feels like a reverse DNS issue, but everything appears to be 
            fine. What could be the issue?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It's possible that the postfix's 
              chrooted copy of <b>resolv.conf</b> does not match what's in 
              <b>/etc/</b>. You may want to check for chrooted copies of <b>resolv.conf</b> 
              (probably <b>/var/spool/postfix/etc/resolv.conf</b>) containing 
              incorrect data.

            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> From the Open Boot Prom (aka 
              the <i>ok</i> prompt), you can use the command <b>show-nets</b> 
              to see a listing of all network interface device names. If the machine
