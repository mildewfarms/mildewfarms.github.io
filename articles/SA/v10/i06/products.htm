            <p><b> Connex Unveils SANavigator Lite</b>
            <p> Connex announced its SANavigator Lite storage management application, 
              designed for entry-level storage management. According to the company, 
              SANavigator Lite provides many of the storage management features 
              of the company's SANavigator software to smaller SAN installations
            <p> SANavigator Lite, like SANavigator Version 1.5, is a Java-based 
              storage management application that operates as a host for other 
              storage management applications, utilities, and tools from other 
              storage vendors. It includes an Auto Discovery feature that performs 
              a complete inventory of all SAN and NAS resources. The SANmap component 
              of SANavigator Lite presents a visual map of the SAN showing all 
              devices and their interconnections.
            <p> According to the company, one of SANavigator Lite's features 
              is its ability to automatically discover direct-attached Fibre Channel 
              devices. This gives entry-level SAN customers an opportunity to 
              test Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) or other SAN devices before they invest 
              in a complete SAN architecture that incorporates fabric devices.
            <p> Like SANavigator, SANavigator Lite supports all Microsoft Windows 
              platforms (98, NT, and 2000), Solaris, and Linux. SANavigator Lite 
              is fully interoperable with other storage management applications 
              and can be utilized to launch operations such as serverless backup 
              using third-party backup software. SANavigator Lite provides storage 
              management functionality, but does not include the Data Path Map, 
              Event Notification, Trap Forwarding, Community Strings, and SNMP 
              Listen Port Change features included with SANavigator. Additionally, 
              SANavigator Lite does not have the ability to change the port on 
              which SANavigator listens for SNMP traps. According to the company, 
              when a SAN grows to the point that these management features become 
              necessary, a manager can simply upgrade to SANavigator.
            <p> For more information, or to download SANavigator, visit the company's 
              Web site at: <i>http://www.sanavigator.com</i> or contact: <i>Connex,

            <p> <b>Crystal Group Introduces Darksite Remote Management Appliance</b>
            <p> Crystal Group Inc. announced the addition of DarkSite remote management 
              appliance for servers. According to the company, DarkSite is a platform-independent 
              management tool that monitors the health of servers and notifies 
              users of potential problems before they cause an application to 
              fail. DarkSite allows the user to select which hardware and software 
              systems are monitored and how users will be contacted.
            <p> According to the company, DarkSite is an embedded computer system, 
              with its own operating system and Crystal's server management 
              software application. It functions independently from the host system, 
              using an ISA or PCI slot for power. Sensors on the system can monitor 
              temperature, fan rotation, and power in the host system. Additionally, 
              DarkSite can keep an eye on the status of a server's resources. 
              Installing a small OS Agent will allow DarkSite to monitor the host 
              system's CPU, RAM, disk drives, and network connections.
            <p> DarkSite is Web-enabled, allowing remote administration from any 
              browser on the network or the Internet. Security concerns are addressed 
              by allowing SSL connections to the system, and advanced users can 
              configure DarkSite through Telnet. DarkSite is able to send alarms 
              to any email address, and wireless alert messages to any PDA, pager, 
              or cellular telephone. If you use SNMP to manage your facility, 
              DarkSite can send SNMP traps also.
            <p> According to the company, DarkSite's notification features 
              minimize the worries associated with hardware or software problems 
              that may bring servers down. Altogether, DarkSite can monitor: CPU 
              load, RAM usage, disk space usage, network usage, and system status 
              (heartbeat). DarkSite requires an available ISA or PCI expansion 
              slot for use, an available RS-232 serial port, an ATX power supply, 
              and optional tachometer chassis/case fans. Each DarkSite card features 
              a RISC-based microprocessor, onboard DRAM and Flash memory, embedded 
              10-Mbs Ethernet adapter and two RS-232 serial ports. DarkSite is 
              compatible with Microsoft Windows 95/98, 2000, or NT 4.0, Linux, 
              Solaris x86, SCO (Caldera) UnixWare 7.x, and TCP/IP connectivity. 
              Additionally, protocols compatible with DarkSite include: TCP/IP, 
              HTTP/SSL, Telnet, PPP, Serial Console, SMTP, SNMP, SNTP, and Syslog. 
              Pricing starts at $799 per card.

              machine utilization.
            <p> ActiveBatch supports the concept of "third-party" jobs. 
              A batch job can be submitted, for example, under the administrator's 
              credentials and one or more users or groups can be designated to 
              trigger execution of that job. By using ActiveBatch, administrators 
              can associate their rights with the running of that specific job 
              without requiring any further actions.
            <p> ActiveBatch supports a range of new features designed to automate 
              the management and scheduling of jobs. Among these are ActiveBatch's 
              powerful broadcast capabilities making transparent "updates"

            <p> <b>Tripwire Inc. Announces Tripwire for Web Pages</b>
            <p> Tripwire Inc., a provider of data and network integrity software 
              (DNI), announced Tripwire for Web Pages. Tailored for the Apache 
              Web server platform, this new product detects unauthorized modifications 
              to Web site content, prevents the delivery of modified pages, and 
              alerts the systems administrator.
            <p> According to the company, Tripwire for Web Pages provides integrity 
              solutions by assuring the integrity of Web page content. It extends 
              Tripwire's core DNI offerings from monitoring the file system 
              of the Web server to the real-time monitoring of dynamic Web pages 
              presented by the server. Tripwire for Web Pages does this by detecting 
              unauthorized modifications to Web server content, alerting the systems 
              administrator, and redirecting Web site viewers to a user-defined 
              temporary Web page until authorized content is restored.
            <p> Tripwire for Web Pages determines whether a Web page has been 
              altered by comparing the date and the digital signature of the current 
              Web page to that of the "known good" authorized file securely 
              saved in the database. This "integrity check" is performed 
              each time a browser requests a Web page from the Web server. If 
              the file dates and/or signatures do not match, Tripwire for Web 
              Pages halts the file from being served, sends a custom notification/replacement 
              page to the browser, logs the event, and sends an email to alert 
              the systems administrator of the change and provide steps to restore 
              the authorized content.

                  management tools to mainstream enterprise storage infrastructure. 
                  The Paladin C-series family helps organizations to incrementally 
                  scale their storage infrastructure to hundreds of terabytes 
                  while increasing system bandwidth and reliability. FusionOS 
                  software simplifies storage provisioning and data sharing by 
                  combining block and file information delivery onto a single, 
                  centrally manageable system. With new Alchemy software, organizations 
                  can control of their data assets, thus reducing the cost and 
                  complexity of their networks.
                <p> According to TrueSAN, FusionOS software helps combine distributed 
                  virtualization technology with heterogeneous file sharing. With 
                  FusionOS, administrators can provision storage capacity on a 
                  granular and secure basis. As an open platform, the Paladin 
                  C-series can be integrated with existing storage systems.
                <p> With Alchemy software, IT administrators can control the storage 
                  infrastructure from any device with Internet access and a Web 
                  browser. Alchemy incorporates agent technology that extends 
                  intelligence to the edge of the storage network, enabling proactive 
                  resource management. According to the company, because Alchemy 
                  is integrated with the Paladin C-series, it provides a way for 
                  IT administrators to visualize, configure, and control their 
                  storage infrastructure. For business-critical applications, 
                  Alchemy provides reliability through built-in alternate-pathing 
                  and snapshot technology.
                <p> Paladin C30, including Alchemy software and a two-year support 
                  program, begins at $129,000. The Paladin C60, configured with 
                  no single point of failure, Alchemy software, and 24x7 onsite 
                  support, begins at $239,000. For more information, contact:

                <p> <b>CYRANO Announces Production Testing Tool 2.6</b>
                <p> CYRANO announced the 2.6 release of its "production" 
                  testing tool that monitors production Sybase server activity 
                  and detects anomalies in real time. According to the company, 
                  Production enables you to define specific performance rules 
                  in the form of thresholds which, when reached, trigger alarms. 
                  These alarms can be set to execute predefined shell scripts, 
                  or SQL commands, such as emailing a systems administrator. By 
                  automating the process of monitoring a Sybase server, Production 
                  makes it possible to provide greater levels of performance and 
                  availability without requiring any additional time on the part 
                  of database administrators. The new version of Production adds 
                  several capabilities such as supporting Windows 2000, Version 
                  12 of Sybase, and new lock row levels in recent Sybase releases.
                <p> According to the CYRANO, Production runs as a background process 
                  alongside the production server. It periodically analyzes information 
                  from Sybase SQL Server and, when it detects performance bottlenecks, 
                  provides notification to the database administrator and saves 
                  the information.
