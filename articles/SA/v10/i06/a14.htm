            <p> The different backgrounds and levels of expertise within the UNIX 
              community provide us with rich and varied resources. Coincidentally, 
              this month's column reflects that diversity, with book reviews 
              on an alternative Web browser, a book for UNIX novices, a Linux 
              administrator's guide, and a book about affiliate partnerships. 
              Specifically, the reviews include: <i>The Opera 5.x Book: Browsing 
              the Web with Speed and Style</i> by J. S. Lyster, (No Starch Press); 
              <i>Think Unix</i> by Jon Lasser (Que); <i>Red Hat Linux Administrator's 
              Handbook</i>, Second Edition by Mohammed J. Kabir (M &amp; T Books/Hungry 
              Minds Books); and <i>The Complete Guide to Associate and Affiliate 
              Programs on the Net</i> by Daniel Gray (McGraw-Hill).
            <p> 
            <p> <i>Reviewer's Note: The copy of the Opera book that I reviewed 
              was an advance copy and in manuscript format. The final bound edition 
              may differ in page length due to typesetting and graphics layouts.

            <p> A browser provides a user's access to the Web and, in many 
              cases, also acts as an email client. The two most popular browsers 
              are Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape's Navigator. 
              An alternative choice is the Opera Web browser, which features many 
              capabilities missing in both Explorer and Navigator. Opera takes 
              less space, doesn't load plug-ins until you need them, possesses 
              full windowing capabilities (so that you can actually work in two 
              or more windows without draining your system's resources), 
              and can save your work until a later date.
            <p> One of Opera's strengths is its keystroke alternative. Many 
              users either cannot use a mouse or prefer to use it sparingly. Opera 
              allows the user to rely more on keyboard navigation than on mouse 
              clicks. It also allows cookie options and filters, presentation 
              and kiosk development, and provides Web designers with an ideal 
              testing facility. Because Opera follows the W3C (World Wide Web 
              Consortium) guidelines, the same appearance of a Web page will usually 
              have same appearance in Explorer and Navigator. These (and many 
              more) facets of the Opera Web browser are superbly described and 
              demonstrated in <i>The Opera 5.x Book: Browsing the Web with Speed 
              and Style</i> by J. S. Lyster. The author discusses Opera's 
              installation, basic navigation, toolbars, and its more advanced 
              qualities in a step-by-step format.
            <p> Lyster approaches the different topics through seven sections: 
              Installation, You've Got Mail, Supercharging Your Browser, 
              Power-Surfing, Going Further, Beyond the Browser, and Alternative 
              Operating Systems plus the Appendices. In Part One, Installation, 
              Lyster presents Getting Started, Surfing In Style, The Software 
              Side of the Net, and Customizing the Browser. In the second part, 
              You've Got Mail, the author discusses Setting Up Email and 
              Instant Messaging, Managing Your Mail, and Newsgroups. Supercharging 
              Your Browser details Adding Java Support, Using External Applications 
              and Plug-Ins, Multimedia: Getting the Most Out of Images and Sound, 
              and Three Utilities That Expand Your Reach. The following section, 
              Power-Surfing, examines Keeping Your Hands on the Keys, Unlocking 
              Opera's Powers, and Privacy and Security; Part Five: Going 
              Further, explains Network Administration and Multiple Users, Extreme 
              Customization, and Opera as a Workhorse. The concluding parts, Beyond 
              the Browser and Alternative Operating Systems survey Completing 
              Your Toolkit, Beyond Windows 95 and 98, and Opera for Linux: The 
              New Frontier, respectively. The Appendices include: A) Keyboard 
              Commands and Shortcuts, B) Guide to the Compact Disc, C) Technical 
              Specifications, and D) Learning About the Web. The accompanying 
              CD-ROM contains Opera for all platforms, the utilities described 
              in the book, and plug-ins (where applicable).
            <p> I have been an Opera enthusiast since I realized how much faster 
              it was than other browsers. In <i>The Opera 5.x Book: Browsing the 
              Web with Speed and Style</i>, J. S. Lyster illustrates Opera's 
              capabilities and discusses its possible configurations. The examples 
              are primarily for the Windows 95+ user. However, most of the procedures 
              apply to every platform. BeOS, EPOC, and Windows 3.1 users should 
              read Chapter 19 first; the Linux installation differences are described 
              in Chapter 20. In these two chapters, Lyster reviews the idiosyncrasies, 
              limitations, and workarounds for the other operating systems implementations. 
              The rest of the book discusses guidelines and procedures for all 
              platforms, with few exceptions. Lyster's book is a well-written 
              companion to the features of the Opera Web browser. Users will appreciate 
              his proficient and extensive description of Opera's myriad 
              capabilities and dimensions.

            <p> Every operating system or computing environment utilizes its own 
              set of commands or processes. When developers or users move from 
              one environment to another, they often feel that they've completely 
              changed countries without the benefit of a translator. This is particularly 
              evident when they move from a non-UNIX, non-command line system 
              to a UNIX environment. Originally, a developer's operating 
              system, the documentation, and commands were logical to developers, 
              who also used a permuted index. These procedures and explanations 
              are often not quite as evident to the new UNIX user, even when the 
              user has a computing background.
            <p> Most beginning books are written for the complete novice, not 
              for someone who knows a computer system other than UNIX. To address 
              this forgotten audience, Jon Lasser has written <i>Think Unix</i>. 
              He discusses the way that the UNIX system works and attempts to 
              describe how the UNIX community thinks. Lasser examines the topics 
              through four sections: UNIX Concepts, Shell Concepts, X Window System 
              Concepts, and the Appendices. In the first section, UNIX Concepts, 
              Lasser details UNIX Documentation, Files and Processes, Redirection 
              and Pipes, Networking, and vi, Dotfiles, and Regular Expressions. 
              Shell Concepts contains Muddling Through Shells, Variables and Quoting, 
              Conditional Execution and Loops, and Shell Scripts and More. The 
              X section, X Window System Concepts, analyzes Thinking Like X and 
              Configuring X; Appendices includes: A) Answers to Practice Problems, 
              B) Glossary and References, and the Index.
            <p> As Lasser explains the topics and demonstrates how to create files 
              or change directories or group and use filters, he reinforces the 
              principles discussed with sets of practice problems. He also addresses 
              the various topics with a sense of humor, even through the footnotes. 
              When a technique or procedure doesn't follow an expected pattern, 
              or seem to make sense (at least from the learner's viewpoint), 
              he clearly states that it doesn't, even though that is the 
              accepted way it is done. Lasser explains the concepts and their 
              accompanying implementations clearly, illustrates their use through 
              numerous examples, and reinforces the processes used in a very clear 
              style. This is an excellent book that any UNIX novice can appreciate.

            <p> The original <i>Red Hat Linux Administrator's Handbook</i> 
              covered the distributions through 6.1. The newly released second 
              edition updates the material to reflect changes through Red Hat 
              7.0. The approach remains the same; this book is a quick and thorough 
              reference for systems administrators. Kabir presents the material 
              through three sections. The initial part, Installation and Basic 
              Configuration, addresses Getting Started, Boot Up and Shutdown Configuration, 
              File Permissions, and Using Linuxconf. The central part of the book, 
              Advanced Configuration, concentrates on User Administration, Process 
              Administration, Network Administration, DNS Service, E-mail Service, 
              FTP Service, Sharing Files and Printers with Samba, Web Service 
              Using Apache, Using NFS File Servers, and Configuring X Windows. 
              These chapters illustrate how to set up your server to accomplish 
              the more complex and most essential tasks. The final section, Troubleshooting, 
              analyzes the problems that can occur, demonstrates how to protect 
              your system against intrusion through chapters on Security and Network 
              Security and also details how to keep your system current with a 
              chapter on Customizing the Kernel. The Appendices contain A) Common 

              Commands and B) Linux Resources.
            <p> Kabir is a superb author with demonstrated expertise with Apache, 
              Samba, server installation, and network installation. He writes 
              clearly and demonstrates server installation and configuration in 
              an effective manner. This is an essential utility for every Linux 
              systems administrator.

            <p> Whether it's a single frame, or one of several banners in 
              a row, the appearance of advertisements for other sites has become 
              common practice. Participants are not limited to commercial sites; 
              individuals are also encouraged to join associate or affiliate partnership 
              programs. In <i>The Complete Guide to Associate and Affiliate Programs 
              on the Net</i>, author Daniel Gray explains what the partnership 
              programs involve, issues to consider before becoming an associate 
              or affiliate, some success stories, and the top merchants. The author 
              addresses the topics in the following order: Why Become an Associate 
              or Affiliate?, Building Your Affiliate Site, Search Engine Tuning, 
              Keeping Track, Merchant Profiles, Affiliate Success Stories, and 
              The Top 100 Directory. Within the chapters, Gray demonstrates how 
              to select the right affiliate partnerships for your site, lists 
              pertinent affiliate-related resources, and suggests effective page 
              designs. The importance of careful selection and page design cannot 
              be overemphasized. Many sites clutter their pages with affiliate 
              banners and obscure the primary information onthe page. Conflicting 
              partnerships can also become a problem. Gray details the importance 
              of keeping statistics in addition to the legal responsibilities 
              of an affiliate, including taxes.
            <p> With <i>The Complete Guide to Associate and Affiliate Programs 
              on the Net</i>, author Daniel Gray presents realistic information 
              and expectations for anyone considering an affiliate partnership. 
              He examines the practices and procedures that every would-be affiliate 
              should follow. This is an excellent reference and required reading 
              for anyone about to establish an associate/affiliate partnership.
