              Subject: <i>Sys Admin</i> article -- ufsdump
            <p> I am writing in regard to your article, "Quick and Dirty 
              Server/Workstation Replication Using ufsdump", in the <i>Sys 
              Admin</i> April 2001 issue.
            <p> 
            <p> 1. On Step 2 - Step 3, you called for installation of Solaris 
              OS (only to be erased later). You can save yourself a lot of time 
              by booting it off the CD in single user mode:
            <p> 
            <pre>
boot cdrom -sw
</pre>
            Then, use <b>format</b> command to partition your drive. This will 
            achieve the same result in less than 5 min.
            <p> 
            <p> 2. After Step 4, you will need to install the boot block or the 
              system won't boot up. Mount the <b>/usr</b> partition that 
              you have just restored:
            <p> 
            <pre>
# mount /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s2 /a
# cd /a/platform/`uname -i`/lib/fs/ufs
# installlboot ./bootblk /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0
</pre>
            This will place the bootblock at the beginning of the drive c0t0d0s0.
            <p> 3. On Step 5, you said <b>setenv boot-command disk0</b>, I am 
              not sure if that's what you want to do. Should it be:
            <p> 
            <pre>
setenv boot-device disk0
</pre>
            "<b>boot-command</b>" is just what the parameter does; it 
            is the command it will execute upon booting up. Then "<b>boot-device</b>" 
            is the device it will boot from. So, during boot up, it will do:
            <p> 
            <pre>
boot disk0
&lt;Boot-command&gt; &lt;boot-devices&gt; &lt;option&gt;
</pre>
            4. A very important thing to remember about cloning systems (if the 
            two systems are different hardware) is the architecture of the systems. 
            Do <b>uname -i</b> to find out the architecture. of your system. You 
            cannot clone systems on different architecture machines. Believe me, 
            I tried many times without success. Most of the new Sun system are 
            "sun4u" architecture, only old systems are "sun4m". 
            So, this is one thing that might cause the system to fail to boot 
            up.

            Subject: RE: <i>Sys Admin</i> article -- ufsdump<br>
            Dear Mr. Chow:
            <p> Thanks for the careful read of our article. In reply to your comments:
            <p> 
            <p> 1. You are correct about saving time to boot from the CD and use 
              <b>format</b>. Our first draft of this article did just that. But 
              it was very difficult to explain how to use <b>format</b> to set 
              up the disk partitions, especially when the disk sizes are not the 
              same between the original and clone systems. We spent two paragraphs 
              alone explaining what "Free Hog partition" meant. We decided 
              that rather than confuse readers with the various partitioning options 
              that Sun's <b>format</b> command uses, we would make it very 
              easy by using the install "<b>boot cdrom - install</b>" 
              command and have the reader fill in the graphical partition table. 
              Granted, this takes about 15 minutes extra to load the system up 
              just to overwrite it later, but it saves many headaches.
            <p> 2. If you use the <b>format</b> command as you recommend, you 
              would have to install the boot. But using our method, the Solaris 
              install CD puts the boot block in for you as part of its built-in 
              installation script. Thus, the reader will not have to perform this 
              step. I've successfully done this on many systems here in-house.
            <p> 3. You write: "On Step 5, you said <b>setenv boot-command 
              disk0</b>, I am not sure if that's what you want to do. Should 
              it be:"
            <p> 
            <pre>
setenv boot-device disk0
</pre>
            You make a great point here. And I agree wholeheartedly, which is 
            why we added the caveat at the end of the article that: "Cloning 
            works best if the clone machine has the same hardware as the original 
            machine ..." Perhaps we should have stated our point a bit more.
            <p> 
            <p> Again, thanks for your comments. We really appreciate them. It 
              just goes to show that there are many ways to perform a given task.
            <p> Sincerely,<br>
              Ben Diamond<br>

            <i>I also received some letters in support of James O'Gorman's 
            script title (April issue). Here's a sample:</i>
            <p> 
            <p> From: Gary Luther (gluther@safmt.org)<br>
              Subject: Viagra: Keeping Services Running on BSD (Feb 2001)
            <p> I am writing to support James O'Gorman and his article. Victoria 
              Sadoff wrote chastizing his reference to penises. Since I didn't 
              think such a reference would make it past the editing table, I reread 
              the article several times to see if perhaps I had become jaded in 
              what was acceptable. I found the use of the word Viagra 6 times 
              including the title and the program listing. Since it was the name 
              of the script (clearly the author's choice), James made reference 
              to his admittedly plagiarized script only 4 times. Nowhere in the 
              article was there a direct reference to penis(es). Not wanting to 
              be offensive -- perhaps James could rename his script BobDole.
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <i>Thanks to all for writing. I appreciate the comments on both sides. 
            In regard to the script name, our editorial staff did not find the 
            Viagra name offensive, but we cannot anticipate every reader's 
            reaction. We hope to maintain a balance of (tasteful) humor and technical 
            information.</i>
            <p><i> I appreciate your time and your support of the magazine.</i>
