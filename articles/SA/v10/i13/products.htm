            <p><b> Perle Adds TruePort for AIX Applications to Serial Server Range</b>
            <p> Perle Systems announced the addition of TruePort for AIX applications 
              across its range of serial servers. With this functionality, according 
              to the company, Perle supports the connection of serial devices 
              to AIX applications via Ethernet-based serial servers.
            <p> TruePort for AIX allows serial devices such as terminals, POS, 
              and other data collection equipment connected to a Perle Serial 
              Server to function as if directly connected to the AIX server by 
              mimicking TTY port functionality. Applications written for directly 
              connected serial devices can thus be deployed across an Ethernet 
              LAN environment without modification.
            <p> TruePort software provides transparent access from AIX applications 
              to as many as 500 serial ports on Perle JetStream, LanStream, LinkStream, 
              and IOLAN+ serial servers located across a TCP/IP network. Other 
              features include:
            <p> Applications written for serial device connections can be deployed 
              without modification. TruePort's TTY API emulation allows applications 
              to remain configured as if they were supported directly by connected 
              serial devices. TruePort for AIX uses a single process on the AIX 
              server for all serial servers on the Ethernet network, reducing 
              processing server overhead. Perle Serial Server ports are configured 
              to appear as if directly connected to AIX rather than being connected 
              over a TCP/IP backbone.
            <p> TruePort software is available free of charge to Perle JetStream, 
              LanStream, LinkStream, and IOLAN+ serial server customers and can 
              be downloaded from Perle's Web site at: <b>www.perle.com/downloads</b>.

            <p> <b>IBM Announces ProFibre Storage Array Subsystems </b>
            <p> IBM announced that the ProFibre Storage Array DF1100R RAID subsystem 
              is available and shipping to the company's Technology Group 
              distribution channel. Featuring RAID hardware and software technology 
              from Mylex (an IBM Company), the ProFibre Storage Array DF1100R 
              is good for clusters and storage area network (SANs).
            <p> According to the company, the ProFibre Storage Array is designed 
              for storage-intensive environments and by using fault-tolerant redundancy 
              features, such as hot swappable drives, dual cabling, dual RAID 
              controllers and interface modules, and dual power units and cooling 
              components, the 10-bay ProFibre Storage Array helps to ensure high 
              availability.
            <p> The company also says that software for the ProFibre Storage Array 
              enhances manageability and data availability. Mylex SANArray manager 
              enables easy configuration, monitoring and management of network 
              RAID from anywhere in the world via the Internet. PATHpilot provides 
              redundant path management and support for transparent failover/failback 
              to optimize data availability for SAN and clustered-server environments.
            <p> Constructed with vibration dampening material, the subsystem is 
              designed to reduce disk drive vibration, resulting in fewer misreads, 
              missed rotations, and faulty error messages. Adaptive cooling and 
              automatic environmental monitoring further improve reliability, 
              while reducing noise and vibration.
