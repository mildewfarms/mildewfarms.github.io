            As I mentioned in my February column, readers have recently expressed 
              interest in receiving additional AIX administration information. 
              We've aimed over the years in this magazine to present solutions 
              and tools that are UNIX general -- that is, applicable to many 
              or all flavors of UNIX with little modification. Providing that 
              type of broadly applicable information continues to be our goal, 
              but in response to these requests, we will also provide occasional 
              extra issues that allow for more specific coverage of topics.
            <p> I received a good response to my call for AIX-specific articles, 
              and I think this supplement offers a strong mix. Articles of particular 
              interest include Sandor Sklar's article on the AIX error logging 
              facility. Sklar explains how this logging tool works, and he shares 
              a script that checks the log for error messages, filters out common 
              error messages, and sends alerts. Mike Wilcox describes features 
              of the Network Dispatcher tool, and Primitivo Cervantes explains 
              how IBM's HAGEO product can be used for real-time remote data 
              mirroring. Rich Ferri (who also recently contributed a conference 
              report of the Extreme Linux Developer's Conference for UnixReview.com) 
              discusses in general terms IBM's commitment to Linux, and provides 
              a list of major Linux tools that IBM has ported to AIX.
            <p> You may have noticed another item inside the polybag this month. 
              IBM has put together a collection of Technology Papers especially 
              to accompany this issue that provides further AIX-specific information. 
              The collection is titled <i>AIX 5L: World Class UNIX with Linux 
              Affinity</i> and includes papers describing the use of the Web-Based 
              System Manager, AIX Workload Manager, and the Logical Volume Manager.
            <p> I hope this special issue and the accompanying technology papers 
              are helpful to all those <i>Sys Admin</i> readers who administer 
              AIX systems. Please send comments and suggestions to me at: <i>aankerholz@cmp.com</i>. 
              I look forward to hearing from you.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> 
            <p>
