            <p> <i>Elizabeth Zinkann</i>
            <p> AIX, based on AT&amp;T's UNIX System V, is IBM's UNIX 
              operating system. AIX (Advanced Interactive eXecutive) is most often 
              associated with the RS/6000 computers, although it is capable of 
              running on other architectures. Several books have been written 
              for AIX administrators, and I have reviewed most of them as they 
              appeared. The most recent publications have been written and published 
              by IBM Redbooks, and I have included a review of the <i>AIX Logical 
              Volume Manager from A to Z: Troubleshooting and Commands</i> by 
              Laurent Vanel, Ronald van derKnaap, Dugald Foreman, Keigo Matsubara, 
              and Anthony Steel (IBM International Technical Support Organization, 
              IBM Redbooks). I also reviewed <i>Accelerating AIX: Performance 
              Tuning for Programmers and System Administrators </i>by Rudy Chukran 
              (Addison-Wesley), plus a couple of brief summaries of AIX books 
              that I've reviewed in the past. The first, &AElig;leen Frisch's 
              <i>Essential System Administration</i>, Second Edition (O'Reilly 
              &amp; Associates, Inc.) isn't really an AIX book, but it has 
              enough AIX information to aid any AIX administrator. The second, 
              <i>AIX Performance Tuning</i> by Frank Waters (Prentice Hall), should 
              be a familiar reference for anyone running an AIX system.
            <p> A note about IBM Redbooks -- while researching and writing 
              this column, I became aware of IBM Redbooks, Redpieces, Redpapers, 
              and their related Residencies. There is a relatively new system 
              of Redbook Portals, which provides information about Redbooks in 
              each of the categories. Redbooks present the most recent books about 
              topics, such as RS/6000 and UNIX, Netfinity, Networking, Storage 
              and SAN, S/390, Tivoli, and the AS/400. Redpiece display the pre-publication 
              books, which may not be completed or proofread; Redpapers contain 
              shorter technical documents. The Residencies are proposed topics 
              that are currently under development. IBM's International Technical 
              Support Organization is responsible for the entire project. (Monterey 
              is in the RS/6000 and UNIX category, as is AIX.) 
            <p> Because the portals are a relatively new development, there are 
              several different formats of the Web address. However, all of them 
              are forwarded to the same URL, so that any variance in URLs will 
              work and will be pointed to:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://redbooks.ibm.com/
</pre>
            I tried that with several of the different addresses that I had, including:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.ibm.com/redbooks
</pre>
            I hope that this explains the different URLs that you may encounter 
            for this site, and also that this provides some useful information 
            about the ITSO Redbooks Portal.

            <p> When AIX started to become popular, the only documentation for 
              systems administrators was the IBM documentation. Anyone who wanted 
              a more detailed explanation that the manuals offered or who didn't 
              have access to the manuals couldn't do much about it. &AElig;leen 
              Frisch was one of the first authors to technically address the system 
              in the original <i>Essential System Administration </i>(O'Reilly 
              &amp; Associates, Inc.) In both the original and the second editions, 
              Frisch addresses AIX through numerous topics, such as printing, 
              networking, TCP/IP, initialization scripts, SMIT, disks and filesystems, 
              and special files. She explains the concept and implementations 
              of logical volume managers (LVMs) with exceptional clarity and describes 
              a superior approach to it, noting the advantages of the LVM, defining 
              its unique vocabulary, and detailing its use among the different 
              operating systems. Frisch presents the most direct and comprehensive 
              explanation of LVMs that I've read. <i>Essential System Administration</i> 
              is an extraordinary book that every systems administrator needs, 
              for installation, configuring, troubleshooting, or just understanding 
              the processes that are involved, whether for an AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, 
              or other flavor of UNIX, including Linux.
            <p> <b>Accelerating AIX: Performance Tuning for Programmers <br>
              and System Administrators</b><br>
              Rudy Chukran <br>

            <p> The concept of performance tuning is easy to understand -- 
              you want to make your system run better. Achieving optimum performance 
              is slightly more complex. In <i>Accelerating AIX</i>, Chukran discusses 
              four essential topics: tuning concepts, AIX system design and functions, 
              tools and remedies for the systems administrator, and parallel tools 
              and remedies for programmers. He approaches these varied aspects 
              of tuning through the following chapters: Introduction to Tuning 
              Concepts; AIX System Design; Tools for the System Administrator; 
              Remedies; Local Area Network Tuning; Programming Tools; Remedies 
              for Programmers; and Putting It All Together. The Appendix includes 
              References; Sources for AIX Software; Sources for Free Software 
              for AIX on the Net; Performance Toolbox Metrics; and Source Examples. 
              (The references and Internet resources have expanded, and the IBM 
              address has changed to <b>http://www.ibm.com/redbooks/</b>.)
            <p> In the introductory chapter, the author poses questions about 
              realistic performance tuning expectations versus idealistic hopes. 
              (Computer hardware does have its limitations.) The following chapter 
              examines the design of the AIX system and illustrates how the design 
              of AIX fits into the classic operating system design framework and 
              highlights some of its differences. Surveying some of the options 
              for the systems administrator, Chukran reviews selected tools that 
              analyze a system's current performance, including (but not 
              limited to) <b>vmstat</b>, <b>sar</b>, and <b>monitor</b>. He also 
              provides practical solutions to CPU and memory bottlenecks, emphasizing 
              performance that can be improved through better procedures versus 
              hardware upgrades. Chukran covers TCP/IP local area network (LAN) 
              performance problems and their respective solutions in a separate 
              chapter. 
            <p> The final topic that the author explores is directed to programmers. 
              Anyone who has written any programs beyond entry level knows that 
              there are various possible implementations. The initial effort fulfills 
              the program's specifications and hopefully works as expected. 
              In many cases, added refinements can make the program run faster 
              and more efficiently, utilizing fewer resources. Following Programming 
              Tools and Remedies for Programmers, Chukran concludes with Putting 
              It All Together, which summarizes the most important ideas and procedures 
              discussed throughout the book, as well as some practical guidelines 
              and considerations, including "When Do I Stop?"
            <p> Chukran's insight into AIX performance, tuning, and the accompanying 
              considerations provides a well-written introduction to system optimization. 
              The author's use of analogies and examples is particularly 
              good; he not only states them, but also extends them through his 
              examples. <i>Accelerating AIX</i> is an informative guide to AIX 
              performance tuning, which outlines the concepts and guidelines of 
              tuning procedures, describes the design of AIX, and demonstrates 
              various practical implementations.

            <p> The LVM (Logical Volume Manager) of AIX can be a challenge to 
              learn or to explain. Even its terms overlap with existing administration 
              vocabulary although their meanings are quite different. However, 
              once understood, the features of the LVM offer several advantages, 
              including dynamic extension. 
            <p> The <i>AIX Logical Volume Manager from A to Z</i> is a two-book 
              set, although they are sold separately. <i>Troubleshooting and Commands 
              </i>is the second volume; the first volume covers its Introduction 
              and Concepts (SG24-5432-00). The second volume is divided into two 
              primary sections: the informative chapters and the appendices, which 
              contain the LVM commands. The chapters address the LVM Commands, 
              Problem Determination and Recovery, and Replacing a Drive in a Mirrored 
              Configuration. The Appendices contain: A) High-level LVM commands, 
              B) Intermediate-level commands, C) ODM commands, D) Other related 
              commands, E) Scripts used during this residency, F) Special notices, 
              and G) Related publications. The introductory chapter, LVM Commands, 
              demonstrates how to utilize the LVM commands through four parts: 
              Volume group related commands, Logical volume related commands, 
              Physical volume related commands, and Journaled file system related 
              commands. The format of this chapter demonstrates how to use the 
              LVM through SMIT, with a reference to Appendix A for use through 
              the command line. 
            <p> The second chapter, Problem Determination and Recovery, features 
              the troubleshooting techniques, presents a methodology for detecting 
              a problem, searching output for diagnostic information, corruption 
              examples, inspection commands, rebuilding and repair, and special 
              considerations for rootvg. The contents of each section demonstrates, 
              in step-by-step format, how to check logs for information, how to 
              interpret the information found, and what steps are necessary to 
              restore data and integrity to a damaged system. The third chapter, 
              Replacing a Drive in a Mirrored Configuration, illustrates the nine 
              steps required to replace a failed physical volume and the use of 
              the <b>replacepv</b> command.

            <p> The appendices contain the LVM and other helpful commands, with 
              each command's syntax, description, options, how and when to 
              use the command, and notes that explain relevant information or 
              procedures. Each appendix begins with a brief introduction describing 
              the set of commands with that section. For example, Appendix A contains 
              the high-level LVM commands designed for both administrators and 
              users, whereas the LVM commands detailed in Appendix B (Intermediate-level 
              commands) are primarily for knowledgeable administrators.
            <p> <i>AIX Logical Volume Manager from A - Z: Troubleshooting and 
              Commands</i> provides AIX administrators with extensive information 
              about LVM procedures and an excellent command reference. The authors 
              describe the processes for both routine tasks and occasional troubleshooting 
              through a step-by-step format. Their detailed approach and superb 
              explanations create a valuable and effective resource. The team 
              of authors discusses the design concepts of the LVM, their practical 
              considerations, and utilizes numerous examples and illustrations 
              throughout the book. They also include the commands required and 
              tips for more effective and efficient use of LVM procedures. The 
              result is an excellent Logical Volume Manager guidebook for every 
              AIX administrator.

            <p> The practices and procedures related to maintaining an operating 
              system and its respective user environment are essential skills 
              for systems administrators. Regardless of the system, the administrator 
              must know what concepts are involved and how to achieve maximum 
              system performance. In <i>AIX Performance Tuning</i>, Waters explores 
              the different tools available, the design issues that are concerned, 
              and various ways to improve the system's production. Some of 
              the particular topics he addresses include: an AIX Resource Management 
              Overview, Performance Conscious Planning, Design and Implementation, 
              System Monitoring and Initial Performance Diagnosis, Monitoring 
              and Tuning CPU Use, Monitoring and Tuning Memory Use, Monitoring 
              and Tuning Disk I/O, Monitoring and Tuning Communications I/O, and 
              DFS Performance Tuning. He presents information about both Versions 
              3.2.5 and 4.1, detailing NFS, TCP, and UDP performance tuning, diagnosing 
              performance analysis, and examining what parameters can be changed 
              to attain better execution. This is an excellent guide to AIX performance 
              tuning. Waters covers the essential resources and provides most 
              of the references that you need. (However, some of the URLs may 
              have changed in the interim.) <i>AIX Performance Tuning</i> examines 
              the topics that comprise any attempt, simple or complex, to improve 
              system throughput and general performance.
