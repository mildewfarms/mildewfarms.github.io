            <H1><b>Questions and Answers</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Jim McKinstry and Amy Rich</i>
            <p><i> </i><b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an AIX machine where 
              <b>/var</b> keeps filling up, and I need to make it bigger. How 
              do I increase the size of my <b>/var </b>filesystem, and where does 
              the space come from?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> The space comes from the free 
              physical partitions in the volume group in which your partition 
              (the one you want to increase) resides. A volume group consists 
              of physical volumes that are made up of physical partitions. The 
              logical volumes (e.g.,<b> /var</b>, <b>/usr</b>,<b> /</b>) then 
              consist of the physical partitions. Your<b> /var</b> logical volume 
              is probably in <b>rootvg</b>, so you can do an:
            <p> 
            <pre>
lsvg -p rootvg
</pre>
            to see the physical volumes in the volume group <b>rootvg</b>. If 
            you have the free physical partitions in <b>rootvg</b>, you can do 
            the following to increase <b>/var </b>to be 100 Mb by doing the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
chfs -a size='102400' /var
</pre>
            For more information on the Logical Volume Manager, you may want to 
            take a look at IBM's Redbooks (search for LVM):
            <p>

http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/pubs/html/redbooks/
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've heard of some people creating 
            ramdisks under AIX, but I can't find out how from the documentation.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> Ramdisks are a new feature in 
              4.3.3, and are still unsupported. Prior to that, the best you could 
              hope for was to modify the RAM disk buffer. As of 4.3.3, you can 
              create a ramdisk by doing the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
mkramdisk &lt;size&gt;
/dev/rramdiskxx
mkfs -V jfs /dev/ramdiskxx
mount -V jfs -o nointegrity /dev/ramdiskxx /your_mount_point
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Where can I pick up precompiled freeware 
            packages for AIX 4.3?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> IBM has a number of GNU tools 
              precompiled at the following site:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.ibm.com/servers/aix/products/aixos/linux/
</pre>
            There's also another site that carries more packages than just 
            GNU, and the packages are in SMIT-installable format:
            <p>

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I want to upgrade my AIX machines, 
            but it doesn't boot off the CD-ROM when one is in the drive. 
            How do I make it see the CD-ROM?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> This depends on the model of machine 
              you have. If you have an older machine and there's a key, turn 
              the key to service mode and reboot. If you don't have a key, 
              you can press the "5" key when the machine gets to checking 
              the speaker (it should say "speaker") during the boot 
              process. You can also just change the boot list by doing the following 
              (assuming that your normal boot list is just hdisk0 and your CD 
              is in cd0):
            <p> 
            <pre>
bootlist -m normal cd0 hdisk0
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> How do I create a custom-bootable 
            CD to install new AIX 4.3.3 machines?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> You can use the <b>mkcd</b> command 
              to make a backup image of a system that's installed to your 
              specifications. Using <b>mkcd</b>, you can create three types of 
              CDs: personal system backup, "generic", and non-bootable 
              volume group backup. If you select generic, you can then boot and 
              install any RS/6000 platform (<b>rspc</b>, <b>rs6k</b>, or <b>chrp</b>). 
              This backup requires all the necessary device support, including 
              the MP kernel, to create the boot images for all three platforms. 
              This type of backup also requires a user-supplied and previously 
              created <b>mksysb</b> image. Extra software is needed to create 
              the Rock Ridge format CDs. Take a look in <b>/usr/sbin/mkrr_fs</b> 
              and <b>/usr/sbin/burn_cd</b> for the programs that create the filesystem 
              and write it out to the CD. Also look in <b>/usr/samples/oem_cdwriters</b> 
              for some different vendor-specific sample shell scripts. The <b>mkcd</b> 
              man page includes more information and explains what each flag does.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have an 43P running AIX 4.3 
              and I am trying to change the network interface from a static IP 
              to using DHCP, but things don't seem to be working correctly. 
              I use <b>smitty</b> and get to the part about the network, and I 
              delete the old IP information. When I exit and go back into <b>smitty</b>, 
              though, they're still there! How do I make my machine a DHCP 
              client?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> We'll say that you're 
              using the ent0 Ethernet interface. Do the following to shut down 
              the interface and remove it:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ifconfig en0 down
ifconfig en0 detach
rmdev -dl en0
</pre>
            Because you've been trying to change things already, you may 
            have already enabled DHCP service, so shut that down:
            <p> 
            <pre>
stopsrc -s dhcpsd
</pre>
            Now use <b>smitty</b> to go create the interface again:
            <p> 
            <pre>
smitty mkinet
</pre>
            Choose "Add a Standard Ethernet Network Interface". It should 
            show that en0 is available. Exit out and run:
            <p> 
            <pre>
smitty mktcpip
</pre>
            filling in all of the required fields. To actually configure the interface 
            to use DHCP, run:
            <p> 
            <pre>
smitty tcpip
</pre>
            and choose "Use DHCP for TCPIP Configuration &amp; Startup". 
            After you press enter, it should create an empty en0 interface using 
            <b>cfgmgr</b>. After it finishes, exit out of <b>smitty</b> again, 
            and you can check to see that the device was created by doing:
            <p> 
            <pre>
lsdev -C|grep en0
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Where can I get the AIX program Sysback, 
            used to create emergency recovery tapes?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> Sysback (actually called AIX Sysback 
              Backup &amp; Recovery/6000) does not come with AIX. It's a 
              separate product offered from IBM. You can get it by contacting 
              your IBM account representative or reseller, calling 1-800-IBM-4-YOU, 
              or by going to: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.ibm.com/
</pre>
            and clicking on "ShopIBM". There's also a third-party 
            piece of software called Storix Backup Administrator: 
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.storix.net/
</pre>
            that provides a better interface and more functionality.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running AIX 4.3.2 and 
              can't seem to read any man pages with the <b>man</b> command 
              (and <b>catman</b> doesn't work, either). What am I doing wrong?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> The man pages are not installed 
              by default. Most likely you don't have them on your system. 
              Check by doing the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
lslpp -l | grep bos.html
</pre>
            If you don't see the below sets, you need to install them. You'll 
            need to put in the "Base Documentation" CD-ROM and install 
            the following sets:
            <p> 
            <pre>
bos.html.en_US.cmds.cmds1
bos.html.en_US.cmds.cmds2
bos.html.en_US.cmds.cmds3
bos.html.en_US.cmds.cmds4
bos.html.en_US.cmds.cmds5
bos.html.en_US.cmds.cmds6
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running AIX 4.3, and I want 
            to reclaim some space from my paging volume (hd6). How would I go 
            about reducing the size of the swap partition when it's always 
            in use by the system?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> IBM has a technote that describes 
              how to do this by creating a new, smaller temporary paging space 
              (assuming you have some free PPs), and then disabling the old one. 
              They highly suggest that you then remake the default paging space 
              on hd6 because some scripts are hardcoded to use it.

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> How do I turn on large file support 
            on the fly with AIX? What's the maximum file size I can have?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> AIX does not allow turning on 
              large file support on the fly. Large file support is an option that's 
              determined at filesystem creation time. Journaled filesystems on 
              AIX 3.2.5 and preceding versions are limited to 2 GB per filesystem 
              (no large file support). With AIX 4.1, IBM allows filesystems up 
              to 2 GB, and AIX 4.2 and above allows 64 GB files.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're about to upgrade to 
              AIX 4.3.3, but it appears that IBM ships with an ancient version 
              of Sendmail (8.9.3). It claims to have bug fixes and anti-spam features, 
              but it doesn't ship the anti-spam stuff in the configuration 
              file by default. How do I get the anti-spam stuff in my <b>sendmail.cf</b>?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> Your best answer is probably to 
              scrap the installed Sendmail stuff and install the latest Sendmail 
              software from:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.sendmail.org/
</pre>
            You'll need m4, either the GNU version or from the fileset <b>bos.adt.base</b>. 
            If you want to actually stick with what IBM ships you, then you'll 
            want the Sendmail macros from <b>bos.net.tcp.adt</b> and the m4 binary 
            mentioned above. The configuration macros are stored in<b> /usr/samples/tcpip/sendmail</b>, 
            along with READMEs that contain information about generating your 
            own customized <b>sendmail.cf</b>. Be sure to look at <b>/usr/samples/tcpip/sendmail/cf/aix433.mc</b> 
            and <b>/usr/samples/tcpip/sendmail/ostype/aix433.m4</b>. You'll 
            also want to look at the Sendmail 8.9 anti-relaying page:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.sendmail.org/tips/relaying.html
</pre>
            and the Sendmail 8.8 anti-spam page:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.sendmail.org/antispam.html
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> What's the difference between 
            interfaces en0 and et0 under AIX? Should I have both of them?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> En0 and et0 refer to different 
              kinds of framing for the ent0 device. The commonly used frame for 
              TCP/IP is DIX, corresponding to the en0 interface. The et0 interface 
              uses IEEE 802.3 framing. While both framing types can coexist on 
              the wire, the majority of applications these days are TCP/IP, and 
              there's no reason to configure 802.3 for TCP/IP unless you 
              know you have a need for it.
