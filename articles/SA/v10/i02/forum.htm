            Upon the release of our successful Solaris administration supplement 
            last November, several readers expressed interest in a similar issue 
            related to AIX administration. We aim to please, so we're planning 
            to produce an AIX special issue to mail with our May 2001 issue. We're 
            now looking for articles to include in that issue. The articles proposed 
            should relate directly to AIX configuration and problem solving. Joe 
            Casad has devised this list of possible topics: 
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Description of a useful AIX tool or feature that isn't 
                present in other UNIX versions. The article should describe how 
                to use this feature and provide concrete examples 
              <li> Explanation of a configuration task that is different in AIX 
                than in other UNIX systems 
              <li> AIX-5L -- A preview 
              <li> AIX security -- Tips for hardening your AIX host 
              <li> AIX integration -- Interoperating AIX with other UNIX systems 
            </ul>
            <p> If you're an AIX expert, please send your proposal for an 
              article to me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>. Proposals are due asap, 
              and manuscripts will be due soon! I look forward to working with 
              you to make the AIX issue valuable to our readers. 
            <p> In this issue, we include several articles related to Web administration. 
              Charles Walker and Larry Bennett provide an excellent overview of 
              CGI scripts and describe some tips for safer scripting. Charles 
              Leonard presents an application called Spamivore that attacks spam 
              at its source by disabling those insidious email address harvesting 
              agents. Also, Brett Lymn begins a short series on NFS failover -- 
              this month, he explains how to implement Sun's <b>cachefs</b> 
              feature to solve certain problems. 
            <p> Look for more Web- and network-related solutions in next month's 
              <i>Sys Admin</i>, and let me know if there's a specific topic 
              you'd like to see. As always, I hope you enjoy the magazine. 
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours, 
            <p>
