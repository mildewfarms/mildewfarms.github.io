            <p> Everyone uses the Domain Name System; systems and network administrators 
              (hopefully) understand it. In <i>Linux DNS Server Administration</i>, 
              Craig Hunt discusses and details the related concepts and implementation 
              of DNS within the Linux operating system environment. Hunt addresses 
              this topic through four major sections plus the Appendixes. The 
              divisions include: How Things Work, Essential Configuration, Advanced 
              Configurations, and Maintaining a Healthy System. Part 1, How Things 
              Work, explores The DNS Architecture, The DNS Protocols, and The 
              BIND Software. The author surveys the <b>/etc/hosts</b> file, Internet 
              protocols, the format of the DNS message, the <b>named</b> command 
              and how to enable it within both BSD and System V Linux systems, 
              how to compile new BIND releases, and optional ways to install BIND. 
              The Essential Configuration section analyzes Configuring the Resolver, 
              Caching and Slave Server Configuration, and Creating a Master Server. 
              These chapters discuss default configurations, the basic configuration 
              files (<b>resolv.conf</b>, <b>host.conf</b>, <b>nsswitch.conf</b>, 
              and <b>named.conf</b>) plus the commands and directives used within 
              them. In Advanced Configurations, Hunt describes Creating Subdomains, 
              Special BIND Configuration, Dynamic DNS and their options, advantages, 
              and disadvantages. Maintaining a Healthy System illustrates DNS 
              Security, Testing DNS, and the BIND Log Files. The security chapter 
              includes basic hardware and software security, encryption, authentication, 
              and some aspects of firewalls. The BIND log files reviews the dump, 
              statistics, and trace files, system messages, and configuring logging 
              capabilities. The appendixes comprise: A) BIND 9, B) <b>named.conf</b> 
              Command Reference, C) Resource Record Reference, and D) Configuring 
              Network Information Service. 
            <p> <i>Linux DNS Server Administration</i> provides administrators 
              with an invaluable and comprehensive reference. Good documentation 
              is often elusive; great explanations are rare. Hunt presents a thorough 
              and knowledgeable explanation of DNS and BIND for the Linux operating 
              system. I used it almost immediately for confirmation, research, 
              and procedures. Hunt's well-written descriptions and examples 
              combined with his extensive expertise make <i>Linux DNS Server Administration</i> 
              an outstanding and dynamic reference for every Linux administrator.

            <p> In his latest edition, Kennedy once again provides the reader 
              with a remarkable treasure trove of information, references, and 
              procedures. Written in English (as opposed to acronyms, geekspeak, 
              and technobabble), the author describes how a search engine (or 
              MP3 or a newsgroup, etc.) works, what resources you need to access 
              it, and the basic processes to do it. Kennedy presents information 
              through four sections: Basics, The Guide, Contexts, and the ISP 
              Directory. 
            <p> The first part, Basics, contains most of the book's explanations. 
              The initial section includes chapters on: FAQs, Getting Connected, 
              Connection Software, The Web Browser, Connecting, Surfing the Web, 
              Email, Mailing Lists, Newsgroups, Downloading Software, Finding 
              It, Chat, Shopping, MP3 and Online Radio, Online Gaming, Creating 
              Your Own Web Page, and On the Road. The second section, The Guide, 
              features a bountiful selection of World Wide Web Sites plus a Software 
              Roundup. Contexts, the following section, surveys A Brief History 
              of the Net, Net Language, and a Glossary, while the concluding section, 
              ISP Directory, provides Internet Service Providers and 51 Things 
              To Do. The newest additions to the book are the Shopping and MP3 
              chapters; the latter also details some distinctions of copyright 
              law and what practices are illegal. Many of the chapters must be 
              read to be thoroughly appreciated. For example, the chapter entitled 
              Internet Service Providers isn't just a listing of ISPs; it 
              also includes questions to ask, basic features to expect, and costs 
              to consider. The "Finding It" chapter demonstrates how 
              to search effectively (and successfully) for a topic and The Guide 
              furnishes over 2000 sites and subjects to explore. 
            <p> This is an outstanding book on the Internet's features and 
              techniques. Kennedy's direct approach and straightforward analyses 
              enable <i>The Rough Guide to the Internet</i> to be a reference 
              as well as a resource. Its 4-inch by 5.75-inch size makes it an 
              "anywhere reference", ideally suited for both the mobile 
              user and readers in the more traditional desktop computing environment. 
              The number of topics and the amount of accompanying information 
              is amazing. Whether Kennedy used compression, optimization, or just 
              plain magic, the result is a large Internet resource in a small 
              package. Both beginning surfers and experienced navigators will 
              appreciate its compact size and encyclopedic content.

            <p> The dynamic technology of PC hardware continues to advance at 
              an amazing speed. A hardware technician barely has time to assemble 
              a system before the next new development is released. With new processors 
              and chipsets, there are different architectures and motherboards 
              to consider. As I write this, there are Socket 7, Socket 8, Slot 
              1, Slot A, Socket 370, and Socket A, to mention the most popular 
              selections. (Pentium 4 is on the horizon; Crusoe is just debuting 
              in select notebooks.) Implementation is not always easily or smoothly 
              achieved, as the number of newsgroup postings asking for help indicates. 
            <p> <i>PC Hardware in a Nutshell</i> provides many excellent resources 
              and guidelines. The Thompsons discuss buying considerations, detail 
              installation procedures, and summarize data in easily referenced 
              tables. The authors begin the book with two general chapters: Fundamentals 
              and Working on PCs. These address PC components, upgrading, buying 
              practices, tools, and some basic installation techniques. They feature 
              the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of computer components and 
              peripherals including: Motherboards, Processors, Memory, Floppy 
              Disk Drives, Removable Hard Disk Drives, Tape Drives, CD-R and CD-RW 
              Drives, DVD Drives, Monitors, Sound Cards, Game Controllers, Cases, 
              and Power Supplies. The concluding chapters demonstrate Designing 
              A PC and Building A PC. The authors also present their favorite 
              components at the end of each chapter through a section called Our 
              Picks. They offer updates, current developments, an email address 
              for reader's questions and comments, and book Errata on their 
              Web site: <b>http://www.hardwareguys.com</b>. 
            <p> <i>PC Hardware in a Nutshell</i> is a superb book for anyone upgrading 
              or maintaining a system (and learning how to do it). The Thompsons 
              share favorite tips and techniques, demonstrate how to upgrade (or 
              build) a system, and identify when upgrading just isn't worth 
              it. 
            <p> The design process is usually the most time consuming part of 
              system assembly; one of the most important sentences in the chapter 
              appears in the introduction: 
            <p> "When you design a system, the most you can hope for is to 
              choose good components at a good price at that moment in time." 
              (Page 425) 
            <p> (Usually, everything is less expensive and faster two weeks later, 
              unless you decide to wait two weeks.) The final chapter, Building 
              a PC, shows the reader exactly how to assemble a computer, both 
              through step-by-step descriptions and accompanying photographs. 
              Throughout the book, the authors illustrate their extensive knowledge 
              of computer hardware complexities, identify problems you may encounter, 
              and relate frustration-saving procedures. <i>PC Hardware in a Nutshell</i> 
              is must for anyone upgrading or building a computer system.

            <p> Databases provide an organized way to store information for full 
              or partial retrieval and routine access. Whether your database is 
              a simple collection of names and addresses for a mailing list or 
              a more complex description of inventory that changes daily, it can 
              be maintained through MySQL. Available for both Open Source and 
              Windows platforms, MySQL easily interfaces with Perl, PHP, and Apache. 
              <i>MySQL</i> by Paul DuBois presents a straightforward and interesting 
              way to learn and implement the features of MySQL for your individual 
              databases. 
            <p> DuBois addresses the concepts and programming constructs of MySQL 
              through four major sections: General MySQL Use, Using MySQL Programming 
              Interfaces, MySQL Administration, and the Appendices. The first 
              section contains an Introduction to MySQL and SQL, Working with 
              Data in MySQL, MySQL SQL Syntax and Use, and Query Optimization. 
              The author presents a MySQL Tutorial and describes two examples 
              (The U.S. Historical League and a Grade-keeping scenario), which 
              he uses throughout the text. He then illustrates the commands to 
              create and use them. In Query Optimization, DuBois demonstrates 
              which query combinations are the most efficient and economize system 
              resources most effectively. The second section, Using MySQL Programming 
              Interfaces, includes: an Introduction to MySQL Programming, The 
              MySQL C API, The Perl DBI API, and the PHP API. In the following 
              part, MySQL Administration, DuBois discusses an Introduction to 
              MySQL Administration, The MySQL Data Directory, General MySQL Administration, 
              Security, and Database Maintenance and Repair. The final section, 
              Appendices, details A) Obtaining and Installing Software, B) Column 
              Type Reference, C) Operator and Function Reference, D) SQL Syntax 
              Reference, E) MySQL Program Reference, F) C API Reference, G) Perl 
              DBI API Reference, H) PHP API Reference, I) Useful Third-Party Tools, 
              and J) Internet Service Providers. 
            <p> The book <i>MySQL</i> (to differentiate it from the program) describes 
              the uses, processes, whys, and wherefores of database programming 
              with MySQL. DuBois not only demonstrates how to implement an RDBS 
              (relational database system), but also how to do it efficiently. 
              His use of the examples clearly illustrates the programming concepts 
              by showing how to create and achieve the properties within the two 
              databases. This is a superior guide to MySQL creation and use that 
              will simplify MySQL for programmers, Web designers, and administrators.
