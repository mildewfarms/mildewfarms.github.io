            <p><b> Starfire Announces Network Computing Manager </b>
            <p> Starfire Engineering &amp; Technologies, Inc. announced the January 
              2001 release of Starfire Titan, the Network Computing Manager. Starfire 
              Titan provides browser-based, centralized administration for OS/2, 
              WorkSpace On-Demand, AIX, Windows NT/2000, and Linux environments. 
              Starfire Titan enables an administrator to launch tasks by answering 
              only a few questions via a Web browser interface. 
            <p> Starfire Titan allows complex, multi-step tasks to be defined 
              once and delivered to multiple customers. Then the IT staff responds 
              to a few questions and Starfire Titan completes the task for them. 
              It provides browser-based, cross-platform management of network 
              computing resources enterprise-wide. Starfire Titan is built on 
              a foundation of open standards including Java, TCP/IP, HTML, XML, 
              and SSL/TLS. 
            <p> Starfire Titan "stores" the intellectual property required 
              to accomplish a task, and therefore enables anyone with the proper 
              access to perform even the most complex tasks. The IT staff is freed 
              from the need to research, develop, and test solutions to the same 
              problems repeatedly. Titan activities can be customer built to extend 
              and customize the Starfire Titan investment. Additionally, Titan 
              activities can be purchased from the Starfire Titan Partners. Starfire 
              Titan can be further extended to support additional environments 
              and vendor products. 
            <p> Starfire Titan will be generally available in January 2001. For 
              additional information, contact: <i>Starfire Engineering &amp; Technologies,

            <p> <b>ADVA Optical Networking Announces DiskLink</b> 
            <p> ADVA Optical Networking announced SCSI over IP capability to its 
              DiskLink SAN interconnect gateway. The new Gigabit Ethernet interface 
              added to DiskLink as an alternative to existing ATM OC-3 and OC-12 
              wide area interfaces allows customers to build storage networks 
              over IP backbone networks, such as intranets and Virtual Private 
              Networks. SCSI over IP permits business-critical SAN applications, 
              such as data replication and remote tape backup, to operate on existing 
              IP networks. ADVA's DiskLink is able to combine storage traffic 
              from local Fibre Channel SANs and SCSI-based storage devices for 
              transmission to remote sites over ATM or broadband IP networks. 
              In effect, DiskLink allows local SANs to be interconnected to create 
              an enterprise-wide SAN. 
            <p> DiskLink provides a high-performance alternative to NAS (Network 
              Attached Storage) by connecting storage devices (disks and tapes) 
              directly to a broadband IP network and carrying storage traffic 
              in IP packets, thus avoiding the server bottleneck. DiskLink can 
              carry storage traffic at several times the rate in a NAS environment, 
              significantly reducing server loading and backup times. For more 
              information, contact: <i>ADVA AG Optical Networking, Fraunhoferstrasse

            <p> <b>Rave Computer Adds Redundant Disk Array</b> 
            <p> Rave Computer Association, Inc. announced a redundant 4U disk 
              array to provide data solutions for storage requirements and for 
              applications requiring high-performance, fault-tolerant data storage. 
              The Rave Systems Redundant Disk Array features nine drive bays, 
              including eight drive canisters. Each drive canister provides visual 
              SCSI target ID and has two additional LEDs -- one for power 
              and the other for disk drive activity. 
            <p> The Rave Systems Redundant Disk Array can be configured as a JBOD 
              or for a variety of RAID levels including 0, 1, 3, and 5 via Ultra2 
              SCSI LVD single or dual RAID controller. These RAID functions can 
              provide the user with high data availability and protection by using 
              capabilities like automatic drive failure detection, hot stand-by, 
              automatic rebuilding, hot swapping, and online background rebuilding. 
              Additional configurations include dual-port or multi-bus SCSI configurations. 
              This system is Ultra160 compliant. 
            <p> According to the company, continuous operation of the system is 
              assured by the system's dual hot-swappable 300-watt (N+1) current 
              sharing power supplies that have dual power receptacles. Data integrity 
              is ensured by also providing the battery power to the internal cache 
              in the event of power loss. The chassis also has two 80-mm 43CFM 
              exhaust fans. There is an audible warning for any faults that occur 
              with any of the power supplies. Additionally, users have the option 
              of choosing a tower RAID subsystem with the same configurations 
              as the 4U rack.

            <p> <b>Macro 4's UniQPrint Announces Output Management to Linux 
              Users</b> 
            <p> Macro 4 launced UniQPrint for Linux, an output management for 
              printing, faxing, and Web site postings. Macro 4's UniQPrint 
              provides management facilities for all printing devices in an open 
              systems network. According to the company, UniQPrint's new 
              enterprise GUI (graphical user interface) replaces product-specific 
              interfaces with a single user-friendly Windows GUI, simplifying 
              print management for all users, operations staff, and end users. 
              Automatic print delivery ensures that reports created on remote 
              server machines can be routed around the open systems environment 
              in a secure and managed fashion. 
            <p> So far, UniQPrint has successfully run on several releases of 
              Linux, including RedHat 6.x, SuSE. 6.x, and Caldera OpenLinux 2.x. 
              Due to the nature of UniQPrint coding, the program is easily portable 
              to other versions of Linux, usually without change to the code.
