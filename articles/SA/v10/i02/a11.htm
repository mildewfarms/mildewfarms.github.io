            <H1><b><img src="../../resource/questions.gif" width="200" height="100" align="right">Questions 
              and Answers</b> </h1>
            <p> <i>Jim McKinstry and Amy Rich</i> 
            <p> I recently answered a Solaris question and said that you should 
              get to an "ok" prompt to set an <b>eeprom</b> variable. 
              I received a couple of emails letting me know that a "better 
              way" is to use the <b>eeprom</b> command (e.g., <b>eeprom boot-device='disk1:a 
              disk net'</b>). Todd A. Fiedler sent me a better, well-written explanation 
              than what I originally provided: 
            <p> The fourth question deals with determining the logical name (of 
              a disk) from the instance name. While the author's answer was 
              correct, I don't feel that it was really the answer the writer 
              was looking for. A better way to illustrate this is to point out 
              the relationship between the devices under <b>/dev/dsk</b> and the 
              path into<b> /devices</b> that the symbolic links point to. An example 
              is outlined below (some elements of the <b>ls</b> output are omitted): 
            <p> 
            <pre> $ ls -l c*t*d*s2
 
 c0t0d0s2 -&gt; ../../devices/pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/ide@3/dad@0,0:c
 c0t1d0s2 -&gt; ../../devices/pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/ide@3/dad@1,0:c
 c0t2d0s2 -&gt; ../../devices/pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/ide@3/sd@2,0:c
 
</pre>
            You can then look in the <b>/etc/path_to_inst</b> file for the disk 
            in question. 
            <p> 
            <pre> $ grep dad@0,0 /etc/path_to_inst
 
 "/pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/ide@3/dad@0,0" 0 "dad"
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^ ^^^
 physical path | |
 | +--&lt; device type
 |
 ^
 instance number
 
</pre>
            You can see that the instance name for the logical device <b>c0t0d0</b> 
            is therefore <b>dad0</b>. The instance name is useful when viewing 
            the output of commands like <b>iostat</b> <b>-x</b> and <b>sar -d</b>. 
            Listing 1 is a script I like to use for determining this relationship 
            between disks. 
            <p> Thanks to everyone who provides feedback! Jim 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Our operating system is Sun OS 
              5.6 (Solaris 2.6) on a Sun Ultra 3000 workstation. We have one production 
              system and one backup-plus-testing system using the same OS. I have 
              encountered a problem related to <b>ftp</b> on these two machines. 
              When I <b>ftp</b> from the backup machine to get a file of about 
              600 million bytes on the production machine, the <b>ftp</b> fails. 
              The <b>ftp</b> looks like (every time): 150 Binary data connection 
              for <b>mcfee.tar.Z ....</b>(614507802 bytes). After a while, the 
              transfer hangs. I kill it with a <b>^C</b> and I get: 
            <p> 
            <pre> 421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection
 local: mcfee.tar.Z
 remote: mcfee.tar.Z
 614507802 bytes received in 3.6e+03 seconds (164.91 kbytes/s)
 
</pre>
            Then I get out of <b>ftp</b>. 
            <p> Why did the <b>ftp</b> hang when it apparently finished the transfer? 
              (I have no problem transferring files smaller in size.) Is there 
              a limit on file size when using <b>ftp</b>? If so, is there any 
              other way to get around it? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> <b>ftp</b> doesn't have 
              any hard limitations as far as file size or time of transfer. After 
              looking at this, we noticed that the time the transfer was 3.6e+03, 
              which equals 3600 seconds, which equals 60 minutes or 1 hour. When 
              the admin who submitted the question looked a little harder, he 
              found that his firewall had <b>TPC session timeout</b> set to 1 
              hour. Modifying this allowed the larger, longer transfer to take 
              place. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I just added a new storage unit 
              to my system and want to migrate my data from my old disks to my 
              new, faster storage. The question is how do I do that without bringing 
              my application down? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The easiest way to do this is 
              as follows: 
            <p> 
            <p> 1. If you are not currently using some kind of LVM (Logical Volume 
              Manager) tool, then install one. (I like Veritas' Volume Manager.) 
            <p> 2. Configure your new storage to look like the old storage. (Actually, 
              the LUNs on the new storage just need to be greater than, or equal 
              to, the size of the LUNs of the old storage. The new storage should 
              have at least as many LUNs as the old storage.) 
            <p> 3. Using the LVM, import the new LUNs so that each old LUN is 
              now paired with a new LUN (of equal or greater size). 
            <p> 4. Now, using the LVM, mirror the old LUNs with the new LUNs. 
            <p> 5. Let the disks sync-up. 
            <p> 6. Using a "split mirror" facility (all the "good" 
              LVMs out there do this), split the old disks out of the mirrors, 
              (or you could take a more brute-force approach and just turn off 
              the old storage, which will cause the LVM to run off of the mirrored 
              disk (i.e., the new storage). 
            <p> 7. At this point, you are now running on the new storage. 
            <p> 8. Now that you are running off of the new storage, go back into 
              the LVM and disassociate the old storage from the new storage. You 
              can now recycle the old storage. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I wanted to use a Jumpstart profile 
              to install everything under the <b>root</b> directory. I could not 
              seem to come up with a profile that could accomplish this task. 

              The installation always complains about file system <b>/usr</b> 
              and <b>/export/home</b>. It seems to me that Jumpstart wants to 
              create separate file systems for these two directories. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> In your profile you need to have 
              the following (assuming you want 256 M for swap and want to devote 
              the rest of the disk to <b>/</b>): 
            <p> 
            <pre> partitioning explicit
 filesys c0t3d0s0 free /
 filesys c0t3d0s1 256 swap

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Our DNS servers have names that have 
            nothing to do with their functions. Is it possible to refer to them 
            also as <b>ns1.domain.com</b>, <b>ns2.domain.com</b>, etc? Can I register 
            them with OpenSRS this way? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can have users refer to your 
              nameservers as <b>nsX.domain.com</b> for other services (e.g., <b>ssh</b>, 
              <b>telnet</b>, <b>ftp</b>, etc.) by using <b>CNAMEs</b> in your 
              zone files, but anything that you give to a domain registrar and 
              any other records should reference the real name. No other records 
              in your zone files can reference a <b>CNAME</b>: 
            <p> 
            <pre> IN NS realname.domain.com.
 IN NS realname2.domain.com.
 IN MX 10 realname.domain.com.
 
 $ORIGIN domain.com.
 
 realname IN A 192.168.5.1
 realname2 IN A 192.168.8.1

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I need to replace a CPU on an Enterprise 
            6500. Can I just pull the system board out and hot swap the CPU? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There are quite a few requirements 
              to hot swapping a system board. For instance, the CPU board can 
              not be removed if it contains interleaved memory or if it's 
              listed in the <b>cfgadm</b> status report (<b>cfgadm -s cols=ap_id:type:info</b>) 
              as non-detachable or permanent. Most servers usually have interleaved 
              memory; you're probably out of luck. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I was just given an old pm2e and 
              I'd like to use it as a console server for some Sparc 20s. 
              I have my machines hooked up, but I'm not sure how to actually 
              connect to them. I know with the old Sun NTS servers you needed 
              to type "<b>cli</b>" and then enter the port number, but 
              that doesn't appear to be the case here. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Make sure you're using a 
              null modem cable to connect the Suns to the pm and that you've 
              disabled or changed (depending on your OS revision) the break sequence 
              so that rebooting the pm doesn't send a break signal to your 
              Suns and drop them to the "ok" prompt. After you have 
              the machines connected with the correct cables, <b>telnet</b> to 
              the pm and do <b>attach sX</b> (where X is your port number). 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an Ultra 10 on which I 
              need to install Solaris 2.6. I know there are some issues with it 
              being IDE and possibly needing a "helper" CD. What exactly 
              do I need to get this machine working? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The minimal OS release you need 
              depends on the model of the system board inside your Ultra 10. If 
              you have system board 375-009, then you can use 2.6 3/98. If you 
              have anything later, you need 2.6 5/98. In any case, 5/98 is the 
              recommended revision of 2.6 for all machines at this point. The 
              "helper CD" you refer to is the Operation Environment 
              Installation CD. You only need this if your CPU is faster than 419 
              MHz.
