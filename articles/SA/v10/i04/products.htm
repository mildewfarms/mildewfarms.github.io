            <p><b> Aduva Announces Network-Based Service to Automate Management 
              of Multi-System Linux Networks</b>
            <p> Aduva, Inc. announced the introduction of the Aduva Director, 
              a network-based solution that automates the system management of 
              multiple, networked Linux systems. The solution was designed for 
              multi-system, commercial Linux users regardless of installation 
              size or heterogeneity. According to the company, it addresses the 
              need for system management tasks such as upgrades, patches, and 
              new hardware driver and software installations to ensure system 
              reliability and component compatibility.
            <p> The central foundation of the Aduva Director is the Aduva Knowledge 
              Base, which includes conflict and dependency information on hardware 
              driver, software, and kernel module components for Linux systems. 
              This repository grows and is updated based on new products, upgrades, 
              patches, security notices, and other developments in the Linux community.
            <p> The Aduva Director software is installed on the system's 
              central administration server. A local software client is also installed 
              on each individual system in the network. The local software client 
              maintains an inventory and profile of all hardware, software, and 
              kernel module components and makes this information available to 
              notify the administration server about developments. No user configuration 
              information is sent to Aduva, so the solution is secure.
            <p> For more information about the Aduva Director, contact: <i>Aduva

            <p> <b>TimeSys Launches Linux/RT Version 2.0</b>
            <p> TimeSys announced TimeSys Linux/RT Version 2.0, a Linux distribution 
              with features to meet embedded real-time quality-of-service requirements. 
              TimeSys Linux/RT Version 2.0 is a QoS solution that operates within 
              the Linux kernel, rather than running as an additional layer beneath 
              Linux. 
            <p> Designed for a wide array of applications, including telecommunications, 
              automotive, defense, and embedded electronic, TimeSys Linux/RT Version 
              2.0 can provide real-time responses in devices that run on the Linux 
              operating system. For example, a Linux-based operating system may 
              be used to power an Internet appliance for use in the home. This 
              appliance can regularly be required to stream video from the Internet, 
              receive voice-over-IP phone calls, search the Internet, and may 
              be linked to a home security system. TimeSys Linux/RT Version 2.0 
              could allow each of these functions to take place in a predictable 
              window of time, allocating priority levels to the most important 
              functions -- in this case the home security system.
            <p> The TimeSys Resource Kernel is housed directly within the Linux 
              kernel, which allows standard Linux applications and device drivers 
              to gain real-time responsiveness and quality-of-service enhancements. 
              Additional TimeSys Linux/RT Version 2.0 features include: 
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> A fully preemptible platform 
              <li> CPU and network reservations 
              <li> Priority inheritance 
              <li> Priority ceiling protocol 
              <li> A high-resolution timer 
              <li> 256 fixed-priority levels 
              <li> Periodic thread support

            <p> <b>PolyServe Announces Server Clustering Software</b>
            <p> PolyServe, a provider of systems software for the Internet data 
              center, introduced LocalCluster Enterprise, a new high-availability 
              server clustering solution for data replication of Web- and IP-based 
              services. According to the company, LocalCluster Enterprise provides 
              the ability to cluster up to 10 servers, which allows IT or network 
              managers to create groups of servers, even heterogeneous servers, 
              within their organizations with full monitoring, recovery, and failover 
              support. The integrated data replication feature allows data in 
              the cluster to be automatically replicated on all servers, so users 
              see the same data regardless of which server is handling their requests.
            <p> LocalCluster Enterprise supports built-in service monitors for 
              network infrastructure applications such as HTTP, FTP, DNS, NIS, 
              TCP, and more. If a server or service fails, failover and recovery 
              policies can be defined to ensure that users continue to receive 
              prompt and accurate service. Customers can also build custom monitors 
              that trigger a failover event based on policies and tolerances designed 
              into the customer's script. LocalCluster Enterprise also has 
              the ability to customize the notification of cluster event changes. 
              Systems administrators can choose to be notified by email, pager, 
              or through network management stations via an SNMP trap mechanism.
            <p> LocalCluster Enterprise is available on Linux and will soon be 
              available on a other platforms, including Solaris, Windows NT, Windows 
              2000, and FreeBSD.

            <p> Caldera Systems, Inc. announced the release of Caldera Volution, 
              a Linux management solution that reduces the cost of implementing 
              and managing Linux systems. According to the company, Caldera Volution 
              allows administrators to use policies and profiles to manage thousands 
              of Linux systems, without having to individually manage or touch 
              each one. Volution is distribution-neutral and provides broad management 
              functions.
            <p> Caldera Volution is a Web-based remote management solution that 
              allows administrators to manage Linux systems from anywhere at anytime. 
              It is directory-based utilizing the strengths of LDAP directories. 
              Volution supports three major LDAP directories, Novell's eDirectory, 
              OpenLDAP, and iPlanet. OpenLDAP, and eDirectory ship with the product. 
              The suggested list price for Caldera Volution is $2995.
