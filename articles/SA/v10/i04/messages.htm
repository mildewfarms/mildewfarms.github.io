              Subject: VTun article (October 2000)
            <p> Arthur, If the samples of the packet dumps you have given in your 
              VTun article for <i>Sys Admin</i> are real, then I would be very 
              wary of the "encryption" offered by VTun. If you study 
              the packets closely, you will see that the same data appears in 
              the same location in all the packets you showed in your example. 
              This indicates to me (I am no crypto-geek by any means) that the 
              encryption used is a simple bit-swizzle and that with a small amount 
              of effort the key could be extracted from the encrypted data using 
              differential decryption allowing the packets to be decrypted.

            <i>Dear Brett,</i>
            <p><i> The packet dumps are real dumps!</i>
            <p><i> I haven't studied the encryption of VTun that closely 
              to be honest. I paid attention to the authentication part, which 
              makes sure the password is never sent over the tunnel. I will take 
              a closer look at the data encryption now, first by studying the 
              source code.</i>
            <p><i> I must confess that since writing this article, I switched 
              over to IPsec (the FreeS/WAN implementation for Linux) for two reasons:</i><i> 
              </i> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li><i> It is a standard and makes interoperation between different 
                platforms and vendors a reality (I tested it between Linux and 
                W2K) </i>
              <li> <i>It has a better crypto foundation that VTun.</i>
            </ul>
            <p> 
            <i>Thanks for pointing this out, and I will investigate it. If I turn 
            up anything interesting, I will let you know.</i>

            <i> </i>From: David R. Thome (<b>drt8243@liberator.ca.boeing.com</b>)
            <p> Please let me know if you have covered this suggestion in a previous 
              issue. I have a suggestion for very helpful article that I'd 
              like to see in your publication.
            <p> For all UNIX platforms, show how an SA would (by using <b>cron</b>) 
              go out and make copies of all critical config files as well as output 
              from commands such as <b>ioscan</b>, <b>sysinfo</b>, <b>dmesg</b>, 
              and critical Veritas commands, etc. Have the <b>cron</b> run them 
              weekly and maybe compare previous weeks in attempt to show potential 
              problems. Also if a server crashes or begins having problems, these 
              files would be good references to compare to. Which system files 
              should be available, which command out would be critical to always 
              have on hand? Does this make sense? Have you had articles on this 
              in the past?
            <p> 
            <p> <i>Readers: I don't think </i>Sys Admin<i> has published 
              an article on this topic. If anyone can help, please let me know. 
              Thank you. --AA</i>

            <i> </i>From: Jeff Krintila (<b>jkrintil@telus.com</b>)
            <p> I just got around to reading an older edition of your fantastic 
              mag and thought I would offer an additional snippet of info to the 
              letter from Nick Patetta (New Messages in August 2000) regarding 
              "Building a Jumpstart Server for Solaris" (<i>Sys Admin</i> 
              May 2000).
            <p> Patetta mentions two cluster-install options (SUNWCuser and SUNWCall). 
              I use the SUNWCXall cluster instead (includes the OEM distribution). 
              I have found that if you are going to be installing Oracle 8.1.6, 
              you need this type of install. Hope someone finds this helpful.
            <p> Jeff
            <p> 
            <p> <i>Thanks for the information, Jeff. --AA</i>

              Subject: Viagra: Keeping Services Running on BSD (February 2001)
            <p> I find the metaphor implicitly comparing servers with penises 
              used in this article unneccessary, puerile, and unprofessional. 
              Why detract from useful information with infantile drivel?
            <p> 
            <p> <i>Victoria, Thank you for taking the time to write to </i>Sys 
              Admin<i>. I appreciate all feedback from readers, and I regret that 
              you found the script name chosen by the author of this article to 
              be unprofessional and immature. Please accept my apology for any 
              offense. --AA</i>

            From: Mark E. Dawson, Jr.<br>
              Subject: SA feedback
            <p> Thanks to fellow member of the AIX-L mailing list, Jonathan Tansley, 
              it was brought to my attention that I made a technical error in 
              my AIX Cloning article (<i>Sys Admin</i> March 2001). I mention 
              in the article that the "<b>mkszfile</b>" command creates 
              BOTH image.data and bosinst.data. The truth is that "<b>mkszfile</b>" 
              only creates the image.data file.
            <p> To customize the bosinst.data file, you must copy the example 
              bosinst.data file from <b>/var/adm/ras</b> directory, then make 
              your customizations to your copy of that file.
            <p> Thanks to Jonathan for bringing that error to my attention.

              Subject: SA feedback
            <p> Having just purchased your Feb. 2001 issue, I must tell you that 
              I will not be looking for your next one at the bookstore. I could 
              justify spending $6 on something that imparts useful information 
              or is at least entertaining, but at a slim 80 pages it is quite 
              a stretch.
            <p> One of the very few articles you did bother to include didn't 
              even have the program listings (Spamivore). You must concede that 
              a detailed walk-through of the functions in this CGI is fairly useless 
              without the code that it describes. If you did it to save space 
              for more content I would understand, but it seems more like you 
              ran out ink and paper.
            <p> You need to get it together if you want to stay afloat. This was 
              a pretty slim offering.
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <i>Ian, I appreciate your comments about the magazine and regret that 
            you were unsatisfied with your purchase. In many cases, we do choose 
            to run the code listings only on our Web site so that we can include 
            more articles in the magazine. Our readers generally also find this 
            the easiest way to make use of the code.</i>
            <p><i> Also, the total number of editorial pages we can run every 
              month is based on a number of factors. Basically, however, it boils 
              down to a stated editorial-to-ad ratio that we must maintain. I 
              hope this addresses your concerns, and I thank you for writing.
