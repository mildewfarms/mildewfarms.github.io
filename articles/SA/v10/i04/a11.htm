            <p> This impressive and practical guide to FreeBSD illustrates its 
              advantages and capabilities and also demonstrates how to use this 
              reliable and popular system. Mittelstaedt explores the FreeBSD/Windows 
              co-existence, the Internet protocol perspective, and the FreeBSD 
              installation and configuration options. He begins with FreeBSD Serving 
              Windows Networks, which examines the functions of FreeBSD and Windows 
              within the same system. Following the introduction, the author discusses 
              DHCP, DNS, and TCP/IP on the Corporate LAN, exploring the TCP/IP 
              protocol suite's varied services, setup for different platforms, 

              and application programs. The next chapters describe FreeBSD Installation 
              and FreeBSD System Administration. (The author mentions an interesting 
              catch-22 in the Preface: 
            <p> "You need to know how FreeBSD works before you can install 
              it properly, but you need an installed FreeBSD system before you 
              can learn how it works." [Preface, Page xvi]
            <p> In Internet Connectivity and Corporate WANs, the author analyzes 
              Internet Service Providers, Security and Firewalling, and Proxy 
              Serving and IP Address Translation. The succeeding chapters detail 
              Web Serving, Fileserving with Samba, Printserving, and Electronic 
              Mail. The final chapter presents an unusual assortment of topics: 
              FreeBSD history, its relationship to Linux, FreeBSD Advocacy, The 
              Microsoft Antitrust Trial, and Some Final Words About Open Source 
              Software. The enclosed CD-ROM contains the base FreeBSD 4.2 operating 
              system for Intel architecture plus Xfree86 3.3.6 for FreeBSD, as 
              well as the most popular third-party packages for FreeBSD.
            <p> The <i>FreeBSD Corporate Networker's Guide</i> is a remarkable 
              book in several ways. The topic discusses a seldom-addressed system 
              and the details of its networking capabilities. The author's 
              approach combines a logical and understandable description of the 
              processes, protocols, and design issues involved. Mittelstaedt also 
              contributes an historical perspective that presents an unique perspective 
              to the system's development. The result is an outstanding book 
              that every systems administrator, open source enthusiast, or knowledgeable 
              user will want to read.

            <p> Intrusion methods and their accompanying traces of invasion vary. 
              The analyst's job is to recognize the unnoticeable and to reconstruct 
              the events. <i>Intrusion Signatures and Analysis</i> begins with 
              the analogy of a tracker, as portrayed through the myth and magic 
              of Hollywood westerns. The science of intrusion detection utilizes 
              various tools, each has its own way of recording events and retaining 
              evidence. You have to recognize what tools you have, and where to 
              look. Northcutt, Cooper, Fearnow, and Frederick demonstrate how 
              to become an effective intrusion analyst. They present tools, threats, 
              and responses through the following chapters: Reading Log Files, 
              Introduction to the Practicals, The Most Critical Internet Security 
              Threats (Parts 1 and 2), Non-Malicious Traffic, Perimeter Logs, 
              Reactions and Responses, Network Mapping, Scans That Probe Systems 
              for Information, Denial of Service-Resource Starvation, Denial of 
              Service-Bandwidth Consumption, Trojans, Exploits, Buffer Overflows 
              with Content, Fragmentation, False Positives, and Out-of-Spec Packets. 
              The Appendix provides answers to questions posed throughout the 
              text. Many of the topics and some of the material are closely related 
              to the SANS Institute Global Incident Analysis Center (GIAC) and 
              its certification program for a Certified Intrusion Analyst (GCIA).

            This book encompasses security threats, and their respective solutions, 
            attack descriptions, evidence, responses, and defense recommendations. 
            An intruder may leave traces and evidence in a log file or through 
            a pattern change, i.e. an increase in network traffic at a specific 
            time. The analyst's task is to find whatever traces there may 
            be and identify them. Although the signatures will differ with the 
            various types of attacks, the systems involved, and the detection 
            tools employed, the authors demonstrate how to analyze and recognize 
            an intrusion, and illustrate the type of disruption to examine. Northcutt, 
            Cooper, Fearnow, and Frederick have created a valuable resource for 
            effective network protection, and they also define and detail an intrusion 
            analysis methodology. <i>Intrusion Signatures and Analysis</i> provides 
            administrators with an extraordinary defense against intrusion and 
            a well-written and unparalleled examination of detection.

            <p> Databases can offer efficient ways to organize data, from your 
              Christmas card list to complete inventories including minute and 
              individualized descriptions. However, they can also become disorganized 
              nightmares without proper maintenance and query capabilities. Queries 
              provide a way to extract data from a database, preferably the data 
              and form that you need at the time. One of the most popular query 
              languages is SQL (Structured Query Language), which can be used 
              with a variety of database programs, including PostgresSQL, Oracle, 
              MySQL, and Microsoft's SQL Server. Its commands and structures 
              are relatively simple, depending on the complexity of the database 
              and the varying syntax.
            <p> Kevin and Daniel Kline have summarized the syntaxes and presented 
              an easy-to-use, quick reference guide. In this latest nutshell book 
              (at least as I write this), the authors address SQL Vendor Implementations, 
              and Some History, Foundational Concepts, SQL Statements Command 
              Reference, SQL Functions, and Unimplemented SQL99 Commands. The 
              Appendix features SQL99 and Vendor-Specific Keywords. The first 
              chapter surveys the concepts and implementations of relational databases 
              and the relational database model. Foundational Concepts, the second 
              chapter, examines the SQL99 relational database model, the individual 
              database datatypes, processing nulls, and some general syntax rules, 
              keywords, and identifiers. In the following chapter, SQL Statements 
              Command Reference, the authors provide the SQL commands and illustrate 
              any differences in syntax among PostgresSQL, Oracle, MySQL, and 
              Microsoft's SQL Server. This is the center of the book and 
              the chapter that anyone doing database programming needs. Kline 
              and Kline display tables showing keyword search patterns, limitations 
              of the searches, comparisons, operators, and little known and sometimes 
              undocumented facts about the commands. Functions are detailed in 
              Chapter 4, SQL Functions, and the SQL99 Commands that may be implemented 
              in the future.
            <p> This is an important resource for anyone using SQL queries in 
              database programming. It includes all of the important commands 
              and any differences among the PostgresSQL, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft's 
              SQL Server programs. Additionally, the authors provide warnings 
              and notes, describing problems or other facts to be considered before 
              utilizing a command, query, or command option. I wish I would have 
              had this book when I was using SQL to maintain and secure data from 
              large databases. Everyone involved with creating, maintaining, or 
              querying databases will value this book and wonder how they ever 
              managed without it!

            <p> Systems administrators are well acquainted with both Apache and 
              Perl on a variety of platforms. Apache is the preferred Web server, 
              and Perl provides accompanying Web scripting capabilities. The Apache 
              <b>mod_perl</b> module allows programmers to implement and run Perl 
              scripts within the Apache environment. The <b>mod_perl </b>fundamental 
              configuration is relatively straightforward; however, finding a 
              particular directive, handler function, or method quickly and easily 
              can become a challenge. The <i>mod_perl Pocket Reference</i> by 
              Andrew Ford features an efficient and valuable organization of frequently 
              referenced functions, methods, and directives in a compact and portable 
              volume. Ford addresses essential topic in the following order: What 
              Is <b>mod_perl</b>?, Setting Up <b>mod_perl</b>, Migrating CGI Scripts 
              to <b>mod_perl</b>, Embedding Perl in HTML Documents, Programming 
              <b>mod_perl</b>, The <b>mod_perl</b> API, <b>mod_perl </b>Configuration 
              Directives, Apache/Perl Modules, CGI Environment Variables, HTTP 
              Status Codes, and HTTP Header Fields. He also includes two indexes: 
              an Index of Modules and an Index of Methods.
            <p> This is an excellent and easily referenced guide to <b>mod_perl</b>. 
              Ford provides essential information about <b>mod_perl </b>in a pragmatic 
              and effective mini-nutshell. This reference about the popular Apache 
              extension will furnish a superb supplement to any knowledgeable 
              Apache text. Administrators and Perl programmers will appreciate 
              Ford's <i>mod_perl Pocket Reference</i> and use it often.

            <p> During my computer science college days, one of my instructors 
              emphasized that everyone thought in pictures. At the time, I wasn't 
              totally convinced. However, the more I explain computer concepts 
              and procedures, the more I recognize and appreciate the value of 
              an applicable image. The newest series by MaranGraphics and Hungry 
              Minds, Visual Blueprints, is written for experienced users, network 
              professionals, and developers who prefer a visual approach. Michael 
              Bellomo, an experienced visual author (<i>Master Red Hat Visually</i>, 
              <i>Linux Administration for Dummies</i>, and both the Visual Blueprints 
              books on Linux and UNIX) demonstrates UNIX concepts and processes 
              through descriptions, illustrations, screen shots, and examples.
            <p> He begins his UNIX tour with Logging Into UNIX and The UNIX Desktop 
              Environment. Some of the topics in these two chapters feature the 
              Graphical User Interface (GUI), logging in and out of UNIX, shutdown 
              procedures, and desktop customization. The following chapters discuss 
              Working With Files And Directories, Working With UNIX File Permissions, 
              Creating Text Files, Working With Text Files, Working With Processes, 
              and Working With Shells And System Variables. The succeeding chapters 
              address administration issues through: Basic Administration, Administrating 
              Users and Groups, Working With Hard Disks and Printers, Network 
              Connectivity, Using Netscape, E-mail In The Terminal, Working With 
              Archived Files, Troubleshooting, Accessories, and Advanced System 
              Administration. The Appendices contain A) vi Editor Commands and 
              B) What's On The CD-ROM. The accompanying CD-ROM provides: 
              Diskcheck, Logwatch, and Tripwire troubleshooting and monitoring 
              programs, all of the code and examples from the book, and a searchable 
              e-version of the book.
            <p> The format of the topic entries highlights a set of progressive 
              screen displays, a step-by-step procedure for the specific task, 
              a clear and informative explanation of the process, and either an 
              Extra or an Apply It section. Extras provide additional information 
              about the topic, either in a note or question and answer form; Apply 
              Its present demonstrations or exercises that the reader can try 
              on his or her own system. Throughout the book, Bellomo addresses 
              a wide variety of topics from setting permissions, automating tasks 
              using cron, e-mailing through Netscape or mailx, fixing device problems 
              on reboot, setting calendar dates, and archiving and compression 
              utilities, to mention a few of the entries. <i>UNIX: Your Visual 
              Blueprint to the Universe of UNIX</i> by Michael Bellomo superbly 
              illustrates how UNIX works for the computer user who wants to learn
