            Sociologists say that after major changes (such as national elections, 
            company layoffs, or big career moves) people spend less money and 
            eat more comfort food like mashed potatoes until the anxiety of the 
            change wears off. Here at <i>Sys Admin</i>, however, we seem to thrive 
            on change and live on chocolate and caffeine. Our sales manager jokes 
            that we're crisis-motivated, and he's probably right. However, 
            not unlike systems administrators, we like to plan ahead as well as 
            put out fires. 
            <p> One tool that helps us plan ahead is our reader survey. <i>Sys 
              Admin</i> will soon be mailing a reader survey to a randomly selected 
              group of subscribers; and if you're one of the lucky ones to 
              receive it, I hope you will take the time to fill it out. This survey 
              helps us understand what you're doing in your jobs, so we can 
              better serve your needs within the magazine. We'd like to know, 
              for example, what hardware and software you use and how you use 
              it, how often you write your own code, how many users you support, 
              and how you prefer to get the training and information needed to 
              enhance your careers. Through past surveys, we've found that 
              you get most of your training from publications (we hope that means 
              <i>Sys Admin</i>), informal training at work, and attending conferences 
              or seminars. We've also found that you're most interested 
              in security articles -- with performance tuning and system-monitoring 
              articles close behind. We'll tally the results of the new survey 
              and let you know how things have changed.
            <p> Of course, the survey also asks a lot of questions about the magazine 
              itself, such as: which columns are most valuable to you, and how 
              can we make the Web site more useful to you? According to last year's 
              results, you like the Q&amp;A, Net Admin, and Perl Advisor columns 
              best, and you also find product reviews helpful. Because you've 
              told us that backups are another important topic to you, this issue 
              contains a number of backup-related articles. Clark Cooper shows 
              how to back up and restore Linux and Solaris machines with a couple 
              of shell scripts; Ben Diamond and Keil Wurl explain the use of <b>ufsdump</b> 
              to perform a full backup and restore; and Shawn Bayern takes a minimal, 
              one-script approach to backup using an extra hard drive.
            <p> Please note that you don't have to wait to receive a survey 
              to tell me what you like or dislike about the magazine. You can 
              write to me anytime with suggestions or comments. I look forward 
              to hearing from you.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> 
            <p>
