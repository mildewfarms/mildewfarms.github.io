              and Answers</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Jim McKinstry and Amy Rich</i> 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Does AIX have support for IP aliasing 
              through SMIT? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b>Prior to AIX 4.3, the answer was 
              no and you had to use <b>ifconfig</b> commands in <b>/etc/rc.net</b>: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
ifconfig &lt;iface&gt; &lt;ipaddr&gt; netmask &lt;mask&gt; [alias|delete]
</pre>
            With 4.3, though, you can use the following fastpath:
            <p> 
            <pre>
smitty mkinet4al
</pre>
            which executes the command:
            <p> 
            <pre>
chdev -l &lt;iface&gt; -a alias4=&lt;ipaddr&gt;[,&lt;netmask&gt;]
</pre>
            Removal can also be done through <b>smit</b> with:
            <p> 
            <pre>
smitty rminet4al
</pre>
            which does:
            <p> 
            <pre>
chdev -l &lt;iface&gt; -a delalias4=&lt;ipaddr&gt;[,&lt;netmask&gt;]
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> How do I find out which package is 
            associated with a particular file on a Solaris machine? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> All of 
              the package installation information is stored in <b>/var/sadm/install/contents</b>. 
              If you want to find a particular file, you can do:
            <p> 
            <pre>
grep FILE /var/sadm/install/contents
</pre>
            The last field will tell you what package FILE belongs to.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I heard 
              there was a program called <b>hid</b> that changes the MAC address 
              of a Solaris 2.6 machine. This doesn't appear to work on a 
              2.7 machine. Do you know of any utility that will perform the same 
              function for 2.7?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> If you 
              look at the Web page where change-sun-hostid (aka <b>hid</b>) is 
              maintained, you'll find a 64-bit Solaris 7-compatible version 
              called <b>hid2</b>.

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I just upgraded 
            my machine from FreeBSD 4.0 to 4.1.1. I was running a custom-installed 
            Sendmail, version 8.11.1. I had "<b>NO_SENDMAIL= yes</b>" 
            in <b>/etc/make.conf</b>. After the upgrade, Sendmail wouldn't 
            start because it said my <b>cf</b> file version was too new for my 
            binary version, 8.9.3! I took a look in <b>/usr/src/contrib</b> and 
            Sendmail 8.11.0 is what's there. I reinstalled Sendmail from 
            the source again, but I want to know where this 8.9.3 binary came 
            from, and how can I prevent my binary from being overwritten in the 
            future?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> In newer 
              releases of FreeBSD, <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail</b> is now a wrapper 
              program that looks at <b>/etc/mail/mailer.conf</b>. Even if you 
              have "<b>NO_SENDMAIL= yes</b>" in <b>/etc/make.conf</b>, 
              it still upgrades the wrapper, and thereby wipes out your real, 
              hand-installed binary at <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail</b>.
            <p> To get around this, you can either copy the binary back after 
              every <b>installworld</b>, or you can modify Sendmail when you install 
              it, leaving the wrapper in place. To modify Sendmail, you can edit 
              <b>devtools/OS/FreeBSD</b> and add the following line at the bottom: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
define(`confMBINDIR', `/usr/libexec/sendmail')
</pre>
            Now when you run <b>./Build</b>, it will install the binary in <b>/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail</b>. 
            This is the default location of the Sendmail binary in <b>/etc/mail/mailer.conf</b>. 
            When you next do an <b>installworld</b>, it should upgrade the wrapper 
            but leave your binary in <b>/usr/libexec/sendmail/</b> alone. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> On one 
              of our enterprise servers running Solaris 2.6, the <b>last</b> command 
              is only showing data up to November 19th. Today is August 8th, and 
              I want to see current data. The file <b>/var/adm/wtmpx</b> is current, 
              and I split the file and copied it backed to <b>wtmpx</b>, but to 
              no avail.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b>Your <b>wtmpx</b> 
              database may have become corrupted. You can use the following command 
              to dump the <b>wtmpx</b> file into ASCII format and then edit any 
              bad records:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/lib/acct/fwtmp &lt; /var/adm/wtmpx &gt; file
</pre>
            You can put the records back into binary format by specifying the 
            <b>-ic</b> switch to <b>fwtmp</b>.
            <p> You can also use the following command to correct time/date stamps 
              and make sure the entries are consistent: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/lib/acct/wtmpfix /var/adm/wtmpx &gt; file
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're 
            a long-time SUN/NIS shop, but we're trying to migrate away from 
            that to LDAP. Are there any pointers to make this transition easier 
            for both the users and the systems administrators?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> There's 
              a series of articles on Sun's Blueprints site that compare 
              and contrast NIS and LDAP and discuss the tools that can help ease 
              the transition. The author begins with a short comparison of NIS 
              and LDAP:

            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have 
              a SPARC 20 with a parity error. I keep getting the following message:
            <p> 
            <pre>
WARNING: Uncorrected SIMM at: J0203
</pre>
            First, how do I tell which SIMM this is? Second, can I replace it 
            with a bigger SIMM so I can increase my overall memory without replacing 
            all of the SIMMs?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> The identifier 
              (in this case "J0203") will be silk-screened onto the 
              board next to the bad SIMM. You can put different-sized SIMMs in 
              the SPARC 20, but make sure you put the larger SIMMs in first. You 
              want to fill your SIMM banks in the following order:
            <p> 
            <pre>
J0201, J0303, J0202, J0301, J0305, J0203, J0302, J0304.
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'd like 
            to have 24-bit color on my SPARC 20. What do I need to do?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> The onboard 
              frame buffer on the SPARC 20 is the SX. You actually have a 24-bit 
              frame buffer already, but to use it, you need to install an 8-Mb 
              VSIMM (video SIMM) in one of your memory slots (unless you already 
              have the SS20/SSX). You can get away with a 4-Mb VSIMM, but you'll 
              only be able to do 1152x900 resolution. You can tell which size 
              VSIMM you have via software by doing:
            <p> 
            <pre>
prtconf -vp
</pre>
            The important value is the last value on the "reg" line. 
            If you have a 4-Mb VSIMM, it will say 00400000. AN 8-Mb VSIMM will 
            say 00800000.
            <p> You can alter the default depth and class by adding options to 
              your "openwindows" server: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
openwin -dev /dev/fb0 defdepth 24
openwin -dev /dev/fb0 defclass TrueColor
</pre>
            If your screen appears too dark or too washed out after switching 
            to 24-bit mode, you can try changing the gamma correction. You'll 
            also want to take a look at the command <b>sxconfig</b> for reserving 
            system memory to improve performance. Depending on your OS revision, 
            you will also want to set the resolution using <b>cg14config</b> or 
            in the <b>eeprom</b> by doing the following: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/sbin/eeprom output-device=screen:r1280x1024x76m
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm using 
            Budtool to back up our systems from an HP machine. We have a host 
            listed in <b>/etc/hosts</b> that it's trying to back up. It says 
            that the machine is down (returning ICMP 3, destination unreachable), 
            but I can clearly <b>ping</b> the machine. Why would it be giving 
            me this error, and what can I do to correct it?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> Since 
              you're getting "host unreachable" instead of "host 
              unknown", this sounds like you have the target machine in DNS, 
              too, but not as the right IP address. Even if you have <b>nsswitch.conf</b> 
              listed with files first (which would make <b>ping</b> and other 
              services work), Budtool will ignore this and go straight to DNS. 
              Try checking your zone files to see whether you have the IP for 
              the target machine listed correctly.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Each time 
              I invoke Solaris admintool, I'm able to input all the fields 
              to add a user, but as I click ok, I receive an error -- segmentation 
              fault core dump. I recently downloaded Sun Solaris 2.6 recommended 
              cluster hoping it would fix the problem, but it didn't.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> There's 
              only one 2.6 patch that deals specifically with admintool, 105800-06, 
              the Y2K patch (which also fixes a number of buffer overflows). You 
              may be experiencing a problem with a shared library, but this should 
              also show up when running other programs. Make sure that you have 
              all the Y2K patches and the latest patch set from Sun installed, 
              and make sure you reboot the machine after patch installation so 
              that there are no library/binary inconsistencies. If you're 
              still having problems, you can use a debugger and utilities, like 
              <b>truss</b> and <b>strace</b> to determine which system calls are 
              causing your problem.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Upon bootup 
              on x86 Solaris 2.8 PC, I get the error message:
            <p> 
            <pre>
metainit: no database exists
</pre>
            Any suggestions?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> <b>metainit</b> 
              is part of Solstice Disksuite, the Sun software RAID management 
              package. It sounds like you were once using Disksuite but have somehow 
              managed to erase the areas in which it keeps its databases. If you're 
              not using Disksuite, then you want to remove the startup files for 
              it in <b>/etc/rc?.d/</b>. If you are using Disksuite, then you need 
              to rebuild your database. See the man page for <b>metainit</b> for 
              more information.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Under 
              Solaris 2.6, how do I add new disks without rebooting the machine?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> If you 
              have hot pluggable disks and can add them on the fly, you can run 
              the following commands to have them recognized by the system:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/sbin/drvconfig
/usr/sbin/devlinks
/usr/sbin/disks (or /usr/sbin/tapes for tapes)
/usr/ucb/ucblinks
</pre>
            If you're rebooting the machine to have the disks recognized, 
            you must reboot with the <b>-r</b> flag. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Under 
              Solaris, how do I increase the maximum number of pseudoterminals?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> In Solaris 
              2.7 or earlier, add the following line to <b>/etc/system</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>
set pt_cnt = &lt;num&gt;
</pre>
            In Solaris 2.8, you no longer need to set <b>pt_cnt</b>, because the 
            number of pseudoterminals grows on demand. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I was 
              trying to remove Veritas lines from <b>/etc/system</b> on my Solaris 
              box so I could boot off the encapsulated disk normally, but I appear 
              to have badly munged <b>/etc/system</b>, and now the machine won't 
              boot. I don't have a copy of the installation CDs at this site, 
              so is there any way to fix this?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> If you 
              boot with <b>-as</b>, the system should ask you a number of questions, 
              including the name of the system file, and then boot into single-user 
              mode. Use the old copy of <b>/etc/system</b> if you made a backup, 
              or use <b>/dev/null</b>. After you get into single-user mode, you 
              can fix <b>/etc/system</b> and reboot.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I need 
              to install a bunch of HP systems in our DMZ and secure them as much 
              as possible from outside attack. How do I go about doing this?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> There's 
              a good security cookbook for HP/UX 10.20 located at: <b>http://secinf.net/info/unix/secureHP-UX.html</b>. 
              It covers installation, stripping things out after installation, 
              access controls, and number of items from the Defense Intelligence 
              Agency DII COE Security Checklist.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I want 
              to do remote administration on a number of Solaris boxes we have 
              at a POP in another state. What should I look into buying to make 
              my life easier? Can remote administration be done with PC UNIX variants, 
              too?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> One thing 
              that really helps with remote administration is a console server. 
              Depending on the amount of time you have and what your budget is, 
              you may want to look into something like an old annex, an old Livingston 
              PM2E/30 box, a Cisco 3620/3640, a PC running some UNIX flavor that 
              has a whole lot of serial ports that you can do PPP over, or a dedicated 
              console server like the ConsoleServer 3200 from Lightwave. One big 
              plus to the 3200 is that Lightwave claims they will be adding SSH 
              support later this year. For PCs, you may want to take a look at 
              Real Weasel: <b>http://www.realweasel.com/intro.html</b>.
            <p>The 
              other thing that can be a life saver for doing remote administration 
              is IP-addressable power strips, for those times when the machine 
              is hard hung and can only be fixed by a power cycle.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> How do 
              I find out the cache sizes of the CPUs on my Ultra AXi running Solaris 
              2.7?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> The cache 
              size and other information about the CPUs and boards can be found 
              using the <b>prtdiag</b> command:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/platform/sun4u/sbin/prtdiag -v
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> All of our 
            compute servers are headless boxes connected to a console server. 
            Unfortunately, we need to render some graphics in memory (never to 
            be seen on the actual screen on this machine). But, since there is 
            no graphical device to bind to, we can't seem to make the rendering

            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> To run 
              a virtual X display, you want to take a look at the X Virtual Frame 
              Buffer (<b>xvfb</b>). It's an X server that doesn't need 
              to bind to a physical device. It comes with the X11R6 distribution 
              under programs/Xserver.

            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have 
              a need to unplug the keyboard from a running Solaris 2.5.1 machine 
              without having it drop to the <b>ok</b> prompt. A serial console 
              is not an option at this point. Is there any way around the hardware 
              interrupt?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> To change 
              it from the command line before you pull the keyboard, type the 
              following as root:
            <p> 
            <pre>
kbd -a disable
</pre>
            When you've reconnected the keyboard, you can type:
            <p> 
            <pre>
kbd -a enable
</pre>
            To make the change permanent so that the disabled BREAK sequence persists 
            after a reboot, edit <b>/etc/default/kbd</b> and add the line:
            <p> 
            <pre>
KEYBOARD_ABORT=disable
</pre>
            The man page for <b>kbd</b> offers more keyboard options. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have 
              AIX systems running 4.2.1 that I want to upgrade to 4.3.3. How can 
              I can make my migration as painless as possible?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> Follow 
              the instructions in the Redbook and boot from the 4.3.3 CD, choosing 
              Migration installation. Make sure you run <b>lppchk -v</b> to see 
              whether there are any problems. Clear your <b>smit</b> log file 
              and run <b>smit</b> <b>update_all</b> with "preview only" 
              and get detailed output. Viewing the <b>smit</b> log should give 
              you a decent idea of any problems that might occur during the update. 
              Once you have fixed any issues that cropped up in the preview run, 
              run <b>update_all</b> normally.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I need 
              to write a script that <b>ping</b>s all our servers every 10 minutes. 
              If one of the servers is down it should send an email to the systems 
              administrators.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> Check 
              out: <b>http://bb4.com</b>. This tool also does a lot more and allows 
              you to page yourself or watch the status of multiple machines in 
              real-time with color-coded status ("Green is Good, Red is Bad"). 
              Or you should be able to write a script that <b>ping</b>s each server 
              and <b>grep</b>s the output for "alive" (assuming a <b>ping</b> 
              command that returns something like "host is alive"). 
              You could also do something like:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#!/bin/sh
SERVER_LIST="server1 server2 server3"
TIMEOUT=5

for SERVER in $SERVER_LIST
do
  ping $SERVER $TIMEOUT &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
     mail -s "Ping Report" you@yourmail.com &lt;&lt;EOM
$SERVER not responding
EOM
  fi
done
</pre>
            Run this from <b>cron</b> every 10 minutes.

              a DSL connection to the Internet. This connection is provided by 
              PacBell, who requires you to login after boot-up. PacBell states 
              that they do not support Linux. Is there a way for me to go online 
              with Linux using DSL? If so how?

            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I need 
              to create 1800 user accounts on a Red Hat 6.2 system preferably 
              with assigned passwords. We used <b>useradd -c "John Doe,8193" -p 
              catfur89 jdoe</b>, then ran this as a script. We tried the <b>-p</b> 
              option, and we tried just writing a plain text password file and 
              converting it to shadow with <b>pwconv</b>. (This just moved the 
              plain text into the shadow file.) Users cannot log in until we individually 
              change their passwords.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A</font></b> In Red 
              Hat 6.2, there is a command called <b>/usr/sbin/newusers</b>. This 
              is the command for batch user creation. Start by creating a file 
              with one line per user. Each line is the same format as <b>/etc/passwd</b> 
              (except the password will be in clear-text). Once the file is ready, 
              just type "<b>newusers &lt;filename&gt;</b>". Note that 
              if the group in the file does not exist, it will be created. If 
              the home directory does not exist, then it will be created.
