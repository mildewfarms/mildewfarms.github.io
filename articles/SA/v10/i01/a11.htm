              of Service: Types and Effects</h1>
            <p> <i>Peter H. Salus</i>
            <p> Because of its very nature, it is difficult to destroy a packet-switching 
              network, much less the network of networks that is the Internet. 
              However, a number of events have disrupted Internet service -- 
              some large, some limited in extent. This article is an attempt at 
              a typology and a spur to discussion.
            <p> We all know that in a packet-switching network, there are multiple 
              routes between any two points. As a consequence, such networks are 
              more robust when under attack than direct-line connections or circuit-switching 
              networks (like the telephone system).
            <p> But disruptive events have visible effects on the Internet. Over 
              the years, many of these events have been featured in the press. 
              But the press has never looked at the disruptions as "natural 
              phenomena." Nor have important distinctions been drawn.
            <p> I talk about disruptive events, because these things are quite 
              different from virus attacks or denial of service attacks. On the 
              one hand, virus attacks afflict individual PCs (sometimes hundreds 
              of thousands of them), but have little visible effect on the Internet. 
              On the other hand, denial-of-service attacks may put an individual 
              site out of commission, but only influence the Net because such 
              attacks add to the flow of bits in the Net as a whole.
            <p> Since 1990, Matrix.Net (aka Matrix Information and Directory Services) 
              has been surveying traffic and mapping the Internet and other networks. 
              We thus have a solid corpus of data to look at. Here are some instances.
            <p> <b>The 1994 Northridge Earthquake</b>
            <p> On 17 January 1994, at 4:31 AM PST (12:31 PM GMT), in the Northridge 
              suburb 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles, a magnitude 6.7 earthquake 
              struck. In 15 seconds it led to the deaths of 15 people and injuries 
              to more than 9,000. This was a major disaster. What effect did it 
              have on the Internet?
            <p> The Internet Weather Report (IWR, <b>http://www.mids.org/weather/</b>) 
              was already running back then. It ran scans at 2AM and 6AM PST, 

              thus taking before and after snapshots of the Internet. At that 
              time, we noted:
            <p> Comparing the two series of scans, effects of the earthquake can 
              be seen as far north as Lawrence Livermore Laboratories northeast 
              of San Francisco (which shows higher latencies immediately after 
              the earthquake) and as far south as San Diego (which shows more 
              traffic several hours later). Ensenada in Baja California, Mexico, 
              disappears just after the quake, but that is probably coincidence, 
              since the host we are pinging in Ensenada sometimes doesn't 
              respond.
            <p> Here are some Matrix.Net graphs of the IWR data from the Northridge 
              Earthquake event. You can see the initial earthquake event in both 
              packet loss and on the Internet at large. The effect is shortlived, 
              however, and by the next scan, most of it is gone. Apparently the 
              earthquake crashed quite a few computers briefly, but many of them 
              were soon back up (see Figures 1-3).
            <p> This quake did tens to hundreds of billions of dollars of property 
              damage, taking the San Fernando Valley off the Internet for more 
              than a day. Most of the affected areas were back on line completely 
              after a week. The Internet as a whole was not affected beyond the 
              immediate geographical vicinity: there was no overall effect on 
              packet loss; there was no visible difference in latency or packet 
              loss of the Internet overall.
            <p> The main reason that much of the local Internet was down was simple: 
              computers don't run without electricity. The only long-term 
              Internet infrastructure damage was one router that fell over. All 
              the others came back up when power was restored.
            <p> But let's move up a few years.
            <p> <b>Hurricane Floyd</b>
            <p> Hurricane Floyd threatened the Caribbean islands and the eastern 
              coast of the United States for the first two weeks of September 
              1999. It achieved Category 4 status before it made landfall. It 
              missed Hispaniola and Cuba completely, passed over the Bahamas, 
              missed Florida, and Georgia, grazed South Carolina, and went ashore 
              in North Carolina. By then it had tapered off to tropical storm 
              classification, still generating high winds and much rain, but instigating 
              far less damage than anticipated.
            <p> <b>Overall Internet Effects</b>
            <p> The expected overall effects on the Internet were negligible. 
              These graphs represent average Internet performance. The darker 
              line represents the Internet as a whole. The lighter one represents 
              the WWW, a subset of the Internet.
            <p> Looking at the Internet Average is informative. The Matrix.Net 
              Internet Average is a high-level summary of performance data measured 
              from hosts all around the world. It provides one baseline against 
              which more specialized Internet performance data might be compared, 
              serving a similar role as the Dow Jones Industrial Average does 
              in the financial world.
            <p> However, negligible isn't the same as indetectible. There 
              was, in fact, a surge in both latency and packet loss on Monday 
              13 September 1999, starting around 8AM EDT and continuing the entire 
              working day (see Figure 4).
            <p> The Internet "pinglist" shows a pointed latency spike 
              about noon EDT. The peak of that spike is at 186.4 ms, which is 
              about 16% higher than the usual 160 ms for a Monday afternoon. The 
              WWW pinglist shows a smaller increase, to about 169 ms over the 
              usual 158 ms of a Monday afternoon, or about 7%. There's a 
              smaller spike on both pinglists about 5PM Monday.
            <p> What we don't see is much effect on Wednesday or Thursday, 
              when Floyd actually made landfall. If anything, there may be a decrease 
              in latency on Wednesday.
            <p> Looking more closely at the underlying data, and looking only 
              at nodes in Florida as an example, we can see that there was a drop 
              in reachability at noon EDT Monday, and another at 5PM. Reachability 
              rachets back up by the same amounts at 7AM and 9AM Wednesday. That 
              looks as though a number of people turned off their machines as 
              they were being evacuated, and turned them back on when they returned.
            <p> <b>ISP Effects</b>
            <p> What might have been expected would be brief spikes in ISP performance 
              either when Floyd passed over an area or later when batteries were 
              drained. Most ISPs these days have pretty good backup power, so 
              this would seem the most likely scenario. For big ISPs, the battery 
              would only be on for about five minutes, and then emergency generators 
              would take over. Then it's just a question of availability 
              of fuel for the generators. Smaller ISPs might have bigger problems, 
              as they have fewer resources for USPs and generators.
            <p> Or, if damage were sufficiently severe and direct to actually 
              take routers off the Net, we might see an outage of a day or more, 
              with a sharp beginning and a gradual end as ISPs dug out and replaced 
              broken equipment. This would be similar to the effects of the Northridge 
              Earthquake, except probably more severe because the earthquake effect 
              was caused more by power outages than by direct damage.
            <p> What we see instead is a lot of small latency and packet loss 
              events on Monday, before Floyd hit anything, and negligible effects 
              thereafter. The only big ISP that seems to have significant later 
              effects was Global-One.
            <p> <b>Friday 17 September 1999</b>
            <p> This hurricane's bark was worse than its bite, where the 
              Internet was concerned. Evacuation and fear of the hurricane had 
              much more effect on the Internet on Monday than the hurricane itself. 
              However, there was finally a brief but noticeable event on Friday 
              (see Figures 5 and 6).
            <p> ISPs these days are quite hardened to problems with electricity 
              and telephone service, and even flooding. Certain kinds of problems 
              still affect the Internet, however, such as hysteria, seen here; 
              cable cuts, which are likely the cause of the Friday event; and 
              configuration problems inside the ISPs themselves, which were not 
              observed in this particular week.
            <p> Earthquakes and hurricanes are genuinely natural events; but there 
              are other types of physical disruption.
            <p> <b>Fiber Cut of 29 September 1999</b>
            <p> About noon EDT on 29 September 1999 there was a massive fiber 
              cut in Ohio, which took more than four hours to fix. This infrastructure 
              outage was noticeable across the entire Internet, as illustrated 
              by the Matrix.Net Internet Average.
            <p> Not much damage is visible in latency, although interestingly 
              enough most of what is visible is in the curve for Top Level Domain 
              (TLD) Domain Name System (DNS) servers.
            <p> Packet loss clearly shows the event in all three curves (Figure 
              7). Latency shows the most dramatic effects (Figure 8).
            <p> We also examined the top 30 ISPs one by one, and found that only 
              a few of them (AboveNet, GTE Internet, and PSINet) were noticeably 
              affected. AboveNet got it worst, and took a day to completely recover. 
              All the other ISPs were essentially unaffected.
            <p> <b>Outage of October 7, 1999</b>
            <p> About 3AM EDT (8AM GMT) on October 7, 1999 there was a massive 
              Internet outage, bigger than the one caused by the fiber cut of 
              September 29, 1999. This infrastructure outage was noticeable for 
              the entire Internet. Packet loss shows the outage clearly. And reachability 
              shows it even more clearly (Figures 9-11).
            <p> <b>Denial of Service attacks</b>
            <p> On Monday and Tuesday, February 7 and 8, 2000, a large number 
              of major sites across the US were assaulted by "Denial of Service" 
              (DoS) attacks. These attacks were the result of millions of messages 
              flooding a particular host or gateway, overwhelming the resources 
              and backing up traffic in a domino fashion (Figure 12).
            <p> In the days since, Attorney General Janet Reno has said that the 
              FBI would track and punish the miscreants. The President has called 
              another meeting. All the "usual suspects" 
              were rounded up.
            <p> There have been security warnings, as well. In general, the newspapers 
              and the TV reporters appear clueless on the differences between 
              cracking a site and blocking a site.
            <p> "Since smurf attacks originate from a variety of sources 
              at unpredictable times, an Internet-wide system analysis is necessary,'' 
              said John Quarterman, CEO of Matrix.Net, in Austin, TX. He continued, 
              "Just look at the 'Internet Average' for 8 
              February. It's completely clear that the entire Internet had 
              higher packet loss and far lower reachability for several hours. 
              It's like a shark took a bite out of the Net."
            <p> There have been other interesting events: the Victoria's 
              Secret lingerie show slowed down AOL, but had no real effect on 
              the Internet; the release of the Starr Report caused several spikes 
              in latency, at the release time and at about 5PM EDT and thereafter. 
              Presumably, folks wanted to see the report when it went up, and 
              then read parts of it when working hours were over.
            <p> Even more recently, on September 25, 2000, the ISP Applied Theory 
              showed the a wild fluctuation in reachability. This was caused by 
              a "router flap" at Sprint. Rather than the absolute drop 
              shown in the cases of DoS attacks, or the massive outages shown 
              by fiber cuts, the up-down seesaw here reflects the router trying 
              to come up and succumbing again. When it was swapped out, everything 
              returned to normal.
            <p> The important thing is to recognize just how limited the effects 
              of all of these events have been, as well as how different from 
              each other natural disasters, fiber cuts, blown routers, and denial 
              of service attacks are. We are currently datamining our records 
              to ascertain exactly what the early warning signs are.
            <p> Knowledge is power: it may be that with early recognition, the 
              ISPs will be able to route around disruptions and thus ameliorate 
              the consequences.
