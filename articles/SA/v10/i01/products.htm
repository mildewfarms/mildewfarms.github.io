            <p><i> </i><b>Multiview Group Announces Multiview Catalyst Version 
              6.0</b>
            <p> MultiView Group, part of Surf Control, Inc., has announced the 
              availability of its Web-to-host connectivity software, MultiView 
              Catalyst version 6.0. According to the company, Multiview Catalyst 
              Version 6.0 gives customers point-and-click Web access to their 
              legacy UNIX applications and is the fastest and easiest way to face-lift 
              and Web-enable UNIX applications. 
            <p> According to the company, MultiView Catalyst is specifically designed 
              for the UNIX environment and offers UNIX customers an efficient 

              solution for face-lifting and connecting UNIX applications to the 
              Web. Additionally, MultiView Catalyst provides monitoring and usage 
              abilities for assisting application service providers (ASPs) who 
              offer outsourced Web-to-host connectivity services.
            <p> New Capabilities for MultiView Catalyst Version 6.0 include:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Complete Printing Support -- MultiView Catalyst 6.0 features 
                a range of printing capabilities for both internal and remote 
                users. In addition to print screen and auxiliary or pass-through 
                printing, users can also perform background printing via completely 
                secure connections (SSH and SSL) with LP printing. Bandwidth is 
                maximized, since print jobs are handled in the same session and 
                the print priority can be set. 
              <li> Session Resume -- A new Session Resume feature assures 
                solid remote connections and adds network stability since client 
                connections or print jobs can be quickly resumed. 
              <li> Monitoring Capabilities -- Systems administrators and ASPs 
                can monitor software usage and user workloads from a browser. 
              <li> Flexible Enterprise Licensing -- Customers can purchase 
                one set of licenses and use any combination of products, such 
                as MultiView Catalyst, MultiView 2000, and MultiView 2000 Server 
                Edition. Installation for PC-level, thin client and Web-based 
                users can be centrally controlled via the MultiView License Manager, 
                and shared product license keys provide load balancing, server 
                resilience and backup, and virtually unlimited scalability. 
              <li> Enhanced Security -- With Secure Shell (SSH v1) support, 
                all data exchanges between the terminal emulation client and the 
                remote UNIX server are fully encrypted and secure. MultiView Catalyst 
                provides a complete security wrapper that protects data traffic 
                from the Web Client to the Catalyst Server (SSL) and from the 
                Catalyst Server to the UNIX host (SSH). 
              <li> Smart Cursor Improved Mouse Navigation -- Smart Cursor 
                provides added productivity since edit fields and other areas 
                on the screen can be selected with the mouse instead of with arrow 
                keys or tabs. 
              <li> Web Page Wizard -- The Web Page Wizard automates the Web 
                design process, providing the fastest way to set up display parameters 
                and turn boring UNIX screens into dynamic Web pages.

            <p> <b>SharpeWare Releases NetWatch 2.0</b>
            <p> SharpeWare has released NetWatch 2.0, a program designed for Windows 
              NT/2000, Novell NetWare, and UNIX, that monitors servers -- 
              logging important data and generating alerts when problems occur.
            <p> NetWatch 2.0 remotely monitors and logs servers without the need 
              for special agents. Key data, such as memory or disk load, can be 
              logged, or the "Tell me When" feature can be used to automatically 
              generate alerts by pager, email, and more. The Alert Log tracks 
              all problems and resolutions. The VolWatch feature gives a constantly 
              refreshed single view of storage status across all servers regardless 
              of their type. Users can publish directly to a company intranet 
              site and view up-to-date alerts, server, and user data through a 
              browser. NetWatch 2.0 maintains the necessary Web pages automatically, 
              and no Web server customization or installation is required. Regardless 
              of the type of server, NetWatch 2.0 will remotely display open files, 
              active users, processes/services/NLMs, memory, disk and network 
              performance, and more.

            <p> <b>Aurora Software Announces SarCheck for AIX</b>
            <p> Aurora Software, Inc. has announced the general release of SarCheck 
              4.0 for AIX. SarCheck is a performance management tool designed 
              to assist systems administrators in the analysis of system performance 
              by translating the output of several monitoring utilities in a plain 
              English or HTML-formatted report. SarCheck identifies performance 
              bottlenecks, finds runaway processes and memory leaks, recommends 
              changes to various tunable parameters and hardware configurations, 
              and quantifies remaining system capacity.
            <p> SarCheck is designed to help systems administrators learn more 
              about how their systems work by explaining resource utilization 
              and capacity limits in plain English. It uses the tools that come 
              with the operating system, primarily sar and ps, to learn how the 
              system's resources are being used. It then makes recommendations 
              for kernel tuning and hardware upgrades, based on how well the system's 
              resources are utilized. The software also helps the administrator 
              to diagnose problems remotely, and to quickly recommend or implement 
              corrective actions. Because SarCheck has been specifically designed 
              with safety in mind, it will make detailed recommendations instead 
              of attempting to fix problems itself. It will also explain the reasons 
              for its recommendations.
            <p> SarCheck currently runs on many UNIX platforms. Translation to 
              languages other than English is planned for the future. For more 
              information, contact: <i>Aurora Software, Inc., P.O. Box 1033, Plaistow, 
              NH 03865; Phone: (603) 382-4200; Fax: (603) 382-4247; WWW: http://www.sarcheck.com</i>.
