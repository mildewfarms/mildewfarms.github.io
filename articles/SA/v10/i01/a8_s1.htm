            <H1> The Story Thus Far</h1>
            <p> As a refresher for readers, the first article in this series, 
              (<i>Sys Admin</i> Vol 9, Issue 9) provided an overview of QoS and 
              various methods that could be used to differentiate types of network 
              traffic. In the second article in this series (<i>Sys Admin</i> 
              Vol 9, Issue 10), I discussed QoS with the data link layer, outlining 
              the role of the IEEE 802.1p standard in a switched-based LAN environment. 
              The third (<i>Sys Admin</i> Vol 9, Issue 11) and fourth (<i>Sys 
              Admin</i> Vol 9, Issue 12) articles comprised a two-part mini-series 
              that described how traffic can be differentiated as it flows into 
              a WAN. The third article focused on router queues and described 
              different queuing methods, as well as illustrated relevant Cisco 
              router commands to effect such methods. I concluded that article 
              with an examination of the Type of Service (ToS) byte in the IP 
              header, which paved the way for the second article that focused 
              upon QoS into the network. That article covered the manner by which 
              the use of the ToS byte was revised by the Internet Engineering 
              Task Force (IETF). That revision, which was the focus of the fourth 
              article, examined how the ToS byte was used to provide differentiated 
              service (DiffServ) information to routers to expedite the flow of 
              traffic through a network.
