            <h1><img src="../../resource/syslog.gif" width="200" height="80" align="right">syslog</h1>
            <p>The obvious topic for a January column is New Year's resolutions, 
              so I'm resolving to answer all my email within 12 hours, organize 
              my paperwork in color-coded binders, label the shelves of my linen 
              closet and pantry with brass-edged nameplates, and bake fresh bread 
              every morning -- no wait, that's not me. I have no desire 
              to regiment my life to such a painful degree. I'm fairly content 
              to sift semi-regularly through the piles of paper that accumulate 
              on the floor of my office and occasionally order takeout rather 
              than cook. 
            <p> Some areas of our professional lives, however, must be strictly 
              regulated. For example, systems administrators must conscientiously 
              maintain scheduled backups of critical information, enforce rigorous 
              security measures, and perform frequent security checks. Aside from 
              those responsibilities that are spelled out in job descriptions, 
              however, systems administrators are also bound by a firm code of 
              ethics. The System Administrators Guild (SAGE) has detailed this 
              code of ethics (in Portuguese and French along with English) on 
              its Web site at: <b>http://www.usenix.org/sage/</b>. If you've 
              not read it, I highly recommend you do so. Its goals, as stated 
              on the site, are:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> To provide a set of codified guidelines for ethical directions 
                that system administrators must pursue; 
              <li> To act as a reference for construction of local site-acceptable 
                use policies; 
              <li> To enhance the professionalism and image of the Guild and of 
                its individual members by promoting ethical behavior; 
              <li> To act as an "industry standard" reference of behavior 
                in difficult situations, as well as in common ones; 
              <li> To establish a baseline for addressing more complex issues.
            </ul>
            <p> You don't have to be a member of SAGE to find value in these 
              recommended practices. The code of ethics serves as a reminder that 
              the "golden rule" applies to systems administration as 
              much as to any other profession. We are reminded that, athough systems 
              administrators are in a position to access vast amounts of confidential 
              information, they must not misuse this information for any personal 
              gain. The beginning of a new year naturally leads to consideration 
              of past and present courses of action, and this code of ethics may 
              serve as a helpful guide for determining future direction.
            <p> With this January issue, we offer a poster/calendar along with 
              the magazine. I'm grateful to Zonker Brockmeier for providing 
              the poster text on intrusion detection and to the art and production 
              staff for working so hard to put it all together. Let me know what 
              you think by emailing me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>. I value 
              your comments.
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
