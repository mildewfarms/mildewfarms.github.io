              Allaire ColdFusion<br>
              Allaire Corporation<br>
              Web Site:<b> http://www.allaire.com/products/coldfusion</b><br>
              Allaire's ColdFusion is a feature-rich application server that 
              uses HTML-like syntax to mark up pages to provide dynamic content. 
              The Cold Fusion Markup Language, or CFM, is a large set of such 
              tags, covering everything from typical programming constructs, such 
              as variables, conditional statements, and loops, to database access, 
              COM/DCOM object access, and (with ColdFusion 4.5), the ability to 
              access Java Servlets and Enterprise Java Beans through Allaire's 
              JRun Java Application Server (see below). A scripting language, 
              CFScript, provides a complete set of functions libraries for a wide 
              variety of uses like mathematical operations, string manipulation, 
              and more. You can also develop your own custom tags, allowing you 
              to develop reusable "templates" with CFM. Support for 
              a variety of methods for maintaining user session state and user 
              authentication is also provided. ColdFusion Studio, while not available 
              for Linux, is a top-notch IDE for ColdFusion developers.
            <p> 
            <p> Active Server Pages Active (ASP)<br>
              Server Pages allows you to embed blocks of code written in VBScript, 
              JavaScript, or even PerlScript, into your HTML pages. There are 
              two companies of note offering implementations of Microsoft's 
              ASP environment for Linux (and other UNIX operating systems).
            <p> 
            <p> Chili!Soft ASP<br>
              Chili!Soft, Inc.<br>
              Web Site: <b>http://www.chilisoft.com</b><br>
              This award winning port of Microsoft's ASP environment offers 
              the capability to script dynamic Web applications using JavaScript 
              or VBScript to interact with COM objects and relational databases, 
              provide session state management, and more. Developers familiar 
              with ASP on Windows platforms will be comfortable moving their code 
              to Chili!Soft ASP.
            <p> 
            <p> Halcyon's Instant ASP<br>
              Halcyon Software<br>
              Web Site: <b>http://www.halcyonsoft.com</b><br>
              This implementation of ASP is Java-based, making for a platform-independent 
              product offering by Halcyon Software. This makes Instant ASP a viable 
              ASP application server for any platform that supports Java 2. The 
              Java implementation also makes integration with other Java code, 
              like Java Beans, more viable.
            <p> 
            <p> PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor)<br>
              Web Site: <b>http://www.php.net</b><br>
              PHP is another environment, like ASP, that embeds blocks of script 

              into HTML pages. PHP is an Open Source solution, freely available 
              for a wide variety of platforms, including Linux. This is a full-featured 
              environment that has been available for years, and is in widespread 
              use on the Web. If you're on a tight budget, PHP is a fine 
              alternative for building dynamic data-driven Web sites.
            <p> <b>Enterprise Application Servers</b>
            <p><b> </b>The bulk of what would typically be termed Enterprise Application 
              Servers are all products that implement Sun's Java 2 Enterprise 
              Edition (J2EE) specification. Tomcat, discussed in this article, 
              is the reference implementation of the Java Servlet and JSP specifications, 
              which are just one part of the overall Java 2 Enterprise Edition 
              specification. Additional features within J2EE include support for 
              Enterprise Java Beans (reusable components written in Java), JDBC 
              for database connectivity, JNDI for directory services, and more. 
              Visit <b>http://java.sun.com</b> to learn more about J2EE and the 
              rest of the Java product offerings and specifications. While there 
              are undoubtedly a number of features that distinguish the various 
              products implementing J2EE-based application servers, I will not 
              attempt to enumerate them here. Visit the Web sites of the companies 
              below, all of whom have Linux versions of their products, to learn 
              more.
            <p> 
            <p> IBM WebSphere<br>
              IBM<br>
              Web Site: <b>http://www.ibm.com/websphere</b><br>
              IBM holds a large part of the market share for J2EE application 
              servers. IBM also has an Interactive Development Environment (IDE), 
              VisualAge for Java, that is well integrated with WebSphere. Unlike 
              Allaire's IDE's for either ColdFusion or JRun, the Visual 
              Age for Java IDE is available on Linux as well as Windows platforms.
            <p> 
            <p> BEA WebLogic<br>
              BEA Systems<br>
              Web Site: <b>http://www.bea.com/products/weblogic</b><br>
              BEA WebLogic is probably IBM's primary competitor in this market, 
              and on the surface appear to have very similar products. BEA lacks 
              the tightly integrated IDE, but offers highly regarded products 
              such as Tuxedo for transaction platform, and eLink for integrating 
              Web applications with enterprise (i.e., legacy) backend systems.
            <p> 
            <p> Allaire JRun<br>
              Allaire Corporation<br>
              Web Site: <b>http://www.allaire.com/products/jrun</b><br>
              Like IBM, a distinguishing factor for Allaire is their development 
              environment, in this case JRun Studio. An interesting possibility 
              with JRun, for sites using ColdFusion 4.5 or higher, is the ability 
              to deploy Java Servlets and Enterprise Java Beans in JRun, and interact 
              with them in your ColdFusion pages.
            <p> 
            <p> Secant Extreme Enterprise Server<br>
              Secant Technologies<br>
              Web Site: <b>http://www.secant.com</b><br>
              Secant may not get quite the press of IBM or BEA, nevertheless, 
              they appear to have a solid offering in the J2EE market that has 
              won its own share of both customers and awards.
