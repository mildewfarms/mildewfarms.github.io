            <p> <i>Elizabeth Zinkann</i>
            <p> Linux applications continue to become more sophisticated and popular. 
              They are as diverse as the community who utilizes them. Whether 
              you prefer Applixware, Star Office, Word Perfect, GNUCash, PHP, 
              mySQL, or the Gimp (to name a very few of the available applications), 
              the Linux operating system offers a variety of tools and utilities. 
              Two applications (or at least some documentation about them) are 
              highlighted in this month's column. I also included a book 
              about firewalls and security, and a visual guide to Linux. Specifically, 
              this column includes reviews of: <i>Gimp Pocket Reference</i> by 
              Sven Neumann, translated by Sven Riedel (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 
              Inc.); <i>Building Linux and OpenBSD Firewalls</i> by Wes Sonnenreich 
              and Tom Yates (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.); <i>Linux Music &amp; 
              Sound</i> by Dave Phillips (Linux Journal Press, No Starch Press); 
              and <i>Master Red Hat Visually</i> by Michael Bellomo (maranGraphics/IDG 
              Books).

            <p> Many administrators find themselves suddenly thrust into the world 
              of graphics and Web design. The journey from the shell prompt to 
              creating graphics and user interfaces can cause culture shock. A 
              colleague recently admitted that opening the Gimp (GNU Image Manipulation 
              Program) confused him. He much preferred recompiling the kernel 
              or setting up a network to resizing and optimizing images, with 
              or without magic wands. The set of icons that greet the Gimp user 
              are relatively straightforward once you know their functions and 
              capabilities. Several excellent references are available for the 
              Gimp user, including: <i>The Artist's Guide to the Gimp</i> 
              by Michael J. Hammel (a personal favorite, published by SSC, ISBN 
              1-57831-011-3); <i>GIMP: The Official Handbook</i> by Olaf S. and 
              Karin Kylander (Coriolis Open Press, ISBN 1-57610-520-2); <i>Grokking 
              the GIMP</i> by Carey Bunks (New Riders, ISBN 0-7357-0924-6); and 
              <i>Guerrilla Guide to Great Graphics with The GIMP</i> by David 
              D. Busch (Prima Tech, ISBN 0-7615-2407-X). These books describe 
              what the GIMP can do, the respective procedures, and illustrate 
              the results of the individual tools and filters.
            <p> The <i>Gimp Pocket Reference</i> discusses the essential features 
              of version 1.2 and demonstrates the power and potential of its tools, 
              filters, plug-ins, and preferences. Neumann begins by describing 
              the toolbox, which is the Gimp's beginning work screen, and 
              its associated commands. Following the Introduction and The Toolbox, 
              Neumann details Tools, The Image Window, Preferences, The rc-Files, 
              Creating and Editing Keyboard Shortcuts, Color Models, Drawing and 
              Layer Modes, and File Formats. Neumann defines the purposes of each 
              tool or filter, any existing keyboard shortcuts, and options available 
              to the user. For example, he presents the Smudge Tool entry as follows:
            <p> Smudge Tool (SHIFT + S)<br>
              Smudge simulates the smearing of wet paint. The brush picks up some 
              of the color that it passes over and paints with it for a little 
              while.<br>
              <br>
              Rate<br>
              Determines how long the chosen color remains in the brush. [Page 
              26]
            <p> Neumann (with the aid of Riedel's translation) provides a 
              superb and well-organized guide to the many facets of the Gimp. 
              Whether you want to enhance an image, add artistic filters and effects, 
              or create a completely new design, the Gimp can be a powerful and 
              effective utility. The toolbox and its related functions allow the 
              user to implement both still and animated results. The <i>Gimp Pocket 
              Reference</i> gives the user the key to the toolbox and is a superior 
              resource either as an independent reference or as a complement to 
              another text.

            <p> A general definition of a firewall describes its use as a barrier 
              to prevent the spread of a fire within a building. The parallel 
              computer meaning reflects only a slight change -- a computer 
              firewall prevents easy access to data by an intruder, whether inside 
              or outside the organization. Protecting information is often a double-edged 
              sword; the process may implement security at the cost of user convenience 
              and easy access (and vice versa). The experienced administrator 
              maintains a delicate balance between a secure system and the user 
              interface. In the introduction to <i>Building Linux and OpenBSD 
              Firewalls</i>, Sonnenreich and Yates note that the value of building 
              a firewall yourself adds an extra measure of security. You not only 
              know how the firewall was installed, but also realize its strengths, 
              weaknesses, and expected performance. The final and most important 
              consideration for any security policy examines "What am I protecting 
              and who am I protecting it from?" The answer to that query 
              should determine the strength of your security policy. Sonnenreich 
              and Yates address the issue of security and its implementation through 
              three major sections.
            <p> Part I introduces the theories and concepts connected with network 
              security via The ABCs of Network Security, Fundamental Internet 
              Security Issues, and How Secure Should Your Network Be? The authors 
              describe fundamental network security issues for different sizes 
              and types of organizations, emphasize what utilities are needed 
              (and which aren't), and present some general guidance principles. 
              In Part II, the authors detail the firewall implementations for 
              both operating systems. The first chapter examines the historical 
              perspective of the operating system environments, describing what 
              issues were involved and what resulted from the events. Chapter 
              5, Getting The Right Hardware, is a mini-guide to system components 
              and assembly. (This can often be a more challenging task than it 
              seems, depending on the availability of parts your supplier carries.) 
              The following four chapters feature Installing Linux, Configuring 
              the Firewall under Linux, Installing OpenBSD, and Configuring the 
              Firewall under OpenBSD. The section's final chapter presents 
              Tuning Your Firewall and examines security policies, masquerading, 
              routing, and performance improvement. In the final section, Part 
              III, Sonnenreich and Yates depict Intrusion Detection and Response, 
              and Loose Notes, which includes References by Chapter, A Brief <b>vi</b> 
              Tutorial, The Security Policy, Scripts, and Some Closing Thoughts.
            <p> <i>Building Linux and OpenBSD Firewalls</i> offers the systems 
              administrator an extensive amount of practical advice as well as 
              some historical perspectives and security concepts. Sonnenreich 
              and Yates use Red Hat 6.0 and OpenBSD 2.5, adding that most of the 
              Linux information is applicable for any Linux distribution and any 
              differences between releases will be minimal. The authors present 
              some of the best information through the Notes, Tips, and shaded 
              sidebars, which appear throughout the text. They even address the 
              Linux versus OpenBSD question in the Introduction:
            <p> Both the Linux community and the OpenBSD community understand 
              that it's not about which open source system is better. It's 
              really about choosing open source as a viable alternative in the 
              first place. [page xvi]
            <p> This is an excellently written and organized examination of existing 
              security perceptions and procedures. Sonnenreich and Yates emphasize 
              that you cannot add secure safeguards like post-it notes. They must 
              be carefully planned and cohesively integrated within the administration 
              routine. <i>Building Linux and OpenBSD Firewalls</i> is a valuable 
              and effective resource for every systems administrator and Internet 
              Service Provider.

            <p> The idea of using a computer to generate music is an intriguing 
              thought. The controls not only can be graphically represented, but 
              also can be precisely controlled. However, the documentation for 
              using a Linux system for implementing a recording studio has (until 
              now) been online. Finding the information and the programs simultaneously 
              has presented a challenge. With the <i>Linux Music &amp; Sound</i> 
              book by Dave Phillips, discovering the software, its location, and 
              how to implement it is now available in one book. Within this rather 
              unassuming volume, the aspiring Linux musician can now discover 
              the procedures, programs (or where to locate them), and configurations 
              for MIDI, MP3, and sound synthesis in one place. The musician/author 
              (or author/musician) maintains the "Sound &amp; MIDI Software 
              for Linux" Web site and is also experienced with answering 
              queries and discovering the available software programs.
            <p> Phillips examines the implementations of sound and music through 
              the following chapters: The World Of <i>Linux Music &amp; Sound</i>; 
              Basics of Digital Audio; Setting Up Your System; Mixing, Playing, 
              And Recording; Soundfile Editors; Mod Files and Linux; The Linux 
              MIDI Studio; Linux Does MP3; Multitrack Hard-Disk Recording and 
              Mixing; Software Sound Synthesis; Realtime Software Synthesizers; 
              Music Notation Programs; Network Audio Software; Linux and the Digital 
              DJ; Linux Games; and Operating System Emulators. The Appendices 
              contain an Afterword, Glossary, About the CD-ROM, a Bibliography, 
              and an Index. In the first three chapters, Phillips discusses the 
              sound installation and configuration within a Linux system. Throughout 
              the following chapters, he explores the different aspects of the 
              sound and music phenomena and also details the various programs 
              that can be used for each specific topic. Most of the programs that 
              he describes are included on the accompanying CDROM.
            <p> <i>Linux Music &amp; Sound</i> demonstrates the many ways in which 
              sound can be used on a Linux system. Phillips illustrates his musical 
              expertise through the descriptions of the concepts, the inclusion 
              of the specific programs with installation instructions and troubleshooting 
              techniques, and the wide range of audio-specific applications. This 
              is a superb book about a little-documented area of Linux applications. 
              His patient and detailed answers and explanations on each topic 
              make the topics easy to understand, even from an amateur standpoint. 
              This is an excellent reference both for basic sound procedures and 
              for programs currently available for the Linux musician.

            <p> The majority of readers learn most effectively through some type 
              of visual representation or connotation. The adage claiming that 
              a picture is worth a thousand words is more truth than clich&eacute;. 
              <i>Master Red Hat Visually</i> by Michael Bellomo is an excellent 
              example of visual information. This offering from maranGraphics 
              and IDG books features an introduction to the Linux operating system, 
              beginning administration, networking, security, and disaster recovery. 
              Bellomo addresses the concepts through eight major sections and 
              the Appendices, including: Getting Started; Using the Linux Environment 
              Outside of the GUI; Starting Linux Administration; The Linux Network 
              -- The World Beyond Your Computer; Sharing Files and Machines 
              Over the Network; The Internet and Electronic Mail; Network Security; 
              and Disaster Preparation and Recovery.
            <p> Each section contains three to five chapters with accompanying 
              screen shots (there are more than 1200 throughout the book) to demonstrate 
              how to complete various tasks. This format allows the reader to 
              preview configuration changes, etc. and know exactly what to expect. 
              The first three parts (Getting Started, Using the Linux Environment 
              Outside of the GUI, and Starting Linux Administration) provide the 
              reader with basic configuration and navigation information through: 
              Getting Started with Linux Basics; Customizing Your Desktop Environment; 
              Working with Linux Files; Linux Commands; and GNOME, Working with 
              Linux Files Outside of GNOME; Useful Commands Outside the GNOME; 
              The <b>vi</b> Editor; Customize the Non-GNOME Environment; The Root 
              User; User and Group Account Management; Managing the File System; 
              Managing Linux Programs; and Word Processing in Linux.
            <p> Following these chapters, the user has several choices, depending 
              on his or her particular environment and preferences. Part IV discusses 
              networking in Networking in the Linux GNOME Environment; Remotely 
              Logging onto Other Machines; and Copying Files To and From Other 
              Machines. The following section describes ways to share printers 
              and files through Setting Up Network Printers; The Network File 
              System; The Network Information System -- NIS and Samba NIS 
              Client Configuration; and Setting Up Network Database Users. In 
              Part VI, The Internet and Electronic Mail, Bellomo details Establishing 
              Network Connectivity; Setting Up Your Netscape Browser; Installing 
              and Configuring Apache; and Sending and Receiving Mail in the Linux 
              Terminal. The Network Security section examines Your Security Scheme; 
              Tracking Intruders and Users on Your System; and The Aftermath: 
              What To Do. The concluding chapters concentrate on Disaster Preparation 
              and Recovery, including: Backing Up Files; The Y2038K Bug; and Troubleshooting 
              Common Linux Problems. The Appendixes contain A) Installing Linux, 
              B) Linux Applications You Should Be Aware Of, C) Summary of <b>vi</b> 
              Editor Commands, and D) Glossary of Linux Terms and Commands.
            <p> Bellomo provides a worthwhile and varied approach to learning 
              Linux. Each topic features a textual description, a visual representation 
              of the applicable screen shots, a step-by-step procedure, and a 
              Tips section. The latter utilizes a question and answer format, 
              highlighting some common problems and queries. A frequent complaint 
              about visual books is that they present a lot of screen shots, but 
              little description. <i>Master Red Hat Visually</i> presents a multi-faceted 
              approach that employs a combination of text and screen shots; the 
              author also details more of the intermediate topics than most beginning 
              books. The result is an excellent beginning book with a good reference 
              guide.
