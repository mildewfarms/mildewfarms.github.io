              Through the Network</h1>
            <p> <i>Gilbert Held</i>
            <p> This article is the fifth and final article of a series focused 
              on the various pieces of communications technology that can be used 
              to obtain a Quality of Service (QoS) capability. The previous article 
              discussed the Type of Service (ToS) byte in the IP header and showed 
              how the ToS byte can be used to provide differentiated service (DiffServ) 
              information to routers. (See the sidebar "The Story thus Far" 
              for more background.) In this article, I will point out some of 
              the limitations of DiffServ and then examine an alternative approach 
              to QoS based on Integrated Services and the use of RSVP. I will 
              briefly describe and discuss a few techniques that can facilitate 
              obtaining a QoS capability under different networking environments. 
              There are many aspects associated with QoS that make network managers 
              and LAN administrators yearn for the good old days when the use 
              of 64-Kbps time slots was the only way to obtain a Quality of Service. 
              Fortunately, the ability to support a much higher level of traffic 
              through the use of packet networks compensates for the effort involved 
              in effecting a QoS capability.
            <p> <b>Return to DiffServ</b>
            <p> In the previous article, I noted that this traffic expediting 
              technique divides transmission into a small number of classes. Routers 
              then apply a standardized set of behaviors to each class of traffic, 
              which is referred to as a per hop behavior. Because DiffServ-aware 
              routers perform their operation without the need to know the path 
              of traffic or information about other routers in the network, the 
              technology avoids the need for conveying signaling information other 
              than the bit composition of the revised ToS byte. While this is 
              a key advantage of DiffServ, it also results in the need to carefully 
              consider, as well as control, the arrival rate of one or more types 
              of traffic classes. For example, consider the use of expedited forwarding 
              (EF), which represents a simple per hop behavior that informs routers 
              that packets marked for EF status should be forwarded with minimal 
              delay and loss. The only way that a network operator can guarantee 
              minimal delay and loss to all packets marked for expedited forwarding 
              is to limit the arrival rate of such packets to less than the rate 
              at which routers can forward them. Although this task may appear 
              simple, in actuality, this method of flow control can be quite complex 
              as shown in Figure 1.
            <p> In examining Figure 1, let's assume routers 1 and 2 are connected 
              via a T1 circuit in the middle of a network, while router 1 has 
              connections via circuits labeled A, B, and C to three other devices. 
              This means that the network operator must limit the aggregate arrival 
              rate of EF packets via circuits A, B, and C destined to router 2 
              via router 1 to less than 1.544 Mbps. In actuality, the network 
              operator must also consider other traffic classes and control the 
              aggregate arrival rate of EF-marked packets to a rate significantly 
              under 1.544 Mbps to enable router 1 to transfer other traffic to 
              router 2. Because routers connected to circuits A, B, and C may 
              have one or more inputs that will flow from router 1 to router 2, 
              EF-marked packets at another hierarchy in the network must also 
              be considered. As a network increases in complexity, it becomes 
              harder for the network operator to configure devices at the edge 
              of the network to mark packets that allow routers to guarantee a 
              consistent handling of the packets. For this reason, an alternate 
              approach to provide a QoS capability through a network may be desirable. 
              One such method is based upon what is referred to as Integrated 
              Services (IntServ).
            <p> <b>Integrated Services</b>
            <p> Integrated Services refer to a suite of evolving standards intended 
              to provide a QoS transport capability over IP-based networks. IntServ 
              dates to the work of the IEFT during the mid-1990s and is defined 
              in RFC 1633.
            <p> The basic design issue covered by IntServ concerns sharing available 
              bandwidth during times of congestion. Under IntServ, congestion 
              management consists of the following:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Admission control, which is invoked by a reservation protocol 
                to determine whether resources are available for the flow at the 
                requested QoS 
              <li> A routing algorithm, which maintains a routing database that 
                provides next hop information for each destination address 
              <li> A queuing algorithm, which controls the flow of traffic through 
                a router 
              <li> A discard policy, which provides a uniform mechanism that denotes 
                the conditions under which packets are sent to the great bit bucket 
                in the sky
            </ul>
            <p> Although IntServ includes an admission control function, it does 
              not define the method of control to be used. However, when discussing 
              admission control, many people incorrectly associate the ReSerVation 
              Protocol (RSVP) as part of IntServ. In actuality, RSVP can be used 
              under IntServ but is not a required member of the architecture. 
              Because RSVP is currently the only mechanism that can be employed 
              to deliver guaranteed bandwidth within an IP network, I will describe 
              the basics of this signaling protocol.
            <p> <b>RSVP</b>
            <p> RSVP is a signaling protocol that enables applications to request 
              guaranteed bandwidth from a network. In doing so, RSVP provides 
              an admission control capability on an end-to-end basis, since the 
              availability of required bandwidth determines whether the application 
              gains access to the network.
            <p> Unlike most protocols that are sender driven, RSVP is receiver 
              driven. The rationale for this change is based upon the need to 
              accommodate different members of a multicast group that can have 
              different resource requirements. For example, one member of a multicast 
              group could be connected to an IP network via a 56-Kbps digital 
              circuit, while a second member is connected via a corporate LAN 
              using a T1 line operating at 1.544 Mbps. Under RSVP, a sender will 
              transmit a Path message downstream toward all receivers. The Path 
              message includes information on the traffic characteristics of the 
              data stream that will be generated. Each receiver requests a specific 
              QoS from the network by responding to the Path message with a reservation 
              (Resv) message. As a Resv message flows toward the originator, each 
              router in the path checks to determine whether sufficient resources 
              are available. If so, a reservation is established, and the Resv 
              message is forwarded to the next upstream router. Otherwise, the 
              reservation fails, and an error message is returned to the receiver.
            <p> To reduce signaling requirements, a sequence of packets from a 
              common address with a common destination are treated as a flow specification 
              (flowspec). The flowspec describes the service requirements in terms 
              of a desired QoS or reservation request and can include information 
              such as a service class defined by the application and a reservation 
              specification (Rspec) that defines the bandwidth required.
            <p> Each RSVP-compliant router includes a packet classifier and packet 
              scheduler. The classifier determines the route of the packet, while 
              the scheduler is responsible for servicing and forwarding decisions 
              required to achieve the requested QoS.
            <p> Another integral part of each RSVP-compliant router is a filter 

              specification (filterspec). The filterspec specifies the packets 
              that will be serviced and the manner in which they will be serviced 
              based upon the flowspec. An example of the relationship between 
              the filterspec and flowspec is shown in Figure 2. Note that the 
              packet classifier aggregates a series of packets that flow to a 
              common destination. The filterspec specifies packets that will be 
              serviced by the flowspec, while the flowspec parameters are used 
              by the router to place packets into applicable QoS-delivery queues.
            <p> Both Resv and Path messages have timeout values that are used 
              by routers and switches to set their internal timers. If those timers 
              expire, the reservation and routing information associated with 
              the reservation are turned down. This limits the seizure of resources 
              by the failure of a receiver to terminate an RSVP session.
            <p> Although RSVP is several years young, its implementation is commonly 
              restricted to small intranets. The reasons for its limited use are 
              primarily the signaling overhead associated with the protocol, the 
              need for all routers in a network to be RSVP compliant, and the 
              inability to negotiate the cost of bandwidth when a QoS traffic 
              flow crosses an ISP boundary. Concerning the latter, the simplicity 
              of allocating bandwidth to an application does not mean that it 
              is easy to bill for the bandwidth. This is because allocated bandwidth 
              can be temporarily deallocated when the application is quiescent, 
              permitting a router to use previously allocated bandwidth until 
              the application needs it. Thus, an interesting issue is how, for 
              example, would one ISP bill another for an application that required 
              8 Kbps of bandwidth that was available for use by the host ISP 60 
              percent of the time? While billing issues between ISPs may take 
              a while to resolve, many carriers are taking another look at RSVP 
              for internal use to include its proposed extension to support label 
              distribution and explicit routing. This issue requires knowledge 
              of label distribution, so I'll address this topic with the 
              help of Internet draft documents that describe multiprotocol label 
              switching (MPLS). (For further discussion of RSVP, see Ron McCarty's 
              article in this issue.)
            <p> <b>MPLS</b>
            <p> Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) represents a switching architecture 
              where packets entering a network are assigned a label. Then, instead 
              of forwarding packets based upon searching their routing table, 
              a router uses the label as a forwarding criteria. Because there 
              can be tens of thousands of entries in a routing table (while label 
              entries are associated with device interfaces), it is much faster 
              for the router to make forwarding decisions based upon the contents 
              of the label.
            <p> The original goal of MPLS was to provide the efficiency of Layer 
              2 switching to Layer 3 networking. Although the manufacture of application-specific, 
              integrated circuit (ASIC)-based routers permits relatively fast 
              router table lookup operations, that negates the original goal of 
              MPLS, there are other benefits associated with label switching. 
              Those benefits include the ability to define paths for different 
              types of traffic through a network (i.e., traffic engineering) and 
              the creation of IP tunnels through a network facilitating the creation 
              of virtual private networks (VPNs).
            <p> <b>The MPLS Label</b>
            <p> The MPLS label is 32 bits in length and consists of four fields 
              as indicated below:
            <p> 
            <pre>
|-20 bits Label-|-3 bits CoS-|-1 bit stack-|-8 bits TTL-|
</pre>
            The 20-bit label field contains the actual value of the MPLS label 
            and has local significance in the same manner as a Frame Relay Data 
            Link Control Identifier (DLCI) is used to convey path information. 
            The Class of Service (CoS) field permits packets to be placed into 
            one of eight classes than can affect queuing and discard algorithms 
            applied to the packet as it flows through each router in a network. 
            The third field in the label is the Stack (S) field. This one-bit 
            field is used to indicate a hierarchical label stack and is referred 
            to as a label stack. This means that it becomes possible for a packet 
            to have multiple paths with the value of the label stack identifying 
            a particular path to be taken.
            <p> The fourth field, time to live (TTL), consists of eight bits that 
              provide the functionality of the conventional IP TTL field in the 
              MPLS header. That is, it prevents a labeled packet from endlessly 
              wandering through a network. The MPLS label is inserted after the 
              Layer 2 header, preceding the IP header. The specific path through 
              an MPLS network is referred to as a label switch path (LSP). The 
              LSP is provisioned via the use of a label distribution protocol 
              (LDP), which both establishes a path through an MPLS network and 
              reserves resources to satisfy the predefined service requirements 
              for the data path. One pending LDP is the previously mentioned extension 
              to RSVP to support label distribution and explicit routing referred 
              to as RSVP-TE.
            <p> While one group of vendors (including Cisco and Juniper Networks) 
              supports the extension of RSVP, a second group of vendors (including 
              GDC and Nortel) are backing a second signaling mechanism referred 
              to as CR-LDP. Although both proposed signaling protocols have many 
              similarities, they are not interoperable, and the IETF's MPLS 
              working group has its work cut out in attempting to select one. 
              The MPLS Resource Center (<b>www.mplsrc.com</b>) functions as a 
              clearinghouse for information on the IETF's MPLS Standard. 
              There, you can determine whether a selection between the two signaling 
              protocols was made, as well as access a wealth of MPLS-related information. 
              Please refer to Ron McCarty's two-part series on MPLS (<i>Sys 
              Admin</i> Vol 9, Issue 5 and 6) and Randy Zhang's article in 
              <i>Sys Admin</i> Vol 9, Issue 12 for further discussion of MPLS.
            <p> <b>Other QoS Techniques</b>
            <p> Although DiffServ, MPLS, and other techniques represent traffic-expediting 
              methods, there are other techniques end users can employ that also 
              affect QoS. Those techniques are generally classified as efficiency 
              methods that facilitate data flow through a network. An example 
              of an efficiency method is the use of Real-Time Transport Protocol 
              (RTP) header compression.
            <p> RTP adds time stamping and data sequencing information to a packet. 
              In a voice over IP environment, an RTP header consisting of 12 bytes 
              is used behind an 8-byte UDP header. The RTP and UDP headers are 
              in turn prefixed with a 20-byte IP header. If RTP is employed with 
              an 8-Kbps voice digitization method that results in 20-ms portions 
              of speech being encoded, then the payload of the UDP segment will 
              be 160 bits or 20 bytes. This means that the total length of the 
              IP datagram conveying the digitized voice sample is 60 bytes, of 
              which only 20 bytes represent the actual payload. Through the use 
              of RTP header compression, it becomes possible to reduce the IP/RTP/UDP 
              header from 40 bytes to 2-5 bytes, with the actual reduction dependent 
              upon the susceptibility of the header's contents to compression. 
              RTP compression is currently defined in the IETF draft Compressed 
              RTP (CRTP).
            <p> Several vendors, including Cisco Systems, have implemented RTP 
              header compression to enhance communications on serial lines using 
              Frame Relay, HDLC, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) encapsulation, 
              or via an ISDN interface. Note that there is a relationship between 
              router processing time to perform header compression and the speed 
              at which compressed data is provided to a router's interface. 
              In general, the higher the data rate, the higher the processing 
              time. Thus, RTP header compression is commonly recommended for use 
              on slower links operating up to 512 Kbps where RTP header compression 
              can reduce overhead.
            <p> Another QoS technique that can be protocol independent is setting 
              router queues to prioritize traffic based on packet length. Because 
              digitized voice and interactive queries are typically transported 
              in relatively short packets, it becomes possible to favor such applications 
              over traffic transported in long frames, such as Web pages and graphics.
            <p> Focusing on a particular communications transport protocol may 
              provide control over one or more transmission parameters in conjunction 
              with a service level agreement (SLA) initiated with a carrier. For 
              example, in Frame Relay networking, you can use an SLA governing 
              the delivery rate of frames with or without their discard eligibility 
              (DE) bit set along with a maximum latency time to provide a QoS 
              capability to traffic.
            <p> As I've noted in this series, there are many parts of this 
              puzzle. Unlike when the telephone company provided QoS in the form 
              of reserved 64-Kbps time slots, the ability to provide QoS to packet 
              networks is significantly more complex. However, the fact that packet 
              networks dynamically allocate bandwidth makes their transport efficiency 
              much greater than the use of reserved time slots, resulting in an 
              economic reward for our efforts. Although it may be quite some time 
              until all the pieces of the QoS puzzle come together in an orderly 
              and manageable manner, it doesn't take an expert to note the 
              future.
            <p> With communications carriers installing tens of thousands of fiber 
              miles each year, while the migration from single channel to wavelength 
              division multiplexing (WDM) and dense WDM (DWDM) continues to add 
              significant networking bandwidth, it is quite possible that another 
              approach to QoS will evolve. That approach is for carriers to provide 
              sufficient bandwidth to overcome any potential bottlenecks. As we 
              plan for the vast migration onto packet networks, we need to periodically 
              check the progress of standards, examine SLA offerings, and be aware
