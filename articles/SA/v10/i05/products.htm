            <b>Keyspan Ships USB 4-Port Serial Adapter for Linux, Windows, and 
            Mac OS</b>
            <p> Keyspan, a provider of USB connectivity products, is now shipping 
              its new USB 4-port Serial Adapter. According to the company, the 
              Keyspan USB 4-Port Serial Adapter allows four serial devices to 
              be connected to a single USB port. Each of its male DB9 ports allows 
              connection to RS-232 serial devices at data rates up to 960 Kbps. 
              In addition to supporting Linux 2.4, the Keyspan USB 4-Port Serial 
              Adapter can also be used on the Windows 98, Windows ME, and Windows 
              2000 platforms, as well as with Mac OS 8.6 or higher. Support for 
              Mac OS X will be available in the third quarter.
            <p> This new adapter is targeted to enterprise and industrial market 
              segments. It is an option for connecting serial devices needed in 
              laboratory, manufacturing, and retail settings for Point of Sale 
              (POS), process control, or data retrieval applications. Distributed 
              by Ingram Micro and Tech Data, the adapter has a suggested retail

            <p> <b>Connexx Announces SANavigator 1.5</b>
            <p> Connex, a developer of Storage Area Network (SAN) and Network 
              Attached Storage (NAS) solutions, announced the availability of 
              SANavigator version 1.5. According to the company, this new version 
              of the vendor- and platform-independent SAN management application 
              is a comprehensive solution that supports the Storage Network Industry 
              Association (SNIA) Host Bus Adapter (HBA) API for in-band discovery. 
              In addition to using this feature to provide key management, version 
              1.5 supports (data path) zoning for more devices, provides additional 
              integration features for a variety of applications, and includes 
              a software development kit for support of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, 
              and Roman characters.
            <p> SANavigator Version 1.5, a Java-based storage management application 
              that operates as a host for other storage management applications, 
              utilities and tools from major storage vendors, includes an Auto 
              Discovery feature that performs an inventory of all SAN and NAS 
              resources. The SANmap component of SANavigator presents a visual 
              map of the SAN showing all devices and their interconnections. It 
              allows a manager to establish new zones, create redundant paths 
              and other management routines, completing with just a few mouse 
              clicks a process that previously took several hours.
            <p> By supporting the SNIA standard as part of the Auto Discovery 
              process, Version 1.5 provides valuable information on Host Bus Adapters 
              and attached devices. It provides, for example, LUN (Logical Unit 
              Number) level information on RAID arrays, and the firmware version 
              of SAN devices. Version 1.5 can also provide environmental information 
              and other data. Because Version 1.5 supports agentless in-band discovery 
              for local HBAs and attached SANs, managers can avoid installing 
              and maintaining agents throughout the network.
            <p> Other new features of Version 1.5 include data path zoning support 
              for additional devices, which allows devices and data paths to be 
              organized in different ways, a clip board that makes it possible 
              to copy information about devices to an Excel or Word file for reporting 
              purposes, and a localization software development kit. Like the 
              earlier version of SANavigator, version 1.5 supports all Microsoft 
              Windows platforms (98, NT, and 2000) in addition to Solaris and 
              Linux. SANavigator Version 1.5 is interoperable with other storage 
              management applications and can be utilized to launch operations 
              such as serverless backup using third-party backup software.

            <p> Procom Technology Inc., a manufacturer of data storage and access 
              appliances, has introduced an addition to its enterprise-level NetFORCE 
              3000 series of NAS filers -- the 3200C cluster. Available immediately, 
              the average selling price for 7-TB capacity is $319,000 or 4.5 cents/MB. 
              Offering up to 96 drives with proportional performance increases, 
              the 3200C is the highest capacity NetFORCE filer currently available. 
              According to the company, the 3200C combines high availability, 
              ease of use, ease of installation, affordability, and true file-sharing 
              capability in heterogeneous environments by relying on high-density 
              Fibre Channel technology for back-end storage subsystem.
            <p> NetFORCE 3200C filers are deployed in a clustered environment,

              leaving applications and users unaffected even in the event of catastrophic 
              server failure. The NF 3200C also employs dual-active Fibre RAID 
              controllers, redundant cooling fans, and redundant power supplies. 
              In addition to the cross-platform file sharing enabled by NAS, the 
              NetFORCE 3200C adheres to both Windows and UNIX file security protocols 
              by integrating UNIX directory services, NIS and Windows NT Access

            <p> <b>Dirig Software Announces MySQL SAM </b>
            <p> Dirig Software, a developer of applications and systems management 
              solutions, announced that it has released a new Specific Application 
              Manager (SAM) for managing MySQL, an open source relational database. 
              According to the company, SAMs provide IT administrators with a 
              solution to increase the rate of install and solve application problems 
              such as database management through a set of pre-configured management 
              rules. The MySQL SAM addresses the issues of managing an open source-based 
              database alongside other database configurations. Customers in a 
              multi-platform environment have the ability to manage separate databases.
            <p> Dirig's Specific Application Managers allow a user to manage 
              an application with minimal or no added configuration. Through a 
              drag and drop function, Dirig SAMs are imported and a set of predefined 
              rules are automatically created, providing users with application 
              management with minimal configuration.
