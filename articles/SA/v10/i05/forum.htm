            <p> It seems I'm always writing about change. But, change is 
              good, right? I'm told it's an indication of progress. 
              The first changes I want to mention don't particularly affect 
              <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine, but they do affect me. Two esteemed colleagues 
              of mine have recently left CMP to pursue other opportunities, as 
              they say. Berney Williams, acquisitions editor for our CMP (previously 
              R&amp;D) Books department has left to test his luck in the educational 
              arena. Marc Briand, Editor in Chief of <i>Sys Admin</i>'s sister 
              publication, <i>C/C++ User's Journal</i>, is returning to the 
              engineering life, where he'll be developing avionics test systems. 
              Aside from providing me with sound advice on editorial matters, 
              these men have often cheered me with their dry and quirky humor 
              in the midst of the most sour of situations. Here in our small Kansas 
              office, this is a trait to be highly admired and one I have relished 
              while working with them. I will miss them and all the interesting 
              lunchtime conversations we've shared.
            <p> One of the changes in the works for the magazine is that Curtis 
              Preston, author of the lost+found column in <i>Sys Admin</i> (and 
              of <i>Unix Backup and Recovery</i> published by O'Reilly and 
              Associates) will now be contributing his column on a monthly basis. 
              I'm happy that Curtis has found time in his busy book-writing 
              and consulting schedule to write more frequently for the magazine. 
              This month, he continues his discussion of Storage Area Networks. 
              Rumor has it that SANs will be the subject of Curtis's next 
              book.
            <p> New content has also been added to the <i>Sys Admin</i> Web site. 
              This month, we're debuting the Solaris Corner, which will feature 
              a monthly column by Contributing Editor Peter Baer Galvin. You may 
              be familiar with Pete's work from his columns, Pete's 
              Super Systems and Pete's Wicked World, written for <b>UnixInsider.com</b>. 
              He is also co-author of <i>Operating Systems Concepts</i> and <i>Applied 
              Operating Systems Concepts</i> (John Wiley &amp; Sons). We've 
              posted some (and intend to post all) of <i>Sys Admin</i>'s 
              Solaris-related articles in this section along with links to Solaris 
              administration resources.
            <p> Note that this month we're featuring two Web-exclusive articles. 
              Gil Held's article on script-form attacks and Ed Schaefer's 
              article explaining how to communicate with bar code printers appear 
              only on the Web site, so be sure to check those out. Another article 
              of interest in this issue is Evan Sarmiento's description of 
              his OpenRoot project using FreeBSD's Jail feature. Evan, who 
              writes that he's in the 9th grade, surely wins the Youngest 
              <i>Sys Admin</i> Author award. I invite all potential authors to 
              send article proposals to me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>, and 
              I hope you enjoy the magazine.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p> 
            <p>
