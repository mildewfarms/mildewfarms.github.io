            <p> <b>Solaris 8 Essential Reference </b><br>
              John P. Mulligan <br>
              New Riders <br>

            <p> A good command reference for any system can make the difference 
              between a smoothly running system and an inefficient one. John Mulligan, 
              author of the <i>Solaris Essential Reference</i> (New Riders, ISBN 
              0-7357-0023-0), has updated his excellent command resource to include 
              Solaris 8 and its features. This newly expanded version not only 
              covers Solaris 8, but also can be used for Solaris 2.2 through 2.6, 
              plus Solaris 7. Mulligan features the information through four separate 
              sections: a General Usage Reference, a Developer Reference, Administration 
              and Maintenance Task Reference, and the Appendices. 
            <p> The first section contains chapters on Text Utilities, Shell Scripting, 
              Process Control, and Network Clients and Utilities. The following 
              part addresses the particular needs of developers and includes information 
              on Compilers/Interpreters, Programming Utilities, and Debugging. 
              The central part of the book, Part III, Administration and Maintenance 
              Task Reference, details Startup and Shutdown, User Management, Network 
              Administration, Filesystems, Security, and System Configuration 
              and Tuning. The final section, Appendices, references A) Solaris 
              Version Changes, B) Common Startup Problems and Solutions, C) Linux 
              Compatibility, D) GNU Public License, E) Web Resources, F) Signals, 
              and G) TCP/UDP Port List. 
            <p> Each chapter begins with an alphabetical listing of the commands 
              within the chapter and their page numbers. The opening page also 
              includes a listing of the order in which the topics are presented 
              in the chapter. For most of the entries, the author provides a description, 
              the command syntax, and its specific options, as well as an example. 
              (The exceptions to this are in the third part, where the commands 
              are a little more complex.)
            <p> Mulligan's <i>Solaris 8 Essential Reference</i> is a superb 
              reference, resource, and utility. It qualifies as a reference due 
              to the command entries, descriptions, and syntax. Its recommendations 
              of other sources of information, such as Web sites and publications, 
              also contribute to its usefulness. Mulligan also includes some analysis 
              tools and third party utilities (including GNU tools within Solaris 
              8) to fulfill administration tasks, which make it a utility. The 
              addition of an entire section (the Developer Reference) makes it 
              a complete reference for users, programmers, and administrators. 
            <p> Compiling a command reference requires a delicate balance; if 
              the author is too concise, the commands become cryptic. If he is 
              too verbose, he can quickly and easily defeat his purpose. Mulligan's 
              reference is exceptionally good. The entries are well written, precise, 
              and designed to help the user, programmer, or administrator discover 
              what he or she needs to know and quickly apply the commands to their 
              tasks. This is an exceptional book that any Solaris user or administrator 
              will appreciate and frequently use.

            <p> The mysteries and methods associated with the SCSI (Small Computer 
              System Interface) can be confusing to the uninitiated. In contrast 
              to an ATAPI-only interface system, SCSI installation involves separate 
              interface cards, SCSI IDS (and perhaps LUNS), and terminators. There 
              are also different types of SCSI connections, such as fast, wide, 
              ultra, SCSI-2, and SCSI-3, to name a few of the variations. The 
              advantages of using SCSI are numerous: portability, adaptability 
              (for both Macs and PCs), speed, multi-tasking, and the ability to 
              support multiple devices and types. 
            <p> The second edition of <i>The Book of SCSI </i>demonstrates how 
              to install and configure a SCSI adapter and details how SCSI hardware 
              works, examines the software and device driver programs, and even 
              discusses ASPI (Advanced SCSI Programming Interface) programming. 
              The authors introduce the concepts of the SCSI interface with a 
              Welcome To SCSI chapter. They present an overview of SCSI attributes, 
              their advantages, and some of the different available SCSI types. 
              Chapter 1.5 examines the various devices that SCSI supports, including 
              hard disks, tape drives, CD-ROM, and DVD-ROM drives, printers, and 
              scanners. The following chapters first address the hardware-related 
              topics: A Look At SCSI-3, SCSI Anatomy, Adding SCSI to Your PC, 
              How to Connect Your SCSI Hardware, Troubleshooting Your SCSI Installation, 
              and How the Bus Works. 
            <p> The software and driver-specific chapters highlight: Understanding 
              Device Drivers, Performance Tuning Your SCSI Subsystem, RAID: Redundant 
              Array of Independent Disks, A Profile of ASPI Programming, and the 
              Future of SCSI and Storage In General. The Appendices includes: 
              A) an All-Platform Technical Reference, B) a PC Technical Reference, 
              C) A Look At SCSI Test Equipment, D) ATA/IDE Versus SCSI, E) A Small 
              ASPI Demo Application, and a Glossary. The accompanying CD-ROM contains 
              extensive information in HTML and text formats. The authors provide 
              several ways to access the information: Netscape, Internet Explorer, 
              Windows Explorer, and the Linux command prompt. (I did access the 
              CD-ROM through Netscape, Opera, and the command prompt.) Some of 
              the information on the CD-ROM features the SCSI FAQ, the SCSI Quick 
              Start Guide, the Linux SCSI HowTo, The Linux SCSI Programming HowTo, 
              the entire book in searchable format, and numerous SCSI Internet 
              links.
            <p> <i>The Book of SCSI</i>, Second Edition, is a clearly written 
              and useful reference. The authors demonstrate superb coverage of 
              every facet of SCSI use and configuration. The inclusion of the 
              programming features is particularly valuable in the light of the 
              Adaptec program to encourage and support Open Source driver development 
              for RAID and SCSI controllers. The CD-ROM is a cohesive creation; 
              it addresses the reader with an introduction, instead of merely 
              collecting the information on a disc. The selection of data included 
              on the CD-ROM makes a neatly portable troubleshooting reference. 
              This is a book that every systems administrator, network administrator, 
              system programmer, and hardware technician needs. It is not only 
              a SCSI reference, but is also interesting reading for anyone who 
              likes to know how a system works.

            <p> Regular readers of computer magazines, whether online or traditional 
              print versions, have seen an increasing number of feature articles 
              on XML. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) can perform a wide 
              variety of tasks, depending on the user's needs and the specific 
              requirements of their computing environment. Its versatility has 
              made it a popular choice (as evidenced by the amount of articles 
              and books on the topic) and also reflects the dynamic character 
              of the Internet community. In <i>Learning XML</i>, author Erik Ray 
              first describes XML and some of its capabilities and proceeds to 
              define it. The description provides the opening sentence of the 
              book:
            <p> Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a data storage toolkit, a 
              configurable vehicle for any kind of information, an evolving and 
              open standard embraced by everyone from bankers to webmasters. [Page 
              1.]
            <p> Following a list of some of XML's features, Ray provides 
              a multi-level definition of XML:
            <p> On one level, XML is a protocol for containing and managing information. 
              On another level, it's a family of technologies that can do 
              everything from formatting documents to filtering data. And on the 
              highest level, it's a philosophy for information handling that 
              seeks maximum usefulness and flexibility for data by refining it 
              to its purest and most structured form. [Page 2.]
            <p> After Ray establishes these precepts, he examines XML's most 
              popular uses and concepts. Following the Introduction, the author 
              addresses: Markup and Core Concepts, Connecting Resources with Links, 
              Presentation: Creating the End Product, Document Models: A Higher 
              Level of Control, Transformation: Repurposing Documents, Internationalization, 
              and Programming for XML. The Appendices include: A) Resources, B) 
              A Taxonomy of Standards, and a Glossary. The second chapter features 
              the essential syntax for a basic XML document and illustrates examples 
              of some possible presentations (depending on the stylesheet utilized). 
              This is the basis for the procedures discussed throughout the rest 
              of the book. Chapter 2, Markup and Core Concepts, is also available 
              at:

            Succeeding chapters demonstrate adding resources (such as pictures 
            or dynamic lists), using stylesheets, modeling documents, and transforming 
            documents through XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language for Transformation.)
            <p> <i>Learning XML</i> clarifies the design and procedures of XML. 
              Ray describes what it is, what it isn't, what it can do, and 
              how to implement it. He addresses the varied uses of XML according 
              to the levels defined in the beginning chapter. He also provides 
              practical notes and helpful tips throughout the book in addition 
              to the excellent glossary at the back of the book. Learning XML 
              is a well-written and helpful approach to understanding and using 
              XML. It is also an ideal learning tool and also references ways 
              to become part of the XML community.

            The Friends of ED "Designer to Designer" series of Web design 
            books utilize three levels (Foundation, Studio, and Masters) to address 
            practical Web design. (According to one explanation, ED is Extra Dimension, 
            Exceptional Design, and Every Designer.) The Foundation titles demonstrate 
            the fundamentals; the Studio books illustrate skill and craft improvements, 
            and the Masters books show how the best of designers have created 
            effects and solved problems, complete with the code they used. 
            <p> <i>Foundation Flash 5</i> features the capabilities of Flash 5 
              and describes how to implement various facets of the program. Bhangal, 
              Farr, and Rey introduce the book with a section called Flash 5 and 
              this Book: the Truth. The chapters describe how to use the Flash 
              tools to create and refine a Web-page interface. The authors present 
              the topics in the following order: Flash Movie Essentials, The Flash 
              Toolbox, Flash Symbols and Libraries, Managing Content on the Stage, 
              Enhancing Your Appearance, Motion Tweening, Shape Tweening, Masks 
              and Masking, Actions and Interactions, Intelligent Actions, Sound, 
              Optimizing, Publishing, Intermediate ActionScript 1, Intermediate 
              ActionScript 2, High-Level Site Design, and Futurescape. The Appendices 
              include: A) Sound Sampling, B) HTML and Flash, and C) Glossary.
            <p> <i>Foundation Flash 5</i> provides a clear and ordered description 
              of the procedures for Flash 5 use. Each chapter begins with an outline 
              of the chapter contents followed by a brief introduction; each chapter 
              concludes with a case study and a summary. The case studies build 
              toward a Flash movie that interfaces with a Web page. The authors 
              detail the individual procedures through a discussion of the concepts, 
              when you may want to use them, their effects, and benefits, plus 
              step-by-step guidelines for the respective implementations. In Foundation 
              Flash 5, authors Bhangal, Farr, and Rey furnish effective and valuable 
              descriptions of essential Flash 5 processes and techniques. Any 
              programmer interested in graphic design and its implementation will 
              find this book intriguing; Web designers will find it indispensable.
