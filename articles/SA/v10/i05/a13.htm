              and Answers</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Jim McKinstry and Amy Rich</i>
            <p> I have a Linux machine that logged the following error message. 
              Do you know what it's from or what it means?
            <p> 
            <pre>
kernel: Suspect short first fragment.
kernel: eth0 PROTO=17 OUTSIDE_IP:0 MY_IP:0 L=24 S=0x00 I=57374 \
  F=0x2000 T=116 (#0)</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> This is your kernel intercepting 
            a packet that is too short to be valid. IP packets that are too large 
            can be split into multiple packets, and each part is called a fragment. 
            The kernel then reassembles all of the fragments to get a full packet. 
            This kernel message indicates that someone (probably maliciously) 
            sent you a packet that was too short even to contain the headers for 
            the fragment. Short fragments are usually signs of an attack on your 
            machine.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I was running FreeBSD 4.2-STABLE 
              on a second partition on my laptop, when the need arose to install 
              Windows. I put Windows 98 on the primary partition, and, unfortunately, 
              this overwrote the MBR, and I can no longer boot into my FreeBSD 
              partition. Can I recover my data? Do I need to reinstall?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can easily recover your information, 
              and even be able to boot off the secondary partition as long as 
              your Windows install didn't overwrite the partition your FreeBSD 
              install resides on. You can download the <b>bootinst.exe</b> DOS 
              program from:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.2-RELEASE/tools/
</pre>
            and redo the MBR from DOS.
            <p> You can also use <b>boot0cfg</b> from FreeBSD. Insert your FreeBSD 
              boot disk, and press a key when the machine starts to boot. If you 
              don't have a boot disk, the images can be obtained from:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.2-RELEASE/floppies/
</pre>
            Once you have the kernel image, you can put it onto disk by doing 
            the following from a UNIX machine:
            <p> 
            <pre>
dd if=kern.flp of=&lt;whatever your floppy device is&gt;
</pre>
            To create the images from DOS, you need a disk copy program file <b>fdimage</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>
fdimage kern.flp a:
</pre>
            Insert the kernel floppy into your laptop floppy drive and boot from 
            it (you may need to change the boot list in your laptop's BIOS). 
            Interrupt the booting process at the beginning, unload the kernel 
            from the floppy, and boot determine the location of your kernel image 
            on disk:
            <p> 
            <pre>
unload
lsdev -v
</pre>
            The <b>lsdev</b> will tell you where your root partition resides. 
            You can then reset the current location from which to load the kernel 
            (and actually load the new kernel):
            <p> 
            <pre>
set currdev=&lt;root partition's name determined from lsdev&gt;
load kernel
boot
</pre>
            Once you have the machine booted, you can redo the MBR by doing the 
            following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
boot0cfg -B ad0
</pre>
            You should now be able to boot from either partition.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm using Solaris 2.5.1 on 
              a Sparc 20 with two identical 2-GB internal disks. I'm trying 
              to copy one disk to the other using <b>ufsdump</b>, but I'm 
              getting errors about a corrupted bootblock on the disk I'm 
              dumping to. Both disks are partitioned as follows:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Total disk cylinders available: 2733 + 2 (reserved cylinders)

Part      Tag    Flag     Cylinders       Size            Blocks

  1       swap    wu     944 - 1288     256.05MB    (345/0/0)   524400

  4 unassigned    wm       0              0         (0/0/0)          0
  5 unassigned    wm    1289 - 2732       1.05GB    (1444/0/0) 2194880
  6 unassigned    wm       0              0         (0/0/0)          0
  7 unassigned    wm       0              0         (0/0/0)          0
</pre>
            Slice 0 is <b>/</b> and slice 5 is <b>/usr</b>. Then I do the <b>ufsdump</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ufsdump 0uf /dev/rdsk/c0t3d0s0 /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s0
ufsdump 0uf /dev/rdsk/c0t3d0s5 /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s5
</pre>
            When I try to boot off the disk, I get errors about the disk being 
            unbootable and having a corrupt bootblock. What am I doing wrong?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There's actually a couple 
              of issues here. First, you're doing a <b>ufsdump</b> straight 
              to the second disk device, which causes you to overwrite the bootblock 
              at cylinder 0. What you really want to do is create the two partitions 
              with <b>newfs</b>, mount them, dump them, and then do a <b>ufsrestore</b> 
              as follows:
            <p> 
            <pre>
newfs /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s0
mkdir /s0
mount /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s0 /s0
ufsdump 0f / - |(cd /s0; ufsrestore -)
umount /s0
rmdir /s0

newfs /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s5
mkdir /s5
mount /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s5 /s5
ufsdump 0f /usr - |(cd /s5; ufsrestore -)
umount /s5
rmdir /s5
</pre>
            You also want to install the bootblocks onto the new disk by doing 
            the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
installboot /usr/platform/`uname -i`/lib/fs/ufs/bootblk /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s0
</pre>
            Lastly, if you want to boot off this disk and use all of the filesystems 
            on this disk, you'll need to modify <b>/etc/vfstab</b> to change 
            any references to <b>c0t3d0</b> to <b>c0t1d0</b>.
            <p> That said, it would be much simpler to use Solaris DiskSuite (or 
              Veritas Volume Manager) to encapsulate the boot disk and mirror 
              it to the second one. Using DiskSuite will also give you redundant 
              disk while the machine is live, so you won't need to reboot 
              off the other disk if one fails (although you will eventually have 
              to shut down to replace the disk).
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a lot of users that use 
              UUNET's dial-up pool when they travel. I want to allow them 
              mail relaying from our mail server, but I don't want to open 
              it up to the entire UUNET dial-up pool (for obvious spam reasons). 
              What's the best way to go about this?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You have a couple of options. 
              You can do POP-before-SMTP, which requires modifications to the 
              POP daemon, a couple of utilities, and an addition to the Sendmail 
              configuration. You can also do <b>SMTPAUTH</b> or <b>STARTTLS</b> 
              if you're using Sendmail 8.10/8.11. Sendmail's page on 
              roaming users has information on all of these methods:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/roaming.html
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm having a problem editing 
            root's cron file. I've logged in as root from the console, 
            and I can edit everyone else's crontab with <b>crontab -e &lt;user&gt;</b>. 
            When I try this as root, though, all I get is a line saying 1427, 
            and then my prompt doesn't come back. I can only get out by typing 
            Control-d. I can look at the file with <b>crontab</b> <b>-l</b> just 
            fine. What's the problem?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you're just seeing a 
              number when you use <b>crontab -e</b>, it sounds like you're 
              winding up using <b>ed</b> instead of whatever editor you expected 
              to be using. You can correct this by doing the following (assuming 
              you want <b>vi</b> as your editor):
            <p> Syntax for Bourne shell variants:
            <p> 
            <pre>
export EDITOR=vi
export VISUAL=vi
</pre>
            Syntax for C shell variants:
            <p> 
            <pre>
setenv EDITOR vi
setenv VISUAL vi
</pre>
            You'll most likely want to set these variables in one of root's 
            startup files as well, so you always have the default editor of your 
            choice.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I run a Sendmail mail server, 
              but I need to support a number of Windows clients (specifically 
              Outlook 2000 and Eudora). I'm really concerned about people 
              sending Visual Basic attachments with viruses in them. Is there 
              something I can do to filter on content to protect my Windows users?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b>You probably want to take a look 
              at milter, Sendmail's Perl filter API:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sendmail-milter/
</pre>
            You can write your own filter rules to match whatever criteria you 
            need. Milter has the ability to modify or discard any parts of both 
            headers and body. Milter is distributed with versions of Sendmail 
            8.10.1 and later. One milter that may be of particular interest to 
            you, depending on what OS you run, is at:
            <p> 
            <pre>

</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an organization with shared 
            email address books in Netscape (by editing <b>prefs.js</b> to point 
            at a network location). They are getting to a size where this solution 
            no longer works very well (due to file locking blocking access to 
            other users), but it makes no sense to get something like Exchange 
            server so they can have a centralized address book.
            <p> It seems to me that it ought to be possible to set up OpenLDAP 
              running on a Linux box to serve this purpose (much like, say four11 
              or bigfoot). There are MSWindows clients available to maintain the 
              database. I'm stuck on how to design the database and schema 
              to enable all this happen.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Yes, LDAP works well for a site-wide 
              email address database. For an introduction on how to design LDAP 
              schemas, you may want to pick up the book <i>Understanding and Deploying 
              LDAP Directory Servers</i>, by Timothy A. Howes. Netscape also has 
              information on designing a directory server at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/directory/41/deploy/contents.htm
</pre>
            In general, give some thought to the design up front so you can define 
            a schema that has <i>all</i> the variables that you'll want to 
            be able to store about the employees. Besides designing your LDAP 
            database just for an email addressbook, also consider designing it 
            so you can eventually use it as a centralized database for all sorts 
            of user (and other!) information (HR information, user authentication, 
            calendaring, mailing lists, etc.). Just be sure when choosing the 
            unique identifier for your user leaf nodes that you don't use 
            something confidential like the employee's SSN.
