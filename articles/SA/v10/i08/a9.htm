            <p> <i>Elizabeth Zinkann</i> 
            <p> This month's column highlights an outstanding networking 
              book, a classic fourth edition, a premier book about an editor, 
              a survey of a dictionary, and some notes of interest. Specifically, 
              I reviewed: <i>Networking: A Beginner's Guide</i> by Bruce 
              Hallberg (Osborne/McGraw-Hill Network Professional's Library); 
              <i>DNS and BIND</i>, Fourth Edition by Paul Albitz and Cricket Liu 
              (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.); <i>Vi IMproved-Vim</i> by 
              Steve Oualline, Foreword by Bram Moolenaar, Creator of Vim (New 
              Riders, Open Publication License); and the <i>Dictionary of Internetworking 
              Terms and Acronyms</i> by Cisco Systems Inc. (Cisco Press). I also 
              have included Notes on <i>Secrets &amp; Lies: Digital Security In 
              A Networked World</i> by Bruce Schneier (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 
              Inc.) and the <i>Linux Journal 2001 Buyer's Guide</i> (<i>Linux 
              Journal</i>, Specialized Systems Consultants, Inc.) 
            <p> Notes: <i>Secrets &amp; Lies: Digital Security In A Networked 
              World</i> by Bruce Schneier (ISBN 0-471-25311-1, $29.99), which 
              was reviewed in the November, 2000 issue of <i>Sys Admin</i>, recently 
              received the 11th Annual Jolt Productivity Award by CMP's <i>Software 
              Development</i> magazine. Schneier's book highlights the new 
              risks that accompany Internet business developments and how to securely 
              manage them. 
            <p> I seldom review magazines, but the <i>Linux Journal 2001 Buyer's 
              Guide</i> (<i>Linux Journal</i>, SSC, Inc., $5.00, <b>http://store.linuxjournal.com</b>) 
              is well worth reading. It presents five features about current Linux 
              trends, including a comparison chart of the Linux distributions 
              and how to select your distribution. Most of the guide surveys the 
              products available for the Linux platform, including software, hardware, 
              publications, and services. It also lists a complete vendor directory. 
              Although it is virtually impossible to publish a magazine that is 
              completely current, the <i>Linux Journal 2001 Buyer's Guide</i> 
              provides a good reference with product descriptions, reviews, and 
              vendor information. 
            <p> <b>Networking: A Beginner's Guide</b><br>
              Bruce Hallberg<br>
              Osborne/McGraw-Hill<br>
              Network Professional's Library<br>
              ISBN 0-07-212226-9<br>

            <p> One of the most popular attractions at the spring Comdex was SOHO 
              networking. Many homes now have two or more computers and want to 
              network them to share phone lines or printers. Small businesses 
              are also utilizing networks to share peripherals and file access. 
              In <i>Networking: A Beginner's Guide</i>, Hallberg demonstrates 
              why networking knowledge is important, recognizes the middle-ground 
              reader who is neither a computer novice nor a networking guru, and 
              addresses professional computer users throughout the book. He divides 
              the topics into two major sections: Networking Ins and Outs and 
              Hands-On Knowledge. 
            <p> The first part features networking concepts, hardware implementations, 
              protocols, and design issues. The first chapter, Understanding Networking, 
              presents an overview of Peer-to-Peer and Client-Server network philosophies 
              plus their accompanying benefits and disadvantages. Hallberg also 
              describes basic networking capabilities and details the OSI reference 
              model. The following chapters examine the physical setups, installations, 
              and primary considerations (i.e., security) through: Understanding 
              Network Cabling; Understanding Network Hardware; Making WAN Connections; 
              Understanding Network Protocols; Learning About Directory Services; 
              Connections from Afar: Remote Network Access; Securing Your Network; 
              Network Servers: Everything You Wanted to Know, But Were Afraid 
              to Ask; and All About Client Computers. 
            <p> In the second part of the book, Hands On Knowledge, Hallberg illustrates 
              the practical considerations and necessary configuration and administration 
              tasks for NetWare 5, Windows 2000, and Linux. The individual chapters 
              include: Designing a Network; Installing and Setting Up NetWare 
              5; Administering NetWare: The Basics; Understanding Other NetWare 
              Services; Installing and Setting Up Windows 2000 Server; Administering 
              Windows 2000 Server: The Basics; Understanding Other Windows 2000 
              Server Services; Installing Linux in a Server Configuration; and 
              Introduction to Linux Systems Administration. The author also provides 
              a Glossary. A special illustration of bus, ring, and star topologies 
              plus the OSI networking model are visually represented in the center 
              of the book in an insert called Blueprints. 
            <p> In <i>Networking: A Beginner's Guide</i>, author Bruce Hallberg 
              presents an exceptional analysis of network designs, concepts, and 
              techniques. His clear explanations are interspersed with extensive 
              notes and personal administration experiences appropriately named 
              "author's notes". Hallberg carefully differentiates 
              among similarly named terms with very different definitions. This 
              combination of descriptions, explanations, definitions, and processes 
              make this book an effective and valuable reference. It is a useful 
              resource for anyone who is an experienced computer user and wants 
              to learn more about designing and implementing a network. 
            <p> <b>DNS and BIND</b><br>
              Fourth Edition<br>
              Paul Albitz and Cricket Liu<br>

            <p> The implementations of DNS (Domain Name System) and BIND (Berkeley 
              Internet Name Domain) have become indispensable for administrators 
              and users alike. Administrators install and configure the utilities 
              so that users can type <b>bestsitefirst.com</b> or <b>sysadminmag.com</b> 
              instead of 205.214.165.141 or 66.35.216.85 to access the respective 
              Web sites. Administrators can use <i>DNS and BIND</i> in several 
              ways, including subdividing domains, load sharing among servers, 
              forward and reverse mapping, and securing the server. Albitz and 
              Liu illustrate how to utilize <i>DNS and BIND</i> to accomplish 
              these tasks and more. 
            <p> With the fourth edition, the authors have updated and expanded 
              the text to include BIND 9.10 and BIND 8.2.3 in addition to the 
              4.9 version. Some of the new capabilities are transaction signatures 
              (TSIG), DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions), IPv6 forward and reverse 
              mapping utilizing A6 and DNAME records, and the update policy of 
              BIND 9.1.0. The Security topic now appears in a separate chapter, 
              and the Appendices have also been reorganized and modified. The 
              authors address the individual topics in the following order: Background; 
              How Does DNS Work?; Where Do I Start?; Setting Up BIND, DNS and 
              Electronic Mail; Configuring Hosts; Maintaining BIND; Growing Your 
              Domain; Parenting; Advanced Features; Security; nslookup and dig; 
              Reading BIND Debugging Output; Troubleshooting <i>DNS and BIND</i>; 
              Programming with the Resolver and Name Server Library Routines; 
              and Miscellaneous. The Appendices contain A) DNS Message Format 
              and Resource Records, B) BIND Compatibility Matrix, C) Compiling 
              and Installing BIND on Linux, D) Top-Level Domains, and E) BIND 
              Name Server and Resolver Configuration. 
            <p> <i>DNS and BIND</i>, Fourth Edition remains an essential reference 
              for systems and network administrators. Albitz and Liu describe 
              the facets and procedures connected with DNS and BIND through a 
              well-written and precise style. Every administrator will appreciate 
              their thorough coverage of the new attributes and features within 
              the newer versions plus the inclusion of the previous versions. 
            <p> <b>Vi IMproved-Vim</b><br>
              Steve Oualline<br>
              Foreword by Bram Moolenaar, Creator of Vim<br>
              New Riders Open Publication License<br>

            <p> When it comes to editing, most of us have a preferred text editor 
              that (of course) is much better for inputting everything from the 
              most graceful haiku or the silliest riddles to the most eloquent 
              essays, than any other program in existence. For many of us, that 
              program is <b>vi</b>, or <b>vi</b> improved in its latest form. 
              Up until now, however, the way to learn how to use all of its capabilities 
              was through online documentation. Author Steve Oualline researched, 
              organized, and assembled the information and instructions for using 
              the Vim editor. The result is a superb reference and guide to Vim, 
              presented in three major sections. 
            <p> The first part, encompassing chapters 1 through 17, comprises 
              The Tutorial. The other two parts are The Details and The Appendices. 
              The Tutorial presents the extended basic set of commands; The Details 
              describes the advanced topics; and The Appendices contains miscellaneous 
              information utilizing a slightly different style of organization. 
              In The Tutorial, Oualline addresses the following topics: Basic 
              Editing; Editing a Little Faster; Searching; Text Blocks and Multiple 
              Files; Windows; Basic Visual Mode; Commands for Programmers; Basic 
              Abbreviations; Keyboard Mapping, and Initialization Files; Basic 
              Command Command-Mode Commands (yes, I typed it correctly); Basic 
              GUI Usage; Dealing with Text Files; Automatic Completion; Autocommands; 
              File Recovery and Command-Line Arguments; Miscellaneous Commands; 
              Cookbook; and Topics Not Covered. 
            <p> The second part illustrates the advanced commands and demonstrates 
              regular expressions, multiple files, and windowing capabilities 
              through: Complete Basic Editing; Advanced Searching Using Regular 
              Expressions; Advanced Text Blocks and Multiple Files; All About 
              Windows and Sessions; Advanced Visual Mode; Advanced Commands for 
              Programmers; All About Abbreviations and Keyboard Mapping; Complete 
              Command-Mode (:) Commands; Advanced GUI Commands; Expressions and 
              Functions; Customizing the Editor; Language-Dependent Syntax Options; 
              and How to Write a Syntax File. The Appendices contain A) Installing 
              Vim, B) The &lt;&gt; Key Names, C) Normal-Mode Commands, D) Command-Mode 
              Commands, E) Visual-Mode Commands, F) Insert-Mode Commands, G) Option 
              List, H) Vim License Agreement, and I) Quick Reference. 
            <p> The <i>Vi IMproved-Vim</i> book is virtually an encyclopedia for 
              text editing, formatting, and synchronizing files. Vim can autoformat 
              and interface with Perl, Python, Sniff+, and Tcl. The good news 
              is that it can perform many advanced tasks; the better news is that 
              it can also just insert, delete, change, and save your work. The 
              Quick Reference Guide at the back of the book categorizes the commands 
              and their functions quite neatly. Oualline first explains how to 
              use the basic commands and then describes all of the bells and whistles 
              that you can use. This is a superb book that demonstrates how to 
              access all of the features of Vim, details its improvements over 
              the vanilla <b>vi</b> editor, and also shows how to use the basic 
              commands. This is an outstanding book on Vim for every level of 
              computer user.

            <p> Researching a new topic or aspect can suddenly become confusing 
              if it leads to an article with unfamiliar terms and acronyms. Terms 
              that look familiar often mean something else, which leads to even 
              more confusion. I found Cisco's <i>Dictionary of Internetworking 
              Terms and Acronyms</i> by accident. The book was luckily on the 
              wrong shelf, and I decided to look through it although I needed 
              something more general than a Cisco-specific dictionary. This is 
              actually a general reference with an added section on Cisco terms 
              following the rest of the entries. The definitions are precise without 
              being either terse or verbose, are completely current (at the moment), 
              and easily referenced. The definitions are clearly written and the 
              acronyms are sensibly crossed referenced. I recommend this as a 
              complement to any networking or internetworking book.
