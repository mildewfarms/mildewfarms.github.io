            <p><b> CaminoSoft's Releases T-Rex Data Management Appliance 
              </b>
            <p> CaminoSoft Corp. announced the release of its data management 
              appliance, T-Rex. According to the company, T-Rex offers unlimited 
              transparent virtual storage that stores files in a high-speed, high-capacity 
              RAID-5 fast cache array that is scalable to 12 TB. 
            <p> When combined with its various platform-specific Server Migration 
              Agents, such as Novell NetWare and Microsoft NT/Windows 2000, T-Rex 
              can provide a repository for seldom-used data files. The CaminoSoft 
              Data Migration Server element monitors the status of the cache. 
              When a pre-determined watermark is reached, files are transparently 
              and automatically migrated to the T-Rex's integrated, mirrored 
              set of removable storage media. Migrated file location data is retained 
              in T-Rex's file system, enabling identification and retrieval 
              of files from removed media. 
            <p> According to the company, T-Rex offers: 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Cross-platform support -- It allows servers from one platform 
                to migrate files that can later be retrieved by servers running 
                under different platforms. 
              <li> Shortened backup window -- It enables routine, scheduled 
                backup processes to concentrate on the "working set" 
                of data. 
              <li> Data consolidation -- It accumulates seldom-used files 
                in one place. 
              <li> Automated data management -- It keeps available storage 
                capacity at a maximum level with little or no administrative effort. 
              <li> Fault tolerant and disaster security -- T-Rex employs RAID 
                5 and mirroring technologies for fault tolerance and to enable 
                disaster recovery. 
              <li> Capacity on demand -- The RAID 5 fast cache file system 
                scales from 500 GB to 12 TB, thus providing virtual storage capacity 
                through transparent migration of seldom-used files to removable 
                storage media. 
              <li> Enterprise compatibility and SAN friendly -- T-Rex supports 
                Windows NT/2000, Novell NetWare 4/5, Linux/UNIX and Solaris, Server 
                Migration Agents and/or direct-attach clients from Win 9x, Mac, 
                DOS, and UNIX Platforms. 
            </ul>

            <p><i> </i><b>XINIT Releases Next-Generation 1U Servers</b> 
            <p> XINIT Systems announced the availability of next-generation 1U 
              rackmount GNU/Linux servers. According to the company, the WebLoad 
              1125 is a 1U rackmount dual-processor capable server. The 1125 has 
              support for up to 4 GB of ECC synchronous DRAM, as well as built-in 
              RAID capability. The distinctive feature of the 1125's embedded 
              RAID controller is that it is ATA-based. The 1125 supports RAID-0 
              for maximum I/O performance or RAID-1 for maximum data reliability. 
            <p> The WebLoad 1170, another new 1U server from XINIT Systems, provides 
              support for dual Intel Pentium III processors at up to 1.0 GHz, 
              up to 4 GB of high-performance PC133 ECC DRAM, and up to three hot-swappable 
              SCSI hard disks. Dual embedded network interfaces provide system 
              connectivity for the 1170. The 1170 also has integrated CD-ROM and 
              floppy devices in addition to the three hard drive bays. 
            <p> The 1125 and 1170 are available with either SuSE Linux 7.1 or 
              Red Hat Linux 7.1. For more information, contact: <i>XINIT Systems,

            <p><i> </i><b>Imperial Technology Announces Remote Monitoring Feature</b> 
            <p> Imperial Technology, a manufacturer of solid state disk and intelligent 
              cache systems, released Remote Access Monitor, a module that enables 
              remote administration and 24x7 monitoring of its MegaRam accelerators. 
              According to the company, Remote Access Monitor enhances system 
              management capabilities by using SNMP functionality to communicate 
              with standard enterprise system management packages. 
            <p> Remote Access Monitor supports industry standard SNMP V1 and V2C, 
              thus facilitating compatibility with network management suites, 
              such as HP OpenView, Tivoli, and CA-Unicenter. Remote Access Monitor 
              delivers early indications of system irregularities using SNMP traps 
              and Management Information Bases. In the event that a MegaRam metric 
              strays from predefined tolerances, the Remote Access Monitor issues 
              a notification to the network management console, enabling notification 
              and appropriate action. Conditions that are monitored include the 
              status of the redundant power supplies and batteries, fans, backup 
              disk, temperature, memory, controller boards, and interface ports. 
            <p> According to the company, Imperial's MegaRam storage accelerators 
              are designed to deliver fast I/O rates. The devices improve conventional 
              storage environments by eliminating the mechanical constraints of 
              reading and writing to rotating disks. Adding a MegaRam accelerator 
              to store the "hot" files, such as indexes and logs, can 
              increase server performance 200-400%. 
            <p> For SAN and switched-fabric environments, the latest MegaRam models 
              offer a native Fibre Channel architecture and multiple FC ports 
              for totally independent and redundant data paths. MegaRam accelerators 
              can also be partitioned into multiple logical unit numbers (LUNs) 
              to take advantage of SAN-based storage virtualization.

            <p><i> </i><b>Softnet Security Releases SafeIT 2001</b> 
            <p> Softnet Security, a supplier of encryption tools, announced the 
              release of the latest version of its email encryption software -- 
              SafeIT E-Mail Encryption 2001. Softnet Security is now offering 
              the download of SafeIT for free. 
            <p> According to the company, SafeIT offers improved functions including 
              support for multiple algorithms, such as BlowFish, TwoFish, and 
              the proprietary SafeIT algorithm. The new Advanced Encryption Standard 
              (AES) "Rijndael" is also supported allowing the user to 
              select algorithm for each secure contact. SafeIT E-Mail Encryption 
              2001 uses the Diffie-Hellman PKI algorithm at 2048 bits for key 
              exchange. During communication, SafeIT employs symmetric key lengths 
              of between 256 to 480 bits, depending on the selected algorithm. 
              Improved support for multiple accounts is included in the latest 
              version of SafeIT E-Mail Encryption 2001. 
            <p> SafeIT E-Mail Encryption 2001 works in the background together 
              with all common email programs and is designed to allow users to 
              download, install, and use SafeIT without any prior knowledge. 
            <p> SafeIT E-Mail Encryption is distributed as freeware but comes 
              with one restriction -- without upgrading, a user can only establish 
              secure contacts with ten other people. If the user wants to upgrade, 
              the cost is $24.95 for unlimited secure contacts and support.
