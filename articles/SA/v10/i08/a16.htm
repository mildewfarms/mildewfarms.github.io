            <H1>Firewall Reporter</h1>
            <p> Alex Le Fevre
            <p> Regardless of whether you're a professional firewall administrator 
              watching over a network of machines or simply a home enthusiast 
              who's concerned about security, your best bet in making sure 
              that your firewall is working is looking at the log files it generates. 
              These often detailed records contain all the pieces necessary to 
              tell whether there are intruders attempting to break into your system. 
              These records can also let you know if you've put in rules 
              that are causing unnecessary network blockage, or if something else 
              is wrong with your network's operation.
            <p> The problem is that these logs are often much too detailed. Red 
              flags get buried under piles of successful operations meaning that 
              you could miss the solution to a potential problem. Further compounding 
              the problem is the dearth of software available to analyze and report 
              back on these log files.
            <p> I was alerted to this problem several months ago by a co-worker, 
              George Johnson, who was complaining to me one day that his management 
              wanted reports on firewall activity and that he had no way to give 
              them such reports without creating reporting software himself. As 
              an aspiring programmer looking to expand my C/C++ skills, I told 
              him I'd take a stab at writing such a reporting program; he 
              provided me with some sample log files from CheckPoint Software's 
              FW-1 package and gave me an idea of what might be required. I wrote 
              the program this article describes, Fwreport. See Listing 1.
            <p> My aim in creating this program was to make a tool that would 
              allow network administrators running FW-1 not only to generate reports 
              on demand, but also provide them with automatic notification of 
              potential problems on their network. (Currently, Fwreport only supports 
              FW-1; administrators interested in using it for other packages are 
              encouraged to send me sample log files so that I can expand its 
              capabilities.) I intended to make the software very easy to use, 
              but at the same time fairly customizable, particularly for those 
              with some C/C++ programming experience who don't mind popping 
              the hood and making more complex tweaks.
            <p> <b>Program Features</b>
            <p> The first order of business for Fwreport was ensuring that it 
              could report back on both regular log files and archived files (which 
              have drastically different formats) without any user intervention. 
              Thus, I included an initial check to see which kind of file the 
              program is dealing with; it then acts appropriately depending upon 
              which type of file it sees.
            <p> By default, Fwreport provides a very simple yet fairly useful 
              report. It shows the number of packets that were accepted, dropped, 
              rejected, or encrypted, along with the percentage of time the firewall 
              spent performing each type of action, accurate to five decimal places 
              (as smooth-running firewalls should spend only miniscule amounts 
              of time rejecting or dropping packets). It also gives the total 
              number of actions taken by the firewall.
            <p> This information is sent out to the file <b>report.txt</b>, which 
              is generated in the directory from which Fwreport was run. See Table 
              1 for its format.
            <p> This report is useful in several ways. The total number of actions 
              performed lets you gauge just how busy your firewall box is, which 
              gives you a good idea of what's going on within your network. 
              Figures that are too high indicate that you might want to consider 
              upgrading your firewall machine (and possibly look into what exactly 
              your employees are doing on the network), and figures that are too 
              low indicate that there is possible network blockage somewhere, 
              as the normal number of packets are not getting through to your 
              firewall.
            <p> Watching the number of dropped and rejected actions provides insight 
              into both intrusion detection and the functionality of your firewall. 
              If either of these numbers suddenly jump, either someone is trying 
              to break into your network (unsuccessfully, of course, meaning that 
              the firewall is doing its job properly), or that the new rule set 
              is written incorrectly (and if you don't do something about 
              it soon, you're going to get a lot of irritated tech-support 
              calls).
            <p> The number of encrypted actions helps analyze how hard a particular 
              application or group of users is working. Chances are good that 
              you've got only a few bits of your network traffic encrypted. 
              For example, your accounting department will likely encrypt communications 
              with banks and if you see a sudden spike here, you know that abnormal 
              activity is occurring. This can be useful for detecting intruders 
              who have gained system access and are trying to cover their tracks, 
              or for determining whether a new software package is being a resource 
              hog.
            <p> Of course, further detail would be required to help you get to 
              the bottom of any of these sorts of problems; Fwreport provides 
              such detail, both by default and on demand. The next file you may 
              want to look at is <b>encrypt.txt</b>, also created by default in 
              Fwreport's working directory. It contains a list of all encryption 
              failures on the network, along with the reference number of the 
              action that failed, which allows you to go back to your log files 
              and look more closely at such failures if you are so inclined. (Note 
              that in archived log files, FW-1 generates this reference number; 
              Fwreport simply uses the included number. For regular log files, 
              Fwreport creates a reference number that corresponds to the line 
              number of the file.)
            <p> Careful analysis of <b>IPPairs.txt</b> (which is generated by 
              adding "<b>u</b>" to Fwreport's command line) can 
              help you discover possible intruders. This file simply contains 
              a list of all unique pairs of IP addresses that connected through 
              your firewall. Any addresses that are outside the range of your 
              network, or that you would expect your users to be connecting to, 
              can be identified.
            <p> Users should note, however, that if they are managing a large 
              network, adding this option can add a considerable amount of time 
              to Fwreport's processing. Generating this log file with my 
              sample data added several hours to processing time. Thus, it is 
              best to only generate this file on a periodic or as-needed basis. 
              (My primary concern for Fwreport 2.0 is cutting this time significantly.)
            <p> Beyond that, you have to specify a small amount of information 
              for Fwreport to provide you with relevant log files. If you are 
              worried about dropped or rejected packets on your network, you simply 
              add a command-line argument specifying a threshold (in percent of 
              network actions) over which you wish to see more detail. For example, 
              if you wanted to examine your network more closely when 2% of actions 
              are rejects, you would run the program as <b>fwreport logfile r 
              2</b>. This would, whenever rejects account for more than 2% of 
              your firewall traffic, create <b>reject.txt</b>, which has a format 
              similar to <b>encrypt.txt</b>. It would also notify you via email 
              that the threshold you specified had been crossed. See Listing 2.
            <p> Further reporting features can be added fairly easily. For example, 
              since the program analyzes every IP address entered in your log, 
              a function could be written to trap all activity by a particular 
              user or group of users by writing to a report file every time their 
              IP address appears. Additionally, Fwreport does nothing with the 
              type of packet being transmitted (HTTP, SMTP, etc.); it would be 
              a simple matter to duplicate, for example, the <b>encryptFail()</b> 
              function to report on all of a particular kind of traffic, or to 
              calculate the amount of time the firewall spends processing these 
              types of packets.
            <p> <b>Sample Usage</b>
            <p> Using Fwreport is a very simple task. (See the sidebar for installation 
              instructions.) After compiling the source code and specifying an 
              email address at which you wish to be notified of crossed thresholds 
              (in the companion Perl script that does the mailing), simply run 
              the program as follows:
            <p> 
            <pre>
fwreport /path/to/logfile/filename r .5 d .5 u
</pre>
            This will create <b>report.txt</b>, <b>encrypt.txt</b>, and <b>IPPairs.txt</b> 
            in Fwreport's running directory. The program will create <b>reject.txt</b> 
            and <b>drop.txt</b> if more than 0.5% of firewall actions are rejects 
            and/or drops, and notify you via email if either of the last two conditions 
            are met.
            <p> While it's easy enough to run Fwreport manually from the 
              command line, it's a much better idea to make a <b>cron</b> 
              job out of it. That way, you can have daily log files that you look 
              at each morning; forget about it entirely until a problem occurs, 
              at which point you'll automatically be notified; or have weekly 
              or monthly reports ready for management without any effort.
            <p> Since it's written in C/C++, Fwreport is fairly fast; on 
              my OpenBSD 2.8 system, which runs on an AMD 750-MHz i386 box, it 
              can parse a 112-MB log in less than 30 seconds. However, it is very 
              CPU-intensive, and can take much longer on older systems (the aforementioned 
              George Johnson ran it against the same log file on a P-160 with 
              OBSD 2.6, and it took about 15 minutes). I suggest that, before 
              you attempt to install it as a <b>cron</b> job, you run it manually 
              on a few files of varying sizes and get an idea of how long it takes 
              to run on your system. You could then set it to run at 2:47 a.m. 
              or some other ridiculous time when you know nothing else important 
              will be going on.
            <p> To ensure that you are catching all possible intrusion attempts, 
              vigilantly monitor <b>encrypt.txt</b> and set the reject threshold 
              very low (under 1%, in most cases) so that all suspicious activity 
              comes to light. Additionally, check my Web site:
            <p> 
            <pre>

</pre>
            for Fwreport 2.0; I intend to add more detailed reporting features, 
            as well as reports that cover broader periods of time. Both of these 
            will help provide a clearer picture of what is going on with your 
            firewall. The better you know your system, the less likely you are 
            to have problems with it.
            <p> <b>Thanks</b>
            <p> I'd like to thank George Johnson, who gave me the idea of 
              submitting this program to <i>Sys Admin</i> as well as guidance 
              on what it should do, and my father, Ken Le Fevre, who spent countless 
              hours helping me through the coding process.
