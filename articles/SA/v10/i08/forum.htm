            As you can see, intrusion detection is the theme for the August issue. 
            In this issue, we offer a variety of security-related articles on 
            topics such as integrating Tripwire into Big Brother, implementing 
            a password strength-checking module, a handy checklist for determining 
            whether your system has been cracked, and setting up an IDS with open 
            source tools. In the Web-exclusive articles this month, Chris Kuethe 
            covers basic IDS setup considerations, and Ido Dubrawsky surveys some 
            commonly used tools. 
            <p> The topic of intrusion detection has become so broad in the past 
              few years, however, that we've only touched the surface with 
              the articles in this and other security-focused issues of <i>Sys 
              Admin</i>. If you find yourself needing to learn more about intrusion 
              detection, there are many resources to help you. Online, I recommend 
              checking out the SANS Institute (<b>http://www.sans.org</b>). In 
              addition to their Intrusion Detection FAQ, SANS offers some excellent 
              practical articles in their security reading room, such as "Evading 
              Passive Sniffer Detection with IDS Sensors" by Bryan S. Brandt 
              and "DRAGON - An Intrusion Detection System" by Joni Ramos. 
              Other online resources include: the Network Intrusion Detection 
              Systems FAQ by Robert Graham at:
            <p> <b>http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/network-intrusion-detection.html</b>
            <p> and the Intrusion Detection Primer by Benjamin D. Thomas at:
            <p> <b>http://www.linuxsecurity.com/feature_stories/feature_story-8.html</b>
            <p> Stokely Consulting's Unix System Administrator Resources 
              also has a page of various security links at:
            <p> <b>http://www.stokely.com/unix.sysadm.resources/security.html</b>
            <p> If you prefer books to online resources, here are a few you might 
              want to consider purchasing:
            <p> <i>Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security</i> by Simson Garfinkel 
              and Gene Spafford (O'Reilly &amp; Associates; ISBN: 1565921488).
            <p> <i>Network Intrusion Detection: An Analyst's Handbook</i> 
              by Stephen Northcutt, Donald McLachlan, Judy Novak (New Riders Publishing; 
              ISBN: 0735710082).
            <p> <i>Secrets &amp; Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World</i> 
              by Bruce Schneier (John Wiley &amp; Sons; ISBN: 0471253111).
            <p> I've seen the following quote from Schneier's book reprinted 
              elsewhere, but I think it's worth sharing again. Schneier writes: 
              "We're still stuck with an insecure Internet and insecure 
              password-protected systems. But by the same token, we're still 
              stuck with insecure door locks, assailable financial systems, and 
              an imperfect legal system. None of this has caused the downfall 
              of civilization yet, and it is unlikely to. And neither will our 
              digital security systems, if we refocus on the processes instead 
              of the technologies."
            <p> I hope readers will continue to submit articles to <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              that will benefit us all as we strive to improve our security processes.
