            <p> The Internet has become a convenient and trusted tool for many 
              users. It can (and often does), however, give the user a false sense 
              of security. An intruder looks for weaknesses or a lax procedure 
              in order to gain access to the system. Different types of intrusion 
              demand individual types of responses and defenses to maintain a 
              system's integrity. In <i>Counter Hack: A Step-by-Step Guide to 
              Computer Attacks and Effective Defenses</i>, author Ed Skondis examines 
              the various types of intruder, known vulnerabilities in the most 
              popular operating systems, and defenses that administrators can 
              employ to protect their systems. He also analyzes the process of 
              hacking and presents scenarios that demonstrate hacking or intrusion 
              as it could occur. 
            <p> He specifically illustrates these processes through: the Introduction; 
              Networking Overview: Pretty Much Everything You Need to Know about 
              TCP/IP to Follow the Rest of This Book in 55 Pages or Less, UNIX 
              Overview: Pretty Much Everything You Need to Know about UNIX to 
              Follow the Rest of This Book in 30 Pages or Less; Windows NT/2000 
              Overview: Pretty Much Everything You Need to Know about Windows 
              to Follow the Rest of This Book in 40 Pages or Less; Phase 1: Reconnaissance; 
              Phase 2: Scanning; Phase 3: Gaining Access Using Application and 
              Operating System Attacks; Phase 3: Gaining Access Using Network 
              Attacks; Phase 3: Denial-of-Service Attacks; Phase 4: Maintaining 
              Access: Trojans, Backdoors, and RootKits...Oh My!; Phase 5: Covering 
              Tracks and Hiding; Putting It All Together: Anatomy of an Attack; 
              The Future; Resources; and Conclusions.
            <p> Skoudis has created an extraordinary book in several ways: he 
              demonstrates the vulnerabilities of system design and implementation, 
              illustrates the processes a hacker utilizes to gain access to a 
              system, presents scenarios of intrusions, and offers defensive measures 
              to ward off would-be invasions. His writing style is excellent, 
              refreshing, and often humorous. <i>Counter Hack: A Step-by-Step 
              Guide to Computer Attacks and Effective Defenses</i> is essential 
              reading for every systems and network administrator.

            <p> The advantages of understanding the mechanics of computer systems 
              and their individual components provide numerous opportunities. 
              Whether you build an entire system, add a new peripheral, replace 
              an existing component, or maintain a system's integrity, the principles 
              remain the same. It is necessary, however, to be able to evaluate 
              new developments, hardware, and prevalent trends as they occur. 
              The thirteenth edition of <i>Scott Mueller's Upgrading And Repairing 
              PCs</i> presents extensive coverage and thorough explanations of 
              both new and legacy hardware, including processors, chipsets, DVD 
              drives, and memory choices. 
            <p> Mueller addresses various hardware considerations in the following 
              order: Personal Computer Background; PC Components, Features, and 
              System Design; Microprocessor Types and Specifications; Motherboards 
              and Buses; BIOS; Memory; The IDE Interface; The SCSI Interface; 
              Magnetic Storage Principles; Hard Disk Storage; Floppy Disk Storage; 
              High-Capacity Removable Storage; Optical Storage; Physical Drive 
              Installation and Configuration; Video Hardware; Audio Hardware; 
              I/O Interfaces from Serial and Parallel to IEEE-1394 and USB; Input 
              Devices: Internet Connectivity; Local Area Networking; Power Supply 
              and Chassis/Case; Portable PCs; Building or Upgrading Systems; PC 
              Diagnostics, Testing, and Maintenance; and File Systems and Data 
              Recovery. The Appendices contain A) Glossary, B) Key Vendor Contact 
              Information, and C) Troubleshooting Index succeeded by a List of 
              Acronyms. The accompanying CD-ROM includes a 90-minute video/tutorial 
              by the author, technical documentation reference section, a vendor 
              database, and four previous editions of the book in PDF format.
            <p> This is also a superb reference. This 13th edition describes how 
              to build a PC as well as upgrade it, demonstrates making your own 
              networking cables, provides expanded troubleshooting coverage plus 
              a troubleshooting procedure index, and case/chassis requirements 
              for the new Pentium 4. Mueller also discusses the different processors, 
              complete with illustrations, form factors, power requirements, and 
              the capabilities of the various chipsets. The inclusion of previous 
              editions on the CD-ROM increases the book's value and portability. 
              <i>Scott Mueller's Upgrading and Repairing PCs</i>, 13th Edition, 
              is an excellent resource for any and every hardware technician (and 
              the rest of us, too!)

            <p> The concerns surrounding the implementations and the fundamental 
              design and implementations of security practices have evolved into 
              a series of questions. Whether you are a systems administrator, 
              an IT consultant, or a user, the issues of secure transmission and 
              confidential data are essential considerations. In <i>White-Hat 
              Security Arsenal</i>, Rubin examines the risks threatening computer 
              systems, some past viruses and worms, the most common dangers to 
              a system, and some solutions.
            <p> He addresses the topics through five separate areas: Is There 
              Really a Threat?, Storing Data Securely, Secure Data Transfer, Protecting 
              Against Network Threats, and Commerce and Privacy. In the first 
              part, the author looks at the risks and some recent security trespassers 
              through: Shrouded in Secrecy, Computer Security Risks, and The Morris 
              Worm Meets the Love Bug: Computer Viruses and Worms. In the viruses 
              and worm chapter, he analyzes the Morris Worm, Melissa, CIH Chernobyl, 
              Happy 99, Worm.ExploreZip (also known as W32ExploreZip), Bubbleboy, 
              Babylonia, and The Love Bug, and utilizes a parallel structure to 
              compare them. Rubin discusses the impact of each virus or worm in 
              the following contexts: When It Hit and What It Did, How and Why 
              It Worked, The Consequences, How We Recovered, and Lessons Learned. 
              In the second major section, Storing Data Securely, the author describes 
              Local Storage (including a favorite product, PGPDisk), Remote Storage, 
              and Secure Backup.
            <p> The following part, Secure Data Transfer, features Setting Up 
              a Long-Term Association, Deriving Session Keys, and Communicating 
              Securely After Key Setup. Part IV, Protecting Against Network Threats, 
              demonstrates protecting a network perimeter, including firewalls 
              and remote access capabilities and defending against attacks. The 
              concluding section focuses on commerce and privacy and scrutinizes 
              protecting e-commerce and privacy. This section contains information 
              about the SSL Protocol, using credit cards, the pros and cons of 
              using Passport, protecting your email and posting anonymously, among 
              other topics. Rubin also provides a glossary and an extensive bibliography. 
              The topic of each chapter is identified with one or more icons to 
              show its intended audience. The four icons are: system administrator, 
              the academic, the IT professional, and the surfer/end user. The 
              beginning of most of the chapters start with a scenario comprised 
              of a problem statement (what the administrator is trying to accomplish) 
              and the threat model (what the dangers are within the scenario). 
              Our familiar cryptographic couple, Alice and Bob, illustrate each 
              example.
            <p> In <i>White-Hat Security Arsenal: Tackling the Threats</i>, author 
              Aviel Rubin addresses the most important problems and questions 
              concerning security, privacy, and invasion regarding computer systems 
              and data integrity. He presents the issues and possible solutions 
              in a very readable format, utilizing numerous case studies in the 
              process. His valuable and productive portrayals detail how to become 
              more proficient in establishing a secure environment. Rubin's superior 
              explanations make this an essential book to read, whether to overcome 
              a specific and immediate obstacle or to generate a security policy. 
              <i>White-Hat Arsenal: Tackling the Threats</i> provides an exceptional 
              reference for anyone involved with system security, protection, 
              and defense.
