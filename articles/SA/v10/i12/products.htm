            <p><b> Stem Systems Releases Perl Networking Toolkit</b>
            <p> Stem Systems released Stem, a network application suite and development 
              toolkit. According to the company, network management is enhanced 
              by Stem's collection of high-level modules that provide common network 
              services and resources. You can create applications by connecting 
              Stem modules together in a configuration, with little or no programming 
              required.
            <p> Stem includes support for clients/servers, network communication, 
              log file management, process management, multiplexing I/O, message 
              passing, and remote or local runtime configuration. Stem comes with 
              several example applications, including an <b>inetd</b> emulator 
              created by a configuration of standard modules, which requires no 
              extra coding.
            <p> Stem is written in pure Perl and is Open Source and free to download 
              and use. Go to <b>http://stemsystems.com</b> for documentation and

            <p> Automatos Inc. announced the launch of the Automatos Virtual Systems 
              Engineer (AVSE) product suite. According to the company, the AVSE 
              product suite is a set of automated management services that allow 
              the user to identify operating systems and application-related performance 
              problems. To achieve this automation, the services combine Automatos's 
              tools for performance analysis, capacity planning, real time monitoring, 
              asset inventory/management, Oracle monitoring, and SQL Server monitoring. 
              Users can connect to the AVSE portal via the Internet, download 
              the specific agents, and access the services needed to manage their 
              server problems.
            <p> The AVSE operates by analyzing internal resources of different 
              operating systems and applications. The agent will collect data 
              (e.g., CPU consumption, memory usage, memory locks, procedure cache, 
              connection counters, cache hit rates, and logs) and will send it 
              securely to the AVSE backend. The information is then compiled and 
              generated in the form of a report in pdf format.

            <p> The AVSE product suite is compatible with servers running Windows 
              NT/2000, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, Oracle and SQL Server environments.

            <p> <b>SoftIntegration Launches Ch 2.0</b>
            <p> SoftIntegration has launched Ch 2.0. According to the company, 
              Ch is a C virtual machine with classes that avoids compile/link/execute/debug 
              cycles for application development. It supports C90, POSIX, and 
              socket/WinSock with more than 1,000 functions. Programs using complex 
              type defined in C99 and complex classes in C++ can run in Ch without 
              any modification.
            <p> Ch has many high-level extensions to C, including classes in C++, 
              very high-level shell programming, cross-platform Ch applets, generic 
              functions, string type, computational arrays for linear algebra 
              and matrix computations, user-friendly 2D/3D graphic plotting, classes 
              for Common Gateway Interface (CGI), and advanced high-level numerical 
              functions.
            <p> Ch is an alternative to other scripting languages and mathematical 
              software packages for cross-platform shell programming, systems 
              administration, regression test, real-time interactive computing, 
              rapid prototyping, scientific numerical computing, and Web development. 
              Program ch can also be used as a login shell.
            <p> According to SoftIntegration, Ch bridges the gap between the C 
              language and UNIX shell and is designed for both interactive command 
              interpretation and shell programming. Ch is a portable shell with 
              consistent interface in Windows, Linux, and UNIX. When Ch is used 
              in a single command mode, most features of Ch are the same as conventional 
              UNIX shells and MS-DOS shell in Windows. Shell programs written 
              in the common set of programming features of C and Ch can be readily 
              compiled to the native machine code for efficient execution.
            <p> Ch for Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000, Linux, Solaris, and HP-UX, is 
              available. For more information, contact: <i>SoftIntegration, Inc.,
