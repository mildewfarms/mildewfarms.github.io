            <H1>Kerberos
              <p> 
            </h1>
            Kerberos is a third-party authentication protocol that acts as an 
            arbitrator. This protocol allows for users to authenticate and securely 
            access services on the network. Kerberos tries to eliminate the dangers 
            of sending clear-text passwords over the network. It also provides 
            a mechanism for a client to verify that it really is the client and 
            not some imposter.
            <p> The first step is for the client to send its principle to the 
              Kerberos authentication server (a.k.a. KDC). The principle is a 
              user or service that is able to authenticate using Kerberos. For 
              a user, the principle is the login ID and the name of the TGS (Ticket 
              Granting Server). The KDC makes sure the user is in the database 
              and generates a session key to be used between the client and the 
              TGS. This session key is also called the TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket). 
              The TGT is encrypted by the KDC with the user's secret key (the 
              user's password) and sent back to the client from which the user 
              requested the TGT. The TGT cannot be decrypted without the user's 
              password because the password is the secret key.
            <p> If the client wants access to a network service, the client must 
              have the TGT to obtain a ticket from the TGS. If the user does not 
              authenticate successfully with the process described previously, 
              then he or she cannot gain access to network services that require 
              Kerberos authentication. If the user has obtained the TGT, then 
              it can be used to obtain a ticket from the TGS. This ticket that 
              the client receives from the TGS is then used to authenticate the 
              user. Now the user has access to that network service using a secure 
              authentication method.
