            <p> In the quest for a reliable operating system, many companies continue 
              to choose SolarisTM. Recent releases of Solaris books address varying 
              degrees of user and administration experience and also specialize 
              in individual concepts. Some of the latest additions to the existing 
              Solaris repertoire include: <i>Solaris Administration: A Beginner's 
              Guide</i> by Paul Watters (Osborne McGraw-Hill); <i>Solaris System 
              Management</i> by John Philcox (New Riders); <i>Solaris Internals: 
              Core Kernel Architecture</i> by Jim Mauro and Richard McDougall 
              (Sun Microsystems Press, A Prentice Hall Title); and <i>Sun Cluster 
              Environment, Sun Cluster 2.2</i> by Enrique Vargas, Joseph Bianco, 
              and David Deeths (Sun Blueprints, Sun Microsystems Press, A Prentice 
              Hall Title).

              Blueprints Section Included
            <p> The novice Solaris administrator, whether new to systems administration 
              or new to the Solaris system, often needs a logical explanation 
              or a procedure described in a step-by-step manner. In <i>Solaris 
              Administration: A Beginner's Guide</i>, Paul Watters defines 
              Solaris-specific vocabulary, naming conventions, and demonstrates 
              the most common Solaris processes. He divided the book into four 
              major parts: Installation; Single Host Administration; Managing 
              Internet Services; and Managing Intranet Services.
            <p> The initial section, Installation, presents an overview of the 
              Solaris system in the Introduction to Solaris chapter. Watters describes 
              Solaris installation and configuration through: Installing Solaris 
              SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture); Installing Solaris Intel; 
              and Using the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). The second chapter 
              features a superb description of the SPARC design and its accompanying 
              advantages, especially for readers completely unfamiliar with the 
              SPARC platform. The author even provides some comparisons between 
              the SPARC and Intel architectures and performances.
            <p> Single Host Administration, the second section, concentrates on 
              routine use and management within a Solaris environment. Watters 
              examines Shell Usage and Programming; Shell Programming; Managing 
              Users and Groups; Processes and System Resources; and Package Management 
              and Software Installation. In addition to the command-line interface, 
              processes, signals, file ownership properties, and user/group maintenance, 
              this part also details Solaris implementations of system resources, 
              process management, packaging tools, and their counterparts -- 
              archiving utilities. Part III: Managing Internet Services features 
              the techniques and services utilized for Electronic Mail; the Domain 
              Name Service (DNS); The Internet Daemon; Remote Access; Web Services; 
              and Security. The concluding section illustrates the protocols, 
              services, and utilities to share peripherals and files within an 
              organization. The individual chapters address: Samba; the Dynamic 
              Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and its configuration; the Network 
              File System (NFS); the Network Information System (NIS+); and Printing.
            <p> By necessity, any administration book must include explanations 
              of several processes and systems, each of which could easily fill 
              a complete book on its own. Some examples of this are networking, 
              Sendmail, DNS and BIND, TCP/IP, and security. In <i>Solaris Administration: 
              A Beginner's Guide</i>, Watters (who co-authored <i>Solaris: 
              The Complete Reference</i> with Sriranga Veeraraghavan, Osborne 
              McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0-07-212143-2, $49.99) provides a solid foundation 
              in Solaris administration procedures. He also demonstrates the basics 
              of configuring administration tasks and related features and services. 
              The author outlines the new capabilities in Solaris 8 and emphasizes 
              important considerations using Notes and Tips throughout the book. 
              An eight-page Blueprints insert in the middle of the book illustrates 
              a Solaris-Based Network, the Linux vs. Windows NT/2000-Based Network, 
              the Linux vs. Windows NT/2000 Boot Process, and the Solaris Boot 
              Process. <i>Solaris Administration: A Beginner's Guide</i> 
              is an excellent book and explains Solaris administration concepts 
              and procedures through a combination of description and visual representation 
              in an easy-to-read manner. Experienced administrators will appreciate 
              its thorough and practical content; beginners will value its readable 
              and comprehensive approach.

            <p> The role of a systems manager requires both technical and managerial 
              skills. It demands the authority and planning to implement policies 
              coupled with the technical expertise to realize what is needed. 
              As both an experienced systems administrator and a former systems 
              manager, author John Philcox addresses the challenges of effective 
              systems management of a Solaris environment through three sections: 
              The System Manager, Management of the Solaris Environment, and Management 
              of the Solaris Network.
            <p> The first part, The System Manager, defines the responsibilities 
              of a systems manager and some of the job's fundamental concerns 
              with chapters that discuss: Job Description, The IT Budget, Delivering 
              the Goods, and Testing. In the succeeding division, Management of 
              the Solaris Environment, Philcox surveys some of the more technical 
              and simultaneously strategic aspects of systems management. These 
              include: Solaris Installations and Upgrade; Solaris Security; Disaster 
              Recovery and Contingency Management; Strategic Management; Tactical 
              Management; Working with PCs; and Shells and Public Domain Software. 
              These chapters highlight some of the most current trends within 
              the corporate structure from a systems management viewpoint. The 
              author discusses 24x7 operations, presents scenarios of both a new 
              installation and an upgrade, and examines the multiple facets to 
              consider before establishing a disaster recovery policy. The final 
              part analyzes Management of the Solaris Network and reviews the 
              associated issues of Internet Protocol Version 6, Network Monitoring, 
              and Network Management Tools. The appendix, Resources, features 
              Further Reading and Useful Resources on the World Wide Web.
            <p> <i>Solaris System Management</i> describes and identifies an immense 
              amount of information and policy-making techniques. Philcox demonstrates 
              the logical approach to effectively complete systems management 
              responsibilities within a Solaris environment. The general principles 
              he describes can be implemented within any environment; the specific 
              examples he presents are for the Solaris system. The author's 
              technical expertise coupled with his systems management experience 
              make this book excellent. It details the considerations and planning 
              that precedes corporate guidelines and standards while also describing 
              the technical viewpoint. This book provides an enormous amount of 
              information and is a must for anyone involved in policy making.

              A Web-supported updates book
            <p> The wide range of current computer books addresses a variety of 
              individual topics and differing level of computer user. The more 
              specialized your selected field, the fewer books there are, particularly 
              for the more advanced reader. For the computer professionals blessed 
              with a technical curiosity regarding how operating systems really 
              work, Mauro and McDougall have written an excellent book exploring 
              and explaining Solaris internals. They have organized the chapters 
              according to four major topics: Introduction to Solaris Internals; 
              The Solaris Memory System; Threads, Processes, and IPC; and Files 
              and File Systems.
            <p> The authors begin with An Introduction to Solaris and a brief 
              history of the operating system's development. The following 
              chapters explore Kernel Services, Kernel Synchronization Primitives, 
              and Kernel Bootstrap and Initialization. In Part Two, The Solaris 
              Memory System, Mauro and McDougall examine the Solaris Memory Architecture, 
              Kernel Memory, and Memory Monitoring. Some of the concepts discussed 
              in this part include virtual addressing, page scanning, the paging 
              algorithm, the kernel map, the kernel memory slab allocator, and 
              swap space.
            <p> Threads, Processes, and IPC contains The Solaris Multithreaded 
              Process Architecture; The Solaris Kernel Dispatcher; and Interprocess 
              Communication. These chapters address the concepts of Solaris processes; 
              their structure; the Procfs (Process File System); signals; queues; 
              schedulers; IPC (Interprocess communication; shared memory; and 
              semaphores. The concluding section details the Solaris file system 
              through Solaris Files and File I/O; File System Overview; File System 
              Framework; the UNIX File System; and Solaris File System Cache. 
              These chapters detail everything about the Solaris file systems: 
              their structure; Application Programming Interfaces (APIs); system 
              calls; file descriptors; 64-bit files in Solaris; and pathname caching. 
              The Appendices contain A) Kernel Tunables, Switches, and Limits; 
              B) Kernel Virtual Address Maps; and C) A Sample Procfs Utility.
            <p> Solaris Internals provides a lot of information about how operating 
              systems, and Solaris in particular, really function, including the 
              algorithms, data structures, and respective implementations. The 
              beginning history gives the reader a perspective regarding the development 
              of the Solaris system. Mauro and McDougall explain the essential 
              theory of Solaris and furnish the details of different flavors of 
              UNIX, as well as any differences that may exist among hardware platforms. 
              Since the book covers Solaris through System 7, the authors have 
              initiated the <b>http://www.solarisinternals.com</b> Web site to 
              post updates, errata, utilities, and any changes to the kernel in 
              System 8. As of this writing, there haven't been any new modifications 
              or additions to the kernel.
            <p> I really liked this book, because it presented the concepts of 
              an operating system and described how each attribute was utilized 
              according to the operating system and the architecture. Although 
              not a beginner's book, <i>Solaris Internals</i> does provide 
              a lot of basic information for those who know and understand the 
              principles involved, although not the individual platform and architecture 
              combination. Mauro and McDougall present a valuable reference for 
              Solaris systems administrators and developers, which is exceptionally 
              well-written, organized, and supported.

            <p> Two of the most popular concepts and implementations currently 
              available are high availability and clustering. The design of the 
              Sun Cluster 2.2 provides a setting for a highly available system 
              -- a difficult concept to explain. It is often confused with 
              fault-tolerance, but the costs and implementations differ. Vargas, 
              Bianco, and Deeths explore this framework through two parts: Infrastructure 
              and Implementation.
            <p> The authors of <i>Sun Cluster Environment, Sun Cluster 2.2</i> 
              begin the Infrastructure section with a presentation of High Availability 
              with definitions and descriptions of Reliability, Availability, 
              and Serviceability Fundamentals. They then explain the basics of 
              clustering, and the Sun Cluster 2.2 Architecture through Sun Cluster 
              2.2 Architecture and Sun Cluster 2.2 Components. The second section, 
              Implementation, includes Sun Cluster 2.2 Administration, Highly 
              Available Databases, Sun Cluster 2.2 Application Notes, Sun Cluster 
              2.2 Data Services, and Beyond Sun Cluster 2.2. The Appendices contain 
              A) SCSI-Initiator ID and B) SC2.2 Data Service Templates.
            <p> This Blueprints book demonstrates the concepts and implementations 
              required to utilize the Sun Cluster 2.2 technology to complete a 
              highly available clustering environment. This series is written 
              for experienced systems administrators utilizing the Solaris environment 
              and those who wish to increase their knowledge of new technologies. 
              It addresses the concepts, uses, and processes in an effective style 
              and describes currently available products, options, and troubleshooting 
              procedures.
