            I regularly read Amit Asaravala's column in <i>Web Techniques</i> 
            magazine. <i>Web Techniques</i> is one of <i>Sys Admin</i>'s 
            sister publications, and I generally find Amit's editorials to 
            be thought provoking. His editorial in the July 2001 issue, however, 
            struck a particularly sympathetic chord. He wrote:
<p>
            <ul>If you're a regular reader, you may also have noticed that  the magazine is somewhat <br>
             slimmer than it has been in previous months. This cutback is in response to low ad sales. <br>
              Not only is July a particularly slow month for certain types of advertising -- partly because <br>
              many agencies believe people are less apt to read -- but we've also business and technology <br>
              magazines during summer vacation months been affected by the market correction.</ul>
            <p> These words are unfortunately true also for <i>Sys Admin</i>. 
              In his editorial, Amit goes on to describe the bittersweet feeling 
              of winning a Maggie Award (which honors magazine excellence) while 
              facing staff layoffs. Here at <i>Sys Admin</i> we're experiencing 
              similar mixed emotions. On one hand, we're excited and proud 
              that we have amicably acquired and successfully produced an issue 
              of <i>The Perl Journal</i>. On the other hand, ad sales are down 
              to such an extent that we've been forced not only to reduce 
              the number of pages we publish in <i>Sys Admin</i>, but also investigate 
              a smaller trim size and lighter paper stock. These cutbacks are 
              standard ways to save money during crunch times, and we have every 
              hope that they will prove effective. The issues will be smaller 
              for the next few months at least, but we plan to increase the number 
              of pages again as soon as the market allows. Despite the decrease 
              in the number of pages, however, the amount of editorial has not 
              diminished; there are just fewer ads!
            <p> This issue of <i>Sys Admin</i> focuses on Solaris<sup>TM</sup> administration. 
              As I've mentioned before, Solaris is the most widely administered 
              operating system among <i>Sys Admin</i> readers. The Solaris-related 
              articles included here describe the use the Solaris::Kstat module, 
              some performance tuning tips, and implementation of IPSec in Solaris 
              8. The issue also contains an article by Chris Hare discussing password 
              controls, and one by Bruce Gollsneider showing how to set up a triple-boot 
              machine. The Web-exclusive articles for the month cover the Sun 
              Ray model of computing and the implementation of the Totalnet Access 
              Server.
            <p> As always, I welcome your comments and suggestions. You can email 
              me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
