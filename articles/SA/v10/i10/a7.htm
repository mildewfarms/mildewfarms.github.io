              to Solaris<sup>TM</sup> Web Start Flash</h1>
            <p> <i>John S. Howard</i>
            <p> The Solaris 8 Operating Environment (OE) 4/01 release introduced 
              the Solaris Web Start Flash extensions to the JumpStart framework. 
              Web Start Flash extends the JumpStart framework by adding the mechanism 
              to create a Flash archive, a system snapshot of the Solaris OE and 
              all installed software, from a master machine. This archive can 
              then be used to rapidly install client systems; this installation 
              client may be any hardware platform capable of running the Solaris 
              OE, including those hardware platforms typically referred to as 
              "servers".
            <p> This article will explain how to identify the master machine as 
              well as provide recommendations and examples of creating and administering 
              Flash archives. This article assumes the reader has an understanding 
              of basic Solaris OE or UNIX systems administration skills and a 
              basic understanding of JumpStart technology and the Solaris OE installation 
              procedure.
            <p> <b>The JumpStart Framework</b>
            <p> JumpStart technology is Sun Microsystems' mechanism for controlling, 
              performing, and automating network-based installations of the Solaris 
              OE. The JumpStart framework provides a mechanism to help automate 
              and control installation of the Solaris OE. By automating installation 
              of the Solaris OE, the chances for human error or configuration 
              errors during installation may be greatly reduced. This also helps 
              ensure the consistency of system installation and adherence to site-standards 
              throughout your data center, as well as providing documentation 
              as to exactly how the system was installed.
            <p> The Flash facility extends the traditional JumpStart installation 
              framework by adding the mechanism to create a system archive, a 
              snapshot of an installed system, and install the Solaris OE from 
              that archive.
            <p> A traditional JumpStart software installation is performed by 
              using the JumpStart profile to specify individual software packages 
              or software package clusters (a predefined set of software packages) 
              to be installed. The <b>suninstall</b> program, using the <b>pkgadd</b> 
              mechanism, then installs the specified packages sequentially. As 
              the <b>pkgadd</b> mechanism needs to update the installed package 
              database as well as relocate files, this may become a time-consuming 
              operation.
            <p> <b>The Flash Archive</b>
            <p> Flash provides a mechanism by which a specific or reference installation 
              of the Solaris OE is archived. That Flash archive can then be used 
              to install the Solaris OE. The reference installation is created 
              from the on-disk Solaris OE and includes all installed software. 
              This system on which the archive is created is designated as the 
              master machine. The reference installation can be a Solaris OE installed 
              by any means such as a JumpStart software installation, installation 
              from CD, an interactive installation, etc.
            <p> After identifying the master machine, the reference installation 
              is captured in a Flash archive. This archive (a central feature 
              of Flash) is essentially a point-in-time snapshot of the Solaris 
              OE, software patches, and applications on the master machine. The 
              Flash extensions add the ability to install the archive from an 
              NFS server or an HTTP server, in addition to installation from a 
              traditional JumpStart server. The archive also can be accessed from 
              a disk device (including CD-ROM) or tape device, local to the installation 
              client. The Flash archive is transmitted over the network to the 
              installation client and written to the disk. After the archive is 
              written to the installation client's disk, any necessary archive 
              modifications are performed. For example, configuration files such 
              as <b>/etc/nsswitch.conf</b> on the installation client may need 
              to vary from the master machine. The Flash mechanism enables automation 
              of modifications, allowing for differences in kernel architecture 
              or device differences between the master machine and the installation 
              client to be automatically resolved.
            <p> Additionally, Flash allows for partitioning differences between 
              the master machine and the installation client to be resolved automatically. 
              For example, if the Flash archive was created on a system with a 
              single root (/) partition and the installation client has separate 
              <b>/</b> and <b>/var</b> partitions, the Flash archive automatically 
              customizes itself to the installation client. However, the installation 
              client partitioning must be correctly specified in the JumpStart 
              profile.
            <p> It is important to note that, unless explicitly excluded, the 
              Flash archive will contain all software installed on the master 
              machine. For example, if a flash archive is created from a database 
              server, that archive contains all software that was installed on 
              that database server -- including the database server software. 
              This feature makes Flash a powerful tool for deploying complex server 
              configurations. A complex system architecture only needs to be implemented 
              and configured once and then a Flash archive created; all subsequent 
              system installations from that Flash archive will be identical. 
              For systems such as database servers, the Flash archive should be 
              created before the system goes into production. For example, a database 
              server or LDAP server should have its archive created after the 
              database management software has been installed, but before the 
              databases have been created and populated.
            <p> Software that stores configuration information outside of a UNIX 
              filesystem may not be correctly configured on the Flash installed 
              client. For example, logical volume management software such as 
              Veritas Volume Manager (VxVM) or Solstice DiskSuite software store 
              meta-information (such as logical volume layout and RAID configuration 
              information) in raw partitions, outside of a filesystem. Installing 
              a system from a Flash archive created on a master machine that was 
              using VxVM with an encapsulated and mirrored boot disk is not possible. 
              Since the flash archive creation does not (and can not) access the 
              meta-information in the VxVM private regions, any subsequent installation 
              from that Flash archive would be incomplete and unbootable.
            <p> To incorporate such software in a Flash archive, the archive must 
              be created on the master machine after all software has been installed, 
              but before the software has been configured. Again using the example 
              of a master machine with a VxVM encapsulated and mirrored boot disk, 
              the Flash archive should be created after the Solaris OE is installed 
              and VxVM packages have been added and before executing <b>vxinstall</b> 
              to configure the VxVM software. The VxVM configuration of the installation 
              client, including encapsulation and mirroring of the boot disk, 
              can be performed from a finish script after the Flash archive is 
              installed.
            <p> The Flash archive is a snapshot of a system and as such, all specified 
              files on that system are included in the archive. If a Flash archive 
              is created from a system in use, some files need to be cleaned up 
              or zeroed out after the Flash archive is installed. Examples of 
              these types of files include log files, such as those found in <b>/var/adm</b>, 
              and any files in the <b>/var/tmp</b> directory. Log files can be 
              easily zeroed out from a finish script after installation. In the 
              case of temporary directories, such as the <b>/var/tmp</b> directory, 
              it is recommend to exclude those directories when the Flash archive 
              is created.
            <p> It is important to note that an initial installation must be specified 
              when performing a Flash installation. Flash cannot be used to upgrade 
              a system.
            <p> Installation of the Solaris OE via a Flash archive can be dramatically 
              faster than with other mechanisms, depending on factors such as 
              network traffic and disk speeds. This is partly because Flash does 
              not need to individually install each software package and update 
              the installed package database. Since the Flash archive contains 
              the installed packages and an accurate package database, the archive 
              is essentially written to the installation disk as fast as the data 
              can be taken off the network.
            <p> <b>Identifying the Master Machine</b>
            <p> Before performing a Flash installation, a master machine must 
              be identified. The master machine is the system that serves as the 
              template to be copied onto the installation clients. All software 
              and files on the master machine, unless specifically excluded, become 
              a part of the Flash archive and are installed on the client.
            <p> Usually, the master machine is not the JumpStart server. However, 
              the JumpStart server is an ideal system to act as a repository for 
              Flash archives.
            <p> Each system type in your data center should have a corresponding 
              Flash archive created to install additional systems of that type. 
              For example, identify a reference configuration for each class of 
              database server, Web server, backup server, etc., then create Flash 
              archives of those systems to use when the new systems need to be 
              deployed.
            <p> Store Flash archives offsite, on tape or on CD-ROM, to prepare 
              for business continuity in the event of a disaster. You can then 
              use these Flash archives at a remote site or disaster recovery site 
              to rapidly deploy software-identical, but not necessarily hardware-identical, 
              replacement systems.
            <p> <b>Creating and Administering Archives</b>
            <p> The following <b>flarcreate</b> command creates an archive, named 
              <b>S8-web.archive</b>, of a Solaris 8 OE 4/01 production Web server 
              (excluding the <b>/var/tmp</b> directory) with an archive creator 
              string of <b>j.s.howard@Sun.COM</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>
www06# pwd
/var/tmp/FlashArchives
www06#  flarcreate -n "Solaris 8 web server image" \
&gt; -a "j.s.howard@Sun.COM" \
&gt; -R / \
&gt; -x /var/tmp \
&gt; /var/tmp/FlashArchives/S8-web.archive
Determining which filesystems will be included in the archive...
Determining the size of the archive...
The archive will be approximately 446.45MB.
Creating the archive...
Archive creation complete.
</pre>
            The <b>-R</b> option specifies to recursively descend from the specified 
            directory, and the <b>-x</b> option excludes the specified directory. 
            See the <b>flarcreate</b>(1M) man page for details on these and other 
            options.
            <p> Flash archives can be accessed via NFS or HTTP. Additionally, 
              Flash archives can be written to disk, CD, or tape and subsequently 
              accessed from the disk, CD, or tape drive local to the client, during 
              installation.
            <p> Flash archives can be compressed by specifying the <b>-c</b> option 
              to the <b>flarcreate</b> command. Compressed archives are automatically 
              uncompressed after being transferred to the installation client, 
              prior to installation. See the <b>flarcreate</b>(1M) man page for 
              additional details.
            <p> Use the <b>flar</b> command to extract information from a specified 
              archive. For example, to determine how an archive was created:
            <p> 
            <pre>
www06# flar -i S8-web.archive
archive_id=04291958b038020b87b749ee62085654
files_archived_method=cpio
creation_date=20010326223306
creation_master=www06
content_name=Solaris 8 workgroup server image
files_compressed_method=none
files_archived_size=468105216
content_author=j.s.howard@Sun.COM
content_architecture=sun4u
</pre>
            The <b>flar</b> command also provides options to split or combine 
            archives. Consult the <b>flar</b>(1M) man page for additional details 
            on archive usage.
            <p> <b>The JumpStart Profile</b>
            <p> The JumpStart profile in the configuration file is used to specify 
              software configuration information to the installation client as 
              well as the type of installation to be performed. When using Flash, 
              only the following profile keywords are valid:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> <b>install_type</b> 
              <li> <b>partitioning</b> -- Only the keyword values of <b>explicit</b> 
                or <b>existing</b> must be used. 
              <li> <b>filesys</b> -- The keyword value of auto must not be 
                used. 
              <li> <b>fdisk</b> -- This is valid for Intel Architecture only.
            </ul>
            <p> The following example profile specifies that Flash is used as 
              the installation type, <b>flash_install</b>. Additionally, the profile 
              instructs that the Flash archive is accessed via NFS, from the location 
              specified by the <b>archive_location</b> keyword:
            <p> 
            <pre>
install_type    flash_install
archive_location nfs://10.1.1.8/jumpstart/FlashArchives/ \
                     S8-webserver.archive
partitioning    explicit
#
# 4GB / and 1GB swap on a 18GB disk
#
filesys         rootdisk.s0     450:1786        /
filesys         rootdisk.s1     1:449           swap
</pre>
            Since <b>name_service=NONE</b> is specified in the following <b>sysidcfg</b> 
            file, an IP address is used for the <b>archive_location</b> in the 
            profile.
            <p> The rules entry used for this example is:
            <p> 
            <pre>
model SUNW,UltraSPARC-IIi-cEngine \
        - \
        Profiles/S8-webserver-Flash.profile \
        Finish/EE_Lab-Flash.fin
</pre>
            The <b>sysidcfg</b> file used is:
            <p> 
            <pre>
system_locale=en_US
timezone=US/Pacific
network_interface=primary {netmask=255.255.255.0
                           protocol_ipv6=no}
terminal=vt100
security_policy=NONE
root_password=QH311oT1ff8TU
name_service=NONE
timeserver=localhost
</pre>
            A root password is specified in the <b>sysidcfg</b> file. This specification 
            overrides the root password contained in <b>/etc/shadow</b> within 
            the Flash archive.
            <p> After you have created or edited the above files, verify the rules 
              file. Be certain to use the check script from the Solaris 8 OE 4/01 
              CD-ROM and verify the rules file:
            <p> 
            <pre>
server01# cd /jumpstart
server01# ./check
Validating rules...
Validating profile Profiles/S8-webserver-Flash.profile...
The custom JumpStart configuration is ok.
</pre>
            The finish script used for this example is:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#!/bin/sh
# EE_Lab-Flash.fin
# Finish script for default EE_Lab setup, Jumpstart Flash
#
# clean up after flash archive install
#
for i in /a/var/adm/messages* /a/var/adm/utmpx \
         /a/var/adm/wtmpx /a/var/adm/lastlog
do
    cp /dev/null ${i}
done
mkdir /a/var/tmp
chown root:sys /a/var/tmp
chmod 1777 /a/var/tmp
</pre>
            The <b>/var/tmp</b> directory needs to be created by the finish script 
            because it was excluded when the archive was created with the <b>flarcreate</b> 
            command.
            <p> To perform the installation, the OpenBoot Prom (OBP) command is 
              executed on the installation client:
            <p> 
            <pre>
{3} ok boot net - install
</pre>
            Summary
            <p> This article has introduced the Solaris Web Start Flash facility, 
              available with Solaris 8 OE 4/01. A Flash overview, the concepts 
              of a Flash archive, and a master machine were presented. The use 
              of Flash archives for business continuity was also recommended.
            <p> This article also presented the use of the <b>flarcreate</b> command 
              to create Flash archives and the <b>flar</b> command to administer 
              Flash archives. Additionally, the changes to the JumpStart profile 
              necessary to support Flash installations were presented. Those changes 
              include the ability to use NFS, HTTP, or devices local to the installation 
              client as locations of the Flash archive during installation. Finally, 
              an example of creating a Flash archive and finish script for a Web 
              server was detailed.
