            <p> Westinghouse Electric Company recently released StatePointPlus, 
              a systems integrity controller that diagnoses changes and enforces 
              standards in NT and UNIX environments. According to the company, 
              StatePointPlus characterizes products and system conditions across 
              the desktops and servers on a network simultaneously. It then interprets 
              the functional consequences of system problems for the administrator, 
              often before those consequences occur. The administrator can use 
              a console interface to remotely fix the problem, or set StatePointPlus 
              to act automatically. With StatePointPlus, the administrator can 
              implement strategies that strengthen configuration control, streamline 
              operations, and tighten security.

            <p><i> </i><b>UVNetworks Introduces WebBox 1000</b>
            <p> UVNetworks, a provider of Sun technology-based server appliances, 
              announced its WebBox 1000, a high-performance version of its original 
              Web-hosting server appliance that is based on Sun Microsystems' 
              64-bit architecture and Sun Solaris operating system.
            <p> According to the company, the WebBox 1000 features a 500-megahertz 
              Sun UltraSPARC RISC 64-bit processor for high-speed processing and 
              up to 75 GB in hard disk storage. Manufacturer's suggested 
              retail price for the base WebBox 1000 (256-Mb memory; one 30-Gb 
              removable disk drive) is $3495.
            <p> In addition to incorporating the Sun UltraSPARC RISC 64-bit processor, 
              the WebBox products utilize the 64-bit Solaris 8 operating system. 
              The Internet server appliances are also compatible with other network 
              computing devices, including 32-bit, Intel-based PCs and servers 
              running Linux or Windows NT operating systems. The management software 
              is pre-installed, and the software interface is designed to provide 
              administration through remote management.
            <p> WebBox products are housed in a 1U rack-mountable casing (1U is 
              equal to 1.75-inches high) with front removable hard drives and

            <p><i> </i><b>Proxima Announces alarmmanage</b>
            <p> Proxima Technology Inc. announced their alarmmanage alert notification 
              solution. According to the company, alarmmanage provides an open, 
              fail-safe alert notification solution. With alarmmanage, systems 
              administrators and operations staff are notified of problems by 
              pager, email, or Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) enabled wireless 
              devices.
            <p> alarmmanage collects event messages from a variety of system management 
              products (including PATROL and WMI), filters them and sends alerts 
              for critical situations. Once an alert has been posted, any subsequent 
              events associated with that problem are suppressed so systems administrators 
              are not repetitively alerted to the same problems. alarmmanage takes 
              into account work rosters, vacations, and other information so that 
              the right admin is notified. alarmmanage allows the admin to define 
              meaningful, organization-specific error messages and associate these 
              with critical event types. alarmmanage is typically installed on 
              a central server and it then establishes a connection directly to 
              each management agent at the point an event occurs or other information 
              is required.
            <p> A 30-day trial of alarmmanage can be downloaded from <b>http://www.proxima-tech.com</b>. 
              Prices range from $75 for alert notification from a desktop server, 
              to $2,500 for an enterprise server. Users of BMC Software PATROL 
              Alarm Manager can upgrade to alarmmanage free of charge. For more 
              information, contact: <i>Proxima Technology Inc., 1350 17th Street, 
              Suite 200, Denver, CO 80202; WWW: http://www.proxima-tech.com.</i>
            <p><i> </i><b>O'Reilly Releases Essential SNMP</b>
            <p> O'Reilly &amp; Associates announced the July 2001 release 
              of <i>Essential SNMP</i>, by Douglas R. Mauro and Kevin J. Schmidt 
              (ISBN: 0596000200; paperback, 313 pages). According to O'Reilly 
              &amp; Associates, this new book starts with the basics of SNMP and 
              how it works, then provides examples of how use it. The book covers 
              OIDs, MIBs, community strings, traps, and other technical elements, 
              but the main focus is on network administration: how to configure 
              SNMP agents and network management stations, how to use SNMP to 
              retrieve and modify variables on network devices, how to configure 
              management software to react to traps sent by managed devices, and 
              more. It explores both commercial and open source packages, including 
              HP's OpenView, Castle Rock's SNMPc, the Net-SNMP tools, 
              Simon Leinen's Perl SNMP support, and MRTG. In addition to 
              SNMPv1 and v2, the book covers SNMPv3, which has just recently started 
              to appear in commercial products.
            <p> <i>Essential SNMP</i> was written for systems and network administrators 
              who could benefit from using SNMP to manage their equipment but 
              who have little or no experience with SNMP or SNMP applications. 
              Chapter 2, "A Closer Look at SNMP," is available free 
              online at: <b>http://oreilly.com/catalog/esnmp/chapter/ch02.html</b>.

            <p> <b>Stallion Technologies Announces ePipe ServerWare</b>
            <p> Stallion Technologies has announced the release of ePipe ServerWare, 
              a software-based VPN concentrator and security firewall that can 
              be used to interconnect up to 500 distributed office networks. According 
              to the company, ePipe ServerWare can also bond ADSL broadband connections 
              without special intervention by Internet Service Providers.
            <p> ePipe ServerWare includes many of the features available in Stallion's 
              ePipe 2000 series of Internet and VPN gateway devices, technology 
              that transparently binds together multiple Internet connections 
              (ADSL, ISDN, dial-up modem, etc.) into a single high-speed connection, 
              without any special provisioning by the Internet Service Provider.
            <p> ePipe ServerWare supports up to eight Ethernet segments, seven 
              of which can be used to connect to the Internet with ADSL modems, 
              which gives an upstream speed (for VPNs) of more than 1.5 Mb/sec 
              and a downstream speed (for Internet access) of more than 10 Mb/sec. 
              Alternatively, the Ethernet segments can be assigned arbitrarily 
              between the private network, an access router, DMZs (isolated LAN 
              segments for internally hosted Web servers or R&amp;D environments), 
              and ADSL modems.
            <p> ePipe ServerWare is based on a hardened version of Linux and runs 
              on any standard Intel computer, converting it to a secure VPN router/firewall 
              appliance. In addition to supporting multiple Ethernet segments 
              and ADSL connections, ePipe ServerWare also supports and bonds multiple 
              dial-up modem and ISDN connections.

            <p><i> </i><b>TeraByte Releases BootIt NG Version 1.25</b>
            <p> TeraByte Unlimited has released BootIt Next Generation (BootIt 
              NG) v. 1.25, a partitioning, imaging, and multi-boot manager for 
              the PC that helps partition your hard drives into several virtual 
              drives, run or set up multiple operating systems on your computer, 
              and back up and restore your computer in the event of a major system 
              crash.
            <p> According to the company, BootIt NG helps create, copy, re-size, 
              or delete partitions on your hard drive. BootIt NG's multi-boot 
              features allow you to run multiple operating systems on the same 
              computer. Advanced users can hide and position partitions and create 
              hundreds of primary partitions.
            <p> BootIt NG allows the creation of a compressed image of any partition, 
              and saves it on a hard drive or on a CD-ROM. This capability can 
              help you to create a snapshot of your computer and, if the image 
              is stored on an undamaged hard drive or CD-ROM, you can return to 
              your original setup, even after a disk crash or virus attack. IT 
              specialists can also use this feature to maintain company-approved 
              computer setups.
            <p> BootIt NG supports large hard drives and partitions, and lets 
              you boot from any partition of any drive, including CD-ROMs on most 
              computers. You can also convert partitions between FAT and FAT32 
              and install user-id and password protection to keep unauthorized 
              people from making changes to your computer's partitions.
            <p> BootIt NG v. 1.25 runs on all PCs, regardless of operating system 
              (Windows, UNIX/Linux, BeOS, etc.). The program costs $29.95, includes 
              free future minor updates, and may be purchased online at: <b>http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/</b>.
