            <p> <i>Jim McKinstry and Amy Rich</i>
            <p><i> </i><b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've installed a Solaris 
              8 jumpstart server with the following <b>sysidcfg</b> file (IPs 
              changed to protect the innocent):
            <p> 
            <pre>
name_service=DNS { domain_name=my.domain.com
              name_server=192.168.1.2,192.168.1.3 }
system_locale=en_US
timezone=US/Eastern
terminal=vt100
timeserver=localhost
security_policy=NONE
network_interface=primary { netmask=255.255.255.0 protocol_ipv6=no }
</pre>
            When I try to jumpstart a client with:
            <p> 
            <pre>
boot net - install
</pre>
            the installation goes into interactive mode. If I use <b>name_service=NONE</b>, 
            then the installation completes without intervention. I thought that 
            using DNS and specifying the domain and nameservers should result 
            in a hands-off install. Am I doing something wrong?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b>Are you installing the jumpstart 
              client on a network that can't reach the name servers (e.g., 
              having a private non-routable network just for jumpstart installs, 
              but specifying the real DNS servers)? If the jumpstart client can 
              not reach the nameservers, I believe it asks for manual intervention. 
              In addition to that, you may want to check for typos in the IP addresses 
              and perhaps try a sniffer
            <p> to see what's happening on the wire.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I would like to forward all mail, 
              including local mail, to the central mail server for our UNIX systems. 
              No local mailboxes exist on the clients. The clients are running 
              Solaris 8. The mail server should then decide whether the address 
              is local or forward it to the company mail server. The forwarding 
              to the main company mail server works for non-local mail, but how 
              do I stop the client from delivering mail locally on the clients?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b>On every client that should not 
              ever deliver any local mail, you want to use the nullclient configuration. 
              If you have the Sendmail source code:
            <p> 
            <pre>
cd ${sendmail src directory}/cf/cf
</pre>
            where<b> ${sendmail src}</b> is where you've unpacked the code. 
            You'll see a file there called <b>clientproto.mc</b>. The uncommented 
            text looks like:
            <p> 
            <pre>
divert(0)dnl
VERSIONID('$Id: clientproto.mc,v 8.16 2000/03/21 21:05:26 ca Exp $')

OSTYPE(unknown)
FEATURE(nullclient, mailhost.$m)
</pre>
            You'll want to change two things here: the <b>OSTYPE</b> and 
            the host to which the mail should be sent (the smart host). Your client 
            OS is Solaris 8, you mentioned, and let's say that your central 
            mail server is called <b>mail.foo.com</b>. Your create the file <b>localclient.mc</b> 
            (or pick whatever name you like for the <b>mc</b> file) and put the 
            following in it:
            <p> 
            <pre>
divert(0)dnl
VERSIONID('$Id: clientproto.mc,v 8.16 2000/03/21 21:05:26 ca Exp $')

OSTYPE(solaris2)
FEATURE(nullclient, mail.foo.com)
</pre>
            If your client machine is in the same DNS domain as your central mail 
            hub, you can leave the name of the mail hub as <b>mail.$m</b> instead 
            of specifying <b>mail.foo.com</b>. If you have clients that are running 
            other operating systems, you can find a list of accepted <b>OSTYPE</b> 
            settings in <b>${sendmail src}/cf/ostype</b>. When specifying the 
            <b>OSTYPE</b>, don't add the <b>.m4</b> on the end.
            <p> To create your new <b>sendmail.cf</b> file, do the following (assuming 
              you used <b>localclient.mc</b> as the name of your <b>mc</b> file):
            <p> 
            <pre>
cd ${sendmail src}/cf/cf
m4 ../m4/cf.m4 localclient.mc &gt; sendmail.cf
mv /etc/mail/sendmail.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf.orig
mv sendmail.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
/etc/init.s/sendmail stop
/etc/init.d/sendmail start
</pre>
            Look at the log file (usually<b> /var/log/syslog</b>, <b>/var/adm/messages</b>, 
            or<b> /var/log/maillog</b>) to verify that Sendmail started without 
            errors.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've been seeing a lot of 
              RPC probes on my machine from an address in <b>.br</b>, <b>.kr</b>, 
              and <b>.cn</b>. Where the heck are these places, and is there some 
              definitive database that maps country code domains to location?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b><b>.br</b> belongs to the country 
              of Brazil, <b>.kr</b> to Korea, and <b>.cn</b> to China. I often 
              see a large number of cracking-associated probes (like RPC, backorifice, 
              DNS queries on a machine not running <b>named</b>, etc.) from Korea, 
              Hong Kong (<b>.hk</b>), and China, especially. For a complete listing 
              of country TLDs, take a look at IANA's ccTLD database:

            If you're seeing hits on ports that you don't recognize, 
            you may want to take a look at IANA's list of ports, too:

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a Sun machine with two processors. 
            How do I take one of them offline without bringing down the machine?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> To change the operational state 
              of the processors, use the <b>/usr/sbin/psradm</b> utility. The 
              caveat is that, on some processors or under certain conditions, 
              it may not be possible to disable interrupts for an offline processor. 
              So, depending on your machine, you may not be able to fully take 
              the processor offline. In order to take a specified processor offline, 
              you need to know the number of the processor. These are listed when 
              you do a <b>/usr/sbin/psrinfo</b>. Once you know the processor number, 
              you specify it by using the <b>-f</b> flag to <b>/usr/sbin/psradm</b>. 
              You'd take processor 1 offline by doing the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/sbin/psradm -f 1
</pre>
            Look at the manpages for <b>psradm(1M)</b> and<b> psrinfo(1M)</b> 
            for more information on these commands.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm looking at installing 
              some form of open source BSD on my PC. What's the difference 
              between NetBSD, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD? Is one any better than the 
              other?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> As always, "better" 
              is a relative term depending on what you're after. The three 
              open source BSD projects have different goals. NetBSD is designed 
              to be the most portable BSD, and it runs on a number of different 
              and obscure platforms. OpenBSD's goal is to be the most secure 
              OS, and they've done code audits and security enhancements 
              (like maintaining OpenSSH). Although not as portable as NetBSD, 
              OpenBSD currently runs on about a dozen platforms. FreeBSD is designed 
              to be the most user/systems administrator-friendly branch of the 
              BSDs, but it only runs (currently) on x86 and alpha platforms.
            <p> That said, the open source BSDs benefit from each other whenever 
              one does anything with the code base. There's a great deal 
              of cross-pollination that goes on between them (e.g., advancements 
              like the ports collection, security fixes to problems common to 
              all BSD installs, etc.). Each has a well-developed code base and 
              a structured development environment. They're all fairly good 
              choices for home UNIX machines. 
            <p> Therefore, if you're just looking for a system to tinker 
              around with and learn from, I'd suggest FreeBSD. If you're 
              looking for something to run as a firewall, try OpenBSD. If you're 
              looking to run the same OS on a diverse number of platforms, I recommend 
              NetBSD. You may also want to take a look at the BSD FAQ:

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> How can I completely remove the information 
            from a hard disk so that no one can recover the data that was on it? 
            Is just <b>newfs</b>'ing the disk good enough? How about formatting 
            it?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The best way to ensure that no 
              one ever reads data off of a disk is to destroy the disk and melt 
              it down into slag. If you want to remove the old data and pass the 
              disk onto someone else for reuse, that's quite a bit trickier. 
              It isn't sufficient to just format or <b>newfs</b> the disk. 
              It's not even sufficient to write all zeros on the disk. Because 
              of the way data is stored on the disk, you have to jump through 
              hoops to actually get all of the data truly erased so that even 
              disk recovery houses can not pull information off of them. There's 
              a good paper by Peter Gutmann in the USENIX library that describes 
              erasing disks and tapes:

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Is there a way to find out a user's 
            UID without looking in the password file? A machine I'm on has 
            the <b>/etc/passwd </b>file unreadable.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can use the <b>id</b> command 
              to determine what your UID and GID are. Most systems have a native 
              <b>id</b> command, or you can install the GNU <b>sh-utils</b> software:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/sh-utils/
</pre>
            You can also whip up your own C program that uses one or more of the 
            following functions:
            <p> 
            <pre>
getuid, geteuid, getgid, getegid, getpwnam, getpwnam_r, getpwent,
getpwent_r, getpwuid, getpwuid_r, setpwent, endpwent, fgetpwent,
fgetpwent_r
</pre>
            See your system's man pages for the appropriate function call 
            syntax.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have both FreeBSD and Solaris 
              machines at our company. We aren't currently running any sort 
              of centralized password authentication method (we're looking 
              into LDAP), but I want to be able to keep the passwords consistent 
              across platforms by just copying the password field. Is this possible?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If your two platforms are using 
              the same scheme to encode passwords, then you can, indeed, copy 
              the passwords between machines. Note that the other fields of the 
              password entry may differ, however. By default, Solaris uses DES 
              to encode the the local password. At install time, FreeBSD can be 
              configured to use either DES or MD5. MD5 is believed to be more 
              secure, but if you're aiming for compatibility, you're 
              better off having your FreeBSD machines use DES. FreeBSD moved to 
              MD5 password encoding because, at the time, DES was export controlled, 
              and it was illegal for people installing FreeBSD in countries other 
              than the United States to use it. As a result, the DES libraries 
              (the FreeBSD crypto package) can do both MD5 and DES, but the MD5 
              libraries can only do MD5. 
            <p> To determine which scheme you're using on your FreeBSD machines, 
              take a look at<b> /etc/master.passwd</b>. Passwords encrypted with 
              the MD5 hash are longer than those with encrypted with the DES hash 
              and begin with the the string <b>$1$</b>. DES password strings are 
              shorter and are coded in a 64-character alphabet, which does not 
              include the <b>$</b> character. You can also determine which authentication 
              system your machine is using by looking at where the libcrypt libraries 
              point.
            <p> 
            <pre>
ls -l /usr/lib/libcrypt.*
</pre>
            If these libraries point to <b>libdescrypt</b>, then you're using 
            DES. If they point to <b>libscrypt</b>, then you're using MD5. 
            If you're using MD5 and you want to switch to DES, you can install 
            the crypto package from <b>/stand/sysinstall</b>. The <b>libcrypt</b> 
            libraries should now point to the <b>libdescrypt</b> libraries. If 
            you have old users with MD5 entries, you'll either have to crack 
            them or have the users change their passwords. 
            <p> If the DES libraries are installed, also be sure to check <b>/etc/login.conf</b> 
              for a <b>passwd_format</b> directory. If one exists, you'll 
              want it set to <b>des</b>, not <b>md5</b>. This setting controls 
              the format in which any new passwords are stored.
            <p> As an aside, if you're looking at some sort of centralized 
              password and group repository, try as soon as possible to sync up 
              your UIDs and GIDs across all of your machines.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b>I'm trying to run Netscape 
              4.76 on Solaris 8, but whenever I type in a URL, it just sits there 
              and hangs. If I wait long enough, it comes back and says that it 
              can't resolve the host. I have the following in <b>/etc/nsswitch.conf</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>
hosts:      files dns
</pre>
            I can do an <b>nslookup</b> on the hosts I'm trying to get to, 
            I can <b>ping</b> them, and I can <b>telnet</b> to them -- everything 
            but Web access via Netscape. What's the problem?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b>You've probably turned off 
              <b>nscd</b>, the name service cache daemon. Unfortunately, with 
              Solaris 8, Netscape refuses to function without using <b>nscd</b>. 
              I'd suggest trying to run:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/etc/init.d/nscd start
</pre>
            and then browsing. If this fixes your problem, make sure you have 
            the following start and stop scripts in place, and <b>nscd</b> will 
            start even after the machine gets rebooted:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/etc/rc0.d/K40nscd
/etc/rc1.d/K40nscd
/etc/rc2.d/S76nscd
/etc/rcS.d/K40nscd
</pre>
            For more information about <b>nscd</b> and what it does, take a look 
            at the man pages <b>nscd(1M)</b> and <b>nscd.conf(4)</b>.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a large number of messages 
              that get queued, so I want to set up multiple queue directories 
              on different disks to help with <b>stat()</b> times and read times. 
              I'm using Sendmail 8.11.2, and I have the partitions for the 
              queue directories mounted as <b>/var/spool/mqueue1</b>, <b>/var/spool/mqueue2</b>, 
              and <b>/var/spool/mqueue3</b>. I'm not sure how to split up 
              the queue so that it goes onto these disks, however. Everything 
              is still staying in <b>/var/spool/mqueue</b>.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> First, make sure that you have 
              stopped Sendmail and that no mail is being delivered. From <b>doc/op/op</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>
QueueDirectory=dir [Q] Use the named dir as the queue directory. To 
use multiple queues, supply a value ending with an asterisk.
For example, /var/spool/mqueue/q* will use all of the
directories or symbolic links to directories beginning with q
in /var/spool/mqueue as queue directories.
</pre>
            Set <b>QueueDirectory</b> to<b> /var/spool/mqueue/q*</b>. In the <b>mc</b> 
            file, add the following; rebuild your <b>sendmail.cf</b>; and put 
            it into place:
            <p> 
            <pre>
define('confQUEUE_DIR', '/var/spool/mqueue/q*')dnl
</pre>
            Make the following symlinks:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/var/spool/mqueue/q1 -&gt; /var/spool/mqueue1
/var/spool/mqueue/q2 -&gt; /var/spool/mqueue2
/var/spool/mqueue/q3 -&gt; /var/spool/mqueue3
</pre>
            You can also change where you mount your three partitions so that 
            they are directly mounted as<b> /var/spool/mqueue/qN</b> instead of 
            <b>/var/spool/mqueueN</b>. If you mounted the partitions directly, 
            you could skip doing the symlinks. If you don't have dedicated 
            partitions for each of the spool directories, though, symlinks are 
            the way to go.

            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b>I've heard that you can now 
              download Solaris instead of paying $75 for the CDs. Is this true? 
              Is it both SPARC and x86? Where can I get the distribution?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b>Yes, Sun has now put Solaris 8 
              up for free download. After downloading the ISO images, use your 
              favorite CDR/CDRW burning software to put the images onto CDs. You 
              can obtain the zipped ISO images for either SPARC or x86 platforms 
              from the following URL:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/binaries/download.html
</pre>
            You can also still order the media from Sun for $75 if you don't 
            have the space or the connection speed needed to download the ~800M 
            ISO images.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b>I have a message in my <b>syslog</b> 
              files that indicate that <b>sshd</b> (OpenSSH 2.3.0p1) generated 
              a RSA key. This happened without my intervention. Does <b>sshd</b> 
              do this automatically at certain times, or is something malicious 
              happening?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b>Yes, this happens automatically 
              for security reasons. After the key has been regenerated, it becomes 
              impossible to recover it for decrypting hijacked sessions because 
              the key is not stored on disk. From the <b>sshd</b> man page:
            <p> 
            <pre>
...when the daemon starts, it generates a server RSA key (normally 768 bits). This key 
is normally regenerated every hour if it has been used, and is never stored on disk.
</pre>
            You can specify the key regeneration interval when you start <b>sshd</b> 
            by using the <b>-k</b> switch (time is measured in seconds). If you 
            wanted to regenerate the key every half hour, you'd start <b>sshd</b> 
            as:
            <p> 
            <pre>
sshd -k 1800
</pre>
            If you specify zero for the regeneration time, it will never be regenerated. 
            This is not recommended.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b>When I make an alias as an end-user 
              everything works as expected. When I invoke other shell console, 
              though, the alias I made is not available anymore. Is there any 
              command to add aliases to a file, or is this method of adding aliases 
              just for root?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b>Aliasing is a function of your 
              shell, and some shells do not support aliases. For shells that do 
              support aliases, when you set an alias on the command line, it is 
              good only for that session. If you want aliases to persist for each 
              shell invocation, you need to put them in a resource file (e.g., 
              <b>.cshrc</b> for <b>csh</b>, <b>.tcshrc</b> for <b>tcsh</b>, <b>.bashrc</b> 
              for <b>bash</b>, etc.). To determine the proper resource file for 
              your shell, read the man page on your chosen shell.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b>Is there an equivalent to Solaris's

              HP product, but <b>tusc</b> (trace UNIX system calls) was written 
              by Chris R. Bertin who works at HP Cupertino. <b>Tusc</b> can be

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b>My Exabyte 8200 8mm tape drive just 
            died, and I'm thinking of upgrading to the Exabyte Mammoth. Will 
            I still be able to use the tapes from my 8200?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b>The Mammoth and Mammoth-LT drives 
              can read the data written by the 8200 drive, but the Mammoth-2 drive 
              can not. Neither of them can write the 8200 format, but I suspect 
              you don't care about that as much, because it sounds like you 
              won't be going back to using a 8200 for restores. You'll 
              also have to buy new tapes to write to, because the Mammoth drive 
              does not write to the MP tapes. These two URLs from Exabyte should 
              give you a good idea of your compatibility options:
