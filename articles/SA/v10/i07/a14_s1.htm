            <H1>What Have We Sacrificed</h1>
            <p> A colleague expressed some concern about my hardening of the SNMP 
              service:
            <p> "Without tons of experimentation, we don't know if what 
              you did locks down too tight, and for a large company using a vendorware 
              SNMP management station, you might have broken monitoring in favor 
              of hardening." -- Patrick Matlock, 10/10/2000.
            <p> Patrick suggested that we explore the SNMP service with the tool 
              <b>snmpwalk(1)</b> to see what variables are available before hardening 
              and what remains after hardening. That tool is part of the UCDavis 
              SNMP Suite, which we have installed on some systems. You won't 
              find any vendor provided tools on Solaris to query the service unless 
              you've installed some value-added packages. Here's an 
              example of how you can use it to find out about "system" 
              values:
            <p> 
            <pre>
[1:38pm wally] snmpwalk dilbert public system
system.sysDescr.0 = Sun SNMP Agent, SPARCstation-20
system.sysObjectID.0 = OID: enterprises.42.2.1.1
system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (619954285) 71 days, 18:05:42.85
system.sysContact.0 = dilbert@ist.uwaterloo.ca
system.sysName.0 = dilbert
system.sysLocation.0 = Machine Room, UW/IST, MC
system.sysServices.0 = 72
</pre>
            The arguments to the command are the system (e.g., "dilbert" 
            is a computer name), the community (e.g., "public" and "private" 
            are the defaults), and the optional <b>objectId</b> (i.e., the things 
            you want to know about). I understand that the <b>objectId's</b> 
            are all strings that begin with one of these: <b>at</b>, <b>icmp</b>, 
            <b>interfaces</b>, <b>ip</b>, <b>snmp</b>, <b>system</b>, <b>tcp</b>, 
            and <b>udp</b>. We discovered, and this came as quite a surprise to 
            me, that we had not lost any SNMP values through hardening. Here's 
            how we determined this:
            <p> 
            <pre>
[1:39pm wally] snmpwalk system-a public | \
        sed -e 's/[0-9.]* =.*//' | sort -fu  /tmp/system-a
[1:40pm wally] snmpwalk system-b public | \
        sed -e 's/[0-9.]* =.*//' | sort -fu  /tmp/system-b
[1:40pm wally] diff /tmp/system-a /tmp/system-b
</pre>
            If system-a has a vendor-configured service, and system-b has a hardened 
            service (as above, but also configured to let wally be a "manager" 
            for the system), then each of them returns the same 150 things. I'm 
            confident that we've not sacrificed any data by hardening. The 
            "private" things returned is a small list (7 things), and 
            again that's not any different pre- or post-hardening.
            <p> <i>The CERT Advisory CA-2001-05 at <b>http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-05.html</b> 
              of March 30, 2001 identified a serious vulnerablity in the snmpXdmid 
              RPC daemon. The hardening strategy recommended here does not require 
              that service. We discovered that we didn't need the service 
              and removed it long before the advisory was ever released. It's 
              always a good idea to remove services you don't need </i>--<i> 
              doing so means you won't be caught by a vulnerablity that's 
              discovered later.</i>
