            As promised, here are some results from <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine's 
            most recent editorial survey. This survey is not conducted by any 
            external, unbiased entity. We mail it and tally the results ourselves, 
            so you may wish to heed the advice of the Slashdot pollsters -- 
            i.e., if you're using these numbers to do anything important, 
            you're insane. Please note, however, that 91% of respondents 
            find my syslog column at least somewhat useful... 
            <p> The survey results also indicate that readers find the NetAdmin 
              and Perl Advisor columns very useful. The Q&amp;A column, however, 
              was rated most useful of all. Amy Rich of Oceanwave Consulting deserves 
              recognition for her hard work and time spent answering readers' 
              questions both in the magazine and on the <i>Sys Admin</i> Web site. 
              Thank you, Amy!
            <p> One of the questions on the survey asked, "Is systems administration 
              your foremost responsibility? If not, please specify." Nearly 
              half (48%) responded that their foremost duty was something other 
              than UNIX systems administration. Not surprisingly, these duties 
              include Web development, programming, consulting, database administration, 
              systems integration, help desk support, teaching, and management. 
              47% responded that they support more than 100 users (23% support 
              more than 500). The most widely administered operating systems are 
              (in order): Linux (all flavors), Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, Irix, BSD 
              (all flavors), Tru64, and SCO.
            <p> Within the topic of job-related duties, we asked how often our 
              readers program in various languages. 58% program occasionally in 
              C/C++; 41% program in Java; 75% program in Perl; 91% program in 
              shell; and 35% write Tcl/Tk programs. The article topics respondents 
              found most interesting are: security, performance tuning, system 
              monitoring, and scripting languages. Results indicated less interest 
              in mainframe, Web-to-host, or NT connectivity issues.
            <p> The write-in suggestions requested that more <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              articles be made available online. You'd also like larger issues 
              with fewer ads and more code. I'm not sure how to make all 
              these things happen, but I'll work on it. In the meantime, 
              this issue offers a wide variety of articles that I hope you'll 
              find informative. This issue includes an article by Jeffrey Rothman 
              and John Buckman, which compares the performance of various operating 
              systems when running a specific network application. Anthony Taylor 
              provides an overview of WindowMaker, and Tom Podnar walks us through 
              a network troubleshooting exercise. The Web-exclusive articles include 
              an introduction to Coda by Brett Lymn, some tips for monitoring 
              Usenet news usage by Bill Davidsen, and ways to make the default 
              SNMP configuration more secure under Solaris. As always, please 
              let me know if you have additional suggestions for improving the 
              magazine.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
