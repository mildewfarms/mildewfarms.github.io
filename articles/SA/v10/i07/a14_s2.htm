            <H1>Intermapper</h1>
            <p> The InterMapper (see <b>http://www.intermapper.com</b>) is an 
              SNMP monitor that runs on the Mac platform. You configure it to 
              monitor a list of hosts using a basic ping test or a more informative 
              SNMP test -- SNMP "system" parameters can give information 
              about system uptime, operating system and much more. The InterMapper 
              does not, to the best of my knowledge, probe any of the more esoteric 
              SNMP parameters. At our site, we don't use SNMP alerts (those 
              are "alarms"), nor do we use SNMP to control systems. 
              While I don't know very much about SNMP, it was clear from 
              the outset that our InterMapper requirements were very modest indeed.
            <p> We have other systems where our SNMP monitoring requirements are 
              much more than those discussed here. We have backroom database systems 
              where we monitor the performance using a vendor-provided utility 
              that "plugs into" the SNMP suite provided by Sun. A daemon 
              is provided that extends the Sun service by acting as a back-end 
              to the <b>snmpdx</b> daemon in the same way that the <b>dmispd</b> 
              and <b>mibiisa</b> do. It's pretty clear that for those systems 
              we cannot eliminate as many services. More work is required to determine 
              which components are required in that context. Nevertheless, we 
              recognize the backroom database server is the exceptional case. 
              Most servers require much less.
