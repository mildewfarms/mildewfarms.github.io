            <p><b> SecurityFocus.com Announces ARIS</b>
            <p> SecurityFocus.com announced its Attack Registry &amp; Intelligence 
              Service (ARIS), a network attack predictor and incident management 
              system. ARIS is comprised of two modules -- the ARIS analyzer 
              that collects and analyzes incident data and the ARIS predictor 
              that functions as a global warning system for computer attacks.
            <p> According to the company, ARIS can automatically and anonymously 
              collect a company's Intrusion Detection System (IDS) log data, 
              provide organized reports on attacks to their systems as well as 
              information to respond to attacks, and give customized prediction 
              reports on likely attacks, all through a secure Web interface.
            <p> The ARIS analyzer collects and uploads IDS log files from a variety 
              of systems including Cisco Secure (formerly NetRanger), ISS Real 
              Secure, Network ICE ICEpac and Defender, and Snort, into a central 
              database and correlation engine for the analysis and handling of 
              incidents. The ARIS predictor utilizes the data gathered from a 
              worldwide collection of incidents to view computer attacks from 
              a global perspective, and to predict attacks based on this data. 
              It can statistically track attacks by type, source, time, location, 
              and victim profile. Security analysts at SecurityFocus.com create 
              customized attack prediction reports for each customer.
            <p> ARIS analyzer is a free service that is available now at http://aris.securityfocus.com. 
              ARIS predictor is a subscription service available in May 2001.

            <p> <b>Tripwire Releases Tripwire for Web Pages </b>
            <p> Tripwire Inc announced Tripwire for Web Pages for the Apache Web 
              server platform. According to the company, this new product detects 
              unauthorized modifications to Web site content, prevents the delivery 
              of modified pages, and alerts the systems administrator.
            <p> According to the company, Tripwire for Web Pages detects unauthorized 
              modifications to Web server content, instantly alerts the systems 
              administrator, and redirects Web site viewers to a user-defined 
              temporary Web page until authorized content is restored. Tripwire 
              for Web Pages determines whether a Web page has been altered by 
              comparing the date and the digital signature of the current Web 
              page to that of the "known good" authorized file securely 
              saved in the database. This "integrity check" is performed 
              each time a browser requests a Web page from the Web server. If 
              the file dates and/or signatures do not match precisely, Tripwire 
              for Web Pages halts the file from being served, sends a custom notification/replacement 
              page to the browser, logs the event, and sends a custom email to 
              alert the systems administrator of the change and provides steps 
              to restore the authorized content.
            <p> Tripwire for Web Pages is available immediately, priced at $1,095.

              18 GB to 36 GB or higher; one 5-1/4 inch slot for a notebook-type 
              CD-ROM; one 3-1/2 inch slot for FDD; and two 3-1/2 inch slots for 
              IDE or SCSI hard disk drives. The COMPstation U100T is expandable 
              from 256 KB to 2 GB of system memory; and three PCI slots at 33 
              MHz/32 bit. Like the low profile server, disk storage includes options 
              for IDE or Ultra Wide SCSI, with capacities ranging from 18 GB to 
              36 GB or higher; but the U100T has three drive slots for CD-ROM, 
              tape drive, HDD or FDD, and one IDE or SCSI slot for hard disk drives.
            <p> Both systems include two serial ports, a Centronics-compatible 
              parallel port, two USB ports, two 10/100-BaseT Ethernet interfaces, 
              Solaris 8, and an optional 16-bit audio/graphics. The COMPstation
