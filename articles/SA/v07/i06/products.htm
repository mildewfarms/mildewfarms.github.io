<h1>New Products</h1><p><p>
<b>Young Minds, Inc. Announces High Speed CD-Recording System for UNIX</b><p>Young Minds, Inc. has announced its third generation CD-recording system. The system remasters, records, and prints as many as 100 different CD-ROM disks in a single day.  This turnkey solution is called Mass Production Studio 2 (MPS 2).<p>
MPS 2 consists of the MPS multi-processor controller, premastering software, two CD recorders, a media autoloader, and an inline printer. Since premastering the data set requires at least as much time as the actual disk recording process, two or more premastering tasks run concurrently on the host system. The host system would be a UNIX workstation. Once the data has been premastered, the host sends the data to the MPS 2 system, which then queues and sends it to a recorder. MPS 2's parallel architecture allows a high rate of utilization of the CD-Recorder. The MPS 2 controller design includes built-in redundancy for the writers.<p>
The MPS2 uses two 4x recorders and supports simultaneous recording on both writers. The input capacity allows up to 50 disks to be recorded unattended. When using the inline printer, the autoloader moves the recorded disk from the recorder to the printer, and then from the printer to the output stack. The printing requires no manual disk handling. The printer uses a thermal printing process for sharp, crisp graphics and text. There is no bleeding or drying time as with ink jet printers. Printed disks will not smudge, fade, or wash off. The entire printing operation, from the time the disk finishes recording to the time it is placed on the output spindle, can take less than 60 seconds.<p>
For more information, contact <I>Young Minds, Inc., 1906 Orange Tree Lane, Suite 220, P.O. Box 6910, Redlands, CA 92375-0910; (800) 964-4964; Fax: (909) 798-0488; Internet: marketing@ymi.com; WWW: http://www.ymi.com.<p>

<B>Aurora Software Announces SarCheck v3 for HP-UX</b><p>Aurora Software Inc. has begun shipping version 3 of SarCheck for HP-UX 9.00 through 11.00. SarCheck is a performance management tool designed to assist system administrators in the analysis of HP 9000 performance by translating the output of several monitoring utilities into a plain English report. SarCheck identifies performance bottlenecks, finds runaway processes and memory leaks, recommends changes to various tunable parameters and hardware configuration, and quantifies remaining system capacity.<p>
SarCheck is designed to help system administrators learn more about how their systems work by explaining resource utilization and capacity limits in plain English. The software also helps the administrator diagnose problems remotely and quickly recommend or implement corrective actions. Because SarCheck has been specifically designed with safety in mind, it will make detailed recommendations instead of attempting to fix problems itself. SarCheck also provides explanations for its recommendations.<p>
SarCheck reports consist of three sections and a summary. The first section contains recommendations that can be used to improve system performance. These changes include changes to tunable parameters, disk load balance, and hardware upgrades. The second section is an analysis of all system resources monitored by SarCheck. The analysis section contains insights that can help an administrator, even when no resource bottlenecks were detected. The final section, Capacity Planning, can be used to approximate the remaining system capacity.<p>
Pricing for a single SarCheck license for HP-UX starts at $750, and other licensing options are available. SarCheck runs on other popular UNIX platforms, and support for other languages is planned. For more information, contact <I>Aurora Software Inc., P.O. Box 1033, Plaistow, NH, 03865; (603) 382-4200; Fax: (603) 382-4247; WWW: http://www.sarcheck.com.</I><p>
<B>Ontrack Provides Data Recovery by Phone</b><p>Ontrack is now offering Remote Data Recovery (RDR), a service that lets Ontrack rescue data on modem-equipped PCs by phone. Patent-pending RDR works in conjunction with Ontrack Data Advisor, freeware diagnostic software. When a data loss occurs-even when the system won't boot-Data Advisor can be used to diagnose the problem and provide recommendations, including Remote Data Recovery, where appropriate.<p>
RDR can solve non-hardware related problems, including some caused by viruses, corrupted file structures, and software malfunctions. (Other problems, including hardware malfunctions, may require traditional data recovery methods.) If Data Advisor recommends RDR, it gives users the option of automatically establishing a dial-up connection to Ontrack and uploading the diagnostic test results. An experienced data recovery engineer uses those results to develop a data recovery plan. The Ontrack representative will provide time estimates and price quotes for the recovery effort.<p>
Ontrack began providing RDR in January 1998. Typical recovery times range from 30 minutes to two hours, for a 28.8 kbps connection. Pricing is quoted on a case-by-case basis based on the severity of the problem. For a typical drive with a capacity of 2 Gb or less, RDR pricing would range from $400 to $1,200, including a non-refundable $100 diagnostic fee. Data Advisor is available from Ontrack at (800) 872-2599 or as a free download from the Ontrack Web site (www.ontrack.com).<p>
<B>Breece Hill Enhances Saguaro DLT Libraries</b><p>Breece Hill Technologies has announced a new software release that allows its Saguaro DLT libraries to be managed as a network device via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The Saguaro library will appear as a network device to SNMP enterprise applications. Breece Hill engineers created an Enterprise Extension to the standard SNMP Management Information Base (MIB), which enables the Saguaro library to operate with the major network management applications that support SNMP, including: Tivoli, CA UniCenter, Microsoft Systems Management Server, Sun Solstice Enterprise Manager, Hewlett-Packard OpenView, and IBM NetView,<p>
Network management applications can query a Saguaro library and receive the full range of SNMP data in return, including notification when problems occur in the library. Breece Hill's SNMP implementation includes features to generate a variety of reports. The enhanced MIB (now standard with all Saguaro libraries) enables network managers to access information such as: installed media, location of media within which drive, tape drive operational information, and data about library temperature and voltages.<p>
Breece Hill's DLT-based Saguaro libraries are available in three models optimized and configured to address specific storage demands: the high-performance Saguaro Q70 equipped with 12 DLT drives and 70 cartridges for a maximum capacity of 4.9 terabytes, the "mixed application" Q140 with 9 drives and 140 cartridges for a total capacity of almost 10 terabytes, and the Q2310 high-capacity model that offers almost 15 terabytes of capacity using 6 DLT7000 drives. All Saguaro models are available in "de-populated" configurations to address current needs, but provide scaleability for future growth. For more information, contact <I>Breece Hill Technologies; (303) 449-2673; Internet: Lelizer@BreeceHill.com, WWW: http://www.BreeceHill.com.<p>
