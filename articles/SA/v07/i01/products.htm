<h1>New Products</h1><p>
<b>EST Announces QuickStart</b><p>Enhanced Software Technologies, Inc. has announced QuickStart, a family of multi-platform software products for replicating identically configured systems and recovering business systems and critical data. The QuickStart family includes QuickStart System Replicator, QuickStart System Rescue, and QuickStart Data Rescue.<p>
QuickStart System Replicator provides replication of identically configured systems. QuickStart System Replicator supports one-step mass reproduction for 10 to 10,000 systems. The administrator creates a verified QuickStart Master Volume consisting of the full system and application environment for the replicated systems, then uses the QuickStart System Replicator disk to duplicate this master environment on each target system. QuickStart System Rescue provides one-step disaster recovery of the system and application environment so the administrator can restore a fully configured system to its original state without reinstalling the operating system or applications. QuickStart Data Rescue provides single boot-disk backup and disaster recovery of a system environment including data files so the administrator can restore a system to the exact state of its last backup. Equipped with a QuickStart Master Volume and backup volumes from any other backup software, the administrator boots the system using the QuickStart Rescue disk to restore the system without reinstalling the operating system.<p>
QuickStart products support Intel-based PC systems, including Windows 95, Windows NT, NetWare, and OS/2, as well as PC UNIX platforms, including SCO, UnixWare, Interactive UNIX, Linux, BSD, and Solaris x86. QuickStart supports SCSI or IDE/ATAPI tape device, floppy-based QIC-80 or Travan tape device, Iomega Jaz and Zip, and Syquest EzFlyer and Syjet. The QuickStart DemoStart Package includes a free 10-user QuickStart System Replicator license. QuickStart System Replicator licenses, available in bands from 10 to 10,000 uses, are priced at $25 per use and include a free QuickStart System Rescue disk for each QuickStart replicated system. QuickStart Data Rescue is priced at $99 per system. For more information, contact <I>Enhanced Software Technologies, Inc., Tempe, AZ; (602) 820-0042; FAX: (602) 491-0865; Internet: info@estinc.com; WWW: www.estinc.com.<p>
</I><B>Collective Technologies Announces Linux Commercial Support</b><p>Collective Technologies has announced its newest AnswerDesk service: Linux Commercial Support. The vendor-independent Linux telephone support was announced at the 1997 LISA Conference in San Diego, along with the NT and UNIX support currently being offered. The Collective Technologies AnswerDesk provides multi-platform NT and UNIX telephone support to Fortune 500 clients.<p>
Linux phone support is available to Collective Technologies clients in 50-hour blocks, includes 24x7 phone support, and allows users to access the Collective Intellect, a knowledge base of answers to problems that cover all major NT and UNIX platforms. This vendor-independent service will allow a company to receive cross-platform support for all of their NT and UNIX needs. The Linux phone support contract comes with the guarantee that if the Collective Technologies AnswerDesk does not solve your Linux problem, then you don't pay.<p>
Along with the announcement of the new Collective Technologies service offerings, the company also used the LISA Conference to announce their new name. Collective Technologies is formerly PSA/Pencom Systems Administration.<p>

<B>Insession Launches TransFuse</b><p>Insession Inc. has launched TransFuse, a tool that links client platforms with venerable host transaction processing systems. Dubbed "enterprise accessware", TransFuse makes that content of corporate databases available to a client platform, whether a browser or traditional desktop, while enforcing transaction integrity.<p>
TransFuse supports TP monitor access and makes it available to C++, Visual Basic, Java, PowerBuilder, ActiveX, Lotus Script, Delphi, and CORBA IDL application developers. On the back-end, TransFuse supports TP monitors such as IMS's CICS and IMS, Tandem's Pathway and BEA's Tuxedo, as well as IBM's MQSeries messaging middleware. TransFuse's API supports Microsoft's DCOM and the Object Management Group's CORBA.<p>
Once TransFuse's API is incorporated into an application, TransFuse controls a transaction throughout its life cycle. If a transaction fails to complete, it is automatically rolled back. For large mainframe data centers where more than one TP monitor is operating, TransFuse also binds application components together into a single transaction that can span multiple TP monitors, or multiple passes to the same TP monitor. In an n-tier architecture, TransFuse works with ORBs to provide scalability.<p>
Pricing for TransFuse starts at $5,000 for 10 concurrent users. For more information, contact <I>Insession Inc., 2030 Main St., Suite 1300, Irvine, CA; (714) 260-9098; FAX: (714) 260-9099; WWW: http://www.insession.com.<p>

</I><B>Network General Announces CyberCop</b><p>Network General Corp. has announced CyberCop, an intrusion detection system that performs real-time surveillance of network traffic. Placed at key locations throughout a network, from LAN segments and dial-up modem servers to connections to the Internet or other WANs, the CyberCop system's sensors unobtrusively analyze the datastream for suspicious activity. Once CyberCop detects suspicious activity, CyberCop alerts system administrators and records data in permanent logs and Sniffer Analyzer trace files. Administrators can then use the Sniffer trace files to build trend analysis information or as evidence to prove that improper use of the network occurred.<p>
Using technology from the WheelGroup, CyberCop recognizes 170 kinds of network and host-based intrusion originating from either inside or outside the corporate network. To ensure its own security, CyberCop includes secure user identification and authentication, encrypted communications and messaging, and multiple layers of security.

</I><B>Electric Mail Introduces AKA</b><p>The Electric Mail Company Inc. has introduced the AKA service, a multi-purpose service that gives companies Internet email addressing capabilities and routing flexibility. Using a Web interface, the system administrator can create any number of multiple, unique, or generic Internet email aliases that are automatically and transparently routed to existing email addresses, either internal or external to the company. AKA also lets an organization use one simple company domain name for all its employees, even if their email system uses multiple sub-classes, complex domain names, or outside ISP accounts. AKA services can be activated, deactivated, or reconfigured via the Web. Addresses can be as complex or simple as needed, and each user can have as many addresses as they like.<p>
AKA also performs a mailing list function. The administrator can create a generic email address in AKA that can be directed to a specific group whether they are working in the office or in a remote location using an ISP account. One email message sent to the generic address will be received by all members of that specific group. Also, AKA lets users create more succinct domain name and have messages routed transparently to the longer email address. AKA routes email to mobile employees who want to use the company's standard domain name even though they may be accessing their email through an external ISP account.<p>
AKA monthly corporate subscription fees start at $25 per month. There is also a setup fee. The self-managed Web interface is accessible from any browser. If an organization does not have Web access, AKA maintenance service is available directly though Electric Mail.
