</I><B>ARCO Announces DupliDisk-PCI</b><p>ARCO Computer Products Inc. has announced DupliDisk-PCI, a driverless disk mirroring RAID 1 adapter designed for the PCI bus. DupliDisk-PCI is not a primary disk controller but uses ARCO's intermediate adapter technology to provide disk fault tolerance and continuous automatic hard disk backup. When inserted into a PCI bus slot, the DupliDisk-PCI mirrors up to two pairs of IDE, E-IDE, or U-IDE drives. If a hardware failure disables one of the mirrored drives, DupliDisk-PCI automatically shifts operations to the functioning drives.<p>
DupliDisk-PCI connects via a standard IDE cable either to the IDE connector built into most PCI motherboards or to an add-in IDE adapter installed on the system. Disk drives are connected to the DupliDisk-PCI via primary and mirror connectors provided with the boards. The DupliDisk-PCI operates transparently.<p>
DupliDisk-PCI is a hardware-based dual-channel adapter and requires no TSRs or operating system-dependent device drivers. Since compatibility with DupliDisk-PCI is established at the original IDE connection, according to the company, DupliDisk is essentially operating-system independent. DupliDisk-PCI can be installed on systems running UNIX, Linux, NetWare, Windows 3.x/ 95 and NT, OS/2, DOS, and others.<p>
DupliDisk-PCI is priced at $225. For more information, contact <I>ARCO Computer Products, Inc., 2750 N. 29th Ave., Hollywood, FL 33020; (954) 925-2688; Fax: (954) 925-2889; Internet: arco@arcoide.com; WWW: http://www.arcoide.com.<p>
