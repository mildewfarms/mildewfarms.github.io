<h1>New Products</h1><p><p>
<b>Finjan Introduces SurfinShield</b><p>Finjan Software Inc. has introduced SurfinShield Corporate version, a Java and ActiveX security tool that offers centralized security management. Designed for the enterprise, SurfinShield Corporate can be integrated seamlessly into a corporate network configuration, interoperating with other security devices including firewalls and other corporate software distribution products. SurfinShield Corporate is also compatible with gateway security solutions such as Finjan's SurfinGate.<p>
A flexible and scalable solution, SurfinShield Corporate allows different settings for each desktop. Shared experiences are gathered into a database that collects and consolidates Java and ActiveX information from each desktop. A customized log is then created within the system. If one desktop with SurfinShield Corporate faces an attack, the program learns from the experience, and all other networked desktops are updated to automatically eliminate the hostile element. SurfinShield Corporate works at the desktop level to detect any Java applet or ActiveX control that reaches the system. The program continually monitors mobile code behavior during runtime in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that adds an additional layer of protection to the end users' desktop. Depending on the level of security selected, SurfinShield Corporate automatically eliminates any Java or ActiveX element that tries to breach security rules before the code is allowed to do any damage.<p>
For pricing and other information about SurfinShield Corporate, contact <I>Finjan Software Incorporated, 2620 Augustine Dr., #250, Santa Clara, CA 95054; (408) 727-8120; Fax: (408) 727-8528; Internet: info@finjan.com; WWW: http://www.finjan.com.<p>

</I><B>SEM Introduces Three Products</b><p>Security Engineered Machinery has introduced three security document destruction products that erase information, to NSA requirements, on data disks, CD ROMs and magnetic media. The three products are the SEM Model 1200 CD-ROM declassifier, the SEM Model 1090 desk top degausser/eraser, and the SEM Model 1100 Magnetic Media Degaussing Wand.<p>
The Model 1200 CD-ROM declassifier removes data-bearing surfaces in 20 seconds, reducing them to powder. Once a CD-ROM is clean, the powder falls into a drawer at the bottom of the unit. A vacuum module system is also available. The table or desktop unit is 18x15x8 inches, weighs 50 pounds, and requires electricity. The SEM Model 1090 is a desktop degausser/eraser for both Standard Density (325 oersted) and High Density (750+ oersted) media in 5 1/4", 3 1/2", and smaller floppy formats. The degaussing/erasing procedure requires that the operator place the disk into the 1090 front aperture. The fully shielded magnet cleans the disk, which can then be reused. The Model 1090, which requires no power source, is 8 1/4 x 2 1/2 x 4 inches, and weighs five pounds. Erasure level is -90 Db. or better. The SEM Model 1100 Magnetic Media Degaussing Wand erases disk drives, disk packs, drum-type memories, floppies, and flat surface magnetic memory. The erased items can be reused after cleaning. A multi-polar design ensures minimum flux levels of 6,000 gauss and full hysteresis of all magnetic states. The Wand is 7 1/2" long, weighs four ounces, is self-contained, and requires no power source. The Wand is certified by the NSA for all security levels in applications specified.<p>
The Model 1200 CD-ROM declassifier is priced at $4,389 per unit. The Model 1090 desktop degausser/eraser is priced at $902. The Model 1100 Magnetic Media Degaussing Wand is priced at $911.

</I><B>ARCO Announces DupliDisk-PCI</b><p>ARCO Computer Products Inc. has announced DupliDisk-PCI, a driverless disk-mirroring RAID 1 adapter designed for the PCI bus. A hardware-based dual-channel adapter, DupliDisk-PCI mirrors up to two pairs of IDE, E-IDE or U-IDE drives of any capacity. If a hardware failure disables one of the mirrored drives, the DupliDisk-PCI automatically shifts operations to the functioning drive. Visible lights indicate when the drives are working properly. When one fails, an audible alarm alerts the user of the drive failure and continues to sound until manually switched off. There is no interruption of service, and the system continues to function normally until the user can power down and install a new drive.<p>
DupliDisk-PCI is not a primary disk controller but uses ARCO's intermediate adapter technology to provide disk fault tolerance and continuous automatic hard disk backup. Included in DupliDisk is ARCO's ACP software for rebuilding drives and disk preparation. The DupliDisk-PCI connects via a standard IDE cable either to the IDE connector in the PCI motherboard or to an add-in IDE adapter installed in the system. The DupliDisk-PCI operates transparently.<p>
DupliDisk-PCI is operating-system independent and supports UNIX, Linux, NetWare, Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows 3.x, OS/2, and DOS. DupliDisk-PCI is priced at $225.
