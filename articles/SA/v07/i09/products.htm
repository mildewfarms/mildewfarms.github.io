<B>Network Instruments Upgrades Observer</b><p>Network Instruments, LLC has upgraded Observer, its protocol analyzer. Observer version 5.0 adds several features including remote software, Probes, multiple concurrent modes, and an improved user interface. By including fully functioning remote software Probes into Observer 5.0, administrators can use the Observer console to monitor and troubleshoot 252 segments across LANs and WANs.

<B>Schumann Security Announces SAM Request Manager</b><p>Schumann Security Software, Inc. has announced SAM Request Manager (SAM/RM), a workflow system for the security request process. By automating the end users view to security, SAM/RM replaces the traditional paper-based system of IT security requests. According to the company, SAM/RM provides relief to administrators overwhelmed by authorization requests and allows them to concentrate on more critical tasks. SAM/RM includes a window-based GUI. This GUI lets employees initiate requests that are automatically sent for approval. SAM/RM also keeps track of each request, from its current status to its history (the person who created it, who approved it, the date of execution, etc.).<p>
SAM/RM is available as a standalone product or can be connected to Security Administration Manager (SAM), the cross-platform enterprise administration application. When combined with SAM, approved authorization requests are implemented across all connected mainframes, platforms, applications, and systems instantly. The SAM/RM and SAM combination can perform RBAC, in which standard job classifications can be designated for specific levels of access automatically.<p>
For pricing and other information about SAM Request Manager, contact <I>Schumann Security Software, Inc., 8101 Sandy Spring Rd., Suite 301, Laurel, MD 20707; (301) 483-8807; Fax: (301) 483-8349; WWW: http://www.SchumannSoftware.com</I>.<p>
<B>ATL Introduces PL50 Library Hub</b><p>ATL Products, Inc. has introduced the PL50 Library Hub. With the PL50 Library Hub, administrators can connect three UNIX or NT backup servers running any data management software to a single ATL Library. The PL50 Library Hub presents a virtual library partition to each backup server for use as its own dedicated library. The PL50 also provides an alternative to network backup over Ethernet. The PL50 lets each backup server independently take advantage of direct SCSI connection to the library hub and tape drives residing within the ATL library. According to the company, this allows for 20 Mbps Fast-Wide SCSI throughput.<p>
Using the Library Hub's GUI, administrators can add UNIX or NT backup servers. To specify the number of cartridge slots and tape drives required for each server, the user configures the virtual library using point-and-click operations. Robotics commands are routed to the PL50, where they are queued and performed in the sequence they were received.<p>
The PL50 Library Hub supports many ATL libraries, including the 7100 Series, 520 Series, and 2640 Series, and appears to each backup server as a dedicated library transparent to the OS and data management software. Also the PL50 requires no additional purchases, drivers, or special software agents to install or maintain. For pricing and other information about the PL50 Library Hub, contact <I>ATL Products, Inc., 2801 Kelvin Ave., Irvine, CA 92614; (800) 677-6268 or (714) 774-6900; Fax: (714) 477-7799; Internet: atlpsales@atlp.com; WWW: www.atlp.com</I>.<p>
<B>F5 Labs Announces BIG/ip</b><p>F5 Labs, Inc. has announced BIG/ip, a family of dedicated server array controllers that intelligently allocate Internet and Intranet service requests across a group of network servers. Residing between Internet routers and the local server arrays, BIG/ip controllers continually monitor each server for application availability and performance, and automatically direct each service request to the most available server. This availability-based load balancing technology lets administrators balance Web, email, database, FTP, and firewall traffic. The BIG/ip family includes three versions: BIG/ip, an entry-level field-upgradable system; BIG/ip2, a fully redundant system; and BIG/ip3, a Pentium 333 MHz redundant system.<p>
A single BIG/ip simultaneously controls and load balances the following: multiple firewalls with any mix of transparent and non-transparent services; multiple cache servers, supporting clients with any mix of transparent and non-transparent requests; multiple filters with any mix of transparent and non-transparent services; and multiple Web, mail, news services, and other servers. Also BIG/ip directs requests for services to specific groups of servers. If desired, BIG/ip can direct transparent and non-transparent requests to the same or different groups of servers. Specific IP address and port combinations can also be tested to determine if a transparent server is functioning properly.<p>
For pricing and other information about the BIG/ip Server Array Controllers, contact <I>F5 Labs, Inc., 200 First Ave. West, Suite 500, Seattle, WA 98119; (888) 882-4447 or (206) 505-0800; Fax: (206) 505-0801; WWW: www.f5.com</I>.<p>
<B>DNS Boss Announces DNS Boss</b><p>DNS Boss has announced DNS Boss, a software tool that automates the installation and maintenance of DNS and IP addresses. Using a third-generation DNS manager, written as a Java application, DNS Boss turns DNS operations into graphic screens and routine approvals. Using DNS Boss, the administrator needs only four steps to establish a DNS primary. After installation, DNS data becomes live to the rest of the Internet, and propagates to DNS secondaries if they exist.<p>
Features of DNS Boss include automatically incrementing the serial numbers of DNS database files each time an update is made, letting DNS updates run in a "safe mode" so changes can be previewed before they are propagated in the production environment, and letting special entries be appended to DNS databases created by DNS Boss. When an administrator clicks the "update hosts" button, DNS automatically creates forward, reverse, and loopback DNS databases for hundreds of DNS domains; builds a new <B>/etc/named.boot</B>, and restarts <B>/user/sbin/in.named</B>. Also DNS prohibits users from editing actual DNS databases. Changes to DNS databases are allowed only through the controls of the DNS Boss GUI.<p>
DNS Boss runs on SPARC Solaris 2.5-2.6 and Solaris X86 2.5-2.6. According to the company, companies with mixed platforms can use DNS Boss on a PC running Solaris X86 as a DNS server for Windows NT, Windows 95, Linux, Solaris DNS, and Apple clients. Prices for DNS Boss start at $1,000 for up to 10 hosts and depend on the number of DNS hosts served. A 30-day free trial version is available for download at the company's Web site. For more information, contact <I>DNS Boss, WWW: http://www.dnsboss.com</I>.<p>
<B>Cubix Introduces Density Series</b><p>Cubix Corp. has introduced the Density Series Server system, a line of consolidated network servers. A rackmounted server platform, the first Density Series option supports up to four individual Pentium Pro two-way SMP servers. The second Density Series option, supports eight Pentium servers with MMX technology, and the third option combines two dual-SMP and four uni-processing servers.<p>
Features of the Density Series include modular components with cable-less, hot-swappable, plug-in server boards, plug-in hard drives, three hot-swappable power supplies, a muxed floppy drive, and a switched CD-ROM drive. Using electronic switching technology, multiple Density Series servers can be controlled with one monitor, keyboard, and mouse. The Density Series runs Cubix's Windows NT-based Global Vision management software. Using Global Vision, administrators can monitor and manage the servers locally, across the LAN/WAN, via an Internet browser or dialup connection, or remotely. Alerts can be forwarded via email or pager.<p>
The Density Series system with SMP servers is priced from $7,000. The system can be configured with a variety of Intel-based servers. For more information, contact <I>Cubix Corporation, 2800 Lockheed Way, Carson City, NV 89706; (702) 888-1000; Fax: (702) 888-1001;WWW: http://www.cubix.com</I>.<p>
