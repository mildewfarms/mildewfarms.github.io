<H1>Sidebar : Raid Overview</H1><p><p>
There are many different levels of RAID. I will briefly discuss a few of them. See the article by Gilbert Held in the February 1998 issue of Sys Admin for a more complete discussion.<p>
<B>RAID Level 0</b><p>RAID level 0 is known as striping. This is where data (raw or file system) is spread across multiple drives.<p>
<B>Pros:</B>  Fast (data striping allows for I/O load balancing across the drives in a volume) and cheap (if you need 10 GB of storage, you buy 10 GB of storage).<p>
<B>Cons:</B>  No fault tolerance. If you have 20 GB spread across 5 drives and you lose 1 drive, then you lose all of your data.<p>
<B>RAID Level 1</b><p>RAID level 1 is data mirroring. Each disk has an exact duplicate.<p>
<B>Pros:</B>  Benefits of full data redundancy without the overhead of parity. Increased throughput on reads due to load balancing across mirrored drives.<p>
<B>Cons</B>:  Decreased throughput on writes, since the mirror write must be completed before the write is considered complete (maskable with the proper amount and type of cache). 50% loss of actual drive capacity due to mirroring.<p>
<B>RAID Level 5</b><p>RAID level 5 is striped, interleaved parity (parity is spread across all of the drives in the volume).<p>
<B>Pros:</B>  Fault tolerance (if one drive dies, then the data can be accessed from the parity on the remaining drives) and increase throughput due to striping. Only using N+1 drives to achieve effective capacity of N drives. Good balance of fault tolerance and speed for OLTP database applications. Parity is also striped across the drives in the volume to avoid the bottleneck of a dedicated parity drive as used in RAID level 3.<p>
<B>Cons:</B>  Write penalty on throughput due to parity processing (maskable with the proper amount and type of cache). Fault tolerance is limited to the loss of one drive.<p>
<B>RAID Level 10</b><p>RAID level 10 (also known as RAID level 0+1 or RAID level 1+0) is striped mirrors. This provides the most fault tolerant solution and is usually faster than other RAID levels.<p>
<B>Pros:</B> Benefits of full data redundancy without overhead of parity and increased throughput optimization due to striping. Loss of up to 50% of the drives is acceptable.<p>
<B>Cons:</B> 50% loss of actual drive capacity due to mirroring.
