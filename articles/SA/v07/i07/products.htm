<h1>New Products</h1><p><p>
<b>Network Instruments Releases Observer 5.0</b><p>Network Instruments, LLC has released Observer 5.0, its protocol analyzer. Features include: probing remote software, multiple concurrent modes, an improved user interface, and additional decodes. By including Probes, administrators can use the Observer console to monitor and troubleshoot 252 segments across any LAN or WAN. With the Distributed Observer license, a user receives one remote probe, letting the user collect data from a remote segment in addition to the local segment to which Observer is connected.<p>
The multiple-mode interface lets administrators track several network monitoring conditions and segments concurrently. By running multiple simultaneous modes, an administrator can watch for an event with high-level mode. After the event occurs, the administrator can drill down using a low-level mode to see what actually occurred.<p>
Observer 5.0's user interface has been updated to include more intuitive controls. All graphs and modes are configurable with a right mouse click. Observer 5.0 also includes several new decodes. These include: IPv6, OSPF/RIPv2/BGP, Full SMB, HTTP/SMTP/POP3/IMAP, MNTP, DNS/BOOTP/DHCP, and Banyan Vines.<p>
Other features of Observer 5.0 include a dashboard showing current LAN conditions and local/probe PC processor utilization, partial packet captures, and a probe communication trace window. Observer 5.0 has also added a display of alias/hard/IP addresses in all modes, a consistent and configurable button bar for all modes, more configurable protocols and IP services, filtering by IP address, and NE2000 NDIS drivers for low-level Ethernet errors.<p>
Observer 5.0 supports UNIX, NetWare, Windows NT, Windows 95/98, DEC, Macintosh, IBM networks, Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI. Observer 5.0 is priced at $695. Distributed Observer is priced at $995 for one local and one remote Probe. Additional Probes are priced at $295 each.

</I><B>Aurora Introduces ControlTower Console Management Software</b><p>Aurora Technologies Inc. has introduced ControlTower console management software. Aurora ControlTower supports monitoring and controlling multiple SPARC Solaris systems from one location. ControlTower enables a single SPARC server to function as a common console (monitor and keyboard) for up to 128 managed systems. Any function that can be performed from a keyboard and monitor directly connected to a system can be performed from the console manager server, including monitoring log files, running diagnostics, and rebooting a system. Additionally, a time-stamped log of system messages from each managed system is maintained on the console manager to assist in analyzing system problems.<p>
Using ControlTower viewer software (included with the product), the console manager server can be accessed via a TCP/IP network or modem link. Managed systems in one or more physical locations can be administered from a remote location. The viewer software can be installed at multiple sites to allow coordination among multiple administrators.<p>
ControlTower console manager software runs on a Sun SPARC server or compatible running Solaris 2.5 or higher. Managed systems can be SPARC Solaris compatible servers or other UNIX servers that support a serial line console. Managed systems are connected to the host server via a RS-232 serial interface from the console port. ControlTower console manager software must be used with an Aurora multiport serial controller for optimum performance and reliability. Aurora provides Sbus and PCI-bus multiport serial controllers with break signal protection of managed systems. The serial controllers can handle up to 128 serial connects to a console manager server system slot.<p>
Aurora ControlTower console manager software is sold under a host-ID license agreement and is offered in three versions. The small user edition supports up to 16 managed systems from one host system; list price is $5000. The standard edition supports up to 128 managed systems; list price is $7500.
