<H1>10 Steps to Becoming a UNIX Administrator<p>
</H1><p>Russ Hill<p>
Notwithstanding the level of coverage given to Windows NT by the popular press, UNIX systems stand at the core of most mid-sized and large organizations. These systems run everything from mission-critical database applications to dazzling Web sites. The task of keeping these systems humming falls on the shoulders of the UNIX systems administrator. While the job description for a UNIX systems administrator may vary between organizations, the job carries a fair degree of respect within the industry; is often harried, but satisfying; and is reasonably well-paid. Becoming a UNIX systems administrator is thus a career goal worth striving for. Getting there, however, can be a challenge. This article is dedicated to the casual or first-time reader of the magazine who has not yet reached wizard status, but could use a little help on how to get there. <p>
UNIX system administration is one of the few master/apprentice jobs still in existence, much like the old apothecary in medieval times. Usually, on-the-job training for a new apprentice is about the only training offered. Most organizations cannot afford to have a sys admin out for a week of vacation, much less for several week-long training sessions. However, times are changing. UNIX administration is now being taught at schools and employers now emphasize academic credentials and certification. The apprenticeship method of training, however, has produced many skilled administrators in the market place. Employers are starting to realize that the background, self-training, and the expected job performance is difficult to maintain for any system administrator. System administration is starting to be considered a career path, and professional salaries are beginning to be more consistent with the level of the skills required.<p>
For those who have not yet obtained the wizard's wand of a UNIX system administrator, here are 10 steps toward achieving that goal:<p>
<B>1. Learn UNIX Basics</b><p>Learn at least 80 basic commands of the UNIX system (for example, <B>cp</B>, and <B>mv</B>).
