<h1>New Products</h1><p><p>
<b>Syntax Announces TAS v5.2</b><p>Syntax, Inc. has announced TotalNET Advanced Server (TAS) v5.2. TAS is network operating system software that lets a UNIX server act as a file, print, and application server to a variety of client PCs in a heterogeneous, networked environment. TAS gives Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows for Workgroups, Macintosh, OS/2 Warp, and DOS clients access to the same UNIX file, print, and server resources through each client's desktop interface. TAS is delivered as an Intranet server, letting an administrator install and configure TAS using a standard HTML-based GUI known as TotalAdmin. TAS v5.2 includes new features and improvements to the TotalAdmin GUI including frames, Java technology, and distributed administration. TotalAdmin also administers all TAS servers in the enterprise with a single login and facilitates the optional installation of modules or "spheres".<p>
TAS v5.2 also provides unified mapping of file names across services for UNIX, NetWare, SMB (Windows 3.x, 95, NT, and OS/2), and Macintosh. TAS maps files with pure case insensitivity and case preservation. Additional TAS v5.2 features include: performance tuning, modifications to device drivers, network utilities, tracing, and support for outbound Macintosh printer (PAP) connections.<p>
For pricing and other information about TotalNET Advanced Server v5.2, contact <I>Syntax, Inc., 840 S. 333rd St., Federal Way, WA 98003; (253) 838-2626; Fax: (253) 838-9836; WWW: http://www.syntax.com.<p>
</I><B>Trend Micro Introduces Two ScanMail Products</b><p>Trend Micro Inc. has introduced two virus protection products, ScanMail 2.0 for cc:Mail and ScanMail 1.5 for Lotus Notes. The first product, ScanMail 2.0 for cc:Mail, includes a 32-bit management utility, giving administrators the ability to centrally configure manual, scheduled, and real-time scanning of individual or multiple Post Offices within a LAN. Additionally, the administrator can configure cc:Mail to scan all users' in-boxes, mail containers, or personal folders from one central console.

</I><B>I/O Announces Fingerprint Preboot Security System</b><p>I/O Software, Inc., has announced a fingerprint-based preboot security system designed to provide preboot PC security through ROM-based software. The preboot security system requires the user's fingerprint to be verified before allowing the computer to boot, preventing unauthorized access even before the operating system is loaded.<p>
The security system is based on Sony's Fingerprint Identification Unit (FIU) which is a small self-contained fingerprint scanner. The system is installed by plugging the FIU into a serial port, and enabling the BIOS extension. Access to information on the floppy drive and hard drive is then blocked without the correct fingerprint. Since the code is contained in the system BIOS, the preboot security system supports any operating system including UNIX, Windows 95/NT, and DOS.<p>
Features of the preboot security system include: support for username/password; username/fingerprint/password verification; user management through a menu system and a Windows application: selectable number of retries; and a selectable fingerprint matching strictness level. Additionally, the preboot security system remembers the last user who started the computer and keeps a chronological history of who logged on when. Other features of the preboot security system include data backup support, a tampering check counter, and a DES update option. Also, 64 users can be enrolled in the preboot security system per computer.<p>
For pricing and other information about the preboot security system, contact <I>I/O Software, Inc., 1533 Spruce St., Riverside, CA 92507; (909) 222-7600; Fax: (909) 222-7601; WWW: http://www.iosoftware.com.<p>
</I><B>Century Releases TinyTERM 4.0</b><p>Century Software announces the release of version 4.0 of TinyTERM and TERM Professional PC-to-UNIX connectivity software. The release is expected in late May 1998 and will include the following new features: the introduction of MS Office integration, which allows users to seamlessly and transparently send data to a remote host. Users will be able to transfer files simply by pressing a Century button on the tool bar of an MS Office application and choosing a destination from the Century Address Book.<p>
TinyTERM and TERM can now be used from within Netscape or Explorer.  Hosted inside of the browser, TinyTERM can connect customers to their mission-critical host applications from within a browser.<p>
Version 4.0 takes full advantage of the PC's graphical capabilities by "revamping" text-based applications with a familiar Windows interface. This technology improves the look of programs running under terminal emulation and adds dimension to flat character-based applications without modifying existing legacy code.<p>
Century's new Dialog Editor provides a simple drag-and-drop interface for dialog creation. It allows creation of new standard dialogs, tab dialogs and wizards by simply dragging and dropping controls onto the screen. The Dialog Editor provides a tool bar with the most common visual controls, allowing users to import their own specialized visual custom controls.<p>

</I><B>Retrieve Launches Pacemaker</b><p>Retrieve, Inc. has launched Pacemaker, a high-speed data-sharing tool for SCSI and Fibre Channel. Pacemaker is an external appliance for data sharing on a RAID device between Sun Solaris and/or Windows NT hosts. Data can be accessed directly from either computer. Pacemaker connects to the host computers through SCSI or FibreChannel using the existing host disk drives. The system is administered from a built-in Web management interface letting most computers on the network control and monitor Pacemaker.<p>
RAID technology requires storage to be partitioned off for use by different hosts before any data is stored. Pacemaker eliminates this and lets each host take what it needs, when it needs it. Storage not being used by one host is also available to the others. Pacemaker offloads the data compression and decompression process to the storage subsystem. The server transfers the data then processes other functions. Pacemaker then does the compression for the hosts.<p>
For pricing and other information about Pacemaker, contact <I>Retrieve, Inc., 3080 Valmont Rd., Suite 220, Boulder, CO 80301, (303) 448-9029: WWW: www.retrieveinc.com.<p>
