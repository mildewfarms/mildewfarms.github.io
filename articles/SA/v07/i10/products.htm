</I><B>SolutionSoft Systems Announces Time Machine for HP-UX, SUN Solaris, IBM AIX, and NCR MP-RAS</b><p>SolutionSoft Systems has announced Time Machine for HP-UX, SUN Solaris, IBM AIX, and NCR MP-RAS. Time Machine supports year 2000 discovery, testing, and certification. Time Machine allows an application to "travel through time" by returning a specified date or time whenever the application gets the system time. Because the system clock is not actually changed, only applications with which Time Machine is used are affected. Each application can travel to a different point in time by specifying a different date or time, so it is possible to simultaneously test a month-end application on 7/31/2000 and a year-end application on 12/31/2000, while normal system processing is running on the current date and time.<p>
For a free demo or more information, contact <I>SolutionSoft Systems, Inc.; (888) 884-7337; (408) 988-7378; Fax: (408) 988-4777; WWW: http://www.solution-soft.com.<p>
