<h1>New Products</h1><p>
<b>TriTeal Ships WinTED 3.0</b><p>TriTeal Corp. has begun shipping WinTED 3.0, which lets a Windows client access, execute, and display UNIX applications and files as if they were within a native Windows environment. Additionally, WinTED 3.0 provides automatic desktop integration of remote servers, giving the user access to multiple UNIX and NT network resources directly from the Windows desktop. WinTED 3.0 includes the Application Integrator, which automatically gathers applications, file types, and icon data from multiple UNIX-hosts and integrates that data into the Windows Start and Explorer menus. This enables users to store and launch UNIX applications and files from their Windows desktop.<p>
WinTED's Front Panel provides a toolbar for launching applications, with support for both large and small icons, configurable hot-keys, and auto-dock and auto-rotate capabilities. The Front Panel also includes TriTeal's Graphical Workspace Manager (GWM), a desktop multiplier/manager that provides up to 16 full functioning desktops. The GWM normally resides in the Front Panel, but can be relocated anywhere on the desktop. An Application Manager utility provides a single window containing all running applications and the ability to move or copy those applications to other workspaces.<p>
TEDfs, an optional component available with WinTED, allows for file and print sharing between UNIX and Windows systems. TEDfs provides enhanced user authentication permitting easier file sharing with greater security for a cross-platform environment.<p>
WinTED 3.0 is priced at $248.00 and supports the following UNIX platforms: Solaris 2.5, 2.6, HP-UX 10.20, AIX 4.1.3, 4.2.1, IRIX 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and SunOS 4.1.3, 4.1.4. Free evaluation software is available from the WinTED Web page at: <B>http://www.triteal.com/WinTED</B>. For more information about WinTED 3.0 contact, <I>TriTeal Corporation, 2011 Palomar Airport Road, Carlsbad, CA 92009-1431; (760) 930-2077; (760) 930-2081; Internet: info@triteal.com.<p>
</I><B>Open Systems Management Supports Cross-Platform Print and Schedule Management</b><p>Open Systems Management Inc. has announced COSbatch and COSprint, job-scheduling and print management tools, designed to manage both UNIX and NT system operations from a single interface and a single console.

</I><B>Network Instruments Announces NetSense for Observer</b><p>Network Instruments, LLC has announced NetSense for Observer, a module that adds Expert Modes and modeling features to Observer and Distributed Observer protocol analyzers. NetSense, from Network Instruments' OEM Net3 Group, is a software application that performs expert post-capture packet transaction analysis of network protocols.<p>
NetSense for Observer includes an Expert Mode post-capture problem analysis feature, which enables administrators to quickly sort through Observer capture files to pinpoint problems and report them in the Packet Visualizer(tm). The Packet Visualizer component provides unique insights in protocol operation by displaying packets in a spatial fashion, allowing the administrator to easily see packet sizes and the delay between them.<p>
Administrators can also use NetSense for Observer's Client/Server Expert Mode to discover client/server conversations automatically. A display provides administrators with Expert analysis statistics, including low throughput, slow response times, busy network or server, inefficient client, and transport retransmission data.<p>
Support for "What If" modeling analysis in NetSense for Observer allows an administrator to perform load and response time analysis under a variety of scenarios. "What If" modeling begins with a calculated set of measurements based on the user's packet data, and then predicts load and response time resulting from changed variables such as average packet size, send-to-receive packet ratio, latency, server load, and more.<p>
NetSense for Observer supports Microsoft Windows 95, 98, and NT 4.x as well as Observer 4.x or greater. NetSense for Observer is priced at $495, and licensed for one PC on one LAN at one site. A separate license is required for portable use. For more information, contact <I>Network Instruments, Minneapolis, MN; (612) 932-9899; WWW: http://www.networkinstruments.com.<p>
</I><B>Diamond Optimum Systems Upgrades Configuration Management Software</b><p>Diamond Optimum Systems has announced Diamond CM 5.1.6, an upgrade of their software configuration management system. Diamond CM 5.1.6 includes a redesigned graphical user interface and a Java version for enhanced remote access and portability. The latest version of Diamond CM was designed to meet the needs of organizations involved in software development with multiple sites and multiple platforms, including UNIX and Microsoft Windows. Diamond CM features include software inventory/impact analysis, version control, process flow, file/project promotion, build management, programming editor, software distribution, general control, audit trail, system security, client/server architecture, implementation script, and a Windows-based GUI.<p>
Diamond CM can identify all programs using a particular table, variable, or subroutine, allowing for project scoping and workload estimates. Diamond CM's version control feature lets users maintain the controlled files on distributed, heterogeneous hosts. Diamond CM distributes custom or commercial software to the end-users, supports both ASCII and binary file types, and can package files into projects and distribute them to heterogeneous platforms. Diamond CM also supports scheduled push/pull distribution and maintains a comprehensive audit trail of distribution activities.<p>
Platforms supported by Diamond CM are Hewlett-Packard (HP-UX, MPE/iX), IBM (AIX), Sun (SunOS, Solaris), and Intel (MS Windows 95, NT). Diamond Optimum Systems provides 24-hour, seven-day a week support by phone and the Internet, on-site training and consulting, system implementation and configuration, and regularly scheduled updates.

</I><B>Netron Announces Netron Distributed System Solution</b><p>Netron Inc. has announced the Netron Distributed Systems Solution, a package of product components and services for integrating the Internet and multi-tier client/server into existing systems. The Netron Distributed Systems Solutions combines Netron consulting services with re-use technologies including Netron Fusion, the Netron Connectivity Framework, and Netron Renovator. Consulting services bundled into the Netron Distributed Systems Solution include scoping, architecture design, architecture customization, project management, and frameworks implementation.<p>
The Netron Connectivity Framework, the core of the solution, automates the development of components that connect different client technologies, such as Visual Basic and Java, to Cobol servers. Because the methods used by Java, Visual Basic, and Cobol to format data are not compatible, it takes additional work to get them to communicate with each other. When changes are made to either the client or server, resynchronization is also an issue. By automating these processes, Netron's solution addresses both problems. Also Netron's open framework architecture can be extended and made to work with any middleware. If a customer has not implemented a middleware standard, Netron's solution can generate the connection directly.<p>
For pricing and other information about Netron Distributed Systems Solution, contact <I>Netron Inc., Toronto, Canada; (416) 636-8334.<p>
</I><B>ULTRABAC.COM Releases UltraBac 5.0</b><p>ULTRABAC.COM has released UltraBac 5.0 (UB5.0) with Universal Disaster recovery Diskette Option for both Intel and Alpha Windows NT users. UB5.0 with Universal Diskette DR offers disk-to-disk or tape-to-tape restores in a matter of minutes. Using UB5.0, every NT system can have an identical copy of its operating system disk in a form called an "Image" so that it can be properly restored from either a bootable standby system disk or an offline tape in the event of an unbootable system disk crash.
