            <i>Sys Admin</i>'s January issue has traditionally been our 
              featured Linux or Open Source issue. This year is no exception, 
              and the current articles examine a nice mix of Linux and Open Source 
              tools. In particular, this issue contains an article by &AElig;leen 
              Frisch, author of <i>Essential System Administration</i> (3rd Ed., 
              O'Reilly &amp; Associates), an invaluable reference book for 
              sys admins. In her article, Frisch demonstrates some interesting 
              search methods that can be applied when grep won't do the trick. 
              Also in this issue, Evan Sarmiento explores some methods for debugging 
              the Linux kernel and Scott Delinger shows how to automate Linux 
              installs to speed cluster construction.
            <p> You may also notice a special section devoted to vendor-sponsored 
              technology papers. This new section includes papers on topics such 
              as: Apache-based Web Servers for the Itanium Architecture, and Linux 
              for the Internet Infrastructure from HP; Teach Your Servers Self-Defense, 
              from Cylant; and Agentless Monitoring, from Freshwater Software. 
              If you find these technology papers useful, please let us (or the 
              vendor) know. We hope to continue to provide this type of information 
              in future issues.
            <p> And, just in time for holiday shopping, we've released Version 
              8 of the <i>Sys Admin</i> CD-ROM, which includes complete articles 
              and code from <i>Sys Admin</i>'s premiere issue in 1992 through 
              December of 2002. It also includes <i>The Perl Journal</i> archives 
              from 1996 through 2002. As always, we offer both HTML and ASCII 
              versions of the articles on the CD. Note that a few of the articles 
              do not appear on the CD either because we couldn't track down 
              the authors to request permission or because they chose not to have 
              their content included. The CD can be ordered online through the 
              <i>Sys Admin</i> Web site for $49.95 ($24.95 for registered owners 
              of the previous version).
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
