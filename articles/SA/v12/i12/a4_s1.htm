            <h1><b>Managing the Snapshots</b></h1>
            <p> Taking, and in general, handling the snapshots involves another 
              set of tasks, which typically require a privileged user. The scripts 
              must create, mount, and delete the snapshots. In some cases at my 
              site, a scheduler that is not managed by the sys admin or root runs 
              the backups. For this reason, I incorporated the "sudo" tool (<b>http://www.sudo.ws</b>) 
              into the scripts.
            <p> If you are running the scripts from root's crontab, or manually 
              via an admin, you might decide to avoid this. To do so, just modify 
              the "sudo" variable to be blank. Yet another approach would be to 
              use Sun's Role Based Access Control.
            <p> We used the following options during the taking of the snapshot: 
              backing-store-name, backing-store-limit, and chunk size. The script 
              handles this by using the defined "snapfs" filesystem and generating 
              a descriptive name; no limit is specified, and the chunk size is 
              specified to that of an Oracle logical block. The backing store 
              file name looks similar to other temporary file names containing 
              date, time, file system, and other information, and it can be useful 
              during the initial setup of the tools.
            <p> I recommend (and the scripts specify) no limit when using a "private" 
              snapshot filesystem because any limit can cause an artificial problem 
              under these circumstances. If you have to use a "public" filesystem, 
              you should read about snapshots before using them, and you will 
              probably want to consider limits. As for the chunk size -- the man 
              pages define this as the granularity of which filesystem blocks 
              are copied. The default is four times the filesystem block size.
            <p> If you take the default, it probably won't be the same as an Oracle 
              logical block, and you may wind up wasting space during a copy-on-write. 
              Thus, the script queries the database for its logical block size 
              and then sets the chunk size equal to that.
            <p> When using UFS snapshots, you must be aware of how much buffer 
              cache is allocated for use. By default, the limit is 2% of the available 
              physical memory, and you modify this by specifying the "bufhmw" 
              parameter in the /etc/system file. This parameter is in kilobytes 
              and requires a reboot to change; if you are unfamiliar with the 
              details, I recommend using the default.
