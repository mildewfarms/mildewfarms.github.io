            <p> It's December, which means we can take a look back at the year 
              and see how far we've come. <i>Sys Admin</i> has again weathered 
              some stormy industry lows and fierce economic challenges. Again, 
              we've watched sister magazines fold and witnessed colleagues laid 
              off. The fact that it's December, however, also means we can put 
              this difficult year behind us and look toward the year ahead.
            <p> When budgeting and brainstorming for the coming year, the question 
              is asked whether we must plan to survive or plan to succeed. I vote 
              for the latter. As the economy recovers, we should all be poised 
              to take full advantage of it. Operating in survival mode and simply 
              reacting to crises may be necessary sometimes, but it's also short 
              sighted. One of the goals of this magazine is to take a longer view 
              of systems administration and provide tools and information to help 
              you succeed.
            <p> To that end, a couple of specific articles in this issue provide 
              information on which to build. Cameron Laird begins a series on 
              Python with an article called "Python in Systems Administration: 
              Part I -- Better Scripting". In this article, Laird says he finds 
              Python "so capable and easy to learn" that he tells newcomers it's 
              the best single language to choose. Within the next several issues, 
              Laird will support this view by providing an introduction to the 
              Python language, discussing the "scripting mentality", and presenting 
              many practical examples of how sys admins can put Python to use.
            <p> This issue's short, pull-out Solaris administration supplement 
              features an article by Justin Buhler and Adrian Cockcroft that provides 
              tips for doing capacity planning. The authors introduce key principles 
              and tools (specifically the SE Toolkit and Orca) and show how to 
              apply those principles and use the tools to obtain a visual representation 
              of your servers and applications that will give you a better understanding 
              of the capacity of your system.
            <p> <i>Sys Admin</i> is always looking for articles that can help 
              you tweak your systems, sharpen your scripting skills, and build 
              a plan to succeed. We're looking for articles on advanced administration 
              topics, and the issue themes for the next few months include Security, 
              Performance Tuning, Storage, and Networking. If you have tips for 
              success in these or other areas, share that knowledge with your 
              peers through an article in <i>Sys Admin</i>. Please send article 
              proposals to <i>Sys Admin</i>'s managing editor, Rikki Endsley at: 
              <b>rendsley@cmp.com</b>. As always, you can send feedback and suggestions 
              to me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
