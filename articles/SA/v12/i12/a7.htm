            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm on a Solaris machine running 
              5.8, and I'm trying to capture some information with <b>ps</b>. 
              Something keeps going awry with a job in the middle of the night, 
              and I want to verify which arguments were passed to the command. 
              I've been using <b>ps -ef</b>, but that seems to truncate the output.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> /usr/bin/ps will pull up to 80 
              unmodified characters straight from the kernel but stop there. The 
              other caveat is that /usr/bin/ps separates the arguments by spaces, 
              so if you had embedded spaces in the command line, it would be impossible 
              to tell from looking at the <b>ps</b> output.
            <p> If you've installed SUNWscpux (or SUNWscpu if you're not on a 
              64-bit machine), you may want to try /usr/ucb/ps. If you give it 
              enough w flags (they're cumulative), /usr/ucb/ps auwww will show 
              all args, as modified by the process and stored in /proc. Programs 
              like sendmail modify their arguments, though, so this may not give 
              you exactly what you're looking for, either.
            <p> Solaris 9 contains a program called pargs in SUNWesu/SUNWesux 
              that will examine a process or core file and print the program's 
              arguments and environment variables and values.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running BIND 9.2.2, and I'm 
              trying to lock down security on my zones via the named.conf configuration 
              file. I want to ensure that transfers are only allowed from hosts 
              that match a certain IP and that have a matching TSIG key. I can 
              easily do one or the other, but I can't seem to AND them together. 
              Here's a snippet of my config file:
            <p> 
            <pre>
include "keys.txt";

acl slaves {
  10.2.1.1;
};

acl notslaves { ! slaves; };

options {
  directory "/etc/named";
  listen-on { 10.1.1.1; };
  allow-transfer { ! notslaves; key tsigkey; };
};
</pre>
            So, based on this, zone transfers should happen only if the request 
            comes from 10.2.1.1 and has the correct TSIG key. What I see is that 
            10.2.1.1 can transfer without a TSIG key. If I reverse the order to:
            <p> 
            <pre>
allow-transfer {  key tsigkey; ! notslaves; };
</pre>
            then anyone with the key can initiate a transfer. How do I AND them 
            so that BOTH are required?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> BIND processes the checks in 
              order and then stops when it finds a match. If you want to make 
              sure that both requirements are met, you can do so by changing your 
              notslaves acl:
            <p> 
            <pre>
include "keys.txt";

acl slaves {
  10.2.1.1;
};

acl notslaves { ! slaves; any; };

options {
  directory "/etc/named";
  listen-on { 10.1.1.1; };
  allow-transfer { ! notslaves; key tsigkey; };
  };</pre>

            I double-checked the documentation, and client_name should be a valid 
            variable from which I can extract information. Why is sendmail refusing 
            to give me the name/address of the offending host?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Your problem is that you used 
              parentheses instead of braces when you specified client_name. You 
              want "$&amp;{client_name}" not "$&amp;(client_name)".
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just acquired a Sun Blade 
              100 that I'm setting up as a headless box in the machine room. Sun's 
              default serial baud rate is 9600, but I know it can go up to 38400. 
              I've tried changing this in /etc/ttydefs, but it doesn't seem to 
              work properly. I know it's not the other end (a console server), 
              because I can get other machines to connect to the exact same port 
              at the higher speed, and I can get the Sun to connect to the port 
              at 9600.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> To begin, I recommend against 
              setting the console speed to something non-standard unless you're 
              documenting it well. You don't actually list what errors or incorrect 
              behavior you experienced, but there are multiple places where the 
              console speed must be changed so that the serial port speed is consistent 
              throughout all of the states the machine could be in.
            <p> You said you've changed /etc/ttydefs, which should now have:
            <p> 
            <pre>
console:38400 hupcl opost onlcr:38400::console
</pre>
            instead of:
            <p> 
            <pre>
console:9600 hupcl opost onlcr:9600::console
</pre>
            This modifies the port speed after the machine is done booting and 
            init spawns ttymon. At any point before this, you're still going to 
            be at the wrong speed.
            <p> You must also change the OpenBoot ttya-mode setting so that the 
              serial port speed is correct before the kernel loads (while you're 
              at the OBP, for example). From a running system:
            <p> 
            <pre>
eeprom ttya-mode=38400,8,n,1,-
</pre>
            You can also drop to the OBP and set it there with:
            <p> 
            <pre>
setenv ttya-mode 38400,8,n,1,-
</pre>
            Additionally, /kernel/drv/options.conf and /etc/ioctl.syscon contain 
            output in stty -g format. The former specifies the port speed after 
            the kernel is loaded, and the latter specifies it after init starts 
            running, but before ttymon is spawned. The easiest way to change these 
            two files is to modify /etc/ttydefs and the eeprom data first and 
            then reboot. Next, log in as root on the console, making sure that 
            root has no stty information in any of its login resource files. Save 
            the current stty information by running:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/bin/stty -g &gt; /tmp/stty
</pre>
            Create backup copies of /kernel/drv/options.conf and /etc/ioctl.syscon. 
            In /kernel/drv/options.conf, replace the information between the quotes 
            with the contents of /tmp/stty:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ttymodes="2502:1805:bd:8a3b:3:1c:7f:15:4:0:0:0:11:13:1a:19:12:f:17:16";
</pre>
            You can then just mv /tmp/stty over the old /etc/ioctl.syscon. To 
            make sure that everything was modified correctly, power off the machine 
            with init 5 and then watch the boot sequence after the machine is 
            powered back on.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE, 
              and I want to build something from the ports directory using different 
              configuration options. I tried editing the makefiles in the src 
              directory, but they seem to get overwritten every time I try the 
              build. I suppose I could just make the package from scratch, but 
              I'd rather have it listed in the package database so it's easy to 
              update/remove/reinstall later.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Generally, the best way to modify 
              the configuration options is to do so on the command line while 
              you're making the port in question. If you're making modifications 
              from the command line (this assumes a Bourne-like shell), you can 
              either override the existing configuration options:
            <p> 
            <pre>
CONFIGURE_ARGS="--opt1=arg --opt2" make install
</pre>
            or you can append to them:
            <p> 
            <pre>
make CONFIGURE_ARGS="--opt1=arg --opt2"
</pre>
            You can also edit the port's Makefile directly (e.g., /usr/ports/lang/perl5.8/Makefile) 
            before you run make, but be aware that your modified Makefile will 
            likely be overwritten by your next cvsup.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a couple of Netra T1 105s 
              running Solaris 8 that are both attached to the same external disk 
              pack. I'm using SDS to set up a JBOD RAID on this disk pack. I want 
              to set up a poor man's failover and mount the disk pack on the second 
              machine if the first one should fail. I know I could purchase software 
              from Sun, but I need to do this on the cheap. I'm just not sure 
              where to start...
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> What you want to accomplish is 
              possible, but it's not supported by Sun. You want to create (using 
              the <b>metaset</b> command) a diskset, an SDS object that can be 
              shared exclusively and non-concurrently by two hosts. To get started, 
              take a look at the SDS 4.2.1 User's Guide:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/806-3205
</pre>
            If you want a Sun-supported configuration, you need to use Sun Cluster 
            as well.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I get a bunch of spam that has 
              no To: address, so I thought I'd whip up a sendmail ruleset to reject 
              such mail. I thought it would be pretty trivial, since there already 
              appears to be a mechanism to check the To: header, but it doesn't 
              seem to be working. I'm running 8.12.9, and here's the important 
              part of my mc:
            <p> 
            <pre>
HTo:                  $&gt;CheckTo
SCheckTo
R$@     $#error $@ 5.7.1 $: "554 ERROR: No user specified."
</pre>
            The mail comes through with a blank To: header every time I try to 
            test, so I'm guessing that I wrote my ruleset wrong. Could you point 
            out where my mistake is?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There is no mistake in your rule 
              per se, but there is a bug with sendmail. From the KNOWNBUGS file 
              in the sendmail source tree:
            <p> Header checks are not called if header value is too long or empty.
            <p> If the value of a header is longer than 1250 (MAXNAME + MAXATOM 
              - 6) characters or it contains a single word longer than 256 (MAXNAME) 
              characters then no header check is done even if one is configured 
              for the header.
            <p> Until that bug gets fixed, your best bet is to use a milter or, 
              if you'd rather separate it completely from sendmail, procmail. 
              The procmail rule to send messages with empty or space-filled To: 
              headers to /dev/null would be:
            <p> 
            <pre>

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've been administering DNS for quite 
            a few years now, but I recently came across a term I had never heard 
            before, and I was wondering whether you could provide a definition/example. 
            The term was "in bailiwick," and it seemed to have something to do 
            with nameservers.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The reason you haven't heard 
              this term before is probably because the only place it's generally 
              used is in reference to djbdns or DJBs arguments against DNAME and 
              A6. If you've mainly used BIND (or something else), then it's unlikely 
              you would ever come across this term. As far as I know, there is 
              no formal definition for the term. My interpretation is that your 
              bailiwick is the realm of things (a domain, for example) over which 
              you have control. The common usage of the phrase is along the lines 
              of "keeping at least one name server for a domain in bailiwick," 
              meaning that the nameserver for my.domain should be contained within 
              my.domain (e.g., ns1.my.domain).
            <p> There seem to be two main reasons for keeping a nameserver in 
              bailiwick: speed and security. If the nameserver for my.domain is 
              located in this.otherdomain, trust is spread out and more points 
              of exposure are added to equation. Also, every out of bailiwick 
              reference creates an opportunity for a loop. In regard to speed, 
              each out of bailiwick reference means more queries per lookup and 
              more opportunities for delay. Also, caches must limit the number 
              of queries and the amount of memory per lookup. Time or memory could 
              be exceeded before that lookup is successfully completed.

            a PDC. I need to add users that end in $, but the adduser script keeps 
            telling me that this is not a valid username. I've seen this done 
            before, so I know it's possible, but I'm not sure whether there's 
            some additional argument I need to pass to adduser or what.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can add users that end in 
              $ by using vipw instead of adduser, or you can modify /etc/adduser.conf 
              to let adduser know that the username you're trying to enter is 
              valid. /etc/adduser.conf contains a regular expression, usernameregexp, 
              that usernames are checked against. The default is:
            <p> 
            <pre>
usernameregexp = '^[a-z0-9_][a-z0-9_-]*$'
