            <h1><b><img src="a5.gif" width="200" height="167" align="right">Monitoring 
              Latency with Smokeping</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Bill Kramp</i>
            <p> Smokeping is a great tool that complements the traditional ping 
              utility. Ping will quickly show whether a server is up and how fast 
              it is responding, but ping does not provide a way to study the round 
              trip time (RTT) -- the latency of the connection to the server 
              over a time interval. Smokeping, however, writes latency information 
              into a database. The smokeping program sends many requests during 
              each polling period to the network device and records the response 
              times. Smokeping can use pings, http requests, or SMTP requests 
              to the server or network service to collect the latency information. 
              This data can then be viewed with a browser to show the latency 
              for the network service. The graphs can also show the latency distribution 
              for each sample period.
            <p> Smokeping consists of two main parts:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> Smokeping -- The program that tests network devices and 
                records latency information in the database. 
              <li> smokeping.cgi -- A script that displays latency information.
            </ul>
            <p> Smokeping usually runs with a polling period of 5 minutes to collect 
              the latency to the network services. It reads a configuration file 
              that details the network server and service to test. The default 
              setting is to send 20 requests during each polling period to the 
              devices defined in the configuration file.
            <p> All of the data is collected and stored using the Round Robin 
              Database (RRD). RRD will probably be familiar to people who use 
              MRTG, Cricket, or the many other front ends used for collecting 
              SNMP data from network switches and routers. In this article, I 
              will cover how to configure and use smokeping to measure latency 
              on the network. I will provide a sample configuration script and 
              some example graphs of collected data. I will also explain how I 
              used Smokeping to document and resolve problems on the network.
            <p> <b>Software Installation</b>
            <p> Smokeping is a free software package with a GPL license. You can 
              download smokeping from the download section at the Web site:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/smokeping/
</pre>
            Several other utilities are required to make smokeping work, such 
            as Perl, Apache, fping, echoping, SpeedyCGI, and RRD. You will also 
            need Socket6 if you need to resolve IPv6 addresses. Links to these 
            utilities can be found in the resources section at the end of this 
            article and at the smokeping Web site. All the utilities must be installed 
            before smokeping will work. Download, configure, and install the software 
            using the instructions included with each utility. Use gunzip and 
            tar to extract each of the utilities. Most of the software can then 
            be configured, compiled, and installed with the following commands:
            <p> 
            <pre>
# ./configure
# make
# make install
</pre>
            Some of the utilities may need to be configured with other options 
            to meet your needs. Make sure to read the README and INSTALL instructions 
            with each utility before installing.
            <p> <b>Smokeping</b>
            <p> The smokeping software should be installed under a user with limited 
              rights like "smokeping". After creating a user named smokeping, 
              install the smokeping software in this smokeping home directory, 
              using the smokeping account. For this article, the home directory 
              for smokeping will be /home/smokeping. Within the smokeping directory 
              "/home/smokeping", make the following directories: var, 
              public_html, and public_html/.simg. In the directories bin and etc, 
              remove ".dist" from the end of the files that end with 
              ".dist". This can be done by using the <b>mv</b> command 
              to move them, or by making a copy with the <b>cp</b> command. Copy 
              the "/home/smokeping/htdocs/smokeping.cgi.dist" script 
              to the new public_html directory. Examples:
            <p> 
            <pre>
cp /home/smokeping/etc/config.dist /home/smokeping/etc/config
cp /home/smokeping/htdocs/smokeping.cgi.dist /home/smokeping/public_html/smokeping.cgi
</pre>
            The smokeping and smokeping.cgi scripts must be configured with the 
            correct paths to the utilities and configuration file. Edit /home/smokeping/bin/smokeping 
            to make sure the path for Perl is correct. Also check that the paths 
            for the smokeping and RRD library directories, as well as the path 
            for the configuration file, are defined correctly. This may require 
            the use of the <b>find</b> command, if you are not sure of their locations. 
            The paths for the lib and config file for smokeping could look like 
            this:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use lib qw(/local/rrdtool/lib/perl);
use lib qw(/home/smokeping/lib);
Smokeping::main("/home/smokeping/etc/config");
</pre>
            The next file to edit is the /home/smokeping/public_html/smokeping.cgi 
            script to make sure the path to speedy, the SpeedyCGI tool, is correct. 
            As in the smokeping utility, the configuration file, and the library, 
            directories for smokeping and RRD need to be defined. The paths for 
            the config and lib directories will be the same as the smokeping utility:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#!/usr/bin/speedy -w
use lib qw(/local/rrdtool/lib/perl);
use lib qw(/home/smokeping/lib);
Smokeping::cgi("/home/smokeping/etc/config");
</pre>
            <b>Apache</b>
            <p> Apache only needs a few changes in its httpd.conf file to allow 
              access to the smokeping.cgi script in the smokeping directory. The 
              AddHandler option for CGI scripts must be uncommented by removing 
              the leading pound sign (#). Access to the public_html directory 
              must be added to the httpd.conf file as well. The changes for httpd.conf, 
              shown in Listing 1, should allow smokeping to work, but should not 
              be considered a secure configuration. Steps should be taken to secure 
              the configuration of Apache and to limit access to the smokeping.cgi 
              script in a manner that will meet your security policies. (All listings 
              are on the <i>Sys Admin</i> Web site: <b>http://www.sysadminmag.com</b>.)
            <p> <b>Utility Testing</b>
            <p> It is important to test each utility to make sure the utilities 
              are working properly. Smokeping will only work if the utilities 
              on which it depends are working correctly. Understanding how each 
              utility works will make configuration and troubleshooting much easier. 
              These utilities can also be useful for testing and troubleshooting 
              network services in other applications. The following sections describe 
              three important utilities that support smokeping:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> fping 
              <li> echoping 
              <li> curl
            </ul>
            <p> For more on configuring smokeping's support utilities, refer 
              to the utility documentation.
            <p> <b>Fping</b>
            <p> Fping can send out pings to a single address or multiple IP addresses 
              at the same time. After sending out the many concurrent pings, it 
              will keep track of the responses from each server. By comparison, 
              the ping utility can only query one server at a time. If an IP address 
              doesn't respond to fping, it will try several more times. You 
              should only use this tool to ping hosts or sets of IP addresses 
              that you are authorized to probe. Using this tool to ping hosts 
              or scan networks that you do not control could be viewed as an illegal 
              activity. A simple query to test fping is:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Command-&gt;
# fping -e -c 3 192.168.1.1
Response-&gt;
192.168.1.1 : [0], 84 bytes, 0.34 ms (0.34 avg, 0% loss)
192.168.1.1 : [1], 84 bytes, 0.32 ms (0.33 avg, 0% loss)
192.168.1.1 : [2], 84 bytes, 0.32 ms (0.32 avg, 0% loss)
192.168.1.1 : xmt/rcv/%loss = 3/3/0%, min/avg/max = 0.32/0.33/0.34
</pre>
            The response to the <b>fping</b> command showed three pings and their 
            latency. It also showed the minimum, maximum, and average latency 
            value for the three pings. To make fping executable by the smokeping 
            account, fping must be made setuid root. This will allow processes 
            other than root, like smokeping, to run the <b>fping</b> command. 
            Under Linux, the command to make fping setuid root is:
            <p> 
            <pre>
# chmod 4755 fping
</pre>
            <b>Echoping</b>
            <p> Echoping can be used to test several types of network services, 
              such as http, https, smtp, chargen, etc. The three main types used 
              by Smokeping are http, https, and smtp. To test an http service, 
              use the <b>-h</b> option to specify that the echoping request will 
              be an html page, followed by the path. The server and port for the 
              Web server are then specified, with a colon used to separate the 
              server address and port number. The <b>-n</b> followed by a number 
              option informs echoping to execute the command three times:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Command-&gt;
Echoping -n 3 -h / www.domain-name:80
        
Response-&gt;
Elapsed time: 0.002667 seconds
Elapsed time: 0.002565 seconds
Elapsed time: 0.002613 seconds
---
Minimum time: 0.002565 seconds (99805 bytes per sec.)
Maximum time: 0.002667 seconds (95988 bytes per sec.)
Average time: 0.002615 seconds (97897 bytes per sec.)
Median time: 0.002613 seconds (97972 bytes per sec.)
</pre>
            Echoping should respond with the message showing the elapsed time 
            for each of the http requests. It will also display the minimum, maximum, 
            average, and median latency values for the Web server. Testing all 
            the Web sites manually will be easier to troubleshoot than within 
            smokeping.
            <p> If encrypted http connections are going to be used, the OpenSSL 
              library will need to be installed first. Issue the Echoping configure 
              command with the "-with-ssl" option. Then issue the commands 
              <b>make</b> and <b>make install</b>.
            <p> It is also very easy to test the response times of email servers. 
              Issuing the following command can test the latency of an SMTP connection:
            <p> 
            <pre>
# echoping -n 3 -S 192.168.1.1
</pre>
            <b>Curl</b>
            <p> Curl is another useful tool for testing http and https connections. 
              Echoping will inform you of the response time or a failure, but 
              it is sometimes useful to know exactly what the http or https response 
              looks like. Curl will display the html response in text form, and 
              not interpret the html commands. With command-line options that 
              are available, it can use either GET or POST to send information 
              to a Web server. It can also send user authentication information 
              to a server to access protected resources. Here is a sample use 
              of curl to display an https Web page:
            <p> 
            <pre>
# curl --insecure https://web.domain-name
</pre>
            The "--insecure" option tells it not to use any default 
            CA certificates. The "-cacert &lt;CA certificate&gt;" option 
            would be used to define a certificate to be used during a connection.
            <p> <b>Smokeping Configuration</b>
            <p> The smokeping configuration script consists of five basic sections: 
              general, database, presentation, probes, and targets (see sidebar). 
              The format is hierarchical structure for use with the parseconfig 
              module that comes with smokeping. The sample config script in Listing 
              2 shows a basic configuration file for smokeping.
            <p> <b>Running Smokeping</b>
            <p> It is always a good idea to run things manually before turning 
              them loose. Running smokeping with the debug option will cause it 
              to display information about what it is doing. Smokeping will not 
              run as a daemon while in debug mode, but will only run once and 
              display more detailed information about what it is doing:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Command-&gt;
/home/smokeping/bin/smokeping --debug 

Response (condensed)-&gt;
### fping seems to report in 1 milliseconds

0.002315 0.004432
</pre>
            The response showed that four targets were defined in latency testing 
            with fping. Three http targets were also defined, of which only the 
            "mars" Web server debug data is displayed. The "mars" 
            http response shows the results of the 20 latency tests.
            <p> To start Smokeping as a daemon, execute the smokeping utility 
              without any options. Smokeping will daemonize a process and return 
              to the shell prompt. The process can be restarted to read the configuration 
              file by running smokeping with the "--restart" option.
            <p> <b>Web Pages</b>
            <p> Smokeping uses a CGI script to query the RRD database and create 
              the graphs and Web pages. To save a couple of keystrokes in specifying 
              the URL to the CGI script, create an index.html file (Listing 3) 
              in the smokeping public_html directory to automatically redirect 
              to the smokeping.cgi script.
            <p> <b>Graphs</b>
            <p> Smokeping uses two different types of graphs to display the latency 
              information: an overview graph and a detailed graph. The overview 
              graph shows the RTT latency value for the past 10 hours (Figure 
              1). The graph displays the median RTT value for that time period, 
              as well as the last retrieved value. The average packet loss is 
              also calculated and displayed on the graph. Clicking on the graph 
              will retrieve the detailed graph for that server or service being 
              monitored.
            <p> The detailed smokeping graph (Figure 2) use color codes to indicate 
              any packet loss. The color-coded bar indicates that median value 
              of the packets sent during each polling period. Smokeping will use 
              green if there was no packet loss. Light blue is used for losing 
              one packet, with increasingly darker shades for loss increases up 
              to four. Purple and red are used when the packet loss is 10 or 19 
              per polling period. If all packets during a polling period are lost, 
              nothing will be displayed for that time period on the graph.
            <p> Smokeping also uses grey bars to indicate the distribution of 
              the response times. A dark grey indicates a tight packing of many 
              polls with the same RTT. A tall bar of light grey indicates a large 
              variance of the latency in the packets sent.
            <p> When viewing the smokeping graphs for latency, be aware that the 
              data collected using pings may show packet loss. Many routers will 
              drop the ICMP ping packets when they are busy handling other traffic. 
              ICMP is given a much lower priority when compared to the other UDP 
              and TCP traffic. It is better to test for latency using http, smtp, 
              or the other supported services under smokeping.
            <p> <b>Resolving Network Problems with Smokeping</b>
            <p> The following sections describe some examples of how smokeping 
              can help troubleshoot network problems.
            <p> <b>Random Latency Problem</b>
            <p> Last year, some users noticed a problem with their terminal application 
              experiencing a response delay of 5 to 6 seconds to a remote site. 
              The problem did not happen all the time, and of course, never occurred 
              when I tried it. The remote site could not detect any problem with 
              the network equipment. I configured smokeping to monitor the latency 
              to the remote server and the routers in between. After several days, 
              the data showed that the problem was occurring at the remote sites 
              server (Figure 3). The graph showed that the server was experiencing 
              latencies of up to 7 seconds at random intervals. The router graph 
              (Figure 4) does show some packet loss, but not at the same time 
              as the server. In some cases, the router has zero packet loss with 
              no change in latency, while the server shows latency problems.
            <p> Copies of the graphs showing smokeping's findings were emailed 
              to the remote site. The remote site determined that the router was 
              very busy handling our inbound connection, and lots of outbound 
              connections at those times. The remote site then used a packet shaper 
              to give priority to our application traffic, which resolved the 
              problem.
            <p> <b>Broadband Problem</b>
            <p> In another case, a remote site using a broadband provider for 
              Internet access began to see slower response times in accessing 
              our site. Another site with the same broadband provider was not 
              experiencing this problem. The Cricket/RRD data showed that utilization 
              of the bandwidth was not the cause. Looking at the smokeping data 
              showed the latency had been slowly getting worse over a few days. 
              I contacted the provider and explained the problem along with the 
              data I was seeing with the smokeping graphs. They sent a technician 
              who diagnosed a problem with the external broadband equipment.
            <p> <b>Monitoring Server Performance</b>
            <p> Smokeping can also be used to monitor the latency of a Web server. 
              We have used it to monitor the response time of a Web server with 
              a backend database. Smokeping makes a request that only the Web 
              server handles, and makes requests that make use of the backend 
              database. Smokeping provides a history of how the two servers are 
              performing. When a user complains of performance problems, I can 
              look at the graphs to see what has changed and when. This helps 
              reduce troubleshooting time if we can see a correlation to a server 
              patch or modification.
            <p> <b>Conclusion</b>
            <p> Smokeping has proven valuable to me in performing my job responsibilities. 
              Learning how to use it, and the other utilities like curl and echoping, 
              has been very useful with other network projects. Identifying a 
              problem, and backing that up with a graph, went a long way toward 
              resolving network problems quickly. I think Smokeping just reinforces 
              the old saying that a picture is worth a thousand words.
