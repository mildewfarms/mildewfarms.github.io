            <p><b> Imperial Technology Announces WhatsHot</b>
            <p> Imperial Technology announced WhatsHot, a new software product 
              that tracks file usage by individual file name and outputs information 
              that can be used to optimize data placement in storage infrastructures. 
              According to the company, WhatsHot is composed of a simple and non-invasive 
              software agent that resides on the server to collect real-time file 
              access statistics. Once a brief snapshot is complete, WhatsHot provides 
              a concise report that illuminates key file usage parameters including 
              total file usage, time per access, percent file contribution of 
              total workload, and average access size per file.
            <p> WhatsHot for Sun Solaris is available immediately with additional 
              operating environments scheduled for later this year. For more information,

            <p> <b>iStor Announces iSCSI Expansion Technology </b>
            <p> iStor Networks announced a patent-pending technology for IP storage 
              that, according to the company, aggregates the capacity of as many 
              as eight independent IP storage systems into a single system by 
              using inexpensive iSCSI links. The technology expands the number 
              of serial ATA (SATA) disk drives in the same storage domain from 
              16 to 128, which will enable IP storage systems to scale from entry- 
              to enterprise-level (with more than 30 terabytes of data storage) 
              while spreading out the cost of controllers for a better cost/capacity 
              ratio and a lower total cost of ownership. For more information,
