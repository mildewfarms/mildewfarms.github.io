              Truth about Tapes, Backups, and Restores 
              <p> 
            </h1>
            <i>Peter Baer Galvin</i>
            <p> Backups and restores are crucial functions to the integrity of 
              data at a site. And yet once an implementation is in place, except 
              for babysitting, these functions tend to be ignored. Why? Well, 
              backups are certainly not glamorous, and no one really likes to 
              muck with them. The risk/reward ratio on the backup and restore 
              process is a deterrent as well. If, for example, someone tweaks 
              the backups to make them run faster or smoother, or makes the restores 
              easier or faster, then the rewards tend to be small. On the other 
              hand, that same someone could be seeking alternate employment if 
              that tweaking caused restores to fail.
            <p> Even with this understood, I've decided to take the risk 
              and discuss the state of backups and restores (B&amp;R), and some 
              current technologies that may make the reward better than the risk 
              for updating the B&amp;R at your site.
            <p> Here are a few data points to have handy when making a determination 
              at your site: 
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> What tape technology do you use? 
              <li> What is the capacity of the tape, both raw and compressed (if 
                you use compression). What compression rate do you reach? 
              <li> Do you use disk as a staging storage for tape (i.e., "nearline 
                storage")? 
              <li> How many tapes do you buy a year, and at what cost? 
              <li> If you use a library, how many full and incremental tape sets 
                do you keep loaded? 
              <li> How many tape sets do you send off-site?
            </ul>
            <p> The next step to evaluating your B&amp;R methodology is to use 
              a backup calculator. Some vendors provide them if you are using 
              or evaluating their technology. Sun has one freely available at 
              their Web site:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.sun.com/storage/tape/tape_lib_calculator.html
</pre>
            This calculator is very good about accepting quite a lot of input 
            data and allowing "what-if" scenarios to be evaluated. Like 
            most backup calculators though, it only considers solutions that the 
            vendor sells. Regardless, it makes a good starting place.
            <p> An example of using the calculator is shown in Figure 1. It depicts 
              a site with 2TB of usable disk, growing at 20% per year, with 70% 
              utilized and 10% changing per day. The backup window is eight hours 
              for full backups and six for incremental ones. There are one full 
              backup and six incremental backups per data set, and the site wants 
              to keep two full data sets in the robot (two weeks worth of backups). 
              One limitation of this calculator is that it does not show how many 
              tapes would be used in total (including tapes taken off-site), but 
              that calculation can be done based on the numbers input and output. 
              Also, some other calculators show how many Mb/sec of throughput 
              are needed to accomplish the backups in the given windows, and that 
              can be useful for determining if the networking between the backup 
              server and the backup clients is sufficient.
            <p> Where the tool excels is in working through what-if scenarios. 
              For example, you can select the tape drive technology and see the 
              effect on the number of drives, tapes, and slots needed in the library. 
              You can also change backup windows, data sets in rotation, and assumptions 
              such as the compressibility of the data. By trying these scenarios, 
              you can not only determine the best drives and library to use, but 
              also avoid being boxed-in by the solution (should you chose to implement 
              it).
            <p> In Figure 1, the recommended library holds 180 tapes. This capacity 
              is fine for the first three years, but is exceeded in year four, 
              requiring an additional library. (Of course, tape drive technology 
              will likely have evolved by then, and if the library supports new 
              drives the data capacity of the robot could be upgraded.) By selecting 
              another tape robot, such as the L700, you can see how much longer 
              a larger tape robot would last. The "Display Library Requirements 
              Matrix" button saves time by showing all of the possibilities 
              on one screen. Each variation of tape drive and library that is 
              supported by Sun is shown, reflecting the choices available given 
              the data you input to the calculator.
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: upgrading your tape drives can save 
              money.
            <p> For instance, if you have DLT8000 drives, enter the appropriate 
              values in the calculator to see how many LTO tapes and drives you 
              would need. For the most complete picture, determine how many tapes 
              you are using in a time period (three years, for example), and how 
              many you buy in that time period. Then determine how many tapes 
              you would need using a newer tape technology. Multiply by the cost 
              of the tapes, and you may find that over that time period, even 
              including the cost of the new drives and possibly even a new robot, 
              your costs would be lower than sticking with the older, lower density 
              tapes.
            <p> Consider a scenario where your site has 100 DLT8000 tapes in a 
              library and buys 200 per year. The ballpark price for those tapes, 
              over three years (600 tapes), would be $42,000, storing a total 
              of 42TB (at 1.5X compression, including the 100 in the library). 
              To store the same amount of data with LTO tapes needed for three 
              years (even adding the 100 stored in the library), it would take 
              280 tapes at a cost of $19,600. The savings could be used to pay 
              for the LTO drive and a robot. Of course, the backups are also likely 
              to complete faster due to increased drive throughput, and be more 
              reliable due to new drives, and there would be fewer tapes to take 
              and manage off-site, so there are non-financial benefits to consider 
              as well.
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: compression rates vary wildly depending 
              on the data being moved to tape.
            <p> In the above example, we considered a 1.5X compression rate. Unfortunately, 
              compression rates are hazardous to consider in capacity and performance 
              calculations because they are so affected by the data being compressed. 
              Some data is non-compressible (consider audio recordings that are 
              already compressed), while some are highly compressible (such as 
              clear text). The safest bet, if you have mixed data or do not know 
              the data compressibility, is to assume zero compression. This is 
              the worst case, so any compression of the data would be good news, 
              and would add extra capacity and performance to your solution.
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: robot and tape reliability also varies 
              wildly.
            <p> This truth is difficult to provide statistically, because vendors 
              (as far as I know) do not provide reliability information. Rather, 
              the data tends to be anecdotal or site- and scenario-specific. For 
              example, my experience with 8MM tape drives was that they failed 
              after a year of heavy use, while LTO drives seem to be quite hardy. 
              Given a lack of concrete data, how is this truth useful? At a minimum, 
              you might include discussion of reliability in any discussion with 
              solution vendors, and bear in mind that reliability is a consideration, 
              along with other parameters, in any tape solution you may chose.
            <p> <b>Conclusions</b>
            <p> Backups and restores are complicated, fraught with risk, and difficult 
              to get excited about. However, there are rewards for evaluating 
              the current solution at your site and considering upgrades of various 
              kinds. Backup calculators can help guide your selection, but there 
              are truths about B&amp;R technology that should also be considered. 
              This month exposed some truths, and next month I will finish this 
              topic by exploring SCSI vs. Fibre tapes and robots, near-line storage 
              and its uses and abuses, backup SANS vs. backup networks, and backup 
              software choices.
            <p> <b>Good Book Alert</b>
            <p> It is off topic, but I think it is worth mentioning that the third 
              edition of <i>Practical Unix &amp; Internet Security</i> by Garfinkel, 
              Spafford, and Schwartz is now available from O'Reilly and Associates. 
              At first blush, this is a solid update to an already very solid 
              book. New topics include LDAP, Samba, wireless, intrusion detection, 
              MacOS X, and much more. Previous editions have been well thumbed, 
              and I expect this one will be, too.
