            <p>&AElig;leen Frisch, author of <i>Essential System Administration</i> 
              wrote an excellent series of articles for the O'Reilly &amp; 
              Associates Web site last year describing a few of her favorite tools. 
              In the series, she explores her "current list of the most useful 
              and widely applicable open source administrative tools." She 
              says, "In general, these tools can make your job easier no 
              matter what Unix operating system your computers run." On the 
              list are the Amanda backup utility, LDAP, GRUB, and the Nagios monitoring 
              package. Because this issue of <i>Sys Admin</i> features the topic 
              of networking, I'll share a few quick facts about Nagios here.</p>
            <p> Nagios, written by Ethan Galstad, was formerly known as Netsaint. 
              The Nagios home page (<b>http://www.nagios.org</b>) states:
            <p> Nagios&reg; is a host and service monitor designed to inform you 
              of network problems before your clients, end-users or managers do. 
              It has been designed to run under the Linux operating system, but 
              works fine under most *NIX variants as well. The monitoring daemon 
              runs intermittent checks on hosts and services you specify using 
              external "plug-ins" which return status information to 
              Nagios. When problems are encountered, the daemon can send notifications 
              out to administrative contacts in a variety of different ways (email, 
              instant message, SMS, etc.). Current status information, historical 
              logs, and reports can all be accessed via a web browser.
            <p> &AElig;leen Frisch's article, which can be found here:

            takes an in-depth look at Nagios and provides screenshots and annotated 
            configuration files detailing key points. Frisch says that configuring 
            Nagios can seem daunting and involves a fair amount of startup overhead. 
            She also says, however, that the configuration process is not as hard 
            or time-consuming as it initially seems and that it's well worth 
            the effort. Note that Netsaint configuration files are also compatible 
            with Nagios or can be converted with the utility provided. Frisch 
            writes:
            <p> Nagios monitors a wide variety of system properties, including 
              system-performance metrics such as load average and free disk space; 
              the presence of important services like HTTP and SMTP; and per-host 
              network availability and reachability. It also allows the system 
              administrator to define what constitutes a significant event on 
              each host...
            <p> It is also possible to define an event handler: a program that 
              is run when a problem is detected. Such programs can attempt to 
              solve the problem encountered, and they can also proactively prevent 
              some serious problems when they get triggered by warning conditions. 
              The information that Nagios collects is displayed in a series of 
              automatically generated Web pages. This format is quite convenient 
              in that it allows a system administrator to view network status 
              information from various points throughout the network.
            <p> See the Nagios home page for downloads and refer to Frisch's 
              article and the Nagios documentation for more details.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
