            <h1><b>The smokeping Configuration Script</b></h1>
            <p> The configuration script for smokeping contains the following 
              sections:
            <p> 
            <p> General: The General section defines the directory and file locations 
              for rrdtool data, images, sendmail, and smokemail. Email addresses 
              and URL information are also specified in this section. Many of 
              these configuration values are mandatory for the operation of smokeping. 
              It will not work correctly if they are not changed to match your 
              specific configuration.
            <p> Database: The Database section defines how often smokeping will 
              poll a device in seconds (step) and how many attempts will be made 
              during that poll period (pings). The default ping setting is to 
              send 20 requests at a step rate of 300 seconds (5 minutes). Smokeping 
              not only records the round-trip latency for each request, but also 
              records whether a request was lost. The rrdtool database is defined 
              here as well. This informs RRD of how it should store and consolidate 
              the data over time.
            <p> Presentation: The Presentation section is used to specify the 
              sizes of the overview and detail graphs. It also controls the ranges 
              for each of the details graphs in hours or days. The default settings 
              for the four detail graphs are: 3 hours, 30 hours, 10 days, and 
              400 days. These can be change to meet your needs.
            <p> Probes: Smokeping doesn't provide any tools for probing the 
              network services to determine latency. The external applications 
              like fping and echoping are defined here. The full path to each 
              binary is specified for the smokeping application to use for each 
              probe type: ping, http, https, and smtp.
            <p> Targets: The Targets are the devices and servers to monitor for 
              latency by smokeping. The targets are organized into sections in 
              a hierarchical order. Each section starts at level 1 with a single 
              plus (+) sign and the section name. A menu name and title can also 
              be defined for this level and higher levels. Using additional plus 
              signs delineates higher levels. The probe is configured for each 
              section at either level 1 or level 2. It references the probe defined 
              in the probe section of the configuration file. It also defines 
              in more detail about how the probe is supposed to work for this 
              section. The target host can be defined at any level for smokeping 
              to obtain the latency information. The host can be specified as 
              an IP address or as a hostname.
