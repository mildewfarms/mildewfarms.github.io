            </h1>
            <p> Simson Garfinkel is worried. In his thought-provoking column, 
              "The Net Effect", in the May issue of <i>Technology Review</i>, 
              he expresses concern about the computer viruses and worms seen so 
              far. Garfinkel believes, based on the pattern of behavior seen in 
              these attacks, that at least some of these worms are in fact elaborate 
              proof-of-concept tests. The following is excerpted from Garfinkel's 
              column: 
            <p> "Most of these hostile programs have three parts. The first, 
              the "exploit," is the technique the virus or worm uses 
              to break into systems. Most exploits take advantage of a known security 
              flaw -- for example, the classic "buffer overflow," 
              in which an excess of incoming data corrupts the information already 
              stored in memory. The second part, the "propagation engine," 
              is the code that targets computers for attack. And the third, the 
              "payload," does the actual damage. 
            <p> Viewed through this morphology, the major worms that have disabled 
              computers on the Internet -- Code Red, Nimda, Klez, and, most 
              recently, Slammer -- share a disturbing similarity. Each one 
              employed a novel -- and extremely effective -- propagation 
              engine. But for exploits, all these worms have used security vulnerabilities 
              that had been previously identified. And as for the payload: all 
              were duds. Even though each gained so-called administrative privileges 
              to alter the systems they infected, none used its privileges to 
              cause mayhem. 
            <p> ... not a single worm or virus that we have seen in the wild -- 
              not one -- has employed a novel exploit. That's not surprising. 
              Unknown exploits are far too valuable to reveal in public proof-of-concept 
              testing. Likewise, no worm has deployed a payload that caused significant 
              damage." 
            <p> The most worrisome aspect is that, as Garfinkel says, "today's 
              lame computer worms, even with well-known exploits and dummy payloads, 
              have shut down corporate and government networks." What might 
              a more malicious attack do? 
            <p> Hal Pomeranz (in his article in this issue of <i>Sys Admin</i>) 
              speculates that "the Sendmail buffer overflow exploit announced 
              in March will almost certainly be programmed into an automated worm 
              within the next six months. Such a worm could do for UNIX systems 
              what Code Red did to the Windows world -- simply because there 
              are so many potentially vulnerable UNIX systems on the network today." 
              In that article, Pomeranz details some suggestions for protecting 
              networks against this Sendmail vulnerability. I hope you find his 
              article and others in this issue useful in making your systems more 
              secure. 
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours, 
            <p>
