            <p> In the previous issue, the CheckRcvd ruleset from the sendmail 
              spam question had the following two lines: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
R&lt;?&gt; $+ $| $+           $: $&gt;LookUpDomain &lt;$1&gt; &lt;?&gt; &lt;+ Connect&gt; &lt;$2&gt;
R&lt;?&gt; &lt;$+&gt;               $: $&gt;LookUpAddress &lt;$1&gt; &lt;?&gt; &lt;+ Connect&gt; &lt;&gt;</pre>
            These should actually be: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
R&lt;?&gt; $+ $| $+           $: $&gt;LookUpDomain &lt;$1&gt; &lt;?&gt; &lt;$2&gt; &lt;+ Connect&gt;
R&lt;?&gt; &lt;$+&gt;               $: $&gt;LookUpAddress &lt;$1&gt; &lt;?&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;+ Connect&gt; 
</pre>
            Or if you're using sendmail 8.12 instead of 8.11: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
R&lt;?&gt; $+ $| $+           $: $&gt;D &lt;$1&gt; &lt;?&gt; &lt;+ Connect&gt; &lt;$2&gt;
R&lt;?&gt; &lt;$+&gt;               $: $&gt;A &lt;$1&gt; &lt;?&gt; &lt;+ Connect&gt; &lt;&gt;

            In the April issue there was a question about monitoring machine/room 
            temperature. Two additional suggestions have come in from our readers. 
            Bob Sigillito suggests a company called Sensatronics (<b>http://senatronics.com/TempTrax/</b>), 
            and Craig Dupree additionally suggests buying do-it-yourself kits 
            from QKits (<b>http://www.qkits.com</b>) for those people who are 
            comfortable with soldering. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'd like to add a disclaimer 
              footer to every message that goes through our mail server. I'm 
              sure that someone's managed to do this already, but I don't 
              see anything in sendmail that seems workable. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> This problem is more difficult 
              than it first seems because the mail server has to deal with more 
              than just plain text messages. Tacking a footer onto something like 
              a MIME message will break the message. By itself, sendmail is not 
              really a solution, but you can use libmilter and something like 
              MIMEDefang to add your footer to MIME structured messages. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Occasionally, our upstream link 
              goes down and we see the following error messages on our internal 
              DNS server running Bind 9.2.2: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
hostname syslog: client 192.168.1.3#20391: no more recursive clients: quota reached
</pre>
            The client IP addresses differ but there are usually other DNS, mail, 
            or proxy servers. Can I alleviate this condition, or is it just something 
            that will report errors till the link comes back up? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The messages indicate that your 
              name server has reached the maximum number of concurrent recursive 
              queries. As you suspected, this is happening because your upstream 
              link is down. Such error messages can also be indicative of a DOS 
              attack against your name server. 
            <p> You can increase the maximum number of concurrent recursive queries, 
              but if your link is down for an extended period of time and your 
              internal machines are doing a lot of queries, it's possible 
              that you may just hit the ceiling again or run out of memory. Below 
              is an excerpt from the BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual, section 
              6.2.14.8. "Server Resource Limits", which is available 
              as part of the source distribution in doc/arm/ or as a PDF from: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.nominum.com/content/documents/bind9arm.pdf:
</pre>
           <ul> recursive-clients 
            <p> The maximum number of simultaneous recursive lookups the server 
              will perform on behalf of clients. The default is 1000. Because 
              each recursing client uses a fair bit of memory, on the order of 
              20 kilobytes, the value of the recursive-clients option may have 
              to be decreased on hosts with limited memory. </ul>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I was installing a patch cluster 
              (using the install_cluster script that came with the cluster) on 
              a newly jumpstarted Solaris 8 02/02 machine when I got the following 
              message: 
            <p> <ul>WARNING: The / filesystem has 852612 free blocks. The current 
              installation requires 145 blocks, which includes a required 150 
              block buffer for open deleted files. 42 94114829 more blocks are 
              needed. 
            <p> WARNING: The / filesystem has 281493 free file nodes. The current

              are needed. </ul>
            <p> It looks like something got corrupted, because I can no longer 
              add any of the other patches. Is there a way to recover without 
              reinstalling my system? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You don't give the date 
              of the patch cluster you were installing, but earlier this year 
              there was a cluster with a bad version of a patchadd patch, 110934-10, 
              which caused this behavior. If you have a support contract, take 
              a look at the following URL for the details: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://sunsolve.sun.com/private-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=salert%2F50401
</pre>
            Essentially, backout patch 110934-10 if you can, or remove/rename 
            /var/sadm/pkg/&lt;pkgabbrev&gt;/install/space for all packages affected 
            by that failed patch. Make sure to pick up a newer rev of the patchadd 
            patch. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just installed NetBSD 
              1.6 onto an old SPARC I had sitting around. I received the following 
              warning message: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
"WARNING: clock gained 156 days --CHECK AND RESET THE DATE!"
</pre>
            I've heard about the NVRAM chips going bad on these old Suns, 
            so I tried installing SunOS 4.1.4, too, to see if it was just NetBSD, 
            or if something was wrong with my machine. I got the following warning: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
"WARNING: preposterous time in file system - CHECK AND RESET THE DATE"
</pre>
            It looks like my hardware may be bad. How do I fix this? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> When the machine is going though 
              POST, see whether your Ethernet address is set to all zeros. If 
              it is, then most likely the battery backup for the NVRAM chip has 
              died. If the Ethernet address looks normal, then my guess is that 
              your hardware is fine and you're just seeing a spurious message 
              from the kernel because you've booted off a read-only media 
              (like a CDROM or install tape). If this is the case, just check 
              the date of the installed system to make sure it's accurate 
              (and if not, reset it with the date command). 
            <p> If you have a dead NVRAM chip, take a look at:

            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I need to make an additional copy 
              of an 8mm tape that I have in my possession, but I only have one 
              tape drive attached to a Solaris 8 machine. I tried to copy the 
              tape to disk, and then copy it back to a fresh tape using <b>dd</b>, 
              but I got errors about not enough disk space. I have plenty of space 
              and inodes on the filesystem I was trying to copy the tape to, and 
              the new tape to which I'm copying is the exact same size. I 
              even tried a couple different tapes, thinking I may have used a 
              bad one. No luck. So, apparently I'm doing something wrong, 
              or <b>dd</b> isn't the best choice for this job. Any suggestions? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> <b>dd</b> is definitely the right 
              tool for the job here. The "not enough space" error message 
              probably indicates that you used the wrong block size when trying 
              to duplicate the data. If you've added a third party tape drive, 
              you might want to check whether a device block size was specified 
              in /kernel/drv/st.conf. Your <b>dd</b> commands should look something 
              like the following. (I'll assume that you might have multiple 
              chunks of data on the tape, so you'll want to use the norewind 
              device. I've picked an arbitrary block size of 10k.) 
            <p> 
            <pre>
dd if=/dev/rmt/0n bs=10k of=chunk1
dd if=/dev/rmt/0n bs=10k of=chunk2
...
dd if=/dev/rmt/0n bs=10k of=chunkN
</pre>
            Put in the fresh tape, and load the data on: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
dd if=chunk1 bs=10k of=/dev/rmt/0n
dd if=chunk2 bs=10k of=/dev/rmt/0n
...
dd if=chunkN bs=10k of=/dev/rmt/0n</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Our company would like to modify the 
            SMTP messages visible to external clients. Specifically, the following: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
220 smtp.my.domain ESMTP Sendmail 8.12.9/8.12.9; Sat, 8 Apr 2003 11:26:55 -0500 (EST)
250-smtp.my.domain Hello machine.their.domain [192.168.1.1], pleased to meet you
250 2.0.0 h28GHWw0031589 Message accepted for delivery
</pre>
            Is there an easy way to do this? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can change the first message 
              by setting SMTP_LOGIN_MSG in your mc file (rebuilding the cf file, 
              of course): 
            <p> If you specify: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
define(`confSMTP_LOGIN_MSG', `$j (NO UCE)')dnl

            <pre>
220 smtp.my.domain ESMTP (NO UCE)
</pre>
            The latter two have no configuration settings as far as I know. You 
            can make a couple simple changes to src/srvrsmtp.c and recompile your 
            source code to achieve the desired results. You'll want to change 
            the following code snippets to reflect whatever your message should 
            say:

q = "pleased to meet you";
message ("250-%s Hello %s, %s", MyHostName, CurSmtpClient, q);
message("250 2.0.0 %s Message accepted for delivery", id);
</pre>
            There are actually two instances of the middle line that you'll 
            want to change. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> A mistyped <b>rm</b> command wiped 
              out /dev on one of our test Solaris systems where we have no backups. 
              Apparently, these test systems are not trivial to recreate. We're 
              talking with the development team about backing up these machines 
              in the future, but is there something we can do to recover in the 
              meantime? We'd rather not install from scratch if we don't 
              have to. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If the machine is still up and 
              running the OS, try rebuilding the /dev tree. On machines pre-Solaris

devfsadm
</pre>
            If the machine crashed or was already halted, boot off the CDROM and 
            mount the root filesystem as <b>/a</b>. From there you can perform 
            the same steps as above, only specify the alternate root:

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Our company has global offices that 
            speak a variety of different languages, so I'm trying to get 
            Apache's MultiViews option for language content negotiation to 
            work on our internal Web servers. So far, I've had no success 
            on getting one of the languages, Hungarian, to work correctly. 
            <p> I have three versions of a file in English, German, and Hungarian, 
              named file.en.html, file.de.html, and file.hu.html, respectively. 
              I've specified the language and character set in each HTML 
              file using meta tags: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="hu" lang="hu"&gt;

            <p> When I view <b>http://www.my.domain/file</b> with a client, which 
              specifies hu as the preferred language and iso-8859-2 as the preferred 
              charset, file.hu.html is not returned. If the client does not specify 
              English or German as a fallback, then I get the following 406 error: 
            <p>

Not Acceptable

An appropriate representation of the requested resource /file could not be found on this server.

Available variants:

  * file.de.html , type text/html, language de
  * file.en.html , type text/html, language en
</pre>
            I know that this is not a permissions problem or anything like that, 
            because I can go directly to file.hu.html and view it just fine. So, 
            why can't it see my Hungarian file? 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Apache's mod_negotiation 
              doesn't look at the content of your files to determine the

              the .hu extension to the language hu by using the AddLanguage directive. 
              You may also want to assign the charset by using the AddCharset

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm writing a Perl script using 
            getopts to parse command-line flags. My code looks like this:

            <pre>
use Getopt::Std;
getopts('ab:c:d');
...

            it outputs this error:

            How do I silence the default output of getopts and add my own message

            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can set a WARN handler in

            The WARN handler is actually assigned an expression, even though it 
            looks like a subroutine declaration. This is why the semicolon is 
            outside of the closing brace. The above statement could be generically 
            written as:

            Here are the permissions on the important files and directories: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
-rw-r--r--   1 root   root     1452 Dec  7  2002 /etc/mail/aliases

</pre>
            And the possibly pertinent bits from my sendmail.mc: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
MASQUERADE_AS('my.domain')dnl
FEATURE('use_cw_file')dnl

MAILER(smtp)dnl
</pre>
            I'd think that I'd be seeing issues with external senders, 
            too, so I'm not quite sure what the problem is. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Generally you wouldn't install 
              8.12 /usr/sbin/sendmail as setuid root because of security concerns. 
              Since you're talking about mail from local users to local users, 
              and you don't have any problems with SMTP transactions, check 
              your submit.mc and/or submit.cf. My best guess is that you've 
              done something to the msp feature declaration: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
FEATURE('msp')dnl
</pre>
            or perhaps written as one of the following: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
FEATURE('msp', '[127.0.0.1]')dnl
FEATURE('msp', '[IPv6:::1]')dnl
</pre>
            To make your sendmail installation non-suid, make sure you have the 
            msp declaration in your submit.mc file (and rebuild the submit.cf 
            file). Then remove the suid permissions from the sendmail binary: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
chmod u-s /usr/sbin/sendmail
</pre>
            If, for some reason, you need sendmail to be setuid root, then delete 
            /etc/mail/submit.cf and leave the permissions on /usr/sbin/sendmail 
            alone. I would highly recommend making sendmail non-suid.
