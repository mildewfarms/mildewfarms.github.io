            <h1><b>Moore's Law and Clusters</b></h1>
            <p> If you're considering making a cluster purchase, don't 
              forget Moore's Law, the computing axiom that states computer 
              processing power doubles roughly every 18 months. Gordon Moore made 
              his famous observation -- of an exponential growth in the number 
              of transistors per integrated circuit -- in 1965 and predicted 
              that this trend would continue, as it has.
            <p> Because of Moore's Law, it can be demonstrated that it is 
              more cost-effective to purchase small clusters more frequently than 
              to purchase a very large cluster infrequently.
            <p> A cluster's ROI depends on how quickly it is deployed and 
              gets into production. As with all other kinds of equipment, time 
              reduces the value of computing assets. The value of servers drops 
              quickly as newer, faster versions enter the market. So, if it takes 
              three months to get your cluster up and running, it follows that 
              newly bought equipment would be 15 percent faster. The point is 
              clear -- to get the most value out of your cluster, it needs 
              to be up and running quickly. (See Figure 2.)
