              and Answers</h1>
            <p><b>Amy Rich</b>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm writing a bash script 
              that is supposed to sort a text file that includes a date, a process, 
              and a time (measured by the time program). The file is a set of 
              space-separated records, but the process names sometimes have spaces 
              in them as well. I want to sort on the time field, but I'm 
              not sure how, since it's not always in the same field number 
              when the command has arguments. Here's an example file:
            <p> 
            <pre>
04/05/03 ps -auxwww 0.012
04/02/03 ls 0.003
04/01/03 uptime 0.023</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Since the field containing the time 
            is not a constant, you use awk and the variable NF to get the last 
            field. Probably the easiest way to do this is to print out the last 
            field (on which you want to sort) followed by the whole record. Pass 
            that to sort, and then cut off that first column that you added.
            <p> 
            <pre>
awk '{print $NF,$0}' file | sort -n | cut -f 2- -d" "</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to get an A1000 disk 
            array working with an Ultra 10 running Solaris 8 02/02. I've 
            installed a Symbios dual differential SCSI card and connected the 
            A1000 (fully populated with 12 disks) to it. The machine is running 
            Raid Manager 6.22, Rev 01.54. I've rebooted the machine to configure 
            the devices, and I receive the following error at boot:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Mar 28 10:39:41 philly /usr/lib/osa/bin/fwutil: [ID 136482 
user.error] The controller firmware version for controller c3t5d0 
(module: mod2) is 2.05.02. The recommended firmware version for 
this application is 3.00.00 or higher.
</pre>
            In the hope that this error message wouldn't prevent me from 
            getting the RAID configured, I started rm6. I can see the module, 
            but I can't seem to do anything with it. I tried a health check, 
            and it claims that it can't scan the module. I checked the current 
            configuration with raidutil, and that seems to have worked just fine:
            <p> 
            <pre>

            Do you have any ideas on why can't I configure my A1000 when 
            it's clearly up, running, and can read the existing configuration? 
            I don't much care about the existing data since it isn't 
            ours.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> To begin, you'll want to 
              upgrade the firmware on the A1000 just to make sure you're 
              not running into incompatibility issues. See the RAID Manager 6.2.2 
              Installation and Support Guide at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://docs-pdf.sun.com/805-7756-10/805-7756-10.pdf
</pre>
            for information on how to do this.
            <p> I suspect that the real issue is that you (or the prior owner 
              of the A1000) did not clear the existing LUNs when you detached 
              the A1000 from the previous system. You show four existing LUNs, 
              and the module name is not a standard default. This will definitely 
              cause difficulties when you move the A1000 to a new machine. To 
              reset the array to the default, try:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/sbin/osa/raidutil -c c3t5d0 -X
</pre>
            If you now run <b>/usr/sbin/osa/lad</b>, or <b>raidutil -i</b>, you 
            should only see one default 10M LUN 0. You can delete this default 
            placeholder and create your own LUNs. Always make sure you put a LUN 
            at 0, though, or you may experience issues with the A1000. If this 
            doesn't work, you might want to try the suggestion at:

            This person had a problem very similar to yours and resetting the 
            array by removing all the disks seemed to work for him.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to use the access.db 
              feature of sendmail. My sendmail.cf contains:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Kaccess hash /etc/mail/access.db
</pre>
            My /etc/mail/access contains:
            <p> 
            <pre>
aol.com   ERROR:"550 We don't accept mail from aol.com due to excessive spam."
verified_user1@aol.com  OK
verified_user2@aol.com  OK
...
verified_userN@aol.com  OK
</pre>
            This should, in theory, allow mail from <b>verified_user[1-N]@aol.com</b>, 
            but it bounces with the following error:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Action: failed
Status: 5.0.0
Diagnostic-Code: smtp;550 5.0.0 We don't accept mail from aol.com 
  due to excessive spam.</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You need to use FEATURE('delay_checks') 
            to override blocking the SMTP client (aol.com) when you have valid 
            users (<b>verified_userN@aol.com</b>) in your access database. From 
            cf/README:
            <p> By using FEATURE('delay_checks') the rulesets check_mail 
              and check_relay will not be called when a client connects or issues 
              a MAIL command, respectively. Instead, those rulesets will be called 
              by the check_rcpt ruleset; they will be skipped if a sender has 
              been authenticated using a "trusted" mechanism, i.e., 
              one that is defined via TRUST_AUTH_MECH(). If check_mail returns 
              an error then the RCPT TO command will be rejected with that error. 
              If it returns some other result starting with $# then check_relay 
              will be skipped. If the sender address (or a part of it) is listed 
              in the access map and it has a RHS of OK or RELAY, then check_relay 
              will be skipped. This has an interesting side effect: if your domain 
              is my.domain and you have:
            <p> 
            <pre>
my.domain       RELAY
</pre>
            in the access map, then all e-mail with a sender address of &lt;user@my.domain&gt; 
            gets through, even if check_relay would reject it (e.g., based on 
            the hostname or IP address). This allows spammers to get around DNS 
            based blacklist by faking the sender address. To avoid this problem 
            you have to use tagged entries:
            <p> 
            <pre>
To:my.domain            RELAY
Connect:my.domain       RELAY
</pre>
            if you need those entries at all (class {R} may take care of them).
            <p> 
            <pre>
FEATURE('delay_checks') can take an optional argument:

FEATURE('delay_checks', 'friend')
          enables spamfriend test
FEATURE('delay_checks', 'hater')
          enables spamhater test
</pre>
            If such an argument is given, the recipient will be looked up in the 
            access map (using the tag Spam:). If the argument is 'friend', 
            then the default behavior is to apply the other rulesets and make 
            a SPAM friend the exception. The rulesets check_mail and check_relay 
            will be skipped only if the recipient address is found and has RHS 
            FRIEND. If the argument is 'hater', then the default behavior 
            is to skip the rulesets check_mail and check_relay and make a SPAM 
            hater the exception. The other two rulesets will be applied only if 
            the recipient address is found and has RHS HATER.
            <p> This allows for simple exceptions from the tests, e.g., by activating 
              the friend option and having:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Spam:abuse@     FRIEND
</pre>
            in the access map, mail to abuse@localdomain will get through (where 
            "localdomain" is any domain in class {w}). It is also possible 
            to specify a full address or an address with +detail:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Spam:abuse@my.domain    FRIEND
Spam:me+abuse@          FRIEND
Spam:spam.domain        FRIEND
</pre>
            Note: The required tag has been changed in 8.12 from To: to Spam:. 
            This change is incompatible to previous versions. However, you can 
            (for now) simply add the new entries to the access map, the old ones 
            will be ignored. As soon as you removed the old entries from the access 
            map, specify a third parameter ('n') to this feature and 
            the backward compatibility rules will not be in the generated .cf 
            file.
            <p> So, to allow your verified users, you ideally want the following 
              in your /etc/mail/access file:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Spam:verified_user1@aol.com  FRIEND
Spam:verified_user2@aol.com  FRIEND
...
Spam:verified_userN@aol.com  FRIEND

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to audit my system 
            and find all files that are links, either soft or hard. I know the 
            <b>-type l</b> option to <b>find</b> will give me all of the soft 
            links, but there doesn't seem to be a similar option for hard 
            links. Is there a better tool to use, or am I overlooking an option?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Hard links are not an option 
              to the file type argument of <b>find</b>. Most finds take the following 
              as file types:
            <p> 
            <pre>
b       block special
c       character special
d       directory
f       regular file
l       symbolic link
p       FIFO
s       socket
</pre>
            One way you might be able to check for hard links is to look at the 
            link count of each file. A hard link to a file is indistinguishable 
            from the original directory entry, and any changes to a file are effectively 
            independent of the name used to reference the file. Hard links may 
            not normally refer to directories and may not span file systems. If 
            you're specifying a hard link to be a file that has a link count 
            greater than one, you can use the links option to find. Since you 
            want only files, be sure to exclude the file type directory:
            <p> 
            <pre>
find / \! -type d \( -links +2 -o -type l \) -print
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Due to a merging of namespaces, we 
            have two legacy domain names (domain1.com and domain2.com) that contain 
            records for all of the same IP addresses. Our /etc/named.conf specifies 
            separate zone files for the two domains as such:
            <p> 
            <pre>
zone "domain1.com" in {
  type master;
  file "domain1.com";
};

zone "domain2.com" in {
  type master;
  file "domain2.com";
};
</pre>
            The zone files both contain (where domainX is either domain1 or domain2):
            <p> 
            <pre>
$TTL 2D
domainX         IN SOA          primary   root.domain2.com. (
                   2002012004      ; serial
                   1D              ; refresh
                   2H              ; retry
                   1W              ; expiry
                   2D )            ; minimum

                IN      NS      ns1.domain2.com.
                IN      NS      ns2.domain2.com.
                IN      MX 10   mx1.domain2.com.
                IN      MX 20   mx2.domain2.com.

localhost       IN      A       127.0.0.1
www             IN      CNAME   host2.domain2.com.

host1           IN      A       192.168.1.1
host2           IN      A       192.168.1.2
...
hostN           IN      A       192.168.1.N
</pre>
            Is there a way I can only keep one file for both domains, or is there 
            a script to make changes to multiple zones automatically? Updating 
            both by hand whenever there's a change is a pain and highly prone 
            to error.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can use one zone file for 
              both domains. All you need to do is replace the zone name (domainX) 
              with the @ symbol. This is shorthand for the zone name, inherited 
              from named.conf. As long as your zone files are exactly the same, 
              you never use a FQDN where it should be different in each zone, 
              and do not receive dynamic updates, it will work just fine.
            <p> In your case, the only thing you need to change in your zone file 
              is the SOA. The rest will remain the same. Reference this same zone 
              file from both named.conf zone declarations on the master. There 
              won't be any changes to the slave, as each zone will still 
              have its own separate file there. So, on your master, you'll 
              have the following in /etc/named.conf:
            <p> 
            <pre>
zone "domain1.com" in {
  type master;
  file "domain2.com";
};

zone "domain2.com" in {
  type master;
  file "domain2.com";
};
</pre>
            and the zone file domain2.com will contain:
            <p> 
            <pre>
$TTL 2D
@               IN SOA          primary   root.domain2.com. (

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a number of text files that 
            are structured based on line number (e.g., the first line is the file 
            name, the second line is the owner, the third line is the last modification 
            date, etc.). Unfortunately, there's no common data between the 
            same number lines of different files. Line 2 in file1 may be Jack, 
            and line 2 in file2 may be Jill. What I want is to be able to grep 
            just line 2 of every file so I can get a listing of all of the owners. 
            Since there isn't necessarily any commonality, though, I'm 
            not sure how to go about this.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> In this case, grep isn't 
              going to help you any, because it expects some common string or 
              regular expression. If you want to get specific numbered lines from 
              a file, then head, tail, awk, or sed will be the best tools. To 
              get line two of <b>file</b>, you can do one of the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
head -2 file | tail -1
awk 'NR==2{print}' file
sed '2q;d' file
</pre>
            The last option has the benefit of stopping once you've reached 
            the record you want. If your data files are very large, this will 
            save you a lot of time because you won't be parsing the entire 
            file.
