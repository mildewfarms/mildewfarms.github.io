            <h1><b>More Nodes or a Higher-Performance Interconnect?</b></h1>
            <p> If you want to boost the performance of your cluster, you typically 
              have two choices: buy more nodes or get a higher performance interconnect. 
              However, interconnect cost is often not linear.
            <p> Smaller systems can be made by tightly integrated, unmanaged switches 
              that can cost less than $100 per port. However, these inexpensive 
              switches are not suitable for building larger networks. If the cluster 
              size dictates managed Layer 3 switches, the cost jumps to $500-$1,000 
              per port. Switches often provide 2n or 2m +2n ports. If the switch 
              enclosure is fully equipped, expanding the switch carries more cost 
              per port. For example, if a single switch enclosure supports 64 
              ports, you will need six fully populated enclosures to support 128 
              ports maintaining full bi-sectional bandwidth -- a three-fold 
              price premium. In other words, the last 64 ports will cost five 
              times as much as the first 64. (See Figure 3.)
            <p> Applications can also be very sensitive to latency, which can 
              be driven by the processing power available on the cluster. This 
              is particularly true when the system is scaled. What is the overhead 
              for the application to send or receive messages, and how long are 
              packets in transit? How do these numbers change as the cluster is 
              scaled up in size? It's this limitation that will ultimately 
              constrain the scalability of any application. At some point, it 
              is not cost-effective to add more hardware to support the application.
            <p> However, larger clusters do offer two benefits. First, the systems 
              administration cost can be optimized by having fewer but larger 
              clusters. Second, if the key usage of the cluster is throughput 
              oriented, several instances of the application can run on different 
              parts of the cluster at the same time.
            <p> That said, different applications have different requirements 
              for the interconnect; they can be sensitive to latency, bandwidth, 
              or both. How you scale the application is therefore very important. 
              Scaling the system to reduce the turnaround time often changes the 
              application's characteristics. With few nodes, the application 
              will send a few large messages infrequently, whereas when you scale 
              it to many nodes (hundreds or thousands), the application will typically 
              send short messages at tighter intervals. Thus, frequent exchange 
              of small messages puts a larger burden on the interconnect in comparison 
              to infrequent exchange of large messages.
            <p> This restriction to the scalability of the application is depicted 
              by Amdahl's law -- for systems administrators, Amdahl's 
              law implies that the behavior of an application on a small cluster 
              can not necessarily be transcribed into a larger cluster. An application 
              that appears to run well using a legacy interconnect on a handful 
              number of nodes may likely require an exotic, low-latency interconnect 
              to take advantage of a larger cluster.
            <p> You can also scale the system to solve a larger problem. Findings 
              from a small cluster can often be transcribed into a scenario with 
              a larger cluster, in particular for its computational phase. On 
              the other hand, an application's input and output phase might 
              be handled sequentially where special consideration is needed to 
              avoid a bottleneck, which in turn restricts the performance gain 
              offered by the larger cluster.
