              and Answers</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> The following suggestion was submitted by James Holtom for the 
              user who was having issues with FreeBSD crashing. I've certainly 
              had enough issues with ACPI myself that it's worth trying to disable 
              it (though that probably won't fix the disk fsck problem itself).
            <p> 
            <ul>
              The correspondent with FreeBSD crash problems doesn't state what 
              version is being used. Looking at the panic message, I would suggest 
              that it is version 5.x, on account of the "Terminate ACPI" message 
              -- ACPI isn't found in the 4.x line. ACPI is a known cause of difficulties, 
              and a possible cause of crashes, and consequential file-system problems. 
              Try stopping ACPI from loading at boot time by including the line:
              <p> <b>hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</b>
              <p> in file /boot/device.hints

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running ISC's DHCP client, version 
            3.0.1rc11. I don't want DHCP to touch my /etc/resolv.conf file, because 
            I'm running my own DNS server. Is there some setting I can change 
            to tell dhclient not to touch this file?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The script dhclient-script writes 
              information into /etc/resolv.conf. Instead of modifying this file 
              directly (since it will get overwritten if/when you upgrade), copy 
              it to another location and make your modifications there. Then, 
              specify the new script file in your dhclient.conf:
            <p> 
            <pre>
option script "/path/to/new/script-name";</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm migrating our work servers from 
            Linux to Solaris. Is there a way to mount ext3fs partitions on a Solaris 
            machine so that I can copy over data?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you have both machines up 
              and running at the same time, you're probably better off using NFS 
              or running an archiving (tar, cpio, etc) process over the network 
              instead of trying to mount the filesystem directly. If you're trying 
              to hook the disk directly up to a machine running Solaris, you might 
              want to try using the Lxrun program mentioned at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://wwws.sun.com/software/linux/compatibility/lxrun/
</pre>
            Lxrun contains binary precompiled ext2fs modules for both SPARC and 
            Intel platforms. The modules only allow read-only access, but if you're 
            just copying information over from the old Linux disk, this should 
            be enough.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've written an http server for 
              one department in our company that needs something stripped down 
              and fast. Just to make sure that I have actually improved performance 
              over the other servers that we were testing, I'd like to measure 
              the performance of my daemon. Can you suggest any tools that might 
              help?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The Web Performance Tools at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/wptools
</pre>
            should help you analyze performance for your traffic patterns. There 
            are two tools: stress and record. Stress is an HTTP engine that simulates 
            thousands of HTTP clients using parameters that you define. Record 
            is a proxy that preserves an HTTP session for later playback with 
            stress (so you can create some typical user sessions for stress testing). 
            The tools run on AIX, Windows, Linux, Solaris, and HP/UX.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Our network admin is trying to 
              convince us that we should use /31 networks for point-to-point links 
              (we're a small ISP). As far as I know, /31s won't give the users 
              any usable IPs, so this is rather pointless. Is my information incorrect?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You don't say what sort of routers 
              you're using, so I'll pick IOS because it's one of the most popular. 
              Later versions of IOS allow you to use /31s on point-to-point links. 
              You don't need broadcast and network addresses. I think you can 
              also keep the interfaces listed as unnumbered if you're running 
              an older version of IOS. These should both leave you with two usable 
              IPs. For an example, take a look at:

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm struggling with the difference 
            between the ctime/atime/mtime dates on a file. What does each one 
            mean, and when does each one get updated?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Each of these timestamps is relative 
              to the Epoch, January 1st, 1970 00:00:00, not 0 or 1 AD, so if you're 
              writing code, you need to account for that. The three timestamps 
              are as follows:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ctime - last inode change time since the epoch (NOT creation time)
mtime - last modification time since the epoch
atime - last access time since the epoch
</pre>
            The ctime changes when the inode itself is modified. This happens 
            when the file is modified, moved, copied, permissions or modes changed, 
            etc. The ctime of a directory is changed when you cd into it. You 
            can look at the file with less, more, ls, etc. without changing the 
            ctime.
            <p> The mtime changes when the file is written out (e.g., after editing, 
              being opened for writing by a process, etc.).
            <p> The atime changes when the file is read from (less, more, cat, 
              being opened for reading by any process). To view these timestamps 
              with ls, use the following switches:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ctime: ls -c
mtime: ls -t
atime: ls -u
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm in the process of restricting 
            from whom I will accept mail. I'm running Solaris 9 and sendmail 8.9.12, 
            built from source. In my mc file (mailhub.mc), I have the following

mailhub.mc:14: m4: Cannot open /usr/lib/mail/feature/rhsbl.m4: \
  No such file or directory
</pre>
            Did I not install all parts of sendmail when I built it from source? 
            Is this file something I should have gotten elsewhere?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> rhsbl.m4 does not come with the 
              standard sendmail distribution or with Sun's distribution. You can

            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just switched from running 
              FreeBSD on an Intel laptop to using OS X on one of the new Apple 
              Powerbooks. I've been trying to get back to something resembling 
              my comfortable FreeBSD environment, so I've installed Apple's beta 
              3 X server. I was running ssh-agent under FreeBSD, and I'd like 
              to do the same with Apple's X server, but I'm not sure how. Under 
              FreeBSD, I was calling it as part of the startx script, but that's 
              not the way the Apple application works, as far as I can tell. Any 
              suggestions?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you've just purchased a new 
              Powerbook, presumably you're running OS X 10.2 or later. If so, 
              you want to look at sshLogin:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.synthemesc.com/sshLogin/
</pre>
            This program is distributed as an OS X package file for use with the 
            installer utility. This will add a directory to the /Applications 
            directory and an icon to the System Preferences window. You can make 
            configuration changes and add multiple keys by clicking on that icon. 
            Also click on the Login Items icon under the System Preferences window 
            and make sure that sshAskPass is listed.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I need to measure the distance 
              between a cable drop and a switch in our machine room. The wire 
              is run through the walls and ceiling, so using physical methods 
              isn't going to work. Is there a piece of software I can use to measure 
              the wire distance, instead?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Traceroute can give you an approximation, 
              but you'd be better off using a hardware solution to do your measuring. 
              If you want to do the math yourself, you can use an Ohm meter. If 
              you have the spare cash to spend, purchase something more complex 
              like an Ethernet analyzer or higher-end cable tester. Fluke has 
              a number of products that would fit the bill here, and a search 
              on Google for Fluke and "cable length" will turn up several good 
              choices.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to do some system profiling 
              via cron using this command:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/local/bin/top -d1 &gt; /tmp/topfile
</pre>
            While this works from the command line, I always wind up with an empty 
            file from cron because top wants a tty. Is there another program I 
            should be using to get the same kind of information?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you want the information from 
              top, you can run it in batch mode from cron:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/local/bin/top -bd1 &gt; /tmp/topfile
</pre>
            Top is only going to show you a select number of processes, though. 
            You might also want to look into using programs like sar, ps, and 
            system process logging to get the information you're after.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm upgrading my Ultra 5 desktop 
              with a bigger disk, and I'm wondering what's the biggest one I can 
              put in that will still be supported by Solaris 8.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Due to controller limitations, 
              Ultra 5 machines can only support up to 120G IDE drives.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've been trying to get X to work 
              with a virtual OpenBSD machine running on top of VMware 3.x without 
              much success. I start with a Windows 2000 install, create an OpenBSD 
              virtual machine, and that works fine. Then I run xf86cfg and save 
              the configuration. When I exit the setup, I get fatal errors and 
              X doesn't work. Any hints?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> When asking questions, it's best 
              to give specific hardware details, software version numbers, and 
              list any patches/service packs that have been installed. You're 
              also more likely to get usable information if you provide the exact 
              error messages. That said, there's some information at:

            <pre>
http://frogger974.homelinux.org/
</pre>
            that may help you. This details installing OpenBSD as a guest OS under 
            VMware, including setting up X. Essentially, this page suggests using 
            the FreeBSD VMware tools with a few modifications. The page also includes 
            a link to a pre-made XF86Config file that may just work for you, depending 
            on your hardware.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to use WinSCP on a 
              Windows 2000 machine to transfer files from a Solaris 8 server. 
              I'm able to upload files to the server just fine, but when I try 
              to download them, I get the following error:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Error listing directory "/home/brk".
Unexpected directory listing line "drwxr-xr-x  13 brk  1536 Aug 19 09:01 .".
Operation aborted
</pre>
            I have a Linux machine that works fine with the exact same commands, 
            though. Is WinSCP unusable with Solaris, or is this something I can 
            fix?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Based on the error you report, 
              it looks like you're using /usr/ucb/ps, which doesn't print out 
              the group name unless it's given the -g flag. You want to switch 
              to having /usr/bin in your path first, or perhaps /usr/local/bin, 
              if you have GNU ps installed. Both of these ps binaries will include 
              the group in the file listing. There's an issue that has a similar 
              error message if there is no execute permission on the directory 
              that you're trying to connect to. That's not the case here, though, 
              as evinced by the drwxr-xr-x portion of the error output.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just moved to FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE 
              from FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE, and a number of things seem to have just 
              stopped working. I can no longer make entries in /dev for things 
              like apm or my sound card (/dev/MAKEDEV is gone, too). My wireless 
              card no longer gets started automatically, and I have to run dhclient 
              by hand to get it to come up. Is FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE really this 
              unusable, or are there simple fixes that I'm overlooking?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There are some big design changes 
              between 4.8-STABLE and 5.0-RELEASE. Also, 5.0-RELEASE is still buggy 
              in some places and isn't meant to take the place of a -STABLE release 
              like 4.8-STABLE. If you're interested in playing with the OS and 
              reporting bugs, then 5.0-RELEASE is a good choice. If you want something 
              that's just going to work out of the box, you may want to stay with 
              the 4.x-STABLE releases for now. If you choose to stick with 5.0, 
              read all of the information available on 5.0 (in the upper right-hand 
              corner) at the FreeBSD Web page: <b>http://www.freebsd.org/</b>.
            <p> Now to answer your specific questions. To begin, /dev is no longer 
              a part of the root filesystem. It's a new type of filesystem called 
              devfs. Under devfs, the files you need are automatically created 
              when you load drivers. Take a look at the devfs man page for more 
              information.
            <p> The sound modules are not loaded by default. You can load them 
              at boot time by adding the following line to /boot/loader.conf (this 
              will load ALL of the sound drivers):
            <p> 
            <pre>
snd_driver_load="YES"
</pre>
            This should load a slew of sound modules and create the corresponding 
            entries in /dev each time you reboot.
            <p> As for apm, it has been replaced by ACPI. See the man pages for 
              acpi, acpiconf, and acpidump for more information. In /boot/device.hints, 
              apm is disabled with:
            <p> 
            <pre>
hint.apm.0.disabled="1"
</pre>
            If you'd like to switch back to apm, change that line to:
            <p> 
            <pre>
hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"
</pre>
            Add the following to /boot/loader.conf:
            <p> 
            <pre>
apm_load="YES"
</pre>
            Again, you'll want to reboot after making these changes.
            <p> Finally, you were probably using pccardd to start and configure 
              your wireless card. These things should now be under the control 
              of devd. You can add the following line to your /etc/rc.conf to 
              turn devd on:
            <p> 
            <pre>
devd_enable="YES"
</pre>
            You might also have lines something like the following in /etc/rc.conf 
            from your previous 4.8-STABLE install:
            <p> 
            <pre>
pccard_enable="YES"             # enable pccard devices
pccard_conf="/etc/pccard.conf"  # use alternate pccard.conf file
pccard_mem="0xd8000"            # location for pccard
pccard_ifconfig="DHCP"          # use DHCP to bring up wireless card
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a dynamic IP from our cable 
            company, but we run our own mail server because their mail system 
            is rather unreliable, in my opinion. Recently, AOL started blocking 
            all dynamic IP addresses using one of the blacklists. I'm using sendmail 
            8.12.9 on an HP/UX machine. Is there any way I can get around their 
            blocks so I can send mail to people at AOL?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you're running sendmail, you 
              can use the mailertable to route mail for specific domains through 
              your ISP's mail server and still deliver the rest of your mail directly. 
              The mailertable entries would look like:
            <p> 
            <pre>
aol.com esmtp:your.isps.smtp.host
netscape.net esmtp:your.isps.smtp.host
</pre>
            cd into the directory where your mailertable is stored, and build 
            the mailertable database with:
            <p> 
            <pre>
makemap hash mailertable &lt; mailertable
</pre>
            Now add the mailertable feature to your mc file:
            <p> 
            <pre>
FEATURE('mailertable')dnl
</pre>
            And rebuild your cf file and HUP or restart the parent sendmail process.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I need to schedule a payroll run 
              from cron every 14 days, but cron doesn't seem to lend itself well 
              to that. Is there an easy way to do this that I'm overlooking?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Instead of using cron, use at. 
              Schedule the first run by hand, and then, at the top of your script 
              (/your/script), put:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#!/bin/sh
at -f /your/script now + 14 days
# body of your script goes here
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have Solaris 8 running on a 280R. 
            Whenever the system boots, /tmp is set to mode 755, not 1777. I can 
            chown this while the machine is running, and it's fine till the next 
            reboot. Why won't my changes to /tmp stick?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Most likely, your /tmp filesystem 
              is of type tmpfs and the permissions are wrong on the directory 
              in the root filesystem, before the /tmp filesystem gets mounted. 
              You can boot into single-user mode to fix the permissions on the 
              root partition. You might also want to check /etc/init.d/RMTMPFILES, 
              which should be hard-linked to/from /etc/rc2.d/S05RMTMPFILES. Someone 
              may have changed the permissions inside that startup script.
