            <p>Computer security is everybody's concern now. No matter what your 
              job title, you cannot assume that security is someone else's problem. 
              In Jon Lasser's last column for SecurityFocus.com (<b>http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/159</b>), 
              Lasser laments the current state of computer security and writes: 
              "...backups aren't sexy. Basic system hardening isn't sexy, either. 
              Too many shops ignore both.... People will always pay more attention 
              to new and exciting toys than to basic, well-understood practices. 
              And they'll pay more attention to fixing problems in released systems 
              than to designing and testing those systems before release. No matter 
              how many columns I write suggesting that we do things right the 
              first time, it's unlikely that the message will get through."</p>
            <p> I'm a little more optimistic; generally, I think systems administrators 
              do get that message because they see the big picture. They see how 
              systems must be made to work together, how users must be coaxed 
              (or coerced) into accepting system and policy changes, and how those 
              policies must be strictly yet fairly enforced. Sys admins understand 
              that what goes around comes around and that if they neglect sound 
              administration practices in favor of more interesting projects, 
              they'll be the ones to fix the problems that arise.
            <p> Various articles in this issue touch on the value of doing things 
              right in the sense of implementing security software. Honeypots, 
              for example, have gotten a lot of attention lately. These sound 
              like fun tools and can provide extremely useful information, but 
              they can also be a liability if not correctly used. Kristy Westphal's 
              article examines several aspects of honeypots, including what they 
              are, what legal issues to consider, how to appropriately deploy 
              them, and how to maintain them. She stresses the need to examine 
              the overall goals of any honeypot implementation and the ramifications 
              of such a project before getting started. In another article, Eric 
              Cole and Sandra Ring explain how kernel-level rootkit attacks work 
              and how you can detect and protect against them. Keith McDuffee 
              describes grsecurity, an open source tool that works primarily as 
              a set of patches applied to the 2.4 Linux kernel. Rather than running 
              specific tools to detect breaches or vulnerabilities in a Linux 
              system, grsecurity implements process restrictions through the patched 
              kernel.
            <p> Like backups and basic system hardening, these articles are not 
              sexy, but they provide important information for maintaining secure 
              systems and tips for doing it right the first time. I hope you find 
              them useful.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
