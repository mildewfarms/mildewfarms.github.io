            <p><b> Crossroads Announces ServerAttach</b>
            <p> Crossroads Systems, Inc. recently announced the Crossroads Systems 
              ServerAttach family of products. According to the company, the product 
              line is designed to connect SCSI servers into Fibre Channel (FC) 
              architectures, including Storage Area Networks (SANs). The new Crossroads 
              ServerAttach solutions utilize a simplified user interface so no 
              HBA hardware or driver software is required. The products also support 
              proprietary SCSI commands, such as linking commands in IBM iSeries 
              environments, and distance extension for greater flexibility in 
              the physical location of systems. For more information, visit: <i>http://www.crossroads.com</i>.
            <p> <b>Cray to Use StorNext File System for CrayX1 Supercomputer</b>
            <p> Advanced Digital Information Corporation announced that Cray Inc. 
              will deliver ADIC's StorNext File System as the primary SAN file 
              system in its new Cray X1 supercomputer. According to ADIC, the 
              file system, which is being made available through a long-term source 
              license agreement, will be configured for Cray's UNICOS operating 
              system and will be delivered with every Cray X1 system.
            <p> The StorNext File System (StorNext FS) is the core file system 
              technology in ADIC's StorNext Management Suite (SNMS), a scalable, 
              high-performance, data-management solution that ensures the long-term 
              safety and recoverability of data in SAN environments, while optimizing 
              the use of storage resources. StorNext FS provides high-performance, 
              shared access to centralized disk storage for heterogeneous clients. 
              Because it gives multiple clients simultaneous access to the same 
              files sets, StorNext FS eliminates the need to move large files 
              over the LAN and to store duplicate file copies. For more information, 
              visit: <i>http://www.cray.com</i>.
            <p> <b>Nexsan Releases InfiniSAN ATABeast</b>
            <p> Nexsan Technologies announced its next-generation disk-to-disk
