              8 machine and cleaning out accumulated cruft in the root directory. 
              I've come across the directory /xfn, which contains a bunch of things:
            <p> 
            <pre>

            I'm very suspicious of the "..." directory, since I've seen that as 
            the signature of a cracked system before. I tried to remove the "..." 
            directory and got the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
# rm -rf ...
rm: Unable to remove directory ...: Device busy
</pre>
            Is this a sign that I've been hacked? How can I tell how they got 
            in?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The /xfs directory is used by 
              the Federated Naming Service. The Federated Naming Service provides 
              a method for hooking up, or federating, multiple naming services 
              under a single, simple uniform interface for the basic naming and 
              directory operations. In the Solaris environment, the FNS implementation 
              consists of a set of naming services with specific policies and 
              conventions for naming organizations, users, hosts, sites, and services, 
              as well as support for global naming services such as DNS and X.500. 
              In other words, it's a way to tie together NIS, NIS+, files, DNS, 
              X.500, LDAP, and other naming services.
            <p> The files and directories you see under /xfn are typical of a 
              running FNS, as is the fact that you cannot remove them while the 
              service is running. If you don't want FNS, you can stop/remove it. 
              If you want to run automounter but not use FNS, comment out the 
              appropriate lines in /etc/auto_master and run <b>automount -v</b>. 
              If you want to stop automounter altogether, you can remove /etc/rc2.d/S74autofs. 
              If you want to remove the software from the system altogether, do:
            <p> 
            <pre>
pkgrm SUNWfnsx SUNWfns SUNWfnsx5
</pre>
            You can also add SUNWatfsu and SUNWatfsr to the above line if you 
            want to remove automounter from the system as well.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'd like to learn a scripting 
              language that will help me do a number of our automated system and 
              Web-oriented tasks. I've heard of Perl and Python and am wondering 
              if there's anything else out there that I should take a look at 
              before picking one language to go with.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you're looking for a scripting 
              language to support both Web applications and systems administration 
              tasks, then there's always good old Bourne shell (or some derivative 
              thereof). If you're looking for a more robust language, you might 
              also want to take a look at Ruby:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.ruby-lang.org/
</pre>
            I don't think Ruby has made much headway into the sys admin world 
            yet, but I've had some programmers tell me it's a great language.
            <p> Ruby's strengths are that it's been a pure and complete OO language 
              right from start, not added on as an afterthought. The OO model 
              is simple but extensible and features true closures. Ruby has a 
              very simple syntax and good exception handling features. It also 
              has good garbage collection and the ability to dynamically load 
              extension libraries. Another advantage is that variables need no 
              declaration but scope can be defined by a simple naming convention 
              (simple 'var' = local variable, '@var' = instance variable, '$var' 
              = global variable).
            <p> When trying to decide which language to learn, be sure to consider 
              the availability and clarity of documentation, support, established 
              code base, and any legacy code you may need to support. Also take 
              a look at the development cycle of the language you choose and whether 
              it will meet your needs. Do you want a language that's fairly static 
              in syntax and concepts, or do you want one that's explosively adding 
              new features and changing syntax with each major revision? How big 
              of an in-house codebase will you need to support, and can you find 
              someone with the skills to do that when you move on?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I was reading through Sun's Web 
              site and found the following concerning DiskSuite state database 
              replicas:
            <p> Note -- If you created two replicas on each disk in a two-disk 
              configuration, DiskSuite will still function if one disk fails. 
              But because you must have one more than half of the total replicas 
              available in order for the system to reboot, you will be unable 
              to reboot in this state.
            <p> So if I'm mirroring my boot disk and have 50% of the state database 
              replicas on each disk, DiskSuite is useless because I won't be able 
              to boot the machine after I lose a disk? Am I reading this wrong?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> When you lose a disk, the ideal 
              situation is that you are notified and replace it before the machine 
              is down, or at least remove the replicas on the bad disk so that 
              100% are on the good disk. If the machine does go down before you 
              have a chance to fix or modify things, you can always boot single 
              user and remove the state database replicas from the failed disk 
              to continue booting. Let's assume that disk0 has failed and your 
              working mirror is at disk1. From the ok prompt, type:
            <p> 
            <pre>
boot disk1
</pre>
            You'll see the following output:
            <p> 
            <pre>

# metadb -d c0t0d0s7

</pre>
            Be sure that the dead state database replicas are gone:
            <p> 
            <pre>
# metadb
        flags         first blk   block count
     a m      lu      16          1034         /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s7
     a m      lu      1050        1034         /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s7
     a m      lu      2084        1034         /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s7
</pre>
            Finally, reboot the machine so it will come up automatically in multi-user 
            mode.
            <p> 
            <pre>
# reboot -- disk1
</pre>
            If you're only using DiskSuite to two-way mirror your boot drive, 
            you can also put the following into /etc/system as of DiskSuite 4.2.1:
            <p> 
            <pre>
set md:mirrored_root_flag=1
</pre>
            This will allow you to boot with only 50% of the replicas. If you're 
            doing more than mirror your boot drive, spread your replicas around 
            on each disk. You'll still run into issues if you've only got two 
            controllers and you've split your replicas evenly among them. When 
            you lose an entire controller, you'll have lost 50% again.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just set up a sendmail server 
              on my Linux system. When mail is sent to any account added since 
              install time, it fails with a "user unknown" message. Mail to accounts 
              like "root" and "daemon" work just fine, though. I suspect it's 
              the way I'm creating the accounts that's causing mail to fail, though 
              it's pretty vanilla. Here's a cut-and-paste of one of my adduser 
              sessions. Am I doing something wrong here?

</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Sendmail does not preserve case for 
            usernames by default. You can either not use uppercase in your usernames 
            (preferred), or you can work around the uppercase names. If you want 
            sendmail to remain case insensitive, you can create alias entries 
            of the form:
            <p> 
            <pre>
jdoe: JDoe
</pre>
            You can also change the behavior of sendmail to preserve case. If 
            you choose to do this, you may have issues with people who send your 
            users mail with alternate capitalization. To make the modification, 
            put the following in your .mc file and rebuild your .cf file (this 
            assumes that you're running a version of sendmail that will understand 
            this macro):

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Our site has both internal and external 
            DNS servers with different zone files. The internal server maps names 
            and IPs for our internal namespace and is used by people behind our 
            firewall. The external nameserver serves the Internet at large and 
            contains no information about our internal hosts. Due to consolidation 
            and cutbacks, we will now be left with one set of machines to run 
            DNS on. What's the best way to do split DNS only using one machine? 
            How do we reconcile different zone file contents for the same domain 
            name? Is running two named processes in different chrooted directories 
            the best way to go, or is there something different/better?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> While you can use one machine 
              with two named processes, the most elegant way to achieve your goal 
              is to use BIND 9 and views. This will integrate your split DNS zones 
              under one named process. A view is a name space that's tagged by 
              IP addresses or TSIG keys instead of relying on two different listening 
              sockets. A configuration example of views split by IP (if your internal 
              range is 192.168.1.0/24) would be:
            <p> 
            <pre>
view "internal" {
  match-clients { 192.168.1.0/24; };
  recursion yes;
  zone "your.domain" {
    type master;
    file "/var/named/internal/your.domain";
  };
};


view "external" {
  match-clients { !192.168.1.0/24; };
  recursion no;
  zone "your.domain" {
    type master;
    file "/var/named/external/your.domain";
  };
};
</pre>
            You'll also need one hint zone statement per view, as well. When you 
            want to transfer both views to a slave server, both the slave and 
            the master should have two sets of IP addresses. You can then request 
            a transfer based on the source IP. See the FAQ that comes with the 
            BIND 9 source for specific examples.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have been using the following 
              guide from SANS on securing Solaris 8:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.sans.org/y2k/practical/Jeff_Campione_GCUX.htm
</pre>
            This guide recommends that separate filesystems be made for /dev and 
            /devices at install time. I did not do the original install, so I'm 
            trying to modify this after the fact. The one time I tried it, followed 
            by boot -r, the boot just hung. Can you detail how this should be 
            done after the initial install, or do I need to reinstall the machine 
            from scratch?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can NOT put /dev and /devices 
              on anything but the root partition. In fact, there are several incorrect 
              pieces of information in this document, and I would suggest not 
              using it at all. If you're looking for information on securing your 
              Solaris 8 machines, take a look at the Sun Blueprints article:
