           <p> This issue of <i>Sys Admin</i> contains several articles describing 
              useful tools and techniques for Web administration. John Duncan 
              shows how to unify Web clusters with Spread. Peter Dintelmann and 
              Mohammed Kabir share Apache configuration tips, and Dustin Anders 
              demonstrates how to use Squid and Apache to block Web banner ads.
            <p> Joe "Zonker" Brockmeier, occasional contributor to <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              and UnixReview.com's "Open Road" columnist, recently wrote an article 
              for NewsFactor.com titled "The Rogue DNS Phenomenon". In the article, 
              Brockmeier talks about OpenNIC, an alternative to ICANN (Internet 
              Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), which is the international 
              body in charge of managing the Internet's domain name system. Brockmeier 
              explains, "At the end of each domain name is a Top Level Domain 
              (TLD). Right now, the most widely used system is controlled by ICANN 
              and includes the TLDs with which most people are familiar, such 
              as .com, .net, and .org." Other familiar names, such as .edu, .mil, 
              and .gov are administered separately by their own NICs.
            <p> Brockmeier writes, "Like ICANN, OpenNIC (<b>http://www.opennic.unrated.net/</b>) 
              governs registration for domains under its purview. OpenNIC registrars 
              maintain the technical information required for users to query DNS 
              servers with the name of a domain and then receive the proper IP 
              address in response." According to their Web site, OpenNIC is a 
              user owned and controlled alternative that offers top level domains, 
              such as .indy, .geek, .null, .oss, and .parody. Descriptions of 
              the intended use of these domain names are given on the Web site. 
              For many users, Brockmeier notes, "the concept of using an alternate 
              DNS system might sound a bit dodgy, but reaching OpenNIC's namespace 
              is not as hard as one might think. All you need to do is add one 
              or more of OpenNIC's DNS servers to your operating system's DNS 
              list. Once you have set up your OS to use an OpenNIC nameserver, 
              reaching sites within its namespace is a transparent process." As 
              Brockmeier points out, it's always nice to know there are alternatives.
