            <p> MTI Technology Corp. and Quantum Corp. teamed to offer an integrated 
              backup/recovery solution incorporating the Quantum DX30, a new high-capacity 
              disk-based enhanced backup system that emulates a tape library.

              installation and maintenance. MTI's DataSentry VTL can help protect 
              investments in backup procedures and equipment, enabling an enterprise 
              to continue traditional tape operations for off-site storage and 
              long-term archiving using its existing tape libraries. Together, 
              MTI's management processor and Quantum's DX30 provide a full-service 
              backup platform. The Quantum DX30's performance allows the unit 
              to initiate file restores within seconds and recover a 280-gigabyte 
              application server in less than an hour.

            <p> <b>Procom Introduces ProMobile</b>
            <p> Procom Technology recently introduced ProMobile, a backup system 
              for notebook and desktop computers that can also be used for external 
              storage. According to the company, the portable, pocket-sized system 
              is available with capacities of 20, 30, 40 and 60 gigabytes and 
              is a complete software and hardware solution that simply plugs into 
              the computer's USB interface. It automatically scans the source 
              drive, copying only those files that have been changed or newly 
              created since the last backup was performed. ProMobile enables users 
              to access lost data files, in native format, and to keep working 
              even if the computer fails. With a compression option, drive space 
              can be further optimized.
