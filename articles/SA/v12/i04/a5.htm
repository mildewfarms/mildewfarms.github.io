              and Answers</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We've finally upgraded our Web 
              browser software on our user machines (FreeBSD 4.7-STABLE, if it 
              matters) from Netscape 4.x to Mozilla 1.1. My users are unhappy 
              with two key things, though. They are used to using the backspace 
              key as page up, and opening new Web locations with ALT-o. Neither 
              of these things works anymore, and I've been unable to find a way 
              to change the default behavior from ALT-o doing an Open File, and 
              backspace doing nothing at all. Do you have any pointers on how 
              to customize these things? I've already dug through tons of documentation 
              on Mozilla's Web pages and am more dazed than helped.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Since you said that ALT-o does 
              an Open File, I'm guessing that you've already figured out that 
              to change the default accel modifier key from Control to ALT, you 
              must add the following to the users' prefs.js files:
            <p> 
            <pre>
user_pref("ui.key.accelKey", 18);
user_pref("ui.key.menuAccessKey", 0);
</pre>
            The first line changes the accel key to ALT (as far as I know, the 
            name for the key, VK_ALT, doesn't work yet), and the second line turns 
            off the ALT menu access.
            <p> To change the Open Location key sequence back to ALT-o, you need 
              to change /usr/X11R6/lib/mozilla/chrome/comm.jar. First, unzip comm.jar:
            <p> 
            <pre>
unzip comm.jar
</pre>
            This should leave you with a directory called content. Edit the file 
            /usr/X11R6/lib/mozilla/chrome/content/navigator/navigatorOverlay.xul. 
            Since ALT-o is already claimed by Open File, we'll change Open File 
            to be Shift-ALT-o. Change the following lines:
            <p> 
            <pre>
&lt;key id="openLocationKb"   key="&amp;openCmd.commandkey;" \
  command="Browser:Open" modifiers="accel,shift"/&gt;
&lt;key id="openFileKb"         key="&amp;openFileCmd.commandkey;" \
  command="Browser:OpenFile"  modifiers="accel"/&gt;
</pre>
            to:
            <p> 
            <pre>
&lt;key id="openLocationKb"   key="o" command="Browser:Open" \
  modifiers="accel"/&gt;
&lt;key id="openFileKb"         key="&amp;openFileCmd.commandkey;" \
  command="Browser:OpenFile"  modifiers="accel,shift"/&gt;
</pre>
            Instead of specifying the actual ASCII character o in the openLocationKb 
            tag, you can use key="&amp;openFileCmd.commandkey;" (which is currently 
            defined as "o"), but I'd be more concerned about that changing in 
            the future and just stick with hard-coding key="o".
            <p> Now move the old jar file aside, and create the new one from your 
              recently edited files:
            <p> 
            <pre>
cd /usr/X11R6/lib/mozilla/chrome/
mv comm.jar comm.jar.orig
zip -r comm.jar content
rm -rf content
</pre>
            To address the issue of using backspace as PageUp, create the file 
            /usr/X11R6/lib/mozilla/res/builtin/userHTMLBindings.xml with the following 
            contents:
            <p> 
            <pre>
&lt;bindings id="htmlBindings"
   xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/xbl"
   xmlns:xul="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&gt;
       
         &lt;binding id="browserUser"&gt;
           &lt;handlers&gt;
             &lt;handler event="keypress" keycode="VK_BACK" command="cmd_scrollPageUp" /&gt;
           &lt;/handlers&gt;
         &lt;/binding&gt;
       &lt;/bindings&gt;
     </pre>
            For more information on the specific customizations you can make to 
            the key bindings, take a look at:

            users are after.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've installed a homegrown syslog 
              daemon that will handle correlating syslog entries from many hosts 
              into various files. I'm looking for a way to generate a bunch of 
              syslog messages on each of my machines to test the new syslog daemon, 
              but I don't want to actually cause hardware or software failures, 
              per se. Do you know of some sort of program or script I can use 
              create my own syslog entries to test things out?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Most UNIX distributions come 
              with a program called logger, an interactive interface to the syslog 
              daemon. Assuming you're still using the same sorts of constructs 
              in your homegrown syslogd, then this should also work for you.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're on a very tight budget at 
              work, and as part of this, management has decreed that the machine 
              room will no longer have 24x7 air conditioning during the winter 
              months. Their reasoning is that it's cold enough outside that we 
              shouldn't have to cool the machine room. Obviously, I think this 
              reasoning is ludicrous, but I'm stuck with it. I want to make sure 
              that if the machine room <i>does</i> get too warm, someone is notified 
              and can manually take care of things. I hope this will have the 
              added benefit of showing management how wrong they are when we can 
              graph out some stats for them and show them how often the room overheats. 
              Can you suggest what software and hardware I might need to accomplish 
              this sort of monitoring? We have a variety of Sun machines that 
              we could add something onto, if need be.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Depending on what type of Sun 
              hardware you have, you can get temperature information about the 
              CPU and various boards inside the machine (which is what you're 
              really interested in, not the ambient temperature of the room) from 
              the output of <b>/usr/platform/'/bin/uname -i'/sbin/prtdiag -v</b>. 
              You can only get environmental output from the larger Ultra SPARC 
              hardware, though.
            <p> Another option for which you may already have the hardware is 
              monitoring the environmental conditions from your UPS. Many larger 
              UPSes can be polled via SNMP and will contain information about 
              room temperature. The same goes for a variety of networking equipment.
            <p> If you can use existing hardware to obtain your temperature information, 
              you can write a script that will tie into your monitoring system 
              or, if you don't have one, just page or email you directly. If you 
              need to roll your own monitoring scripts, something like Expect 
              comes in very handy.
            <p> If you don't have anything that can already read the temperature 
              for you, then you can purchase an RS-232 monitor and hook it up 
              to one of your Suns. You can also get Ethernet-based monitors that 
              will just plug into your network. Generally, you need a modem to 
              go along with them if you want them to directly page you. Some commercially 
              available products are:

            A company called Spiderplant used to put out a product called the 
            Hot Little Therm. Sadly, Spiderplant has suspended operations and 
            is no longer selling these, but you might be able to find one used. 
            Or, their site includes directions for making your own, if you're 
            so inclined:

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've just been hired at a company 
            that has an Extreme Alpine 3808 switch to which they have no admin 
            password. Is there a way to recover it?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You need physical access to the 
              machine to recover the password. Connect to the console port on 
              the switch and use some sort of terminal emulation software. The 
              RS-232 settings you want are 8n1, no flow control. Once you've established 
              a serial connection to the switch, you need to do a hard reboot 
              (power cycle) while holding down the space bar. This should bring 
              up the bootrom menu. If you type "h" at the Bootrom-&gt; prompt, 
              you should see the following menu:
            <p> 
            <p> 1: Select primary code image<br>
              2: Select secondary code image<br>
              3: Select primary configuration<br>
              4: Select secondary configuration<br>
              b: Change baud rate<br>
              d: Force default configuration<br>
              f: Boot on board flash<br>
              h: Help<br>
              k: Erase selected configuration<br>
              p: Boot PCMCIA cards:<br>
              s: Load code image from serial port using XMODEM
            <p> 
            <p> Choose option "1," the primary code image. After the image has 
              been selected, choose "k" to erase it. If you're trying to reset 
              the switch to factory defaults, choose the secondary code image 
              and then choose "k" to erase that as well. When you're done erasing 
              the code images, choose "d" to force the default configuration and 
              then "f" to boot the onboard flash. After the switch resets, enter 
              "admin" at the login prompt. Hit enter twice to enter a blank password 
              at the password prompt. You should then be logged in with admin 
              access.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running FreeBSD 4.6-STABLE, 
              and I'm removing a number of files that I don't want or need, like

</pre>
            Why am I unable to remove this file? Is there something wrong with 
            my install or hardware?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The system immutable flag is 
              set on /bin/rcp. If you have kern_securelevel_enable=YES and kern_securelevel 
              set to something other than -1 or 0 in /etc/rc.conf, then you must 
              boot to single-user mode to remove the file. If you don't have kern_securelevel_enable=YES 
              or kern_securelevel is set to -1 or 0, then you can do the following 
              to remove the file:

            <pre>

            <pre>
ls -lo /bin/rcp

            There's also a clearer message when you try to remove a file that

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a large number of Sun E250s 
            that we just purchased from a failed dotcom. Unlike our Netras, these 
            don't have LOM for remote administration. Is there some sort of setting 
            or program I can change or install to get similar functionality?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Take a look at Sun's Remote System 
              Control (RSC):
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://docs.sun.com/db/coll/383.1?q=E250+RSC
</pre>
            The RSC software works with the System Service Processor (SSP) on 
            the Sun E250 main logic board. You can access RSC using an Ethernet 
            connection, and you can also install a dedicated modem connected to 
            the RSC serial port for dial-up access. For increased security, you 
            can specify the sys admin's dial-back number if the modem supports 
            this feature.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an AIX 4.3 box and a Red 
              Hat 7 box sitting on different networks, connected by an IPSec tunnel. 
              Things like NFS over TCP seem to work fine but interactive sessions 
              like ssh on the AIX side frequently die with an EMSGSIZE error. 
              It appears that something is misconfigured, but I'm not sure what. 
              Any pointers?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It sounds like you're having 
              Path MTU Discovery issues. For two hosts communicating across a 
              network, a transmitted packet becomes fragmented if its size is 
              greater than the smallest MTU of any network in the path. Because 
              packet fragmentation can result in reduced network performance, 
              it is desirable to avoid fragmentation by transmitting packets with 
              a size is no greater than the smallest MTU in the network path. 
              This size is called the path MTU. Since routes can change dynamically, 
              the path MTU value for a path might also change over time. Decreases 
              in the path MTU value will result in packet fragmentation and a 
              possible loss of connection.
            <p> To fix this, turn off the active PMTUD on both the Linux box and 
              the AIX box, and see if that helps. I think you can do this on the 
              Linux box by creating the file /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc 
              with the contents of 1. For AIX, the path MTU discovery can be disabled 
              for TCP and UDP applications by modifying the <b>tcp_pmtu_discover</b> 
              and <b>udp_pmtu_discover</b> options of the no command. These commands 
              can be put at the end of /etc/rc.tcpip, for example:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/sbin/no   -o tcp_pmtu_discover=0
/usr/sbin/no   -o udp_pmtu_discover=0
</pre>
            When enabled for TCP, path MTU discovery will automatically force 
            the size of all packets transmitted by TCP applications to not exceed 
            the path MTU.
            <p> Since UDP applications themselves determine the size of their 
              transmitted packets, UDP applications must be specifically written 
              to utilize path MTU information by using the IP_FINDPMTU socket 
              option, even if the <b>udp_pmtu_discover no</b> option is enabled. 
              By default, the <b>tcp_pmtu_discover</b> and <b>udp_pmtu_discover</b> 
              options are disabled on AIX 4.2.1 through AIX 4.3.1, and enabled 
              on AIX 4.3.2 and later. Most likely, you are running AIX 4.3.2 or 
              later and have not changed the default settings.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running Bind 8.2.4 on a Sun 
              Netra T1 running Solaris 8. I've put a new NS record for an Active 
              Directory subdomain into the zone file for my.domain. The zone loads 
              fine, queries to the master work fine, but slave machines don't 
              have the NS record in the zone file. I've verified that the slaves 
              are actually getting the latest version of the zone file by watching 
              the AXFR take place and looking at the serial number before and 
              after the transfer. There are no errors in the log files that I 
              can see. I'm wondering if Bind is having a problem with the Active 
              Directory names (since they do have underscores in them) and is 
              just not putting out any error messages. Any way I can further debug 
              and fix this?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You're correct in your assessment 
              of the problem. Bind, in later versions, is strict about ignoring 
              hosts with underscores in them (compliance with RFC 2181). If you 
              can, change the underscores to hyphens. If you can't change them 
              because of the installed Active Directory user base, you can get 
              around this issue by doing the following in /etc/named.conf:
            <p> 
            <pre>
options { check-names ignore; };
</pre>
            You can limit this statement to the scope of a zone {} block if you 
            want to skip checking names for ONLY your Active Directory zones. 
            You can at least check your other zones for compliance if you have 
            things separated. If you don't have your Active Directory zones separated 
            from the rest of your zones, I would highly suggest doing so.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> What's the best way to load new 
              configs/policies into NetScreen?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can pull your config changes 
              over from another machine via TFTP. This machine you TFTP from must 
              be listed in the manager-ip list first:
            <p> 
            <pre>
set admin manager-ip &lt;ip&gt; &lt;netmask&gt;
save config from tftp &lt;ip&gt; &lt;file&gt; to flash
</pre>
            After pulling over the new config information, I highly recommend 
            a reboot if you can afford the small bit of downtime. If you want 
            to merge the new config with your running one, there is also an option 
            to do:
            <p> 
            <pre>
save config from tftp &lt;ip&gt; &lt;file&gt; merge
</pre>
