            <p> In February, when this column was written, the U.S. Department 
              of Homeland Security released its "National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace" 
              (<b>http://www.whitehouse.gov/pcipb/</b>). Among other things, the 
              plan encourages companies to regularly review their technology security 
              policies as part of an overall strategy for protecting computer 
              systems from attacks.
            <p> You do have a security policy, don't you? If not, it's high time. 
              The need for a thorough, up-to-date, enforceable security policy 
              within every organization can hardly be overstated, and there are 
              many resources to help systems administrators facilitate development 
              of such policies.
            <p> SANS (<b>http://www.sans.org</b>) maintains a security policy 
              resource page that provides general guidelines, links, and templates, 
              along with a security policy primer describing how to build a security 
              policy from the ground up. The security policy primer was taken 
              from Michele Guel's certification course -- a foundation course 
              for those seeking to become Certified Information Security Officers. 
              Guel states the objectives of a security policy as follows: to define 
              appropriate behavior; to set the stage in terms of necessary tools 
              and procedures; to communicate a consensus; and to provide a foundation 
              for response to inappropriate action. These are broad objectives 
              that must be broken down into manageable chunks. To help, the SANS 
              resource page also offers sample security documents covering specific 
              policy topics, including encryption, acceptable use, application 
              service providers, auditing, remote access, and wireless communication.
            <p> As part of its "Short Topics in System Administration" series, 
              SAGE (The System Administrators Guild, <b>http://www.sage.org</b>) 
              offers <i>A Guide to Developing Computing Policy Documents</i>. 
              This booklet explains why every site needs a policy, what a policy 
              document should contain, who should draft it, and to whom it should 
              apply. This booklet provides comprehensive guidelines for computing 
              policy in general, one subset of which is computing security. The 
              SAGE site also provides an online computing policy template that 
              outlines essential areas of coverage.
            <p> The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) site also provides 
              a guide to developing computer security policies and procedures 
              in RFC 2196 (<b>http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2196.txt?Number=2196</b>). 
              This document covers such topics as risk assessment, firewalls, 
              authentication, security services and procedures, incident handling, 
              and confidentiality. Other sites providing relevant policy information 
              and guidelines are the Computer Security Resource Center (<b>http://www.csrc.nist.gov</b>) 
              and the COAST Security Archive (<b>http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/coast/archive/</b>). 
              I encourage you to check out these resources and review your organization's 
              security policies on a regular basis.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
