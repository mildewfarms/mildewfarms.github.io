            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> The sendmail documentation seems 
              very incomplete in explaining the difference between an MSP and 
              an MSA. Can you tell me what these are (besides just expanding the 
              abbreviations)?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> A bit of history will probably 
              best help explain what an MSA (mail submission agent) actually is. 
              SMTP was originally designed as a way to route and deliver complete 
              mail messages between machines. Mail transfer agents (MTAs) were 
              meant to handle SMTP transactions and not meant to modify the message 
              beyond adding a few headers. Because many mail user agents (MUAs) 
              like Outlook, Netscape, and others try to inject mail directly to 
              the MTA, it now has to examine the message and possibly perform 
              header and body modifications. The "program" that modifies 
              the message is now known as the MSA. In sendmail, the MTA and the 
              MSA are part of the same binary (sendmail). The MTA runs on port 
              25 while the MSA generally runs on port 587. For more detailed information 
              about the MSA protocol, see RFC 2476:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2476.html
</pre>
            Confusingly, the sendmail binary once again does double duty as the 
            MSP (mail submission program) binary. When called as an MSP, sendmail 
            reads the configuration file submit.cf instead of the configuration 
            file sendmail.cf. The MSP evolved from the security-motivated desire 
            to remove the SUID bit from the sendmail binary. Instead of needing 
            to be root to write to /var/spool/mqueue, the sendmail binary is now 
            SGID smmsp, and the local clientmqueue directory (/var/spool/clientmqueue 
            by default) is owned by the smmsp user and group. The MSP is invoked 
            by programs or users on the local machine in order to inject email 
            to this local queue directory. The MSP does not run as a daemon and 
            cannot accept connections from remote machines, unlike the MTA and 
            MSA.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to use the shell 
              command <b>join</b>. It has an option (<b>-t</b>), which accepts 
              a character as field delimiter. I'd like the data to be tab 
              delimited, but my shell interprets the tab key as file completion. 
              I tried the following ways to specify a tab on the command line:
            <p> 
            <pre>
join -t '\t' file1 file2
join -t 'echo '\t'' file1 file2
</pre>
            These don't seem to work here, even though I've had success 
            with this syntax using other shell commands. How do you specify the 
            tab character?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It sounds like your version of 
              <b>join</b> (you don't mention your OS) does not use \t to 
              represent a tab character. I suggest you output the tab character 
              by using the terminal's <b>lnext</b> key followed by the tab 
              key. To find out what your <b>lnext</b> key is mapped to, use <b>stty 
              -a</b> (generally it's control-v, as shown in the output below):
            <p> 
            <pre>
stty -a
speed 38400 baud; 56 rows; 80 columns;
lflags: icanon isig iexten echo echoe echok echoke -echonl echoctl
   -echoprt -altwerase -noflsh -tostop -flusho pendin -nokerninfo
   -extproc
iflags: -istrip icrnl -inlcr -igncr ixon -ixoff ixany imaxbel -ignbrk
   brkint -inpck -ignpar -parmrk
oflags: opost onlcr -ocrnl -oxtabs -onocr -onlret
cflags: cread cs8 -parenb -parodd hupcl -clocal -cstopb -crtscts -dsrflow
   -dtrflow -mdmbuf
cchars: discard = ^O; dsusp = &lt;undef&gt;; eof = ^D; eol = &lt;undef&gt;;
   eol2 = &lt;undef&gt;; erase = ^H; erase2 = ^H; intr = ^C; kill = ^U;
   lnext = ^V; min = 1; quit = ^\; reprint = ^R; start = ^Q;
   status = ^T; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; time = 0; werase = ^W;
</pre>
            So you'd get the embedded tab by doing:
            <p> 
            <pre>
join -t'^V&lt;tab&gt;' file1 file2
</pre>
            If you want a portable method for a script, you can also use <b>tr</b> 
            to set a variable called TAB and then use that as the argument to 
            <b>join -t</b>:
            <p> 
            <pre>
TAB=$(echo x|tr x '\9')
join -t"${TAB}" file1 file2
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I am running BIND 9.2.2 on a Linux 
            machine. I would like to know how to restrict forwarding only to those 
            servers explicitly listed as forwarders. I don't want my server 
            querying the root servers if its forwarders cannot resolve a name.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You need to specify "forward 
              only" in the options section of your named.conf file, and then 
              specify your forwarders:
            <p> 
            <pre>
options {
  forward only;
  forwarders { ip1; ip2; ip3; };
}</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've been trying to get mod_rewite 
            to work with my Apache 1.3.27 setup without much success. I have the 
            following .htaccess file in the root of my document tree:
            <p> 
            <pre>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ info.php?s=$1
</pre>
            The last rule is supposed to send all requests to the info.php script. 
            <b>http://www.my.domain/root/dir2/dir3/</b> should be rewritten as 
            <b>http://www.my.domain/info.php?s=root/dir2/dir3</b>, for example. 
            But instead, I get:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.my.domain/info.php?s=info.php
</pre>
            I've read <b>http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html</b> 
            and I think I have things right, but obviously I've munged the 
            rewrite rule somehow. I'm not sure what the correct syntax is 
            or why mine fails. Can you help me with the right syntax?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Your syntax is indeed incorrect. 
              You need to specify the full path (relative to your docroot) to 
              info.php in your RewriteRule. Making sure that /full/path/to matches 
              whatever is right for your system, change your rule to:
            <p> 
            <pre>
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /full/path/to/info.php?s=$1
</pre>
            In your case, it looks like you want:
            <p> 
            <pre>
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /info.php?s=$1
</pre>
            Set the the RewriteLogLevel to 9 in httpd.conf for more log information 
            to show why this is necessary:
            <p> 
            <pre>
RewriteLog "/tmp/rewrite.log"
RewriteLogLevel 9
</pre>
            Without the full path to info.php, you'll see:
            <p> 
            <pre>

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm writing a new system where 
            a Perl script processes mail and changes the From: address to bounce-<b>&lt;something&gt;@my.domain</b>, 
            where <b>&lt;something&gt;</b> is a folder name. I then want to create 
            a bounce user and have each message directed to the appropriate folder. 
            For example, <b>bounce-foo</b> will go to the folder foo. This means 
            that I will need to have sendmail be able to handle <b>user-foo@address</b>-style 
            entries. How would I accomplish this?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Since you're writing this 
              from scratch, I highly recommend using <b>bounce+&lt;something&gt;@my.domain</b> 
              instead, since sendmail and local delivery agents like cyrus and 
              procmail have built-in support for user+detail handling. Using sendmail 
              with procmail or cyrus as the local delivery agent then makes your 
              task trivial. Take a look at the sendmail features file for more 
              information:

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm using bash 2.05b.0(8) on 
            a FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE machine. The commands executed from my .bashrc 
            (set -o, complete, etc.) are written to my .bash_history. This is 
            annoying because using the cursor keys to look at entries stored in 
            the history includes these commands from my .bashrc. I can't 
            believe that this is common practice, so what am I doing wrong? Here's 
            my .bashrc:

            <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Your problem lies in the fact that 
            you have <b>set -o history</b> in a sourced file. By default, sourcing 
            a file turns off history, but you've manually overridden that 
            behavior. Any commands you run in your .bashrc after that line will 
            be copied into your .bash_history file. Having that line in your .bashrc 
            also doesn't do what you want. It only turns on history for the 
            duration of the sourcing, not for the calling shell. History is on 
            by default in bash, so if you just remove that line from your .bashrc, 
            things should work as you expect.

            <b><font size="+2">A </font></b>First, I would strongly recommend 
            upgrading your version of BIND due to security reasons. The latest 
            version is 8.4.0. Failed updates are logged to the security category, 
            which you don't mention in your named.conf. Instead of tossing 
            all of the security notifications away, you may want to log them to 
            a different file. If so, you can add the following to your logging 
            section:
            <p> 
            <pre>
channel securitylog {
  file "/var/log/named.security";
  severity info;
};

category security { securitylog; };
</pre>
            If you just want to ignore them, you can route them to null, like 
            you did with your other categories:

category security { null; };

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have sendmail running on a Solaris

            when I'm just using IPv4 addresses, but when I try to use IPv6

DAEMON_OPTIONS('Name=MTA-v6, Family=inet6')       
</pre>
            If I take out the DAEMON_OPTIONS line above and replace it with:
            <p> 
            <pre>
DAEMON_OPTIONS('Name=MTA-v4, Family=inet')
</pre>
            things seem to work fine, but I'm no longer using IPv6.
            <p> If I comment out the INPUT_MAIL_FILTER but leave the DAEMON_OPTIONS('Name=MTA-v6, 
              Family=inet6') line in, then mail gets delivered over IPv6, 
              but it's not running MIMEDefang. Obviously, I don't have 
              the right sequence of declarations in here, or I've managed 
              to mess up the compile somehow. Any help would be appreciated.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Your version of MIMEDefang does 
              not support IPv6. IPv6 support was added to mimedefang.c's 
              mfconnect in version 2.31. If you grab a new source distribution, 
              read the accompanying docs and recompile, you should be able to 
              use the IPv6 addresses as well as the IPv4 ones. You can get the 
              latest source from:
            <p>

            Also, you say that you used the OS file to compile sendmail, but that's 
            not the default (you've removed the NIS information). You should 
            never edit the OS file directly. Any changes you make should instead 
            go into devtools/Site/site.config.m4.
