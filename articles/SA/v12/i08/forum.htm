            <p> The August issue contains articles on topics ranging from storage 
              to security to scripting. In this month's feature article, 
              Ed Schaefer, a frequent <i>Sys Admin</i> contributor and editor 
              of the Shell Corner column on UnixReview.com, shares a way to verify 
              that remote server sites are performing scheduled database backups, 
              while avoiding the use of troublesome "r" commands. In 
              other articles, Brad Bascom and Jason McCullough show how to connect 
              Solaris to various vendors' SANs, and Stephen Pierzchala looks 
              at some compression modules for Apache that can help reduce bandwidth.
            <p> Along with this August issue covering storage, we've included 
              a special supplement that focuses on clustering. This supplement 
              is sponsored by Hewlett Packard and contains a mix of contributed 
              articles from freelance authors as well as HP partners.
            <p> Rich Ferri has written two articles for the supplement highlighting 
              open source clustering projects of particular interest. Ferri's 
              "Secrets of openMosix" describes the openMosix project, 
              which promises to "transform an unwieldy and perhaps heterogeneous 
              pile of computers into a single efficient cluster computing resource" 
              that is also open and scalable. According to Ferri, this transformation 
              is based on kernel changes that provide a single system image cluster 
              and a scheduler that moves processes to the nodes based on a "least-loaded" 
              algorithm.
            <p> Ferri has also contributed, with co-author Brian Watson, an introduction 
              to the OpenSSI project. OpenSSI is an open source clustering project 
              that addresses three major clustering issues: high availability, 
              scalability, and manageability. The authors state: "What distinguishes 
              the OpenSSI project in the Linux space is its ambition and scope 
              -- it intends to become the definitive project that unites all 
              the Linux cluster factions." Other articles in the supplement 
              include "Data-sharing Architectures in the Linux Data Center" 
              by Matthew O'Keefe, "Industrial Strength Cluster Security 
              for an Open Source Price" by Neil Gorsuch, and "Integrating 
              Linux Clusters into The Grid" by Ian Lumb and Chris Smith.
            <p> As always, I hope you find these articles useful. If you have 
              comments or suggestions, please email me at: <b>aankerholz@cmp.com</b>. 
              I look forward to hearing from you.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
