            <p> InfoExpress announced that the latest version of the CyberGatekeeper 
              Suite offers policy enforcement for Web-based applications. According

              requirements are denied access to the company network.
            <p> A complete CyberGatekeeper system consists of the CyberGatekeeper 
              appliance, an agent running on remote systems, and a policy manager 
              to specify the requirements for remote desktop configurations. The 
              agent reports details back to the appliance, which decides whether 
              to allow or deny access. The policy manager supports multiple policies, 
              servers, and central management. For more information, visit: <i>http://www.infoexpress.com</i>.

            <p> <b>NRG Global Announces New Features in Sysload 4.5</b>
            <p> NRG Global's Sysload Enterprise Resource Manager module (ERM) 
              underwent a redesign for release 4.5 and now enables easy navigation 
              through different levels of information from enterprise resource 
              to system data. Users can quickly pinpoint drops in service levels 
              and facilitate immediate reaction. According to the company, Sysload's 
              new Agent Delivery module enables remote agent installation and 
              configuration, reducing installations on a large number of servers 
              from one day to a few hours.
            <p> The Sysload DataCenter module (SDC) extracts and consolidates 
              data collected by Sysload agents into a centralized Oracle or SQL 
              server database. SDC interfaces with popular reporting solutions 
              to produce personalized reports and advanced statistical analysis. 
              The information can be used for accounting projects or capacity 
              planning. Sysload's new SNMP interface enables other SNMP administration 
              software applications to poll Sysload data collection agents.
            <p> Sysload 4.5 covers all the latest OS and databases releases, and 
              Sysload's console now features a fresh design and user-friendly 
              dashboard options. For more information, visit: <i>http://www.NRGglobal.com</i>.
