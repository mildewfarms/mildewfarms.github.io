              Hi,
            <p> I had previously purchased a <i>Sys Admin</i> CD-ROM, and I'll 
              be purchasing the new update. I have a bunch of old <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              magazines that I would hate to throw away. There's still some useful 
              information in all of the issues.
            <p> Would you know of an organization where I could donate these old 
              issues? They really shouldn't go to waste.
            <p> Thanks,<br>
              Lou Avrami
            <p> 
            <p> 
           <i> Lou,</i>
            <p><i> Thank you very much for writing. It's always nice to hear from 
              a long-time reader. We suggest donating your old magazines to a

              Subject: Significant Mistake in your "Review of Current File Systems 
              and Volume Managers"<p>
              Dear Henry,
            <p> I'm writing to inform you of a significant error you have published 
              in your article in this month's <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine in your 
              article titled "Review of Current File Systems and Volume Managers".
            <p> In the section under Solaris File Systems you list VxFS/SANPOINT 
              Control. This is very inaccurate. SanPointControl, or SPC as we 
              call it, is a Fibre Channel device management tool, which allows 
              you to manage all the devices on your SAN from one management console 
              (provided the proper firmware, etc).
            <p> What you wanted to reference was SanPoint Foundation Suite. We 
              commonly refer to the combination of VxVM and VxFS as the Foundation 
              Suite, as they are so tightly integrated (though completely independent). 
              As such, with the advent of our Cluster Server solution, we used 
              the proprietary protocols that are used for VCS (Veritas Cluster 
              Server) to provide a framework where VxVM and VxFS can share file 
              and volume locking information, which leads us to the Cluster Volume 
              Manager and Cluster File System (which are NOT independent) in the 
              product we refer to as SanPoint Foundation Suite. A further correction 
              is that this product is only available on Solaris at this time.
            <p> Regards,<br>

            <p><i> Thanks for writing. I do not know what I was thinking, but 
              you are 100% correct. I kept using the wrong term and darn if I 
              did not know what was correct in the first place. I am very sorry 
              and will ask the editor to correct the online version.</i>

            <p> I am an Apple Macintosh user. I use MacOS 10.2.3/Darwin.
            <p> I see nothing about MY UNIX in your magazine. If you ever include 
              us Darwin users, unwanted as we seem to be with you, I will subscribe 
              to your magazine. No, I am not talking about the random article, 
              I mean regular articles like you have for Linux/SVR4 and the like. 
              If I am wrong, show me.

            <p><i> Thank you for writing to </i>Sys Admin<i>. As you are probably 
              aware, the articles in </i>Sys Admin<i>
            come solely from freelancers. We run a call for papers on general 
            topics every month, such as "Security" and "Networking", and we choose 
            articles from the proposals that we receive. We'd love to run more 
            articles about MacOS, but we receive very few Mac-related proposals.</i>
            <p><i> Would you be interested in writing an article for the magazine? 
              If so, please let me know. Or perhaps you could pass the information 
              to your colleagues that we're always looking for good contributed 
              articles.</i>

            <br> Subject: Soft partition article in <i>Sys Admin</i>
            <p> Dear Matt, <p>
			Sorry to bug you. But I was puzzled by one part of 
              your article and I was hoping you could straighten me out. For the 
              record I haven't had reason to use soft partitions yet, but that 
              might change in the future, so I'm trying to keep up to date on 
              this.
            <p> On page 20 of the article, you show how to create soft partitions 
              on a physical drive. I guess I'm a little confused by the results 
              of the <b>metastat</b> command. It shows that the d112 soft partition 
              starts at block 12582915 where the d111 soft partition started at 
              block 20971522. I had figured that the starting blocks for each 
              soft partition would sequentially increase. Is that wrong and if 
              so why?
            <p> Thanx for your time,<br>
              Stuart
            <p> 
            <p> <i>Hi Stuart,</i>
            <p><i> You are correct. Good catch! Here is what the <b>metastat</b> 
              should have looked like:</i>
