            <h1><b><img src="../../resource/questions.gif" width="150" height="150" align="right">Questions 
              and Answers</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running MIMEDefang with SpamAssassin 
              and sendmail 8.12.6. I've noticed that there are always a number 
              of MIMEDefang processes running, generally one for each sendmail 
              process. Each of these sendmail processes was handling a piece of 
              email from a domain listed as a spammer in /etc/mail/access. Shouldn't 
              these connections have been rejected altogether instead of firing 
              off a MIMEDefang process? If it's not this way by default, can I 
              change it so that so many processes don't get spawned?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Depending on when the check occurs, 
              your MIMEDefang milter might still be invoked at connection time. 
              If you blacklist a sender, for example, the milter is still invoked 
              at connection and HELO time. Sendmail doesn't know to reject the 
              sender until "MAIL FROM:". These processes shouldn't be taking up 
              much in the way of resources beyond those needed to spawn the process 
              itself. If your machine is being swamped by this, you may want to 
              take a look at the mimedefang-multiplexor. The multiplexor only 
              spawns a new process when it actually has data to pass to it.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We want users on our Solaris 8 
              machine, sheridan, to be able to <b>chown</b> their files to other 
              users on the same machine. We ran into a problem doing this, and 
              found information saying that we needed to set <b>rstchown</b> to 
              0 in <b>/etc/system</b>. We did this on sheridan, and things seemed 
              to be working great on the filesystems that are automounted locally. 
              However, we're having issues again trying to make this work on files 
              that are automounted from another Solaris 8 machine, sinclair. We've 
              made sure that sinclair is exporting this filesystem rw,suid and 
              that sheridan is mounting it as such. We tested the local and NFS-mounted 
              files with the exact same users, groups, and file and directory 
              permissions. No dice. Is it impossible to have this work over NFS, 
              or do we need to export the files differently?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you're trying to have users 
              <b>chown</b> their files over to other users on an NFS share, then 
              the machine exporting the share must also have <b>rstchown</b> set 
              to 0 in <b>/etc/system</b>. The check happens on the machine that 
              the filesystem is local to, not where it happens to be mounted.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We are setting up a Veritas VCS 
              cluster system with Sybase with an application layered on top. How 
              do I disable Sybase cron jobs on the inactive system and failover 
              cron to the standby server when Sybase and the application get failed 
              over? I want to make sure that the cron jobs are only available 
              and running on the active server, so there is no corruption.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Sybase cron jobs check for the 
              existence of the script or Sybase processes and abort if they're 
              not found. You can use this to your advantage by storing the cron 
              jobs in files on the local disk on the active machine in your cluster. 
              If the file doesn't exist, it knows it's not on the active server 
              and the cron job won't run.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm being annoyed by a spammer 
              using 216.39.112.0/20. It's more than a class C-sized space, but 
              not an entire class B-sized space. Is there a way to block IPs at 
              the CIDR level in the sendmail access list, or do I have to list 
              all 16 of the class C-sized spaces by hand?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There is no way to actually put 
              CIDR blocks directly into your access map, since it would cause 
              a great deal of overhead in the sendmail lookup code. The lookup 
              code runs for <i>all</i> lookups, not just those in your CIDR block, 
              so you'd see a significant performance hit. You can, however, use 
              the <b>cidrexpand</b> Perl script located in the sendmail contrib 
              directory to generate the entries you need on the fly. In your <b>/etc/mail/access</b> 
              file, place the following CIDR entry along with any other access 
              statements you currently use:
            <p> 
            <pre>
216.39.112.0/20
</pre>
            Instead of rebuilding your access map with:
            <p> 
            <pre>
makemap hash access &lt; access
</pre>
            Rebuild your access map with:
            <p> 
            <pre>
cidrexpand &lt; /etc/mail/access | makemap hash /etc/mail/access
</pre>
            To save yourself some time, modify <b>/etc/mail/Makefile</b> to run 
            the <b>cidrexpand</b> command. Also check to see whether your init 
            script is running <b>makemap</b> at boot time, and modify that as 
            well.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've done a default install of 
              Apache fresh out of the box. When I start Apache with <b>apachectl 
              start</b>, it displays the following error:
            <p> 
            <pre>
/usr/local/bin/apachectl[62]: sin: 0403-009 number incorrect for this command
</pre>
            Line 57 of <b>apachectl</b> is just:
            <p> 
            <pre>
$ULIMIT_MAX_FILES
</pre>
            I'm not sure why this is failing. The same install works on a similar 
            machine that I have.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> I've seen other people claim 
              to have this issue with non-English locales on AIX. Are you perhaps 
              running a non-English locale, but you just translated the message 
              for the question? The reason it fails on a non-English version of 
              AIX because of an issue with <b>ulimit</b>.
            <p> You'll see the following command defined for ULIMIT_MAX_FILES 
              on various systems:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ULIMIT_MAX_FILES="ulimit -S -n 'ulimit -H -n'"
</pre>
            This first runs <b>ulimit -H -n</b> to discover the hard limit for 
            number of file descriptors. Then <b>ulimit -S -n</b> is run with the 
            discovered hard limit as an argument. This sets the soft limit for 
            the number of file descriptors as high as possible. If the hard limit 
            is unlimited, AIX will translate the word "ulimited" to the local 
            language. However, AIX will not accept a translated "ulimited" as 
            the parameter to "ulimit -S -n".
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to compile some software 
              on Solaris 8. The software needs to link against BerkeleyDB, but 
              it's not finding the libraries when it goes to link. I'm fairly 
              certain that this is because BerkeleyDB puts things in the awful 
              and non-standard place of <b>/usr/local/BerkeleyDB</b>. Can I globally 
              change my LD_LIBRARY_PATH so I can easily compile this and other 
              software with BerkeleyDB?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> In Solaris 8 and up, there's 
              a program called <b>crle</b> (configure runtime linking environment). 
              Without any arguments, it displays the current config file contents. 
              You can add a directory to the linking environment by using the 
              <b>-l</b> switch to <b>crle</b>. For example, if you run <b>crle</b> 
              on a system that has only the defaults, you'll see:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Default configuration file (/var/ld/ld.config) not found
  Default Library Path (ELF):   /usr/lib  (system default)
  Trusted Directories (ELF):    /usr/lib/secure  (system default)
</pre>
            If you want to add <b>/usr/local/BerkeleyDB/lib</b>, for example, 
            you would run:
            <p> 
            <pre>
crle -l /usr/lib:/usr/local/BerkeleyDB/lib
</pre>
            This creates the default config file, <b>/var/ld/ld.config</b>, and 
            explicitly states which libraries should be in the default search 
            path. Be sure to always include <b>/usr/lib</b>, or you'll definitely 
            have issues. If you now run just <b>crle</b> again, you'll see the 
            output:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Configuration file [3]: /var/ld/ld.config 
  Default Library Path (ELF):   /usr/lib:/usr/local/BerkeleyDB/lib
  Trusted Directories (ELF):    /usr/lib/secure  (system default)

Command line:
  crle -c /var/ld/ld.config -l /usr/lib:/usr/local/lib
  </pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm looking for a way to do secure 
            file service between my Linux machine and another one that's at a 
            different site. Any suggestions?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You might want to take a look 
              at LUFS, a hybrid userspace Linux filesystem framework, at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lufs
</pre>
            It consists of a kernel module and a userspace daemon. They've used 
            the OpenSSH infrastructure to develop SSHFS, and they have other interesting 
            userspace layers in the works, such as socketfs, httpfs, webdavfs, 
            and freenetfs. LUFS is currently in beta, but it looks pretty active 
            and seems to have a lot of potential.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I am using <b>procmail</b> on 
              Red Hat 7.0 and experiencing some issues with one of my recipes. 
              My intent was to save a copy of the message and send back a reply 
              to the sender with a subject and body indicating that the mail was 
              rejected. I've tried the following rule:
            <p> 
            <pre>
:0H
*  ^Subject.*(test spam)
{  
  :0
      spam

  :0:formail4.lock
    | (formail -rt -I"Subject: We do not accept spam." \
      -A"From: abuse@this.domain" \
      -A"Reply-To: spam@this.domain" \
      -A"X-Loop: abuse@mthis.domain" ;\
      cat /etc/mail/spamreply ) \
      | /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -N never -R hdrs || true
}
</pre>
            A copy of the message is saved in the spam folder, but the bounce 
            is never sent back to the sender. I thought that you could use <b>procmail</b> 
            to do multiple things to one message.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You can use <b>procmail</b> to 
              perform as many delivery actions as you want. What you're missing 
              is the <b>c</b> flag to let <b>procmail</b> know that you're going 
              to keep a copy for the next action. From the procmailrc man page:
            <p> <b>c</b> Generate a carbon copy of this mail. This only makes 
              sense on delivering recipes. The only non-delivering recipe this 
              flag has an effect on is on a nesting block, in order to generate 
              a carbon copy this will clone the running <b>procmail</b> process 
              (lockfiles will not be inherited), whereby the clone will proceed 
              as usual and the parent will jump across the block.
            <p> You don't need to explicitly name your lockfile in the second 
              delivery recipe. You will want to place another colon after the 
              <b>c </b>so that you have a lockfile for writing to your local mail 
              spool, though. Your block should look like:
            <p>

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm writing a script in Perl 5.8.0 
            that reads in files with Latin1 characters in them. I do not want 
            Perl to convert these characters to the default locale that the OS 
            ships with. I don't want the users to have to change their LANG to 
            C to make this script work correctly. My script should just treat 
            the contents of these files as simple bytes with no interpretation.
            <p> I've tried all kinds of variants of <b>use bytes</b>, calling 
              <b>setlocale</b>, and setting <b>$ENV{LANG}</b> within the program, 
              and nothing seems to work. Here's an example of the problem area 
              of the script:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5.8.0 -w

use strict;
use bytes;

sub readwrite {
  local *TFILE;
  open (TFILE, "&lt;testfile") || die;
  while (&lt;TFILE&gt;) {
    print "&lt;&lt;  $_";
  }
  close TFILE;
}

readwrite();
 
1;
</pre>
            The file testfile includes alphanumerics, and one with a letter with 
            a grave accent. When I run the above script, it converts the output.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You need to use <b>binmode</b> 
              to set the mode of the file you're reading to <b>:bytes</b>, and 
              you also need to set the mode of <b>STDOUT</b> to either <b>:bytes</b> 
              or <b>:utf8</b>, or whatever your xterm (or other) will understand. 
              If you don't explicitly state what the mode of <b>STDOUT</b> should 
              be, it will inherit the system default. Try this as your subroutine:
            <p> 
            <pre>
sub readwrite {
  local *TFILE;
  open (TFILE, "&lt;testfile") || die;
  binmode(TFILE, ":bytes");
  binmode(STDOUT, ":bytes");
  while (&lt;TFILE&gt;) {
    print "&lt;&lt;  $_";
  }
  close TFILE;
}</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have a few V880 Solaris 8 boxes 
            where Oracle mysteriously gets reniced to -20. Sometimes, there are 
            a bunch of long running, intensive jobs that nearly kill the active 
            machine. Is something doing this automatically, or do I need to try 
            and track down the users who are upping the priority of their jobs? 
            Perhaps there's an Oracle setting I can tweak? I haven't been able 
            to find any documentation on this phenomenon.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You mention "the active machine". 
              I would bet that you are running Veritas Cluster on your Suns. VCS 
              is known to have this behavior. It starts all agents and subprocesses 
              at the highest possible priority. Changing the <b>ScriptPriority</b> 
              in the VCS resource settings modifies the nice level of the "online" 
              and other scripts, which becomes inherited by the Oracle processes 
              themselves. The range for the <b>ScriptPriority</b> on Solaris is 
              from -60 to 60. Assuming you're running a TS (timeshare) process 
              rather than a RT (realtime) process, a priority of 0 maps to the 
              standard user nice level of 0.
