            <p> I'm a little late with my "state of the magazine" 
              address. Typically, I would have written this column for the January 
              issue, but at the time, I thought if I waited a while, the market 
              would improve and spread a healing balm over the technology industry. 
              Although the market has not improved, <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine 
              is adapting to changes and doing well.
            <p> Some of you have written to me asking why our magazine has gotten 
              so small (fewer pages, smaller trim size, etc.). These measures 
              were taken last year partly in response to a company-wide mandate 
              to reduce printing costs. The reduced number of pages, however, 
              is a direct result of a decrease in advertising support. Our April 
              issue reflected a healthy surge -- you may have noticed the 
              storage poster and the SANS extras, which we were able to include 
              with direct support from advertisers. We hope to continue this trend 
              throughout the year. For example, we're currently organizing 
              two supplements to <i>Sys Admin</i> -- one in conjunction with 
              Hewlett Packard and the other with Sun Microsystems. These projects 
              will allow us to provide a broader range of articles focusing on 
              vendor-specific solutions.
            <p> Others of you have asked whether we plan to include coverage of 
              OS X in <i>Sys Admin</i>. We would be glad to receive proposals 
              for articles on the topic. We rely almost entirely on readers to 
              submit articles reflecting their own specialties and interests. 
              This month's call for papers includes the themes of Security, 
              Server Management, and Performance Tuning, which will be featured 
              in the magazine this fall, so if you're interested in contributing, 
              please contact us. Articles examining Mac OS X, AIX, BSD, HP-UX, 
              Linux, Solaris, and other UNIX-like systems are welcome.
            <p> We are looking for original articles that describe unique solutions 
              (or unique implementations of familiar solutions) that readers can 
              adapt to their own environments. We understand that <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              readers work in diverse settings. Some work in smaller shops where 
              they might do double or triple duty as admin, DBA, and security 
              officer, and others work for large corporations supporting 500 or 
              more users. The strength of <i>Sys Admin</i> magazine lies in the 
              expertise of this dedicated group of professionals, and I encourage 
              you to share your experiences and insights with colleagues by contributing 
              to the magazine. You may also send me suggestions for specific topics, 
              and I'll try to include those for other readers to consider. 
              I look forward to hearing from you.
            <p> 
            <p> Sincerely yours,
            <p>
