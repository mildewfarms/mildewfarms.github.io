            <h1><b><img src="../../resource/solaris.gif" width="150" height="150" align="right">More 
              Truth about Tapes, Backups, and Restores</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Peter Baer Galvin</i>
            <p> In the July issue (<b>http://www.samag.com/documents/s=8284/sam0307h/0307h.htm</b>), 
              I discussed backup solutions and the reasons that sites stay with 
              antiquated tape and software technologies. This month, I'll 
              cover a variety of standard and unorthodox backup and restore solutions, 
              and reveal more truths.
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: SCSI bus is still a better choice 
              than Fibre channel bus, in some situations.
            <p> In spite of the vendor hype, new technology is not always the 
              best solution. A case in point is Fibre vs. SCSI tape and library 
              attachment. While Fibre has some benefits, especially the increased 
              distance allowed between the connection points, SCSI is still the 
              best solution in some scenarios. SCSI solutions tend to be more 
              complex, but sometimes increased complexity is paid for by increased 
              function or reliability. Consider a Fibre HBA in a host, a SCSI-based 
              tape library, and a bridge between the host and the library. Experienced 
              systems administrators might frown on this solution due to the need 
              for multiple cables, connections, and devices. And indeed it could 
              be more prone to failure, more overhead to manage, and more complex 
              to debug, but consider that the bridge includes buffering that can 
              help stream data to the tape drives (making them more efficient 
              and decreasing backup time). The Fibre to the host allows the library 
              to be distant, and the SCSI drives and robot can be more reliable 
              than their Fibre equivalents.
            <p> I've seen instances when a Fibre-based robot control had 
              intermittent errors, while SCSI-based robot controls were rock-solid. 
              Given that Fibre is relatively new on the backup scene, and that 
              SCSI-based drives and robots have been in use for years, this should 
              not be surprising. Also consider that some drives are not yet available 
              with Fibre-attach, so this solution could allow for the best combination 
              of drive and robot technology while maximizing throughput, reliability, 
              and distances between the devices.
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: SANs are not just for disks.
            <p> If your site has several data-centric hosts, a backup SAN could 
              be a good next-generation backup solution. Many sites have moved 
              to this architecture simply because their backup networks could 
              not move data fast enough to meet backup and restore window requirements. 
              A sample backup SAN is shown in Figure 1. Of course there are many 
              options and variations on this architecture. In this example, database 
              servers are directly attached to a storage array, and other hosts 
              with storage are connected on a network. The backup server is connected 
              to the robot and to the network. Backup data can stream from the 
              database servers, through Fibre, through the Fibre-SCSI bridges, 
              to the SCSI tape drives in the tape library. Likewise, data can 
              flow across the network, through the backup server, to the library 
              via Fibre to Fibre-attached tape drives. This type of facility has 
              several advantages (and disadvantages) compared to direct-attach 
              solutions:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> It allows for a central library to be used by many hosts. 
              <li> Throughput between hosts and tape can be scaled as required, 
                simply by increasing connections between the host, the SAN switches, 
                and the tape library. 
              <li> Backup management can be simplified by backup software than 
                can coordinate all hosts, storage, and library use. 
              <li> Adding hosts (and accompanying storage) is less likely to require 
                new infrastructure. In the usual case, the existing library can 
                accommodate the new data, or might require additional tape drives 
                within the library. With network-based backups, adding hosts might 
                cause a backup network to be inadequate. There the solution might 
                be to change the entire network infrastructure between hosts and 
                the backup server. 
              <li> Depending on the storage technology in use, backups can bypass 
                the application server and require only the backup server to drive 
                backup throughput. In Figure 1, the backup server also is connected 
                to the main storage. If the storage array supports snapshots or 
                other splitting/reconnecting technology, a copy of the data to 
                be backed up can be created and exported to the backup server. 
                (See also near-line storage below). 
              <li> Restores can be much faster than in direct-attach tape scenarios, 
                as all tape drives in the central library could be used for a 
                restore, moving more megabytes per second than if a smaller library 
                or single tape drive was attached to the target host.
            </ul>
            <p> A downside to a centralized backup solution is that backup software 
              needs to be more advanced to manage the backup and recovery (B&amp;R). 
              My favorite solution is Veritas NetBackup (NBU). From one central 
              management console, NBU can orchestrate the allocation of tape drives, 
              use of those drives for backup or restore, and release of the drives 
              for use in some other backup or restore. Another downside is the 
              cost of implementing a backup SAN compared with a standard network-based 
              solution.
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: unlike almost all other technology, 
              the larger the tape robot the lower the price per capacity.
            <p> Several small libraries are usually more costly than one large 
              library with the same capacity. Add to the equation the maintenance 
              cost and management overhead involved when more devices are in the 
              mix, and a central tape library makes sense, in most circumstances. 
              Sun has a nice library comparison available (although pricing information 
              will have to be obtained elsewhere): <b>http://www.sun.com/storage/tape/tape_lib_comparison.html</b>.
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: like operating systems are best at 
              backing up and restoring their own kind.
            <p> A few years ago, I was consulting at a large site containing a 
              mix of Sun and Windows machines. The backup software they were using 
              was running on Windows. The backups appeared to work fine. Unfortunately, 
              the restores of Solaris, especially the root disks, were not so 
              fortunate. Generally, the "media server" -- the machine 
              driving the data to the tape drives -- should be of the same 
              operating system type as the machines the data are coming from. 
              Sometimes mixing does work, but as it's more prone to failure, 
              why take unnecessary risk?
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: changing backup software is difficult.
            <p> Although I've talked with many sys admins who were unhappy 
              with their current backup software, only rarely have they felt enough 
              pain to switch to another solution. Some folks who even lost data 
              when they had a disk problem and a restore failure continued with 
              that infrastructure rather than replacing it. The reasons vary according 
              to the site, but mostly they involved the cost of buying the new 
              software. Also consider that the old software usually must be kept 
              to enable restores from the old backup tapes. This difficulty of 
              changing means that the backup software choice is likely a long-term 
              one, so choose wisely.
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: the B&amp;R technologies are rapidly 
              evolving.
            <p> There are several new technologies affecting the B&amp;R problem. 
              Backup SANs have already been described. Another is new tape drive 
              technologies that increase speed and density. Some tape drives provide 
              write-once-read-many (WORM) functionality. The most interesting 
              action is in the appliance space. For example, Decru has a box that 
              encrypts data as it flows from the backup server to the tape drives 
              (and decrypts it during restore). This solution can assure that 
              all the hard work of securing your environment is not undone by 
              clear text tapes being taken off site.
            <p> Another area of appliance solutions is instant restore. These 
              new devices, from companies such as Revivio, record all writes performed 
              to the main storage. They can then provide a view of the storage 
              as it was at any point in time, such as just before a database corruption 
              or a data loss. This type of solution augments standard backups 
              rather than replacing them. Their key is that they make it unlikely 
              that tape will ever be needed for restores -- the restores can 
              be done directly from the appliance.
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: applications add another layer of 
              complexity.
            <p> If it weren't for those dang applications, B&amp;R would 
              be easy! Consider a database server, and the complexities of assuring 
              that the data to be backed up is consistent. Usually this involves 
              the backup software communicating with the database software to 
              coordinate access to the data. A simpler solution that is appropriate 
              with smaller databases is for the database administrator to automate 
              extraction of data (while it is quiesced) to a locally accessible 
              disk, and for the backup to copy that extract to tape.
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: near-line is a new name for an old 
              idea (which doesn't make it bad).
            <p> One big B&amp;R industry buzz is about "near-line storage". 
              This is not a new idea. Amanda, the free backup software package, 
              uses disk as the first stop for data being backed up. It then moves 
              the data from that buffer to tape. Old ideas can be good ones, and 
              near-line storage does have a place in many environments. Typically 
              it should be used when a tape solution cannot meet the required 
              backup or restore window. The data are copied to lower cost disk 
              (near-line storage) during the backup window, and then to tape during 
              a larger window. Restores can be done from the near-line storage 
              as well, with the cost of near-line storage being the only limiting 
              factor in determining the number of backups kept before deletion.
            <p> Note that no one is making the argument that near-line storage 
              is as cost effective as tape. Rather, it is lower cost than the 
              main storage, and faster than tape, and therefore can be of use 
              in some environments. Finally, note that the data could be moved 
              to near-line via backup software, in which case it is in backup-tape 
              format and would need to be restored to be used. Alternately, the 
              data could be copied to near-line, and would then be in its native 
              file system format and be available for testing or disaster recovery 
              use.
            <p> The <i>truth</i> about tape: network backups work.
            <p> With all of the above said about more complex backup environments, 
              consider that network-based backup infrastructure has been around 
              for a long time, and works for a lot of sites. The more complex 
              architectures certainly have their place, and are required in some 
              circumstances, but they should not be used when a simpler solution 
              would do. If the performance (or lack thereof) of an existing network 
              facility is the only impetus to move forward, consider using parallel 
              paths to stretch throughput. For example, IP Multipathing could 
              allow easy use of multiple backup networks. A 1-Gb network, when 
              driven by a Sun server, can move approximately 450 Mb per second. 
              Putting in a second or third gigabit interface and using IP Multipathing 
              can double and triple that performance. Do not forget that sufficient 
              CPU would be needed to drive that throughput. A good rule of thumb 
              is that one fast CPU can drive one high-throughput interface (be 
              it a Fibre channel or a gigabit network HBA).
            <p> <b>The Truth</b>
            <p> It is important that any B&amp;R architecture focus on the primary 
              problem. That problem is not backups and their performance, rather, 
              it is restores and their performance and reliability.
            <p> <b>Conclusions</b>
            <p> There are quite a few obvious and subtle complexities involved 
              in designing or redesigning a backup and restore solution. Mistakes 
              can come from overlooking or underestimating these complexities. 
              Specific areas to consider are server to tape attachment, throughput 
              of backup and restore, robot control, and application interactions. 
              Hopefully the truths revealed here can help assure that your B&amp;R 
              solution meets your requirements immediately, and for the distant 
              future.
