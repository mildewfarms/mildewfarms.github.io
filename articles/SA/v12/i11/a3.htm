            <h1><b><img src="a3.gif" width="200" height="167" align="right">Review 
              of sqlDESKTOP</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Marcel Gagn&eacute;</i>
            <p> I've always loved the expression, "a clean desk is a 
              sign of a sick mind". It's usually written on a little 
              sign or on a coffee mug, both of which are sitting on somebody's 
              messy desk. The reason I like this statement is, of course, because 
              my desk tends to be (oh, how shall I put it) a little unfastidious. 
              For many people out there (notice that I'm now cleverly directing 
              the discussion away from myself), the lack of desktop organization 
              goes beyond the physical desktop and into their computer systems.
            <p> Helping you make sense of that clutter is the idea behind sqlDESKTOP 
              (<b>http://www.sqldesktop.com</b>), a program that is to your computer 
              desktop what a good filing system is to your physical office. By 
              using sqlDESKTOP, you can arrange and organize disparate bits of 
              information into related areas just as you would in the real world. 
              For instance, emails tend to live in email folders, documents in 
              one place, and Web site links in another. The idea behind sqlDESKTOP 
              is to allow you to organize all this related but scattered data 
              into a format that makes more sense using familiar office metaphors 
              such as filing cabinets, stacks of (and individual) binders, and 
              loose documents of various stripes. If you want to track everything 
              related to your fishing resort project, you put all that into the 
              "Fishing resort" binder.
            <p> <b>Installation and Options</b>
            <p> The package is distributed as a single executable file called 
              "setup.bin". After changing the permissions to allow execute 
              privileges, I ran the file from a non-root account. By default, 
              the application will wind up in /opt/sqldesktop. sqlDESKTOP recommends 
              that you use the included JVM (Java Virtual Machine) rather than 
              using any preinstalled version you may have, but you do have the 
              opportunity to override this. The included version will not interfere 
              with any other implementation of the Java VM you may already have 
              installed.
            <p> The free version of sqlDESKTOP comes with a personal database 
              called Hsql (Hypersonic SQL). For a server installation, you would 
              choose PostgreSQL, DB2, Oracle, or others. In the case of these 
              multi-user database setups, an extra step is required in which you 
              must create the database and appropriate tables before continuing 
              (sqlDESKTOP provides script files for this). The upside of the free, 
              single-user installation is that all this magic happens automatically.
            <p> To get things rolling, click the sqlDESKTOP icon on your desktop. 
              As you might expect, a little bit of setup happens on your first 
              run. You'll be asked to enter a first and last name as well 
              as a password. Those people using the free version can pretty much 
              just press Next through the various screens. The only thing that 
              caught me off guard on setup was my eagerness to assign a password 
              for the system admin user (sa) who, at this stage, should not have 
              a password. When you have completed all the setup steps, your KDE 
              or GNOME desktop will wind up with three new icons -- one to 
              start sqlDESKTOP, a ReadMe/Tutorial, and an Uninstall.
            <p> <b>Using sqlDESKTOP</b>
            <p> In the top left of your screen, you will have a selection of "office 
              tools". These include a trash can, sticky notes, new flags, 
              a photocopier, telephone book, email in and out boxes, and a briefcase 
              (to transport data from one place to another). These tools are available 
              two at a time via a system of tabs.
            <p> Over on the right are the organizational tools themselves, also 
              available through a tabbed menu. The items at your disposal include 
              filing cabinets, binder stacks, binders, documents, Web and newsgroups 
              links, and so on. In fact, pretty much any type of data you want 
              to include is there for you. Building your information database 
              is as easy as dragging things to and from the desktop area below 
              the various tabbed items. The desktop area is actually referred 
              to as a "room", and you can create multiple rooms. The 
              idea is a real-world analogy. Binders, file cabinets, and so on, 
              are all things we place in a room, hence the name chosen here.
            <p> I decided to start by dragging a filing cabinet from the toolbar 
              into my room (see Figure 1). A dialogue appears asking me for details 
              on this item -- what I want to call it and how I would like 
              to describe it. When you create anything under sqlDESKTOP, you are 
              presented with a few interesting options such as general notes, 
              and concerned persons. As I mentioned earlier, sqlDESKTOP can be 
              run using different databases than the freeware version provided. 
              With a central network-deployed database, users throughout the office 
              can collaborate on documents, or share in the organization of company 
              information. Users can log in from any workstation through the Java 
              client software and access the sqlDESKTOP system. As a result, when 
              you create filing cabinets, binders, or files, you also have the 
              opportunity to assign rights to those items so that others can work 
              together on the same project.
            <p> Once the choices are made, the dialogue closes and you are left 
              with an icon in your application room with a "talk bubble" 
              much as you see in a cartoon that identifies the name of your resource. 
              Double-click on a binder or file cabinet and you jump to another 
              level where you can create additional documents, application links, 
              or binders with more documents inside. Yes, it's very much 
              like your basic hierarchical data structure, only somewhat more 
              free form.
            <p> Once you start populating your room, you can add to-do items, 
              yellow sticky notes, and "new" flags to the various items 
              (see Figure 2). Double-click on the yellow sticky and you can add 
              additional information. The same idea applies to the to-do items, 
              but you can set deadlines for completion as well. sqlDESKTOP also 
              knows about your existing productivity applications, which means 
              that you can start an OpenOffice document from inside an existing 
              binder or room location.
            <p> Being database driven, sqlDESKTOP does tend to take advantage 
              of these possibilities. Documents can be linked to their real locations 
              on disk or they can be imported into the database. Create a binder 
              (or filing cabinet) and you can choose to import all of the documents 
              in a directory, making the job of populating your database that 
              much easier. If you choose to go the import route, your original 
              directory is unharmed. The reverse is also true. If you have been 
              creating your documents directly from the desktop (or inside a binder), 
              you can later export them to a directory of your choosing.
            <p> All in all, sqlDESKTOP is certainly easy to use. There were, however, 
              some issues.
            <p> <b>Reflections on Use</b>
            <p> Obviously, the better and more powerful your database, the better 
              the storage capabilities. I mention this because the free HSQL database 
              does suffer from performance issues at times. The best example I 
              can give came from trying to import a directory with a large number 
              of documents. The process took a long time and eventually the database 
              complained that it was "out of menory" despite the fact 
              that I still had more than 200 MB of free RAM and several gigabytes 
              of disk available. Directories with small collections of text files 
              gave me no such trouble.
            <p> There were a couple of other things I found less than stellar. 
              While the package is pretty easy to use, it could be more intuitive, 
              given its mission to simplify your data-bound life. For instance, 
              there could and should be more help available. Bubble help would 
              be a boon to the software. When I tried to right-click on a filing 
              cabinet to add users who could collaborate on the documents, I was 
              stuck. Right-clicking is a kind of natural response these days, 
              one that sqlDESKTOP has ignored. So, I tried double-clicking, which 
              only opened the cabinet -- not what I was trying to do. After 
              going to the manual, I learned that you double-click the little 
              icon in the talk bubble to change properties. Then, when filling 
              in permissions for "concerned persons", there was a field 
              for "Attribute" with no explanation of what the possible 
              attributes are and no obvious means to list them. Another trip to 
              the manual.
            <p> To be fair, there is a good bit of documentation available in 
              the form of tutorials and Web pages, all of which can be accessed 
              from the help menu. Given the Java-based nature of the software, 
              it wasn't surprising that the help pages all require a Java-enabled 
              browser. Nevertheless, built-in help is a time saver and sometimes 
              a little reminder is all you need. Forcing the user to go to the 
              manual for everything isn't the right way to do things, particularly 
              not for things we now take for granted.
            <p> <b>Costs and Licensing</b>
            <p> The company behind sqlDESKTOP is PIM. The software I reviewed 
              was the free version (not GPLed), but it is limited to one user 
              at a single workstation.
            <p> If you would like to extend the capabilities of sqlDESKTOP to 
              other users in your office, you want to look at the network version. 
              A 90-day license for the network version is included in the free 
              download, but beyond those 90 days, you must buy a license. Prices 
              here vary from $100 per person for a single network user to $50 
              per person for 100 users. Certified schools or universities, however, 
              can contact PIM for a free license. Licensed users receive free 
              support from PIM. Upgrades to minor releases (without important 
              new features) are also free.
            <p> Lest I be branded as exclusive, I should point out that a Windows 
              version of sqlDESKTOP also exists. The server edition can run on 
              pretty much any OS where the supported databases are available (Linux, 
              Unix, Solaris, Windows 2000, AS/400, etc.).
            <p> <b>Conclusion</b>
            <p> PIM's sqlDESKTOP is certainly easy to learn and use. The 
              flexible nature of the software and the familiar desktop metaphor 
              should mean that you'll be organizing your data and your ideas 
              in no time. sqlDESKTOP does everything it claims and does it rather 
              well, but I harbor some skepticism -- not so much in the software 
              itself, mind you, but in me. sqlDESKTOP is a tool, albeit a good 
              one, to achieve a result that must in the end be driven by the individual 
              using that tool. Furthermore, it seems fairly pricey, particularly 
              for a single-user version when you consider that the same single 
              user on in a non-networked environment can run the software free 
              of charge.
            <p> So, are you ready to get yourself or your company organized? Given 
              how easy sqlDESKTOP is to set up and that you can run it free of 
              charge, it is worth your time to check out this organizer. The only 
              thing you stand to lose is time, and if sqlDESKTOP turns out to 
              be right for you, you may actually save time.
