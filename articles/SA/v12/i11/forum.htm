            <p>One of the questions on our most recent reader survey asked how 
              many of you subscribe to the <i>Sys Admin</i> email newsletters. 
              We currently send out two newsletters a month -- one that previews 
              the contents of the magazine and allows subscribers to read featured 
              articles and columns, and one that provides a Web-exclusive article. 
              Despite our healthy newsletter subscription numbers, only 14% of 
              survey respondents said they subscribe, and that's actually 
              up 10% from last year. This means that the majority of our newsletter 
              subscribers are not print subscribers. So, in case you're part 
              of that 86%, I thought I'd mention a few highlights from recent 
              newsletters.</p>
            <p> This summer, we featured a comparative review of instant messaging 
              clients by Marcel Gagn&eacute;, which is available at: <b>http://www.samag.com/documents/s=8460/sam0306web/sam0306web.htm</b>. 
              Marcel writes, "If your enterprise is ready to wade into the 
              IM waters, you will soon discover that IM is a many-headed beast 
              with protocols galore." In his review, Marcel covers some of 
              the multi-protocol IM clients available for the Linux desktop: Gaim, 
              EveryBuddy, Ayttm and Eb-Lite, and Kopete.
            <p> In August, Joe "Zonker" Brockmeier contributed a review 
              of BSI Computer's R9 PServer, a portable dual Intel Xeon server. 
              Zonker says, "Of course, all servers are portable to some extent. 
              But the R9 is actually designed to be mobile and easy to transport... 
              It's great hardware for anyone who needs to take a server on 
              the road." See <b>http://www.samag.com/documents/s=8855/sam0308web2/</b> 
              for Zonker's complete review.
            <p> Marcel Gagn&eacute; also provided a review of sqlDESKTOP that 
              we're reprinting in this issue of the magazine (see page 13). 
              Marcel says, "By using sqlDESKTOP, you can arrange and organize 
              disparate bits of information into related areas just as you would 
              in the real world. The idea behind sqlDESKTOP is to allow you do 
              organize all this related but scattered data ... using familiar 
              office metaphors such as filing cabinets, stacks of binders, and 
              loose documents of various stripes."
            <p> If you're interested in subscribing to the <i>Sys Admin</i> 
              email newsletters, you can do so through our Web site at: <b>http://www.sysadminmag.com/newsletters</b>.
            <p> Other articles in this issue provide performance tuning tips. 
              Dustin Puryear looks at several performance enhancements that can 
              be achieved with sysctl, Frank Wiles describes a setup for load 
              balancing email servers for better performance, and Thirumalainambi 
              Murugesh shares some information about tuning NNM servers. If you're 
              looking for additional performance analysis tips, next month's 
              Solaris Administration Supplement will feature an article by Justin 
              Buhler and Adrian Cockcroft. This article will describe key principles 
              and tools, specifically Orca and the SE toolkit, for successful 
              capacity planning.
            <p>
