            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm sick of spammers harvesting 
              addresses from our sendmail server by issuing dictionary attacks 
              and the like. Is there any way to prevent them from slamming our 
              mail servers in this way?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You don't say which version 
              of sendmail you're running, so I'll assume something recent. 
              One approach is to accept all addresses at the gateway and then 
              bounce invalid mail on another machine. This will leave you with 
              a lot of undeliverable bounces if you receive a significant amount 
              of forged spam (which is usually the case). If you want to continue 
              to fight spam by dropping connections at the gateway machines, then 
              you can fight off things like dictionary attacks by limiting the 
              number of recipients per message and/or throttle the connection 
              if there are X number of bad recipients. The two sendmail configuration 
              lines to put in your mc are:
            <p> 
            <pre>
confMAX_RCPTS_PER_MESSAGE  MaxRecipientsPerMessage

                           [infinite] If set, allow no more than the
                           specified number of recipients in an SMTP
                           envelope.  Further recipients receive a 452
                           error code (i.e., they are deferred for the
                           next delivery attempt).
</pre>
            This example sets the maximum number of recipients per message to 
            10:
            <p> 
            <pre>
define('confMAX_RCPTS_PER_MESSAGE', 10)dnl
 
confBAD_RCPT_THROTTLE      BadRcptThrottle 

                           [infinite] If set and more than the
                           specified number of recipients in an
                           envelope are rejected, sleep for one second
                           after each rejected RCPT command.
</pre>
            This example sets the maximum number of bad recipients per message 
            before sendmail throttles for one second to 2:
            <p> 
            <pre>
define('confBAD_RCPT_THROTTLE', 2)dnl
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I usually install things for the ports 
            collection on my FreeBSD 5.1 machine just to play around with the 
            software. More often than not, I find that the software isn't 
            useful to me, so I'd like to remove the packages. I can remove 
            the single package just fine, but larger software programs have dependencies 
            so one port winds up installing many packages. When I then remove 
            the port, only the port itself is removed, and not any of the dependencies. 
            Is there a way to have a pkg_delete remove all of the software it 
            installed for any one port so I'm not left with a machine full 
            of unused packages?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The standard pkg_delete won't 
              do this, but if you install portupgrade from /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade, 
              it comes with a program called pkg_deinstall that wraps pkg_delete. 
              You can specify the -R switch to delete packages required by the 
              given package name:
            <p> 
            <pre>
pkg_deinstall -R &lt;package&gt;
</pre>
            If you want to remove only some of the packages depended on by the 
            package you're trying to delete, specify the -i switch to do 
            an interactive removal:
            <p> 
            <pre>
pkg_deinstall -Ri &lt;package&gt;
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm a security administrator 
            who's currently out of work and looking to get a certification 
            or two under my belt to give me an edge in the job market. Do you 
            have any suggestions about which certifications are the best?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> I actually receive this question 
              quite a bit, and it's a difficult one to answer without knowing 
              more about the environment where people are applying for jobs. Are 
              the people doing the interviewing and hiring more technical or managerial 
              in nature? Are they impressed by certifications that are better 
              known outside of the field or better respected by people inside 
              the field? Is it more important to have a broad but shallow knowledge 
              base, or a narrow expertise?
            <p> I recently read this article in <i>Information Security</i> magazine 
              that may be of use to those of you wondering which security certification 
              to obtain. This piece mostly covers the CISSP, but also touches 
              on various other security certifications: <b>http://www.infosecuritymag.com/2003/jun/certifiable.shtml</b>.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I know this falls under the category 
              of "if it hurts, don't do that," but I don't 
              have any control over the remote machine. The situation is this: 
              I'm trying to scp files from my local machine where my username 
              is bob, to a remote machine where my username is bob@remote.machine. 
              Yes, my username is bob@remote.machine. When I try to scp with the 
              following command:
            <p> 
            <pre>
scp file bob@remote.machine@remote.machine:~/
</pre>
            it tries to connect to remote.machine@remote.machine. Obviously it's 
            seeing the first @ and chopping off the rest as the hostname. I realize 
            that a username should never have an @ in it, but, as I said, I don't 
            have any control over that, and the people who run the box won't 
            listen to reason. I've tried various quoting methods to get this 
            to work, and I've come up with nothing so far. Any clue how I 
            could force this?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> First, you're right, the 
              usernames are bogus and who knows what else will break because of 
              that (email immediately comes to mind). But if that's what 
              you're stuck with, then so be it. There may be a way to escape 
              the @, but an easier suggestion is to use the -o flag to set the 
              username separately on the command line:
            <p> 
            <pre>
scp -oUser=bob@remote.machine file remote.machine:~/
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I think my understanding of how the 
            sendmail access map works is flawed. I have the following entry refusing 
            email from peak-10.com in my access map:
            <p> 
            <pre>
peak-10.com     550 Access denied to spammers
</pre>
            I received an email from one of peak-10.com's servers, and it 
            was clearly identified in the Received headers of the message. That 
            message had the following entry in the mail log:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Aug  2 00:48:26 host.my.domain sm-mta[29531]: [ID 801593 mail.info] \
  h624mPhx029531: from=&lt;mail7@mail.play4keeps.com&gt;, size=0, class=0, \
  nrcpts=0, bodytype=8BITMIME, proto=ESMTP, daemon=MTA, \
  relay=[66.129.125.8]
</pre>
            Shouldn't this message have been blocked, and if not, why?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Regardless of what the received 
              headers say, sendmail could not resolve the IP address of the foreign 
              machine when it connected to yours. The hostname you see in the 
              received headers is what's fed to sendmail during the HELO 
              phase and can be easily forged. Because of this, the relay host 
              was identified only by its IP address instead of its hostname. To 
              block this message, you would need to block it by IP, 66.129.125.8.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I have an old PowerPC-based RS/6000 
              that I'd like to use to learn AIX systems administration. It 
              would be cool if I could install 5.2, but I don't know if my 
              machine will support it. I know Sun has a canonical list of what 
              hardware is supported under what OS, but does IBM have something 
              similar?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Some of the PowerPC machines 
              will run 5.2, but not all of them. If you run the command:
            <p> 
            <pre>
bootinfo -p
</pre>
            And your system claims to be chrp, then 5.2 will run on it. If you 
            have a PreP platform or MiroChannel bus, then 5.2 won't run. 
            IBM has stopped supporting these with new OS releases. You can also 
            take a look at the 5.2 release notes at:

            to see whether your hardware falls under any of the categories they've 
            stopped supporting. Similar documents can be found for 5.1 and 4.3

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I notice you answered some OS X questions, 
            so I have one of my own. I'm a die-hard Unix workstation user, 
            and I really hate the placement of the control key on PCs and Macs. 
            I know how to swap control and caps lock under X, but how do I do 
            it for OS X in general? I'm assuming there has to be some way.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you want a software solution 
              that will work on laptops as well as desktops, take a look at uControl 
              (<b>http://gnufoo.org/ucontrol/ucontrol.html</b>). I've had 
              good luck getting this to work by itself, but it doesn't seem 
              to play well in conjunction with bbkeys (which I use to map window 
              manager functions to my laptop's function keys). When using 
              the two together, sometimes the control key becomes sticky and can 
              cause all sorts of havoc.
            <p> If you have a USB keyboard (which rules out the built-in keyboards 
              on laptops), you can modify the info.plist file for the keyboard. 
              Edit: /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBKeyboard.kext/Contents/Info.plist 
              and under the section labeled "IOKitPersonalities/AppleUSBKeyboard" 
              add the lines:
            <p> 
            <pre>
&lt;key&gt;Swap control and capslock&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;integer&gt;1&lt;/integer&gt;
</pre>
            You can also use the PropertyListEditor application that comes with 
            the developer tools package to add the property.
            <p> Now move/remove the device driver cache /System/Library/Extensions.mkext 
              so that it will be rebuilt including the new modified driver when 
              you next reboot.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to integrate majordomo 
              into my sendmail 8.12.9 setup. Because I don't want authentication 
              warnings, I've added majordomo to the trusted users file in 
              my mc:
            <p> 
            <pre>
FEATURE('use_ct_file')
define('confCT_FILE', '/etc/mail/trusted-users')
</pre>
            /etc/mail/trusted-users contains the following:
            <p> 
            <pre>
root
daemon
majordom
</pre>
            I rebuilt the cf and stopped and started sendmail to make sure the 
            changes took effect. I know this is working because sendmail shows 
            all three when I dump the info via the command line:
            <p> 
            <pre>
# echo '$=t' | sendmail -bt

ADDRESS TEST MODE (ruleset 3 NOT automatically invoked)
Enter &lt;ruleset&gt; &lt;address&gt;
&gt; daemon
majordom
root
</pre>
            When I send mail out via majordomo, though, I get the following header:
            <p> 
            <pre>
X-Authentication-Warning: mail.my.domain: majordom set sender to \
  majordomo@mail.my.domain using -f
</pre>
            I'm completely at a loss here, and I figure this must be a bug. 
            It seems like someone else would have reported something so blatant, 
            though.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you're using 8.12.9, 
              you're probably also using submit.cf for local mail. If so, 
              you'll also want to add FEATURE('use_ct_file') to 
              submit.mc and rebuild submit.cf.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE 
              on Intel hardware. I've modified my crontab to run a new script. 
              Now I get the following message every five minutes:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Cron &lt;root@bsd-server&gt; root /usr/libexec/atrun root: not found
</pre>
            I didn't change the atrun line at all, so I'm not sure what 
            the problem is. Any hints on what I munged?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> This usually happens when you 
              use the crontab command to install the file /etc/crontab, e.g.:
            <p> 
            <pre>
crontab /etc/crontab
</pre>
            /etc/crontab has a different syntax than the user crontabs, so when 
            you install /etc/crontab as a user crontab in this manner, it spits 
            out errors. To fix this, remove the user crontab you installed by 
            doing:
            <p> 
            <pre>
crontab -r
</pre>
            If you're just editing /etc/crontab, you don't need to let 
            the system know that it's changed, since it will see that automatically 
            on the next cron run. If you'd rather put new things in a user 
            crontab, then use the syntax explained in the crontab(5) man page. 
            If you're creating scripts that should be run periodically (daily, 
            weekly, monthly), consider putting it in /usr/local/etc/peridoic under 
            the corresponding directory. See the periodic(8) man page for more 
            information on adding these sorts of scripts.

            <p> By default, DPMS uses the screensaver level (0) and provides no 
              power savings. If you want to turn on suspend or power the monitor 
              off, you can use the X Server Configuration Tool under sam, choosing 
              "Modify Screen Options." You can also manually change 
              the file /etc/X11/X0screens and set the variable MinimumMonitorPowerSaveLevel 
              to one of the above numbers, for example:
            <p> 
            <pre>
MinimumMonitorPowerSaveLevel 2
</pre>
            Take a look at /usr/lib/X11/Xserver/info/screens/hp for more information.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm rather new to administering 
              BIND, and I tend to make some syntax mistakes. Is there a tool out 
              there that will debug my changes before I start/restart BIND so 
              that I don't take the nameservers out of commission with bad 
              zone files or config files?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You don't say which version 
              of BIND, so I'll presume that you're running the latest 
              release of BIND 9. If this is the case, there are two programs that 
              come with the distribution that will do exactly what you want. To 
              check your named.conf syntax, run named-checkconf. It checks the 
              syntax but not the semantics of your configuration file (with no 
              arguments, it defaults to /etc/named.conf). To check your zone files, 
              run named-checkzone:
            <p> 
            <pre>
named-checkconf /etc/namedb/named.conf
named-checkzone your.zone /etc/namedb/your.zone.file
</pre>
            For more information, see the man page for each command.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE 
              and I'm trying to replace sendmail with exim. I've built 
              and installed it and modified /etc/mail/mailer.conf. I can't 
              seem to get the daemon to start properly, though. Here's my 
              mailer.conf file:
            <p> 
            <pre>
sendmail /usr/exim/bin/exim
send-mail /usr/exim/bin/exim
mailq /usr/exim/bin/exim -bp
newaliases /usr/bin/true
</pre>
            When the system boots, I get the following message, which looks like 
            it's trying to mash bits of sendmail and exim together:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Starting standard daemons: cron sendmailexim abandoned: unknown, \
  malformed, or incomplete option -L sendmail-clientmqueueexim \
  abandoned: unknown, malformed, or incomplete option -L
  </pre>
            <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It looks as if you still have sendmail 
            enabled in /etc/rc.conf. Be sure to change the following line:
            <p> 
            <pre>
sendmail_enable="YES"
</pre>
            to:
            <p> 
            <pre>
sendmail_enable="NONE"
</pre>
            Also make sure that the exim startup script, /usr/local/etc/rc.d/exim.sh 
            exists. You may also want to add NO_SENDMAIL=TRUE to /etc/make.conf 
            if you're going to remove the sendmail binaries and don't 
            want them rebuilt when you do a make world.
            <p> You also could have installed exim from the ports collection (based 
              on your path to the exim binary, it doesn't look like you did), 
              which would have then generated the rc.d script for you.
