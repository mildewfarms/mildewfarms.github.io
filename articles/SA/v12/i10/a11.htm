            <p> <i>Amy Rich</i>
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Does FreeBSD have support for 
              802.11g? I just purchased a new Apple Base Station Extreme, and 
              I'd like to run everything as 802.11g so I'm pushing bits across 
              the wire faster. Unfortunately, I have a number of FreeBSD laptops 
              as well as the Apple laptops to worry about.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> The ath driver, which provides 
              support for wireless adapters based on the Atheros AR5210, AR5211, 
              and AR5212 chips, was committed to FreeBSD-current in June. The 
              R5212-based devices support 802.11g, so that may be something to 
              work with. FreeBSD-current may not be stable enough for your environment, 
              though, so you may want to set up two separate networks -- one for 
              your 802.11b users and one for your 802.11g users.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to set up mailman on 
              a Solaris 8 box running Apache 1.3.26. I've successfully done the 
              mailman install, and I've added the following line to httpd.conf:
            <p> 
            <pre>
ScriptAlias     /mailman/       "/usr/local/mailman/cgi-bin/"
</pre>
            Running apachectl configtest shows that the syntax is good. However, 
            when I try to go to <b>http://www.my.domain/mailman/create</b>, I 
            get garbage. The first line has a bunch of empty boxes and the word 
            ELF. Later it shows some HTML:
            <p> 
            <pre>

&lt;title&gt;Mailman CGI error!!!&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Mailman CGI error!!!&lt;/h1&gt;
The Mailman CGI wrapper encountered a fatal error.

Failure to find group name %s.  Try adding this group
to your system, or re-run configure, providing an
existing group name with the command line option %s.
Group mismatch error.  Mailman expected the %s
wrapper script to be executed as group "%s", but
the system's %s server executed the %s script as

script as group "%s", or re-run configure,
providing the command line option s=%s'.

            My apache is running with the username and group of www. I made sure 
            to specify <b>--with-cgi-gid=www</b> when I ran configure before compiling 
            mailman. This error seems to indicate that it can't find the www group. 
            Is there someplace else I need to specify things?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> This doesn't look like a problem 
              with mailman; this looks like a problem with your apache. It appears 
              to be opening the create binary as a regular file. Your <b>ScriptAlias</b> 
              line looks fine, but maybe you have it under a <b>VirtualHost</b> 
              or <b>Directory</b> container that isn't applicable? Another possibility 
              is that you're not loading mod_cgi. Make sure the following two 
              lines exist in your httpd.conf:
            <p> 
            <pre>
LoadModule cgi_module          libexec/mod_cgi.so
AddModule mod_cgi.c

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm running OS X 10.2.6, and I've 
            installed fink to grab a bunch of GNU packages. Sometimes when I select 
            packages within dselect, I get a bunch of garbage in my window. This 
            makes it impossible to do anything, and I wind up having to kill dselect. 
            Did I somehow misconfigure something, or is this a bug?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There are known issues with dselect 
              and the OS X Terminal.app termcap. You can work around this by changing 
              your terminal type to xterm-xfree86:
            <p> 
            <pre>
setenv TERM xterm-xfree86
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to use logadm as supplied 
            with Solaris 9. Most of the logs rotate ok, but for very large log 
            files, I get this message:
            <p> 
            <pre>
logadm: Warning: /var/log/&lt;logfile&gt;: Value too large for defined data type
</pre>
            I take this to mean that logadm is not largefile capable, which seems 
            rather counter-intuitive, since it's supposed to be handling "endlessly 
            growing log files." Is there a patch out for this that I just can't 
            track down?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you have a Sunsolve account, 
              you can log in and search for logadm. The third hit is bugid 4763519 
              dated June 19th, 2003: "logadm fails to rotate &gt; 2GB files." 
              Apparently this is fixed in s10_37, so I would expect a backwards 
              patch for Solaris 9 sometime in the future. If this is critical 
              and you have a support contract, you can try to escalate and/or 
              obtain a T patch.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I was attempting to upgrade the 
              FreeBSD ports collection with portupgrade when it segfaulted and 
              dumped core on me:
            <p> 
            <pre>
[Updating the pkgdb &lt;format:bdb1_btree&gt; in /var/db/pkg ... \

  Segmentation fault ruby 1.6.8 (2003-03-26)     [i386-freebsd4]
Abort trap (core dumped)
</pre>
            I tried running and compiling some other programs because I thought 
            maybe it was a problem with my hardware or the compiler, or libraries, 
            etc. Everything else checks out ok, though, so I'm stumped. Portupgrade 
            was working just fine a few weeks ago, and it hasn't been touched 
            in ages. What could have gone wrong between now and then?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Most likely you have run into 
              a known bug with portupgrade. Do you also encounter errors when 
              running pkgdb? From the BUGS section in the portupgrade(1) man page:
            <p> Sometimes a database may get corrupt and the pkgtools commands 
              start to abort due to segmentation fault. In such cases, run "pkgdb 
              -fu" to rebuild the database, and the problems will go away. 
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I want to configure all of our 
              internal machines to use an ntp server so that they're always in 
              sync with each other. I have ntp installed, but I'm wondering who 
              I should use as my ntp server?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> To begin, it's bad form to have 
              all of your internal hosts hammer an external ntp server. You should 
              set up a few of your own machines as internal ntp servers and have 
              all of your other internal machines sync off them. You want more 
              than one machine acting as an ntp server internally in case you 
              have a hardware failure. Each of these internal servers should in 
              turn sync off three to five public stratum 2 or stratum 3 servers. 
              Your ISP may offer ntp servers, and/or you can use some from the 
              list of public ntp servers at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/servers.html
</pre>
            The best configuration includes multiple ntp servers that are close 
            to you (network-wise, not geographically) but on different networks 
            for redundancy's sake.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I've configured sendmail 8.12.9 
              to authenticate clients with LOGIN and PLAIN via saslauthd. For 
              security purposes, I'm running sendmail as a non-root user. Authentication 
              is working, but I receive the following error message:
            <p> 
            <pre>
Sep 10 15:31:21 mailhost sendmail[3841]: OTP unavailable because 
can't read/write key database /etc/opiekeys: Permission denied
</pre>
            The error makes sense since /etc/opiekeys is owned by root, but I 
            don't want opie enabled at all.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> You compiled SASL with opie, 
              so it will attempt to use it unless you specify otherwise. You can 
              recompile SASL specifying the <b>--with-opie=no</b> switch, or you 
              can add a <b>mech_list</b> line to sendmail's SASL configuration 
              file (usually /usr/lib/sasl/Sendmail.conf):

            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We have a lab with a lot of generic 
            machines without interesting names. Each of them is called cslab-X 
            where <b>X</b> is the last portion of the dotted quad IP. Instead 
            of creating all of these entries by hand, I've heard there's a bind 
            directive called GENERATE that will take a range of numbers and create 
            A and PTR records for me. I'm having a bit of trouble with the syntax, 
            though. Would it be possible for you to provide an example?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> If you want to automatically 
              generate A records, you must be running BIND 9. BIND 8 will only 
              generate PTR, NS, and CNAME records. Assuming you're running BIND 
              9, let's say that you have the class C-sized address 192.168.1.x 
              and you want to have cslab-128.my.domain through cslab-253.my.domain. 
              The entry for your PTR records would be:
            <p> 
            <pre>
$ORIGIN 1.168.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA
$GENERATE 128-253 $ PTR cslab-$.my.domain.
</pre>
            The $ORIGIN line provides a base for the LHS of the $GENERATE directive. 
            If the LHS isn't fully qualified, the $ORIGIN will be tacked onto 
            the end. If you didn't use an $ORIGIN statement, you would write your 
            $GENERATE line as:
            <p> 
            <pre>
$GENERATE 128-253 $.1.168.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA PTR cslab-$.my.domain.
</pre>
            Similarly, your A records would be generated by:
            <p> 
            <pre>
$GENERATE 128-253 cslab-$ A 192.168.1.$
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> I'm trying to install UW-IMAP to use 
            strong SSL encryption mechanisms. Following the SSL build/install 
            instructions, I can get a binary that will accept any encryption mechanism, 
            but I don't see a way to configure IMAP not to accept weak ciphers. 
            Is there such a beast, or do I need to switch IMAP servers (which 
            would be difficult)?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There are no configuration settings 
              to specify which ciphers you want UW-IMAP to accept, but there is 
              a place in the code to change this before compilation. In the file 
              src/osdep/unix/ssl_unix.c, define SSLCIPHERLIST to whatever you 
              want. For example:
            <p> 
            <pre>
#define SSLCIPHERLIST "RC4-MD5:RC2-CBC-MD5:DES-CBC-MD5:DES-CBC3-MD5:RC4-64-MD5"
</pre>
            <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We're running OpenSSH 3.6.1p1 at our 
            site. When we try to ssh with compression turned on (specifying -C 
            on the command line), the connection is terminated prematurely, and 
            we receive the error:
            <p>

</pre>
            If we turn off compression, everything works just fine. This feels 
            like a bug, but we have some machines with the exact same version 
            of OpenSSH that work just fine. I'm rather stumped.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> I've heard of this bug cropping 
              up when there were issues with the version of zlib that OpenSSH 
              was linked against (the compression bits are done by libz). You 
              can try upgrading your version of zlib or using the same version 
              of zlib that's installed on the working machines.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> Our company is considering setting 
              up 802.11b networks in buildings we share with other companies. 
              Our security officer is concerned about these other companies obtaining 
              data from the wireless network and using it to piggyback our Internet 
              connections. Is there a resource that explains 802.11b security 
              and the like?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> There is a Wireless LAN Security 
              FAQ available at:

</pre>
            which should answer most of your questions. The short of it is that 
            it's very hard to secure a wireless network if you're in close proximity 
            to untrusted neighbors.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">Q</font></b> We run sendmail 8.12.9 on HP/UX 
              machines, and we see a lot of spam that originates from sites without 
              a valid reverse DNS entry. Is there a way to block these people 
              entirely using sendmail alone? Maybe a milter or a ruleset or a 
              database entry?
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> Rejecting mail from sites that 
              fail a reverse DNS test often leads to dropping valid email. Putting 
              a block like this in place isn't highly recommended, especially 
              for businesses that usually see mail from a variety of places, but 
              it is possible. Neil Rickert wrote a ruleset called <b>require_rdns</b>

            not sure why it's happening. Is there a bug in ksh that needs patching? 
            I looked around Sunsolve but didn't turn up anything that looked appropriate.
            <p> <b><font size="+2">A </font></b> It took me a while to discover 
              your problem, and I'll bet that your eye has just glossed over it, 
              too. Between /usr/sbin and /sbin you have, not one, but two colons. 
              A null entry in your PATH equates to the same thing as a dot. The 
              ksh man page covers this case in a section called "Execution" about 
              half way through:
            <p> The shell variable PATH defines the search path for the directory 
              containing the command. Alternative directory names are separated 
              by a colon (:). The default path is /bin:/usr/bin: (specifying /bin, 
              /usr/bin, and the current directory in that order). The current 
              directory can be specified by two or more adjacent colons, or by 
              a colon at the beginning or end of the path list. If the command 
              name contains a / then the search path is not used. Otherwise, each 
              directory in the path is searched for an executable file. If the 
              file has execute permission but is not a directory or an a.out file, 
              it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands. A sub-shell 
              is spawned to read it. All non-exported aliases, functions, and 
              variables are removed in this case. A parenthesized command is executed 
              in a sub-shell without removing non-exported quantities.
