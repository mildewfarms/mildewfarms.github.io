              Command Shells -- Managing Your Systems through the Telephone</b></h1>
            <p> <i>Patrick Deegan</i>
            <p> Imagine you're out for a night on the town or just driving through 
              the countryside, then your pager goes off or your cell phone rings 
              telling you something's wrong at work. If you are responsible for 
              one or more systems, this will eventually happen. But with a little 
              forethought, VOCP, and a telephone, you can still solve the problem 
              no matter where you are.
            <p> VOCP was released in 2000 under the GPL and is available at:
            <p> 
            <pre>
http://www.vocpsystem.com/
</pre>
            <p>VOCP uses a computer and voice modem to implement a call answering 
              and voice messaging system. It offers a suite of command line, graphical, 
              and Web interfaces for configuration, control, and access (Figure 
              1). You can use VOCP to create a tree of boxes for menus, voicemail, 
              pagers, faxing, and the like.
            <p> VOCP answers incoming calls and places callers in the "root" box, 
              usually comprised of a greeting message and menu. Callers may navigate 
              the system tree, moving from box to box, by entering choices with 
              their touch-tone keypad. VOCP supports a number of different box 
              types, and this article will focus on the boxes with the greatest 
              potential value for the systems administrator -- the "command shell" 
              boxes.
            <p> These "command shell" boxes allow administrators to interact with 
              the system -- running programs and hearing their output. If you 
              can run it on the command line or script it, you can now do it through 
              any DTMF telephone. VOCP can accommodate any number of distinct 
              command shells and provides fine-grained control over the executables 
              that are available and under which privileges they run.
            <p> <b>The VOCP User Interface</b>
            <p> A VOCP user accesses the network through a series of phone-activated 
              menus known as boxes. A command shell is a specific box type that 
              acts like a restricted shell. These boxes aren't available through 
              the public call flow tree, access is instead restricted in a manner 
              similar to voicemail message retrieval. After a person has logged 
              into a command shell box, a limited set of commands are available, 
              through the selections configured for this box by the VOCP administrator. 
              Each selection executes a single program. At a minimum, a selection 
              consists of a program to run and a return value specifying the output 
              format. The box has an owner, and all programs executed through 
              the box will run with the privileges of that owner.
            <p> After a caller has successfully logged into a command shell, she 
              may choose to run any of the available selections using the telephone 
              keypad. Each selection may accept caller input and will provide 
              some type of response.
            <p> A selection may request caller input before running the associated 
              executable. The caller input will be passed to the program as its 
              final argument. User input can be interpreted as raw DTMF (0-9,A-D 
              and *) or as text. For example, a script might be created to send 
              an email notification to an arbitrary user, and a command-line argument 
              associated with the script would specify the user that should receive 
              the notification. Through the telephone, each letter is selected 
              by entering the DTMF key on which it resides, followed by its position 
              on that key. For example, pressing "21" is equivalent to entering 
              the letter "a"; thus, to send a message to "fred", the caller would 
              enter "33 72 32 31" using the telephone's keypad. The process is 
              described in detail at:

<b>VOCP Output</b><p>
            Because VOCP is designed to operate over the telephone, any VOCP-related 
            output must be transmitted to the user in audio format. In the simplest 
            case, VOCP reads the program's numeric exit status. Although the exit 
            status might be sufficient in instances where your interest is restricted 
            to whether the command has succeeded or not, it quickly becomes inadequate 
            in more complex scenarios, such as querying the system for status 
            information. This is where VOCP's text-to-speech support really shines.
            <p> VOCP uses the return value associated with the menu selection 
              to determine how to interpret the output. Valid return values include:
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li> exit -- As described above, exit simply reads the program's 
                exit status. 
              <li> output -- With the return value set to output, VOCP reads one 
                or more lines of numerical output (consisting of numbers and periods 
                only). This format can be useful for reading things like IP addresses, 
                as demonstrated in the example ip.pl script included with VOCP. 
              <li> file -- Your program may print one or more audio file paths 
                to standard out. These files are played to the user in sequence. 
                For example, printing:
                <p> 
                <pre>
/path/to/servtemp.rmd
/path/to/60.rmd
/path/to/5.rmd
/path/to/degrees.rmd
</pre>
                would presumably play a message to the effect that "the current 
                server temperature is sixty-five degrees". (The audio files should 
                be in the RMD format required by your voice modem, but VOCP will 
                convert other formats, such as au and wav, appropriately.)
                <p> 
              <li> sendfax -- If the selection outputs the path to a g3 fax file 
                and has its return set to sendfax, you can implement a dynamic 
                fax-on-demand box. After running the selection, VOCP will instruct 
                vgetty to go into fax mode and send the file specified by your 
                program. You must of course be capable of receiving a fax at your 
                location for this option to be useful. 
              <li> tts -- Text-to-speech output (tts) offers the most flexibility 
                but requires that you install the Festival text-to-speech engine. 
                For selections with a return set to tts, VOCP reads the text output 
                from your program, converts it to audio using Festival, and plays 
                it for the caller. Text-to-speech may be used to hear system status, 
                read Web pages or anything else (see the sample sysstat.pl and 
                webfetch.pl scripts, included with VOCP). The only requirement 
                is that your program output plain text on standard out.</ul>
                <p> <b>Installation</b>
                <p> VOCP requires vgetty (the voice extension to the mgetty+sendfax 
                  package), Perl, a Unix-type computer, and a voice modem that 
                  is supported by vgetty.
                <p> <b>vgetty</b>
                <p> To begin, any older mgetty installation should be removed. 
                  Get the latest version of mgetty+sendfax (<b>http://www.leo.org/~doering/mgetty/</b>) 
                  and VOCP (<b>http://www.vocpsystem.com/</b>). You may install 
                  mgetty+sendfax and vgetty by following the directions within 
                  but, if you are unsure of your modem's compatibility, it is 
                  best to include our "force_detect" vgetty patch. Unpack VOCP, 
                  change into the vocp-X.X.X/prog/dependencies/mgetty-patch/, 
                  and run install_patched_vgetty.pl as root.
                <p> After vgetty has been installed, edit the /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/voice.conf 
                  file and set the "voice_devices" parameter to the device used 
                  by your modem, for example:
                <p> 
                <pre>
voice_devices ttyS1
</pre>
                If you want to use text-to-speech, retrieve the Festival Speech 
                Synthesis System from:
                <p> 
                <pre>
http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/
</pre>
                Then, install it according to the instructions and make note of 
                the location where you've installed it.
                <p> To install VOCP, determine the RMD format to use with your 
                  modem. Convert a wave file to PVF format using mgetty's wavtopvf 
                  program, or select a PVF file from the vocp-X.X.X/messages directory 
                  and convert it to RMD with the pvftormd utility. Use:
                <p> 
                <pre>
$ pvftormd -L
</pre>
                to list acceptable RMD formats and compression methods. Convert 
                the pvf file by specifying a format suitable for your modem. For 
                example:
                <p> 
                <pre>
$ pvftormd US_Robotics 1 file.pvf file.rmd
</pre>
                is suitable for many USR voice modems. Test the resulting rmd 
                file with your modem with vgetty's vm program. Try:
                <p> 
                <pre>
$ vm play -H file.rmd
</pre>
                and listen in on the handset connected to your voice modem. If 
                vm fails or doesn't sound right, check the /var/log/vgetty.ttySX 
                and /var/log/vm.log files for errors and try another of the available 
                RMD formats or compression methods. Make note of the RMD format 
                and compression combination that sounds best.
                <p> As root, run the install_vocp.pl script from within the top-level 
                  vocp-X.X.X directory. VOCP requires a few Perl modules to run, 
                  such as Modem::Vgetty. If these are unavailable, you will be 
                  asked whether you want to install them. Say "y" and the installation 
                  script will fetch and install them all through CPAN.
                <p> If this is a first-time installation, the script will convert 
                  the system messages from their Portable Voice Format (pvf) to 
                  the appropriate Raw Modem Date (rmd) format for your modem. 
                  You will need to specify which of the available formats to select; 
                  use the values determined above.
                <p> If you've installed Festival, say "y" to the "Do you wish 
                  to use Text-to-speech" question and indicate the full path to 
                  its bin/text2wave program. You will also be prompted for the 
                  name of a VOCP group to create. Enter a valid group name or 
                  press enter to accept the default value (vocp).
                <p> Arrange for vgetty to listen for incoming calls and be re-spawned 
                  on termination. Under Linux, this involves adding a line such 
                  as:
                <p> 
                <pre>
S1:345:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/vgetty ttyS1
</pre>
                to /etc/inittab and running <b>init q</b> as root, forcing init 
                to reread its configuration file. In this example, the modem is 
                on ttyS1; adjust the device appropriately for your setup. Verify 
                that vgetty is indeed running and check the /var/log/vgetty.ttySX 
                log file to ensure your modem was correctly recognized. The installation 
                process is fully described on the VOCP site if you encounter any 
                snags.
                <p> <b>Configuration</b>
                <p> Begin by ensuring that vgetty is correctly configured. The 
                  important vgetty configuration files are mgetty.config and voice.conf. 
                  Both files usually reside in /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/ 
                  and are well documented. The most important parameters are the 
                  <b>voice_devices</b>, <b>voice_shell</b>, and <b>call_program</b> 
                  in voice.conf. Use:
                <p> 
                <pre>
voice_devices  ttyS1
voice_shell    /usr/bin/perl
call_program   /etc/mgetty+sendfax/vocp/vocp.pl
</pre>
                adjusting the voice_devices parameter to the location of your 
                modem.
                <p> VOCP is configured using two distinct files: vocp.conf, which 
                  is used to store general parameters, and boxes.conf, which determines 
                  the call tree layout and command shell selections.
                <p> Open /etc/vocp/vocp.conf in your favorite editor, and you 
                  will see that it has a simple format and is also extensively 
                  self-documented. The most important parameters you need to set 
                  are <b>rmdformat</b>, <b>rmdcompression</b>, and <b>rmdsample</b>, 
                  which are modem dependent and specify the exact format to use 
                  when creating audio files (as determined above using <b>pvftormd</b> 
                  and <b>vm</b>).
                <p> To represent arbitrary call trees and ensure flexibility, 
                  the boxes.conf file contains an XML description of the system. 
                  You can create this file by hand, based on the included example 
                  and documentation, but it is much easier to use the /usr/local/vocp/bin/boxconf.pl 
                  GUI. BoxConf presents a simple graphical interface that allows 
                  you to maintain your VOCP system box configuration. (Note that 
                  you must have Perl Tk installed to use it.)
                <p> Listing 1 shows a portion of the boxes.conf file produced 
                  by boxconf.pl. It describes box number 600 of type "command" 
                  (a command shell box). When logged into this box, only two selections 
                  will be available: 100 and 200. Entering "100#" will cause the 
                  system to prompt the caller for input. Assuming the user enters 
                  "33723231#", the selection will be run as "sendemail.sh fred", 
                  since the "input" element is set to "text". Both selections 
                  will be executed as user "nobody", thanks to the box "owner" 
                  setting.
                <p> You may notice that there is no means of authenticating users 
                  in the configuration. Because other portions of VOCP, such as 
                  the message retrieval GUI, require access to the box configuration, 
                  it has been split into two files: boxes.conf and boxes.conf.shadow, 
                  much as in the standard shadow password mechanism. While boxes.conf 
                  is legible by all, the boxes.conf.shadow file contains the (optionally 
                  crypted) passwords and must be readable only by root and members 
                  of the vocp group created during installation.
                <p> To create a command shell box, launch boxconf.pl as root (Figure 
                  2). Click on the "New Box" button, select "command" for the 
                  box type, and click "Ok". Enter a unique box number, select 
                  a box owner, enter a password, and click "Ok". The new command 
                  shell box number will appear in the list near the bottom of 
                  the window. To make selections available from within this command 
                  shell, double-click the box number then hit the "New Selection" 
                  button. In the window that appears, enter the selection number, 
                  the program to run, and the type of response VOCP should provide 
                  afterwards. Clicking "Ok" will add the new selection to the 
                  list.
                <p> When you are done, File-&gt;Save the new configuration. It 
                  is recommended that you save it somewhere other than /etc/vocp 
                  and take a peek inside to ensure everything looks good before 
                  moving the new boxes.conf and boxes.conf.shadow to /etc/vocp/.
                <p> <b>Using Command Shells</b>
                <p> Once installation is complete, you may use the /usr/local/vocp/bin/vocplocal.pl 
                  script to simulate a call using your keyboard and speakers, 
                  use the Call Center to interact with VOCP through your local 
                  handset, or simply call in to test your setup. Normal navigation 
                  through the system involves listening to menus and entering 
                  single digit input to make selections.
                <p> To retrieve voicemail or interact with the command shells, 
                  callers may access the login menu at any time by entering *999#. 
                  At the prompt, enter the box number optionally followed by the 
                  pound sign (#). Enter the password after the system has requested 
                  it. You should now be logged into the command shell. Unless 
                  disabled in vocp.conf, entering 9# will provide a listing of 
                  available selections using Festival's text-to-speech.
                <p> Enter the number of the selection you want to run. Depending 
                  on its setup, you may be prompted for input. The selection will 
                  run and play its response, after which you may enter another 
                  selection.
                <p> Enter 0# to exit the shell and terminate the call, or 001# 
                  to return to the root box (from which you may navigate the system 
                  or log into another box).
                <p> Typical uses include querying the system for various information, 
                  such as which processes are running and who is logged in. System 
                  load and free memory or disk space are all easily reported using 
                  selections with text-to-speech. You can also use command shells 
                  to start and stop services, or even (gasp!) reboot the server. 
                  The possibilities are endless -- if you can script it, you can 
                  run it through a command shell selection.
                <p> Additionally, automated monitoring processes may be set up 
                  to use the VOCP delivery agent such that they will send periodic 
                  messages or alerts to your voicemail, pager, or email box.
                <p> <b>Security</b>
                <p> Because command shells allow a user to run programs on the 
                  VOCP host, special considerations apply when creating these 
                  boxes. To begin, all programs available through the command 
                  shells must be located in the commanddir, specified in vocp.conf 
                  (/var/spool/voice/commands by default). You can either move 
                  the program into the directory, or make a softlink residing 
                  in the commanddir that points to the program to run. It may 
                  be a good idea to have an automated process monitor this directory 
                  for modifications.
                <p> Some guidelines to command shell creation are:
                <p> 
                <p> 
                <ul>
                  <li> Select box owners judiciously -- Follow the principle of 
                    least privilege and set the box owner to a user with only 
                    the privileges required to run the selections. Create command 
                    boxes as needed, with higher privileged commands available 
                    in their own boxes; the caller can run selections in one box, 
                    log into another to run special commands, and return to the 
                    original box afterwards (similar to using the <b>su</b> command). 
                  <li> Keep passwords safe -- Ensure the boxes.conf.shadow file 
                    has the correct permissions (0440 or 0640), and crypt the 
                    passwords. 
                  <li> Use text passwords -- VOCP expects passwords to be entered 
                    using the DTMF keys and long strings of numbers are difficult 
                    to remember, so there is a tendency to select short and easy 
                    passwords. You can get around this by specifying passwords 
                    as text strings. Text passwords are entered in the same manner 
                    as text input to selections. 
                  <li> Be careful of the selections you make available within 
                    the command boxes --Although you wouldn't make the mistake 
                    of having <b>rm -rf /</b> as an available selection, ponder 
                    the effects of each selection you make available, especially 
                    if it accepts user input. 
                  <li> Use <b>restrictLoginFrom</b> -- Get a modem that supports 
                    caller ID (CND), subscribe to the service, and set the <b>restrictLoginFrom</b> 
                    option for command shell boxes. The <b>restrictLoginFrom</b> 
                    box parameter allows you to specify a regular expression that 
                    the call origin number must match in order to access the box. 
                    If you know you'll only be calling from one or a few distinct 
                    numbers, you can make the regex very strict. For example, 
                    setting <b>restrictLoginFrom</b> to <b>^(5551212|5551234)$</b> 
                    will allow access only for calls from 555-1212 and 555-1234.
                </ul>
                <b>Hints</b>
                <p> Here are a few additional suggestions that will make using 
                  VOCP command shells more enjoyable and productive.
                <p> 
                <p> 
                <ul>
                  <li> Take the time to install Festival. Text-to-speech output 
                    is the most helpful and flexible way to return meaningful 
                    feedback. 
                  <li> Try to anticipate situations in which you will be using 
                    the command shells, and set the selections accordingly. Allow 
                    some flexibility where warranted by accepting input for your 
                    selections. 
                  <li> Although selection input is useful, don't expect to write 
                    your thesis through the telephone: two digits per letter will 
                    get tiresome quickly. 
                  <li> Look at the example command shell scripts included with 
                    VOCP in the vocp-X.X.X/commands/ directory. Some may be useful 
                    "as is"; all may help you in creating your own. 
                  <li> Heed the security indications above.
                </ul>
                <p> The VOCP Web site is packed with information to help you install, 
                  set up, and use VOCP. There is also a thriving user community 
                  available through the vocp-users mailing list in case you need 
                  some advice or an extra hand. Finally, the creators of VOCP 
                  are available for commercial support and site-specific customizations, 
                  through Psychogenic.
                <p> <b>Conclusion</b>
                <p> You can use VOCP to monitor systems and perform administrative 
                  tasks, no matter where you are. In this article, I've focused 
                  on the VOCP command shell setup and modes of operation. How 
                  exactly you use the command shells will depend on the specific 
                  issues you want to address and where you strike the balance 
                  between selection flexibility and simplicity. I haven't touched 
                  upon all the other uses you may have for the voice messaging 
                  system, but you can find out more on the Web site. The creators 
                  of VOCP are always looking for ways to improve it, so if you 
                  have a suggestion or particular problem you think should be 
                  addressed, let them know.
