<B>SuSE Linux Debuts on IBM S/390</b><p>SuSE Linux has announced the port of SuSE Linux OS to the IBM S/390 hardware platform. The first beta version of SuSE Linux for IBM S/390 will be available from SuSE's ftp server (<B>ftp://ftp.suse.com</B>). The release of the production version is scheduled for this fall. The independent International Data Cooperation (IDC) found that the market share for Linux servers rose from 16% to 25% within the last year. The S/390 architecture allows configuring logical partitions on a single machine so different operating systems (OS/390, VM/ESA, VSE/ESA) can run independently. These partitions allow businesses to adopt SuSE Linux while maintaining their current OS environments.<P>
SuSE Linux supports Intel platforms, PowerPCs, and Alpha processors. SuSE support of S/390 facilitates platform interoperability and unifies systems administration tasks for heterogeneous networks. For more information, contact: <I>SuSE, Inc., 580 Second Street Suite 210, Oakland, CA 94607; (510)-628-3380; Fax: (510)-628-3381; WWW: http://www.suse.com.<P>
