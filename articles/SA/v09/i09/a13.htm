<P>
</I>I apologize to Advanced Computer &amp; Network Corporation for not referencing their Web site as a source of benchmarking information in the July Q&amp;A column. Please visit their Web site at: <B>http://www.acnc.com/benchmarks.html</B> to read their full write-up on benchmarks. Again, I apologize to AC&amp;NC for my omission.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> If I have two partitions on my hard drive, is it possible to have Solaris 7 on both the partitions?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Yes. You can also have Solaris on one partition and any other operating system you&#146;d like on the other. There are many ways to do this. I suggest partitioning the disk with as many partitions as you need (at least three &#151; one for each Solaris install and one for a shared SWAP area).<P>
Assuming that you installed Solaris on slice 3 and slice 4, you need to use the following commands to boot: <B>boot disk:d</B> to boot from slice 3, and <B>boot disk:e</B> to boot from slice 4.<P>
Just configure each Solaris install to use the slice you set aside for SWAP (or use slice 1 and Solaris will automatically use it).<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I want root to be able to <B>telnet</B> into my system. How do I allow this?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> While this is not a good idea, since <B>telnet</B> will send a password in clear-text (see below), here&#146;s how you do it:<P>
<P>
1.  Look in the <B>/etc/default/login</B> file for the line that starts &#147;CONSOLE&#148; (all upper case).<P>
2.  Delete the <B>CONSOLE=/dev/console</B> line.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> How do I tell how much disk space a user is using?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Use <B>quot -af | grep username</B>. Quot is the facility that displays the number of blocks (1024 bytes) in the named filesystem currently owned by each user. The <B>-a</B> flag will check all of the mounted filesystems. The <B>-f</B> flag displays the number of files as well as space owned by each user. The <B>grep username</B> will only display the line for the user you are reviewing. Leave that out if you want to see the report for every user on the system.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I&#146;ve been asked to &#147;lock down&#148; my server. Where should I start?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> By &#147;lock down&#148;, I&#146;m assuming that you want to control the network access to your system. Start by editing <B>/etc/inetd.conf</B> and removing (or commenting out) all of the entries that you don&#146;t need (<B>finger</B>, all of the <B>r:</B> commands, etc.). The <B>inetd.conf</B> file contains the list of servers that <B>inetd</B> invokes when it receives an Internet request over a socket. Run a <B>kill -HUP</B> against the <B>inetd</B> PID to re-read the <B>inetd.conf</B> file. You should also consider installing <B>ssh</B> to replace <B>telnet</B>. You can also install <B>tcp_wrappers</B> to limit access to the services that you leave in <B>inetd.conf</B>. You can download <B>tcp_wrappers</B> from many sites on the Web.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> How do I add a new hard drive to my Sparc-based Solaris system?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Assuming that you are using vanilla Solaris, here are the steps: <P>
1. Shutdown and power-off the system.<P>
2. Install the drive and restart the system.<P>
3. Find out the address of the drive:<P>
&#149;  Press STOP-A<br>
&#149;  At the OK prompt, type <B>probe-scsi</B>. (This will list all SCSI devices on the system.)<br>
&#149;  Find the new drive in the list and note its information.<pr>
4. Type <B>boot -r</B>. When the system comes up, Solaris will be able to use the drive.<P>
5. Login as <B>root</B> and type &#147;format&#148;. Select the new drive. The drives are listed as <B>c</B>(controller number), <B>t</B>(target id or SCSI id), <B>d</B>(disk number). (Example: c0t0d0.)<P>
6. Next, type &#147;partition&#148;. Partition the drive as required. Always leave partition (or slice) 2 alone. Slice 2 represents the whole disk.<P>
7. Type &#147;print&#148; to list the current partitions and check your work.<P>
8. Exit out of the format command.<P>
9. From the command prompt, create a filesystem: <B>newfs /dev/dsk/DRIVE-ADDRESS</B> (i.e., <B>newfs</B> <B>/dev/dsk/c2t4d0s3</B>).<P>
10. Now make the mount point for the new filesystem: <B>mkdir &lt;directory-name&gt;</B> (i.e., <B>mkdir /new_disk</B>).<P>
11. Mount the new filesystem: <B>mount /dev/dsk/DRIVE-ADDRESS &lt;directory-name&gt;</B> (i.e., <B>mount /dev/dsk/c2t4d0s3 /new_disk</B>).<P>
12. Add the new entry to your <B>/etc/vfstab</B> file so that the filesystem will be mounted at each reboot (i.e., <B>/dev/dsk/c2t4d0s3 /dev/rdsk/c2t4d0s3 /new_disk ufs 1 yes -</B>).<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> How do I set up user disk quotas?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0><P>
1. Edit the file <B>/etc/vfstab</B> in a text edit. For the filesystem on which you want quotas, add the word &#147;quota&#148; to the mount options:<P>
<pre>
/dev/dsk/c2t4d0s3 /dev/rdsk/c2t4d0s3  \
   /new_disk ufs 1 yes quota
</pre>
2. Create a file called &#147;quotas&#148; in the &#147;root&#148; of the filesystem you want to monitor:<P>
<pre>
touch /new_disk/quotas
</pre>
3. Use <B>edquota</B> to edit the quota for a user. To edit the quota for the user &#147;Bubba&#148;:<P>
<pre>
edquota bubba
</pre>
4. Set the soft and hard quotas you want for the user (in kilobytes). Do the same for inodes. Soft is the limit where a user receives a warning when he exceeds the limit. Hard is the limit where the user can no longer save files when he hits the limit. To edit the settings of a user with a soft limit of 100 MB, and a hard limit of 150 MB, with 1 inode per block:<P>
<pre>
fs /new_disk blocks (soft=102400, hard=153600) \
   inodes (soft=1024, hard=1536)
</pre>
5. Run <B>quotacheck</B> to implement the new quotas:<P>
<pre>
quotacheck /new_disk
</pre>
6. To apply the same quotas out to many users, use the <B>-p</B> flap to <B>edquota</B>. For example, to push Bubba&#146;s quota out to Tom, Dick, and Harry, use the following:<P>
<pre>
edquota -p bubba tom dick harry
</pre>
7. To see usage reports on quotas, use the command<P>
<pre>
quotacheck -a.
</pre>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I keep getting timeout errors from Sendmail. How do I fix this?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Sometimes the default TCP/IP abort interval timeout in Solaris 2.x (2 minutes), is too short, and some programs timeout if the response is too slow. To increase this timeout period, use:<P>
<pre>
/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/tcp   \
   tcp_ip_abort_interval 600000
</pre>
Units are in microseconds (600000 microseconds equals 10 minutes).<P>
Solaris allows you to tune, tweak, set, and reset various parameters related to the TCP/IP stack while the system is running (as opposed to a kernel rebuild). <B>ndd</B> is used to get and set some kernel driver parameters. For example, to see which parameters the TCP driver supports, use:<P>
<pre>
ndd /dev/tcp \?
</pre>
To turn IP Forwarding off, which is good to do if you have two network cards in one system and you don&#146;t want the server to route any packets between the two networks:<P>
<pre>
ndd -set /dev/ip ip_forwarding 0
</pre>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I&#146;ve always heard that <B>telnet</B> is not secure. Why?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> The biggest reason <B>telnet</B> is not considered secure is that it sends your password across the network in clear-text, which is really bad if you are <B>root</B>. To see this, use <B>snoop</B>. <B>snoop</B> is a command that puts your system&#146;s network card in promiscuous mode. By being in promiscuous mode, <B>snoop</B> captures all packets on you network, in either real time, or saved to a file. In real-time mode, the data flies across your screen too fast to read. To do some serious analysis, capture your network traffic to a file.<P>
To capture data to a file, the command is:<P>
<pre>
snoop -o &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>
To see the <B>telnet</B> clear-text password problem, run <B>snoop -v -o &lt;filename&gt;</B> on your Sun workstation. <B>telnet</B> to another server and log in. Stop your <B>snoop</B> command (<B>&lt;ctrl-c</B>). To view the file, use <B>snoop -v -i &lt;filename&gt;</B>. You should be able to find the packet that contains your password in readable text. Do the same test using <B>ssh</B> and you should not find your password in the <B>snoop</B> output.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I&#146;m using automounter to mount my users&#146; home directories on demand (<B>/home</B>). Now the mounts are not working. What is the problem?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> The automounter is a program that automatically does mounts and unmounts of designated NFS partitions. It has maps that list what directories it controls in this manner. Automounted directories start out unmounted, and are mounted when someone tries to access them. After a certain idle time, the automounted directory is unmounted.<P>
There are two types of automounter maps: direct and indirect. A direct map lists a set of unrelated mount points that may be spread out across the filesystem. A complete path (i.e., <B>/usr/local/bin</B> or <B>/usr/man</B>) is listed in the map as a mount point. An indirect map sets aside a directory, and mounts everything in the map into that directory (i.e., the <B>auto.home</B> map sets aside <B>/home</B>, and everything in the <B>auto.home</B> map is mounted under that directory).<P>
It is common for automounted mounts to fail because something has been put in the directory of the problem client. Make sure that the <B>/home</B> directory is totally empty on the client before the automounter is started.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I have a file system that is showing 100% full in <B>df -k</B> output. How do I find the files that filled the file system?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> The best way to find the large files is to <B>cd</B> into the file system that is full (e.g., <B>cd /va</B>r). Now run the <B>du -s *</B> command. The output of <B>du</B> will show the size of directories and files in 512 kb blocks. If there are no odd-looking large files in that directory, look into each directory that was listed, starting with the largest. In the case of the example (<B>/va</B>r), <B>/var/adm</B> will probably be one of the largest. <B>cd</B> to <B>/var/adm</B> and do the <B>du -s *</B> command again to find large files, or <B>cd</B> to the largest directory. Keep searching. It takes some practice to find the offensive file(s).<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> When I <B>ftp</B> a file from my Windows workstation to my UNIX box the file appears corrupted. Why is this happening?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> What you&#146;re probably seeing is the <B>^M</B> at the end of each line. This is because the file is in DOS format and not UNIX (ISO) format. Use the <B>dos2unix</B> command to convert the file to UNIX format after you <B>ftp</B> it. You will also note that if you print UNIX ascii files to some network printers they just print out as one big line. This is because the printer expects a DOS-formatted file. To print correctly, do something like this: <B>unix2dos &lt;unix-file&gt; | lp</B>. This command converts the file to DOS and sends it to the printer.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I was editing a file (using <B>vi</B>) when my Linux box crashed (OK, it didn&#146;t crash, I accidentally switched off the power supply). Did I lose all of my work?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Maybe not. Try <B>vi -r &lt;file name&gt;</B>. The <B>-r</B> flag will restore your file in the case of a crash. If this command works, then make sure that you do a write (<B>:w</B>) as quickly as possible so that you don&#146;t risk losing the work again. <P>
