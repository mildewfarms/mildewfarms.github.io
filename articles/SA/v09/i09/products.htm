</I><B>ICP Announced SCSI Wonder</B><P>

ICP vortex has announced SCSI Wonder, which extends SCSI cables beyond their normal limitations, repeats and amplifies the bus signals, and can terminate the bus in a clustered environment. The SCSI Wonder can transform a Single Ended (SE) bus into an LVDS bus and vice versa, permitting integration of SE devices into LVDS systems without slowing down the faster LVDS devices.<P>
SCSI Wonder functions as a bus extender &#151; it can be placed at the end of a 12-meter U2/U160 cable and it will extend the signal so that another 12-meter cable can be plugged into the other side of the SCSI wonder. Up to three SCSI Wonders can be used on one SCSI bus, extending an LVDS bus up to 48 meters in total length. With its repeater function, SCSI Wonder can be used to clean up noisy SCSI signals. SCSI Wonder can be used in a situation where a SCSI bus may need to be temporarily disconnected for repairs or reconfiguration. While connected, SCSI Wonder acts as a repeater, but when disconnected, SCSI Wonder terminates the SCSI bus, allowing all but the disconnected segment to continue working.<P>
