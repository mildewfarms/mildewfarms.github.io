<B>Space Optimization Tool for MS Exchange Introduced by VERITAS Software</B><P>

VERITAS Software Corporation has introduced VERITAS Remote Storage for MS Exchange (RSE), a storage management application designed to minimize storage space on Microsoft Exchange servers by automatically moving email message attachments from the Exchange database onto a secondary storage device. This product can be integrated with VERITAS backup products, allowing shorter backup and recovery time and potentially improving system performance through the smaller database size.<P>
VERITAS Remote Storage for MS Exchange allows organizations to move older message attachments within Exchange databases to a secondary storage device, such as a tape drive or library that users might already be using to back up their systems. With VERITAS RSE, the size of Exchange databases may shrink by as much as 50 percent, while Exchange clients retain complete access to all of the message attachments that have been moved by VERITAS RSE.<P>
VERITAS RSE gives administrators the ability to create policies that determine how and which attachments are to be managed per Exchange server. Selection criteria can be based on size and age of the attachments. Additionally, administrators may define policies, specifying which attachments to move and when to move them to streamline performance.<P>
Additionally, VERITAS Software has created VERITAS Data Analyzer for Exchange, a tool that examines the user's Exchange databases, evaluating what percentage of the database is composed of attachments versus message text, as well as the age and size of the attachments that are in the databases. The Analyzer Tool provides administrators with statistics about the data being managed by VERITAS RSE, illustrating the amount of space being freed up by VERITAS RSE. A &#147;what if&#148; scenario provides administrators the opportunity to visualize what their databases would look like based on the implementation of different policies prior to actually implementing those changes. For pricing and other information, contact: <I>VERITAS Software Corporation, 1600 Plymouth Street, Mountain View, CA 94043; (650) 335-8000; Fax: (650) 335-8050; Internet: vx-sales@veritas.com; WWW: http://www.veritas.com/.</I><P>

<B>Imperial Expands MegaRam-35 Capacity</B><P>

Imperial Technology has increased the capacity of its 3.5-inch MegaRam-35 solid state disk. The MegaRam-35 now offers up to 4.2 GB of volatile storage, and up to 2.1 GB of nonvolatile storage. The expanded size allows administrators improved I/O performance by shifting often-used hot files (such as tables and indices, as well as <B>log</B>, <B>temp</B>, and <B>swap</B> files) to the MegaRam disk, which results in read/write times that match main memory speeds.<P>
The MegaRam solid state disks are compatible with Solaris running both on Intel and SPARC machines. The MegaRam-35 system is comprised of an Ultra SCSI interface, built-in configuration and diagnostic firmware, and proprietary error detection and correction circuitry. It is available in rackmount, internal mount, and desktop enclosures.<P>
A nonvolatile version of MegaRam-35 includes an internal disk and battery unit, which saves all data to a backup disk using battery power when AC power to the unit is cut off. When power is restored, the information is automatically moved from the disk to the solid state memory. For more information about the MegaRam-35 solid state disk, contact: <I>WWW: http://www.imperialtech.com/homemega.html.</I><P>

<B>IBM Introduces SNAPP</B><P>

IBM has introduced SNAPP, a Web-based software package that allows users to install, set up, and manage RS/6000 servers via devices running Palm Computing's Palm OS platform. SNAPP (system networking, analysis, and performance pilot) requires only a limited understanding of UNIX. It defines a PalmPilot as the client user interface, which means that PalmPilot users can install and attach an RS/6000 B50 server to a network. Users can then perform basic administrative tasks on RS/6000 systems using Graffiti-based instructions.<P>
This browser-server application enables quick set-up, maintenance, and rapid application deployment in the large Internet and application service provider industry. The PalmPilot connects to an RS/6000 server via the serial port and establishes communication with the server via an XML-based connection. The XML communication interface makes the application completely extensible and customizable to the customer's environment. Current capabilities include network set-up, memory, CPU, disk monitoring, WebServer management, and system model and configuration reporting with full security (root password protection). The building blocks of this application scale from simple to complex system management tasks. For more information or to download the SNAPP software from IBM, contact: <I>WWW: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/snapp.</I><P>
