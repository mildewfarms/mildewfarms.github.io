<B>Open BSD Launches OpenBSD 2.6</B><P>

OpenBSD has launched OpenBSD 2.6, an operating system that integrates the open source OpenSSH secure communication tools in the base system. According to the company, OpenBSD comes even closer to being &#147;Secure by Default&#148;. OpenBSD's &#147;Secure by Default&#148; configuration lets administrators set up an Internet server and run it. An ongoing thorough audit of the source code for sloppy coding practices and security risks is OpenBSD's recipe for &#147;hardening&#148; the OS. In addition to OpenSSH, OpenBSD integrates several cryptographic algorithms.<P>
Based on UC Berkeley's 4.4BSD-Lite, OpenBSD 2.6 operates on multiple hard platforms such as SPARC, Mac68K, and PCs. OpenBSD is free, reusable software, available on the Internet under a Berkeley-style license. OpenBSD on the Web can be found at <B>http://www.OpenBSD.org</B>. OpenSSH can be found at <B>http://www.OpenSSH.com</B>. For more information about <I>OpenBSD, contact: The Computer Shop, Calgary, Canada; (403) 243-4356; Fax: (403) 243-2684; WWW: http://www.OpenBSD.org/orders.html</I>.<P>

<B>Shpink Announces Network Shell 3.0</B><P>

Shpink Software has announced Network Shell 3.0. Network Shell provides a shell and Perl environment that lets systems administrators perform secure, automated, and interactive system administration of remote hosts without the need to <B>telnet</B> or establish a remote shell connection to each host individually. Network Shell is a secure administration environment. Network Shell supports access control lists to manage host access and permissions on a per host, subnet, and user level with security granularity extending down to the command level. Sessions to remote hosts can be encrypted (up to 128 bits) with either DES, Triple DES (3DES), or Blowfish cipher engines.<P>
Network Shell v3.0 supports concurrent management of multiple UNIX and Windows 9x/NT machines from a single UNIX or Windows NT administration station. Network Shell optionally includes a Windows NT client that lets administrators use UNIX commands to manage remote Windows and UNIX systems.<P>
Pricing for Network Shell v3.0 starts at $199 per single UNIX/NT server license and includes a Network Shell client license for a UNIX host. Each Network Shell client for Windows NT requires a separate additional license also priced at $199.
