<B>CRYPTOCard Provides Strong Encryption for Red Hat Linux</B><P>

CRYPTOCard and Red Hat, Inc. have announced that CRYPTOCard's CRYPTOAdmin 4.0 authentication server will ship with the Red Hat Linux 6.1 application CD. CRYPTOAdmin provides token-based authentication into VPNs, firewalls, and secure extranets. With CRYPTOAdmin and the accompanying API toolkit, developers of security servers (such as those using Secure Shell, SHH) can integrate CRYPTOCard's strong authentication directly.<P>
CRYPTOAdmin is supplied as an RPM file for easy installation and its client-server architecture supports de-centralized administration of centralized authentication. Included with CRYPTOAdmin 4.0 and CRYPTOKit, CRYPTOCard has made available five software tokens and licenses for five RB-1 hardware tokens, which customers must request before June 30, 2000. Customers should contact CRYPTOCard to purchase additional tokens.<P>
CRYPTOAdmin 4.0 is the platform for the company's array of tokens: the RB-1 portable card, the ST-1 (client-server) and AT-1 (Web browser) 100% Pure Java tokens, and the CT-1 command line virtual token. CRYPTOCard's tokens generate and display a one-time password through an event-synchronous method of authentication called QuickLog. QuickLog is based on the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm and provides users with a unique new password for each logon attempt. There is no annual license or maintenance fee for the software or tokens.<P>

The Line Printer Daemon (LPD, RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also supported with reduced functionality. CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer Description (PPD)-based printing options to support applications under UNIX. CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript (currently based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that can be used to support non-PostScript printers.<P>
Sample drivers are provided for HP DeskJet and LaserJet printers. Easy Software Products offers drivers for over 1600 printers in their ESP Print Pro. CUPS is licensed under the GNU General Public License.

<B>Western Scientific Adds CD-ROM Network Server</B><P>

Western Scientific has added a line of CD-ROM Network Servers. According to the company, the CD-ROM Network Server gives users concurrent access to CDs over the network using an interface that finds, selects, and runs CD applications without inserting a CD or even having a CD-ROM drive on the workstation. CD-ROM Network Servers attach directly to the network and create &#147;virtual&#148; CD-ROM drives to support multimedia applications including DVDs. Users access the CDs by opening the virtual drive and dragging the appropriate CD icon to the drives.<P>
Base systems start with seven CD drives and 4.3 GB of disk storage. Individual workstations can be connected to 24 virtual drives and 255 users can access the same CD simultaneously. CD-ROM Network Servers are network file server independent, so they operate even when the network is down.
