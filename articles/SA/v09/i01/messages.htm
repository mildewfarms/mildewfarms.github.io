<I>This month's letters correct a few errors that crept into past issues and provide some useful additional information. Thanks to everyone who wrote in! </I>--<I>AA<P>

In July you published a time syncronizing script on page 66. In order to make the script work with Linux (Red Hat 6.0, kernel 2.2.12), I had to make a change. The variable <B>touch_format</B> needs to be:<P>
<PRE>
$touch_format=sprintf("%02.2s%02.2s%02.2s%02.2s%02.2s%02.2s\.%02.2s", 
  $mon,$mday, $hour,$min,$cent,$year,$sec);

Just read the article &#147;Using Screen&#148; on p.23 of the October 1999 issue. It looks like a very nice utility for text-mode interaction, but there is a free graphical equivalent. At my employer's ECONZ (<B>http://www.econz.co.nz</B>), we make extensive use of a utility called VNC. This is available free (OSS) from AT&amp;T in the United Kingdom on <B>http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/</B>.<P>
It allows remote graphical terminals to control other graphical terminals. A terminal can be running X under Linux, Solaris, OSF1, or even any flavour of Windows (including WinCE), MacOS, and even a Palm Pilot. Several consoles can connect simultaneously in either direction.<P>
Because the UNIX VNC session is served from a host, the client can disconnect, go home, log in, and call up the session as it was when they left off. It allows me to control NT servers in a room upstairs, run GUI Linux boxes with no screen attached, or do remote maintenance of large corporate systems in Australia. More prominence needs to be given to this excellent tool.<P>

I noticed a couple of problems in the November 1999 issue. In the &#147;Controlling Spam&#148; article, on p.10, there is a crontab entry that we are instructed to add. There are 2 problems with this entry:<P>
<P>
1.  It is commented out so it will never run. <P>
2.  The author lists every minute that it is to execute.<P>
<P>
I think the entry would be more clear if it were written:<P>
<PRE>
 * * * * * root nice ...
</PRE>
<P>Also, in my Q&amp;A article, on p.67, there is a command:<P>
<PRE>
ufsdump (ufsdump stuff here) &gt; /tmp/output.file two&gt;&amp;1
</PRE>
<P>that should read:<P>
<PRE>
ufsdump (ufsdump stuff here) &gt; /tmp/output.file 2&gt;&amp;1
</PRE>
<P>There is also a command:<P>
<PRE>
ufsdump (ufsdump stuff here) 1&gt; /tmp/output.file 
  two&gt;/outputtwo.file
</PRE>
<P>that should read:<P>
<PRE>
ufsdump (ufsdump stuff here) 1&gt; /tmp/output.file 
  2&gt;/outputtwo.file
</PRE>
<P>And finally, there is a command:<P>
<PRE>
ufsdump (ufsdump stuff here) &gt;&amp; /dev/null
</PRE>
<P>that should read:<P>
<PRE>
ufsdump (ufsdump stuff here) &gt;&amp; /tmp/output.file
</PRE>
Sorry about that. Thanks!<P>
