<B>ActiveState Announces PerlMx</b><p>ActiveState Tool Corp. has announced PerlMx, a mail filter engine designed to operate under Sendmail on the Linux and Solaris platforms. Beginning with v8.10, Sendmail provides scriptable hooks into all stages of an email transaction, including the content of the message itself. PerlMx allows these hooks to be written in Perl, making for rapid prototyping, debugging, and deployment of custom email filtering solutions.<P>
The PerlMx filter operates at the level of the incoming SMTP connection, which means it has complete control over factors such as whether a connection should be accepted, and whether the content received during the connection should be altered before delivery. For example, this allows Sendmail to efficiently deny connections based on various factors such as the sender, recipient, or other content in the body of the message. Since such processing happens as soon as the content is seen by Sendmail, it improves the overall performance of the mailserver.<P>
Designed to provide an efficient, scalable, and customizable framework of solutions for the entire range of email filtering tasks, PerlMx permits: Mail Archiving, selectively logging email traffic based on arbitrary criteria; Volume Accounting, keeping track of email volumes to generate statistics; Custom Routing, redirecting mail to third parties based on sender, recipient, or other external parameters; Spam Control, implementing custom heuristics for weeding out spam email; and Content Rewriting, adding new headers or changing existing content of incoming messages.<P>
To download the beta version of PerlMx visit: <B>http://www.activestate.com/PerlMx/download.html</B>; See the Readme file for system requirements: <B>http://www.activestate.com/ \<BR>

<B>Metro Link Contributes Fixes to Open Motif</b><p>Metro Link, Inc., has released Open Motif with Metro Link's enhancements and bug fixes, available for free ftp download. In May 2000, The Open Group, owners of the Motif user interface toolkit technology, released the Motif source code for royalty-free use, reproduction, and distribution on Open Source Operating systems, such as Linux and FreeBSD. As an official supporter of the Open Motif initiative, Metro Link is providing freely downloadable Motif binary packages based on this source code.<P>
Metro Link's package is an enhanced version of Open Motif, which includes approximately 30 significant bug fixes and enhancements to the Motif libraries and window manager, plus many minor source changes and over 100 fixes to the Motif demo source code. These changes were developed for Metro Link's commercial Motif products, and are now being contributed back to Open Motif.<P>
The latest Metro Link Open Motif binary or source packages can be obtained from the product download page on their Web site at <B>http://www.metrolink.com/openmotif/</B>. Metro Link's Open Motif binary packages are also available directly from The Open Group's official Open Motif Web site at: <B>http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif/</B>.<P>
"Motif has long been a useful, popular tool for developers. Since 1991, Metro Link has been porting, testing, and producing packages for Motif. In fact, Metro Link was the first company to ship a commercial product on Linux, that being Motif. Also, Metro Link Motif has been certified by one of the most popular database vendors as the most stable supported graphical interface available," said Morgan Von Essen, Metro Link CEO and President. "Now that version 2.1.30 is freely available on Open Source systems, Metro Link believes that even more developers will be attracted to the Motif environment with its reliability and portability. As the maintainers of the X Window System for X.Org, we are fully committed to standards-based Open Source development."<P>
Metro Link continues to offer and support its various commercial versions of Motif. These include Metro Motif Complete! (a $149 CD that includes three versions of Motif, which can be mixed and matched at time of installation, or allows you to install up to three simultaneous versions on a single system) and a $99 downloadable supported version of Motif 1.2.4 or 2.1.30.<P>

<B>Syncsort Releases Sigma</b><p>Syncsort Incorporated has released Sigma, a data aggregate engine with a graphical user interface. Sigma reduces the time required to define and maintain aggregates, thereby saving resources and improving responses.<P>
Sigma is a utility for creating, managing, and processing data aggregates or summary tables. The generated aggregates can be pre-stored and used for query optimization within a database or directly for end-user analysis. Sigma provides a GUI and doesn't requires SQL, command options, or batch scripts. Aggregates can be executed interactively through the GUI, or subsequently through a batch job or script. Sigma uses a proprietary optimization technique to provide high performance and fast execution. A permanent central repository aggregates with just a few clicks of a mouse.<P>
Detail data to be aggregated can be input from, and aggregated data can be output to, flat files in a Microsoft Window or UNIX file system or a relational database management system.

<B>SuSE Linux Delivers Linux FailSafe</b><p>SuSE Linux has delivered Linux FailSafe, a scalable and modular high-availability solution based on IRIS FailSafe, SGI's clustering software. Through cooperative engineering efforts, SGI and SuSE have brought IRIS FailSafe's proven functionality to the Linux environment, enabling users to link two or more servers and create a reliable failover environment with a highly scalable and flexible configuration. A Linux FailSafe cluster enables resiliency from any single point of failure and increases application availability to the level required for mission-critical data center operations as well as 24x7 business environments. This failover capability plays a significant role in the maturation of Linux as an enterprise computing environment.<P>
Following this announcement, both SGI and SuSE are actively encouraging members of the Open Source community to participate in the continuing enhancement of Linux FailSafe, as well as test and integrate their code in the new high-availability environment. To participate in this project, please visit: <B>http://oss.sgi.com/projects/failsafe</B>.<P>
