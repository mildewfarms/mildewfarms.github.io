I received a few more letters in regard to Didier Racheneur&#146;s article on SUID programs. We responded to the main points of objection in the July issue, so I won&#146;t cover those again. However, one reader pointed us to an interesting related item. See the following:<P>

Subject:  &#147;Setting Root SUIDed Programs at Work &#151; Build a Backdoor&#148;<P>
<pre>
http://sendmail.net/?feed=000607linuxbug
</pre>A serious bug has been discovered in the Linux kernel that can be used by local users to gain root access. The problem, a vulnerability in the Linux kernel capability model, exists in kernel versions up to and including version 2.2.15. According to Alan Cox, a key member of the Linux developer community, &#147;It will affect programs that drop setuid state and rely on losing saved setuid, even those that check that the setuid call succeeded.&#148;<p>

<I>We appreciate all your letters. Keep writing! &#151;AA</I><P>
Hello Amber,<br>
I have to compliment you for what an excellent magazine <I>Sys Admin</I> is. I am a regular reader of the magazine, especially in regard to Elizabeth Zinkann&#146;s &#147;Books: A User&#146;s Report&#148; column.<P>
I would like to offer a suggestion for her column, which I&#146;m also forwarding to her. I think it would be very helpful if a top ten book selection for specific topic areas was included on a monthly basis. This would be an extremely useful reference for myself, and I&#146;m sure many others when we are looking for high-quality books in our day to day jobs.<P>
Again, thank you for producing such a useful magazine.<p>
Sincerely, <br>
David Carlson<P>

<I>Thanks for the compliment. We&#146;re planning to post a Top Ten Books List on the Web site soon. &#151;AA</I><P>
Subject: <I>Sys Admin</I> Feedback <br>
From: Hans Drexler &lt;drexler@geotax.nl&gt;<P>
I read the article on BSD systems administration on your Web site. I think the author, Michael Lucas wrote an excellent article. The article uncovers the inner workings of the BSD booting process in a very understandable way. Still, it has much more in-depth covering of the subject than most other articles.<P>
I was not even aware of the existence of your magazine previously. But keep publishing articles like this, with actual content in it, and you will have my undivided attention.<P>
Thanks, <br>
Hans Drexler<br>
<P>
<I>Thank you. Note that another article from Michael Lucas will appear next month in the September issue, entitled: </I>FreeBSD&#146;s <B>sysctl</B> Interface<I>. I hope you&#146;ll enjoy it also. &#151;AA</I><P>
Dear <I>Sys Admin</I>,<br>
I just read and loved the article &#147;Building a Jumspstart Server for Solaris&#148;, by Peter van der Weerd in the <I>Sys Admin</I> May 2000 magazine. Since I am somewhat new to jumpstart on Solaris, I hope you can clarify something for me. On page 12 of the article, when editing the <B>host_class</B> file and explaining what it will do, Van der Weerd says it will load an entire distribution with the line cluster SUNWCuser. I believe it should be cluster SUNWCall and that was an error on someone&#146;s part. Could you let me know if I am right or wrong on this point? Thank you very much.<P>
Sincerely,<br>
Nick Patetta njp@spiff.att.com<br>
<P>
<I>Nick, <br>
Oops ... you&#146;re absolutely right!<br>
<P>
SUNWCuser is enduser distribution <br>
SUNWCall is entire distribution<br>
<p>
Sorry about that.<br>
Peter
