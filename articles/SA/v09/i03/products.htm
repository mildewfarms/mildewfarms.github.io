<H1>New Products</H1><p>
<B>Network Instruments Releases Link Analyst</b><p>Network Instruments, LLC has announced Link Analyst, graphical network mapping software, which includes route mapping and historical logging features. Link Analyst complements diagnostic tools such as Network Instruments' Observer protocol analyzer. Link Analyst provides a user-configurable display with the status of each network device and the ability to drill down for more detailed device status.<P>
Link Analyst supports mapping of routes, from the administrator's system to any other IP device. Link Analyst's route mapping can be used to keep track of any WAN, point-to-point connection, or critical site connection. Link Analyst's historical logging function can log the response time for each hop along the route and maintain the total route response times in its database. Link Analyst is extendable for larger networks offering map reference items or &#147;go to&#148; links that are icons representing downstream LANs or WANs on a map.<P>
In addition to maintaining response time information for stations or devices, Link Analyst also provides user-configurable service tracking for devices. Triggers can identify a server that is malfunctioning or responding inefficiently. For example, if an SMTP server is responding to a <B>ping</B>, but email is down, Link Analyst recognizes the difference and can notify the administrator graphically or via an alarm. Alarms include printing a trouble ticket, popping up a window, writing to a log, sending an email, and contacting a pager.<P>
Link Analyst is priced at $495. The Link Analyst license is for one PC on one site on one LAN and can be used to monitor an unlimited number of devices, LANs, WANs or routes. For more information, contact: <I>Network Instruments, LLC, Minneapolis, MN; (612) 932-9899; WWW: http://www.networkinstruments.com</I>.<P>

<B>Michalis Kabrianis Announces WebRAT 1.0</b><p>Michalis Kabrianis has announced WebRAT 1.0, a Web-based remote administration tool for Linux. WebRAT is a system, a set of client-server applications all bound together with a Web interface. WebRAT supports remote administration of network nodes.<P>
WebRAT consists of a client component, a server, a nodes' daemon, and various scripts. The client is a set of CGI scripts, and handles establishing connections to the servers, transferring requests, getting the answers, and providing these answers to the user through dynamically-created Web pages. The administration server is a single Perl script, and waits (through <B>inetd</B>) for connections from the client scripts, from which it accepts (or denies) the requests, authorizes users, performs the appropriate administrative subroutines, and displays the results of a requested action (which is the output of the administrative subroutine). The nodes' daemon corresponds to the administration server, exists in every node to be administered, accepts connections, and handles requests.<P>
WebRAT administrative features include the ability to view and clear logs for administered nodes, managing the list of administered nodes, and modifying the user-password-module combinations on administered nodes. For each node, administrators can modify groups, modify user passwords, view the tail (last 999 lines) of system logs, modify <B>/etc/hosts</B> files, and modify <B>/etc/services</B> files. For more information, or to download WebRAT, visit: <I>http://hq.hellug.gr/~webrat</I>. <P>
