Much has occurred in the UNIX realm lately -- specifically in the area of UNIX-related publications. This is a sort of &#147;good news/bad news&#148; situation. On the sad side, one of the most widely read UNIX-focused magazines, <I>Performance Computing</I>, folded as of December 31, 1999. This publication (still fondly referred to as <I>UNIX Review</I> by many long-time devotees) addressed strategic issues surrounding the management of heterogeneous UNIX environments.<P>
Part of the good news is that, at the time of writing, <I>Sys Admin</I> is poised to take over the reins of the <I>UNIXReview/Performance Computing</I> Web site. CMP is launching <B>unixreview.com</B> as a UNIX portal site addressing UNIX administration, development, Linux, news, security, and other essential topics within the UNIX industry. The site will encompass the existing <B>performancecomputing.com</B>, <B>unixreview.com</B>, <B>Linux-IT.com</B>, and <B>unixiNTegration.com</B> Web sites, along with the <I>Sys Admin</I> magazine site, to create a UNIX technical professional community site under the familiar UNIX Review name. Thus, new UNIX information, as well as much that was vital to the print version will be available online. I'm excited to launch this site and will have more details for you soon.<P>
The other exciting news regards the launch of a new Linux publication. <I>Sys Admin</I> has partnered with O'Reilly and Associates and VALinux Systems to create the <I>Journal of Linux Technology</I>. This quarterly publication (to paraphrase the journal's Editor in Chief, Mark Stone) will serve the needs of developers and systems administrators interested in the capabilities of Linux as a mission-critical enterprise platform. The journal will provide in-depth articles on technical issues and deliver the kind of authoritative information readers have come to expect from other O'Reilly and CMP publications. The journal's debut issue, which focuses on clustering, will be available at the LinuxWorld Expo in New York the first week of February. If you're interested in obtaining a copy, see <B>jolt.linux.com</B>.<P>

Sincerely yours,<P>
