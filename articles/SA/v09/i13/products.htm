</I><B>JNI Ships New Solaris Driver and EZ Fibre for Fibre Channel Adapters</b><p>JNI Corporation announced the general availability of its new Solaris driver (v4.0) for all of JNI's Emerald-based FibreStar host bus adapters (HBAs) running on systems using the Sun Microsystems Solaris operating system. A new version of EZ Fibre, v2.1, which supports all JNI HBAs running on the Solaris operating system, will soon be available.<P>
The new Solaris driver operates with all JNI PCI or SBus HBAs using the Emerald ASIC controller (FCEn-xxxx family). This includes the existing PCI adapters, the FCE-3210/-6410, FCE2-6410/-6412, and the new Emerald-based SBus adapters, the single-port FCE-1063 and dual-port FCE2-1063 (see separate news release). The driver is supported on Sun systems running under Solaris v2.6, 7, and 8.<P>
EZ Fibre v2.1 is an easy-to-use configuration and management utility that simplifies installation and support for all JNI HBAs on the Solaris operating system. It has a new Java-based client interface, allowing it to be easily ported to other operating platforms, thereby providing an unmatched level of support for heterogeneous Storage Area Networks (SANs).<P>
The latest Solaris driver (v4.0) is part of the UNIX DriverSuite. The UNIX DriverSuite is a single, integrated software driver platform that enables JNI's FibreStar HBAs to run under four major UNIX-based operating systems: Solaris, Linux, HP-UX, and AIX.<P>
The newest driver offers a number of significant features for Emerald-based boards. These include:<P>
<P>
&#149; Full Fabric Support -- JNI drivers support all Fibre Channel topologies, including full switched-fabric support. JNI has offered full fabric support on Solaris for several years and is the only manufacturer with Solaris drivers qualified on both SBus and PCI bus HBAs in full-fabric environments.<P>
&#149; Solaris 8 Compatibility -- JNI offers full compatibility with Sun Microsystems' latest operating system, Solaris 8, including the latest high-availability and clustering capabilities offered by the operating system.<P>
&#149; Full DriverSuite Integration -- Fully integrated with JNI's other UNIX operating systems as part of the DriverSuite.<P>
&#149; Full Emerald Compatibility -- Solaris, like all of the DriverSuite software, is fully compatible with JNI's entire line of Emerald-based FibreStar HBAs, including the dual-port/dual-independent channel 64-bit, 66-MHz PCI bus HBA, the FCE2-6412.<P>
<P>
EZ Fibre offers a variety of features to simplify SAN configuration and management, including:<P>
<P>
&#149; Installation -- EZ Fibre reduces installation to a fraction of the time by replacing a command-line interface with an easy-to-use graphical interface, rendering installation almost foolproof.<P>
&#149; Management -- EZ Fibre enables systems operators to allocate devices to specific hosts; define spare disks as backups in case of disk failure or a surge in storage demand; and also to swap out disks without bringing down a system.<P>
&#149; LUN-level zoning -- EZ Fibre enables LUN-level (logical unit number) zoning, a method of managing multiple disks in an environment of heterogeneous hosts in a SAN environment.<P>
&#149; Troubleshooting -- EZ Fibre provides diagnostics tools to detect connection and HBA status.<P>
<P>
The Solaris driver (v4.0) is available today from JNI and is compatible with all versions of Emerald-based FibreStar(tm) PCI bus and SBus HBAs, including the new FCE-1063 and FCE2-1063 SBus adapters, as well as the Emerald-based FCE-3210, FCE-6410, FCE2-6410, and FCE2-6412 PCI adapters. EZ Fibre 2.1 is coming soon and will support all JNI HBAs on Solaris. EZ-Fibre 2.0 is currently available for Solaris and JNI's FC64-1063 SBus-to-Fibre Channel HBA. <P>

</I><B>Perle Announces Dial-Out Modem Pooling Client</b><p>Perle Systems, a leading provider of networking products for IP and e-business access, has announced the addition of a Linux dial-out modem pooling client for its line of 833 Access Servers. The new client allows Linux-based users to share modems with other Linux, Windows 95/98, NT, and 2000 workstations on their network. <P>
This software allows Perle 833 Access Servers to eliminate the need to attach individual modems on each Linux workstation in the office, where dial-out facilities are needed. This reduces the number of PBX ports used for modem dial-out, saving PBX upgrade costs as office staffing increases. The software lets users share modems attached to, or integrated in, Perle 833 Access Servers by re-routing data traffic from Linux applications, normally destined for the COM port, to the server modem pool. If modems on the access server are busy, dial-out users can be placed on a server queue. When a modem becomes available, the Perle 833 Access Server automatically establishes a dial-out session with the next user in the queue. This eliminates the hassle and lost productivity associated with highly active dial-in/dial-out users.<P>
The new Linux dial-out modem pooling client is supported on:<P>
<P>
Perle 833 version 5.64 and above<P>
Perle 833IS version 6.06, 7.0, and above<P>
Perle 833AS version 6.15 and above<P>
<P>
It is available immediately as a free software upgrade from Perle's Web site. For more information, contact: <I>Perle Systems Inc., WWW: http://www.perle.com</I>.<P>
<B>ActiveState Releases Beta Mail Filter Engine</b><p>ActiveState announced the release of PerlMX, Perl software that allows sys admins to use Perl inside Sendmail for easy email- handing tasks. It is a mail filter engine that will operate under Sendmail on the Linux and Solaris platforms.<P>
PerlMx is designed to provide an efficient, scalable, and customizable framework of solutions for the entire range of email filtering tasks. These include:<P>
