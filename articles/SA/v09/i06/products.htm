</I><B>Alteon WebSystems Unveils Virtual Matrix Architecture Software</B><P>

Alteon WebSystems unveiled its Virtual Matrix Architecture (VMA) software that will improve download speeds by increasing a Web switch's capacity. VMA enhances a switch's session rate performance and session capacity by allowing a switch's distributed processing power and memory to be accessed by any port as needed.<P>
Alteon's Web switches incorporate distributed network processors into the switch fabric. For each port, the switches rely on a single network processing application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). These processors have dual RISC cores and a Layer 2 traffic-forwarding engine. The VMA software effectively separates Layer 2 capabilities from higher layer processing. This results in Layer 3 to 7 processing for forwarding to one of 18 accessible processors on the switch, based on the destination IP address or traffic source. Essentially, the VMA software accesses a switch's entire capacity by accessing memory and processing power that was previously bound to individual ports.<P>
The VMA software is in beta testing and should be available by spring 2000 as a free upgrade for existing Alteon Web switches. For more information, contact: <I>Alteon, 50 Great Oaks Blvd., San Jose, CA 95119; (408) 360-5500; Fax: (408) 360-5501; WWW: http://www.alteonwebsystems.com/products/vma.<P>

</I><B>Sangoma Upgrades WANPIPE</B><P>

Sangoma upgraded WANPIPE for FreeBSD and WANPIPE for Linux. WANPIPE Version 1.1.0 for FreeBSD Version 3.1 supports the S508 and the new S514 PCI cards, including the integrated DSU/CSU/FT1 versions. WANPIPE 1.1.0 also supports Cisco HDLC, Frame Relay, and PPP. With WANPIPE 1.1.0, the kernel does not need to be recompiled each time the protocol type is changed. The users just stop all routers, reboot the machines, run the configuration program to edit the corresponding router configuration file, and start the routers again. WANPIPE 1.1.0 also supports two modes: WANPIPE for routing, and a user API for transparent user data transfer. Other features of WANPIPE 1.1.0 include an installation script, a full screen-based configuration utility, and on-the-fly interface changes.<P>
WANPIPE version 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 for Linux also support S514 PCI cards, Cisco HDLC, Frame Relay, and PPP. WANPIPE version 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 for Linux also include a startup script for starting and stopping each WANPIPE device separately, support for both 2.0.x and 2.2.x kernels, and SMP support. Additionally, a &#147;piggybacking&#148; concept has been introduced into CHDLC drives. This sets up the primary and the secondary ports of the S508 and S514 cards so that each port looks like a separate device. WANPIPE version 2.10 and 2.1.1 for Linux also contain patches for both the 2.0x and 2.2.x kernels. The setup program detects which kernel is being patched and will use the correct patch accordingly.
