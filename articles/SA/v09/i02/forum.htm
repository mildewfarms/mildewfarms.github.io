At the Usenix LISA conference in Seattle, <I>Sys Admin</I> magazine hosted a writers and publishers BOF. About 30 people showed up to share experiences and ask questions. Representatives were present from Morgan Kaufman, MacMillan's imprint Que books, <I>Performance Computing</I> magazine, the online BSD publication, Daemon News, and of course <I>Sys Admin</I>. Mike Loukides from O'Reilly and Associates unfortunately could not attend the BOF, but expressed interest in sharing information about O'Reilly with those contemplating book projects.<P>
One new feature that resulted from the BOF was the formation of an online forum, called UWAP (UNIX Writers and Publishers). At present, this forum is graciously hosted by Kirk Waingrow on behalf of UGU, see: <B>http://www.ugu.com/uwap</B>. From the Web site, you can access author guidelines for various print and online publications. Kirk will be adding more information when he can. Feel free to post questions or information on the board. Also, we plan to attend the scheduled Linux Writers and Publishers BOF at LinuxWorld in New York, so if you're specifically interested in writing about Linux, be sure to stop by.<P>
With this Web Admin issue of the magazine, we've tried to provide an array of useful Web-related articles. There's an article about Web/RCS by Alan Davis detailing a set of extensions to the Web/RCS utility, and a how-to about building a Web-based Java application server with Apache JServ by Don Gourley and Wei Wu that describes how to install and configure JServ. The article about MSFrontpage by Liam Widdowson provides information you won't find in the documentation to help you secure a FrontPage Web server. Also this month, the newest version of <I>Sys Admin's</I> back issue CD-ROM has become available. Version 5 contains eight years' worth of articles and code in a searchable form. If you own previous versions of the CD, you can get the new one at a reduced rate -- see the ad on page 70 or the Web site for details. As always, enjoy the magazine!<P>

Sincerely yours,<P>
