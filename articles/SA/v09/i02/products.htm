<B>Electronic Software Publishing Introduces LinkScan 6.0</B><P>

Electronic Software Publishing Corporation (Elsop) has introduced LinkScan v6.0. LinkScan is a link checking and Web site management tool for UNIX, Linux, Windows 98 and NT operating systems. According to the company, &#147;It is the most accurate, fastest and most scaleable product available.&#148; LinkScan also does HTML validation and creates publishable site maps.<P>
Enhancements to the UNIX version of LinkScan include the following features. Web sites are now scanned via multi-tasking http navigation, and the memory requirements are significantly reduced when validating external links with multiple processes. Enhancements to the Windows version of LinkScan include the following. Multi-tasking validation of external links is supported. Users can specify the number of slave processes to be used in the scan in the graphical windows interface. The time-out/retry logic has been improved when checking slow or hung links. These changes eliminate prior restrictions due to limitation of the Perl implementation for Windows and improve performance.<P>
LinkScan checks Web sites through either the file system or the Web server. The file system process is ten times faster than the Web server process, and it enables LinkScan to identify orphan files. Checking links through the Web server enables LinkScan to check active elements such as CGIs, image maps, external links, and server-side includes. According to the company, LinkScan v6.0 can check more than 40,000 links per hour, and can check Web sites with 50,000 or more external links, and sites with more than 250,000 pages. Multi-threaded processing can check more than 60 links concurrently.<P>
LinkScan operates on UNIX servers (including AIX, BSDI, FreeBSD, Digital Unix, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, and SunOS/Solaris), Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 98 with Perl 5. Fully functional evaluation copies are available for download from the company's Web site. LinkScan v6.0 is a free upgrade to owners of any version from 4.0 to 5.5.
