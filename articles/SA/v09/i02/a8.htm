<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>  I have an NT server and Solaris 2.5.1. How does NT provide <B>telnet</B> service for Solaris? From NT, I can <B>telnet</B> to Solaris; but from Solaris, I cannot <B>telnet</B> to NT.<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0><B> telnet</B> to your Solaris box and run a <B>ps -ef | grep inetd</B>. You'll see something like:<P>
<PRE>
root   139     1  0   Oct 18 ?        0:00 
/usr/sbin/inetd -s/inetd
</PRE><P> is the Internet Services Daemon for UNIX. It controls all of the TCP/IP (i.e., <B>telnet</B>, <B>ftp</B>, etc.) connections into your machine. The services it handles are defined in <B>/etc/inetd.conf</B>. Check it out for more information.<P>
Then, do a <B>ps -ef | grep telnet</B>, and you'll see something like:<P>
<PRE>
root 15185 139 0 16:17:06 ? 0:00 in.telnetd
</PRE><P>You may see more than one <B>in.telnetd</B> running, but they will all have the parent process (third column of the output) of &#147;139&#148; (or whatever your <B>inetd</B> PID is from the first <B>ps</B> command).<P>
Next, do a <B>ps -ef | grep 15185</B>, where &#147;15185&#148; is the PID of your <B>in.telnetd</B> process, and you'll see something like:<P>
<PRE>
root 15185   139  0 16:17:06 ?        0:00 in.telnetd
root 15187 15185  0 16:17:06 pts/5    0:00 -ksh
</PRE><P>You'll see that your login shell (<B>ksh</B> in this case) was spawned by the <B>in.telnetd</B> session. In a nutshell, this is how a <B>telnet</B> connection works to a UNIX system -- a remote user <B>telnet</B>s to the UNIX box. On the UNIX box, the <B>inetd</B> daemon (only one) receives the incoming request on port 23. <B>inetd</B> takes the request and checks the <B>/etc/inet/services</B> file to see what to do with it. <B>/etc/inet/services</B> has an entry like:<P>
<PRE>
telnet          23/tcp
</PRE><P>This says that any request received on port 23 is a <B>telnet</B> request. <B>inetd</B> then checks <B>/etc/inetd.conf</B> where there is a line like this:<P>
<PRE>
telnet  stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/in.telnetd    in.telnetd
</PRE><P>This basically says that if <B>inetd</B> receives a <B>telnet</B> request, then spawn<B> /usr/sbin/in.telnetd</B>. When you look at your NT system, you will not see an <B>inetd</B> or<B> telnetd</B> process running. NT does not provide (at least through revision 4.0) a <B>telnetd</B> service. The <B>telnetd</B> (the <B>telnet</B> daemon) for NT is available from third parties. A good one is NFS Maestro Package from Hummingbird Communications Ltd. The package provides a myriad of <B>inetd</B> style services and a full <B>telnet</B> and <B>ftp</B> daemon, as well as the ability to mount NFS shares.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>  How do I backup complete raw image files to an external SCSI device using <B>dd</B>?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Try the following:<P>
<PRE>
dd if=&lt;input file&gt;  of=&lt;output file&gt;

</PRE><P><img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>  My <B>etc/password</B> file appears to be inoperable, but the system is running fine. I cannot log into the server to make changes. It is acting as my DNS server. Any suggestions?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> It sounds like you need to boot from CD. After you are up from the CD, mount the filesystem that contains <B>/etc</B>. Then you need to either edit the <B>passwd</B> file by hand and fix the problem or recover a good <B>passwd</B> file from tape. If you are using a system where <B>/etc/shadow</B> is used, then you need to edit the shadow file to fix the problem. Once you are done, reboot and you should be able to log in. If you then don't know root's password (because you recovered an old password file), remove the password field for root while editing the password (or shadow) file. The root entry in <B>/etc/shadow</B> will look something like:<P>
<PRE>
root:qQ5vhs6JFddRA:10830::::::
</PRE><P>To remove the password, delete the <B>qQ5vhs6JfddRA</B>, and the line will look like:<P>
<PRE>
root::10830::::::
</PRE><P>If using only <B>/etc/passwd</B> the the root entry looks something like:<P>
<PRE>
root:ciMwPzD28pGE2:0:3::/:/sbin/sh
</PRE><P>To remove the password, delete the <B>ciMwPzD28pGE2</B> and the line will look like:<P>
<PRE>
root::0:3::/:/sbin/sh
</PRE><P><img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>  I have changed the IP addresses and subnet using the <B>ifconfig </B>command. However, after rebooting the system, the old <B>ip </B>addresses and subnet reappear. Any suggestions?<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0><B> ifconfig</B> only changes the information for the life of that boot. When you reboot, you go back to what was previously there. To permanently change the IP address and netmask, there's an easy way and a hard way. For HP-UX, you can use SAM (easy) or change the IP and netmask values in<B> /etc/rc.config.d/netconf </B>(hard). For Sun, you can use <B>sys-unconfig</B> (easy). When the system reboots, you will be prompted to reconfigure it. You can also check out the man page for <B>sys-unconfig</B> and do everything it does by hand (hard). I recommend the hard way. You'll learn a lot more about your system.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>  How can I change the root password (e.g., id=0 gid=1)? I cannot change it in Solstice Admin Suite.<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> I may be really confused, but it sounds like all you need to do is to log in as root and type &#147;passwd&#148;.<P>
<img src="../../resource/q.gif" alt=" Q " width=29 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0>  How can I convert the generic names (like sd19 and sd20) to device file names under Solaris 2.5? The output of <B>sar</B> is useless if I can't find out which disk has a problem!<P>
<img src="../../resource/a.gif" alt=" A " width=28 height=32 align=bottom hspace=0 vspace=0> Here's an example of how this works. Do a <B>ls -l /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s2</B>:<P>
<PRE>
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root          48 Jun  4 15:19
/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s2 -&gt; ../../devices/
sbus@2,0/QLGC,isp@1,10000/sd@0,0:c
</PRE><P>The information that uniquely identifies this device is:<P>
<PRE>
"sbus@2,0", "QLGC,isp@1,10000"  and sd@0,0
</PRE><P>Now look in <B>/etc/path_to_inst</B> for this device. <B>/etc/path_to_inst </B>records mappings of physical device names to instance numbers. Type:<P>
<PRE>
"grep sbus@2,0 /etc/path_to_inst | grep QLGC,isp@1,10000 | grep sd@0,0&#148;
</PRE><P>and you see:<P>
<PRE>
"/sbus@2,0/QLGC,isp@1,10000/sd@0,0" 0 "sd"
</PRE><P>The format is: &#147;physical name&#148;, instance number, and &#147;driver binding name&#148;. Notice that this device is &#147;driver binding name&#148; <B>sd</B>,<B> </B>and &#147;instance number&#148; <B>0</B>, for a name of <B>sd0</B>.<P>
Below is a script that will calculate this information for you. I've tested it on Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.6, but you may need to tweak it a little. It does not handle pseudo devices.<P>
<PRE>
#!/bin/ksh
# Print out ssd and sd devices and their /dev/dsk/c?t?d?s2 counterparts.
# EX: ssd0 is /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s2

# Loop through each disk device in /dev/dsk.
for DEVICE in 'ls /dev/dsk/c*t*d*s2'
do
# for each device, grab some info that will uniquely identify the 
# device in the /etc/path_to_inst
  ls -l $DEVICE | awk -F'/' '{ print $7, $8, $NF }' | read info1 info2
info3

# Now grab the "driver binding name" ("sd" or "sdd") field and the
# "instance number"
  grep $info1 /etc/path_to_inst | grep $info2 | grep 'echo $info3
  | awk -F':' '{ print $1 }' '
  | awk '{ print substr($3,2,(length($3)-2))$2 }' | read SD_DEVICE

# Now print out the results
echo $SD_DEVICE is $DEVICE

done
</PRE><P>Another solution is to install Rich Pettit's SymbEL Tools (RICHPse, RICHPsex, and ANCrules). Located in the example directory, <B>/opt/RICHPse/examples</B>, is a program called <B>disks.se </B>that will convert the names for you. Use <B>/opt/RICHPse/bin/se disks.se</B> to run it. The only problem is that this tool seems to only recognize disks with mounted filesystems on them. There are many other tools included in these packages that seem useful and should be examined. You can get these packages at:<P>
