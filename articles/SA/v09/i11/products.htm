<B>Zzyzx Expands Its High-Performance Raid Storage Line with RocketRAID MAX</b><p>Zzyzx Peripherals, Inc. has announced the availability of RocketRAID MAX. The RocketRAID MAX is a new Ultra2 SCSI interfaced RAID array featuring a new 64-bit RAID controller architecture. According to the company, with all field-replaceable units redundant and hot swappable, the RocketRAID MAX offers extreme fault tolerance. It is designed for high-performance, mission-critical SCSI-interfaced UNIX and NT computing environments requiring over 3 TB of disk storage.<P>
The RocketRAID MAX utilizes a new PowerPC processor, features up to 1 GB of cache, and supports RAID levels 0, 1, 0+1, 3, and 5. The RocketRAID MAX is offered in a 5U rack mount enclosure that supports two redundant, hot swap RAID controllers and nine disk drives. Additional disk expansion enclosures can be daisy-chained to this 5U chassis, creating RAID solutions over 3 TB. Additionally, 10 to 30 disk drive tower solutions are also available, supporting up to 2 TB in capacity. Both rack mount and tower configurations of the RocketRAID MAX can be built with 9 GB, 18 GB, 36 GB, and 73 GB disk drives with speeds ranging from 7,200 RPM to 10,000 RPM and 15,000 RPM models.<P>

<B>RTI Announces High-Capacity Signal Recording System</b><p>Real Time Integration has announced the NetAcquire Data Archiver, a high-capacity portable signal recording device with integrated playback. The NetAcquire Data Archiver samples analog, digitial, and serial data signals at selectable sppeds, and stores the data on an internal 10-GB hard disk. Depending on acquisition speed, the system supports continuous signal recording from days to years.<P>
NetAcquire Data Archiver operates as a standalone device or as a network peripheral. When NetAcquire is connected to an Ethernet network, the archived data files are available to any computer on the network using FTP. NetAcquire Data Archiver also supports standalone signal playback from recorded data files. Playback operation is configurable, including playback speed, start time, and auto-restart once end-of-data is reached.<P>
NetAcquire Data Archiver includes an integrated Web server, allowing remote system configuration and monitoring from any Web browser. NetAcquire AutoFTP software handles archiving very large data sets.  AutoFTP runs on the NetAcquire and continuously transfers archive data files to a customer-supplied central file server. Once AutoFTP confirms a successful file transfer, the associated data file is removed from the NetAcquire hard disk.<P>
NetAcquire Data Archiver also provides data time-stamping and power failure protection. Expansion options include up to 256 analog channels and 64 serial channels. Archive disk capacity can be increased to 30 GB. RAID and DLT tape autochanger options are also available.<P>
The NetAcquire Data Archiver is priced at $6,495. For more information, contact: <I>Real Time Integration, Inc., 733 7th Ave., Kirkland, WA 98033; (425) 576-0822; Fax: (206) 374-2418; Internet: info@realtimeint.com; WWW: http://www.realtimeint.com</I>.<P>

<B>OpenBSD Announces Release 2.7</b><p>OpenBSD has announced release 2.7 of their &#147;Secure by Default&#148; operating system, targeting Internet servers and workstations. OpenBSD 2.7 enhances the built-in strong cryptography with teh OpenSSH suite to support the SSH 1 and 2 secure communications protocols and drivers for hardware accelerators for IPSec VPNs.<P>
OpenBSD's cryptography has been enhanced by encrypting virtual memory swap space and by more flexible ISAKMPD key exchange and operating modes for IP security networking. OpenBSD avoids U.S. export controls on cryptography because it is published in Canada with cryptographic software developed entirely outside the United States. Support for SSH1 and HTTPs secure protocols depends on the RSA public key algorithm patented in the USA. Users worldwide may use the OpenSSL free library while those in the USA must use the non-commercial RSAREF library to abide by the patent.<P>
OpenBSD's SSH support is done with the free OpenSSH suite, also developed by OpenBSD team members. OpenBSD 2.7 improves support for high-end system boards, SCSI controllers, ethernet interfaces, and adds gigabit Ethernet drivers and IPv6 networking.<P>
OpenBSD is free software, released under a Berkeley-style open-source license. It is developed by a team of Internet volunteers, based on UC Berkeley's 4.4 BSD-Lite. OpenBSD runs on PCs, SPARC, Mac68K, and other hardware. For more information, contact: <I>The Computer Shop, Calgary, Canada; (403) 243-4356; Fax: (403) 243-2684; WWW: http://www.OpenBSD.org</I>.<P>
<B>Advantech Introduces Rackmounted RAID Storage</b><p>Advantech has introduced a rackmounted RAID storage subsystem with terabytes of storage capacity.

While running at peak performance, the RAID-500U2 can automatically update the configuration of newly installed drives in the background, without the need to reboot.<P>
The RAID-500U2 can support 6 expansion chassis via an Ultra2 or Ultra-Wide SCSI bus for a total of up to 56 hard disk drives. Prices for the RAID-500U2 data storage subsystem start at $5800, including a 5U RAID enclosure with 8 disk cartridges, redundant Ultra2 RAID controllers with 4 SCSI channels, and a 300 W ATX redundant power supply. OEM and volume discounts are available.<P>

An additional five-connection license is available for $995.95; additional file-format filters are sold separately.<P>
DIGS allows users with Web browsers to view the contents of a file at full resolution, scroll, and change pages, switch layers, and change magnification. This can be done without downloading the file, using browser plug-ins, or enabling Java. All the zooming, processing, and navigation calculations are performed by the server, which then sends small GIF and JPEG files to the Web client for viewing. The server provides support for collaborative work with images.<P>

<B>Western Scientific Unveils Dual Active Controller RAID</b><p>Western Scientific has released the ArcusRAID, a high-performance active/active RAID that provides high availability and performance across a range of environments, including UNIX, Windows, parallel databases, and storage area networks (SANs).<P>
The ArcusRAID can perform 100 Mb/second controller to cache transfers. It is available in either Ultra-2 LVD or Fibre Channel setup and is capable of transferring data at a rate of up to 80 Mb/second standard or 100 Mb/second burst when used in a RAID 3 application. System sizes range from 92 GB to 950 GB and support either RAID 3 or RAID 5. Each controller comes standard with 32 MB RAM and can be configured with up to 128 MB. The ArcusRAID also contains a built-in IP address and fabric switching in a SAN-ready rackmount box. <P>
ArcusRAID includes the AutoRebind capability. Upon hot-replacement of a failed controller, the AutoRebind feature senses the new controller, rebinds it back into the storage system, and reallocates the workload previously being handled by the surviving controller, all done without user intervention. Base ArchusRAID systems start at $19,000. For more information, contact: <I>Western Scientific; 9445 Farnham St. San Diego, CA 92123, CA 92123; (858) 565-6699; Fax:(858) 565-6938; WWW: http://www.wsm.com</I>.<P>
