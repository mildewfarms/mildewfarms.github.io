                       Manual for ar7 Version 0.2
                                (English)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This is a manual for the public domain compression archiver ar7

     ar7 is distributed as a free program released to the public domain.
     This means you may do anything you want with it, with the one exception
     that neither you (nor I, nor anyone) may copyright it.

     There is no restriction for the use within private corporations
     or the use for governmental agencies.  Users must be respon-
     sible for the use of facilities of the software.  The soft-
     ware is distributed as is.  I am not liable for any damage
     caused by the use of this software.

0.  Why ar7 ?
-------------

     Unlike the output from most archivers, ar7 archives are regular
     7-bit, ASCII files with lines 78-characters or less long.

     This means they can be mailed through electronic mail services that
     strip the eighth bit and don't like special characters such as
     CTRL-Z, etc.

     ar7 also ignores all lines before it reaches its specially coded data
     area, so if your e-mail service attaches headers to your messages, these
     can be simply left on the archive and will not affect anything.

     You may also add lines of text (description of contents, etc.) to the
     beginning of the file by editing it with nearly any text editor.
     Text may also be added after the final "!$" of the ar7 data area.

     You just need to be sure that you do not add any lines that begin with
     a comma (ar7's signal).  The text on this line may be edited; it is
     displayed on the screen whenever ar7 opens the archive.

     The compaction rates of ar7 are not too astonishing, even though it uses
     a very efficient compression routine.  The archives generally average
     about 60-90% the size of the original files.  This is due to the
     restriction of it using editable, e-mailable ASCII files.
     So I doubt it will be used much except for 7-bit e-mail systems.

1.  Usage
---------

  A.  General Format:
  ==================

    ar7 <command> ARC [FILENAME]...

    <command>: if one is not used, you get the help screen.


    ARC:       archive name (must include the extension: .AR7 recommended).
    FILENAME:  File name or full pathname if specified (wildcards ok).


  B.  <command>
  =============

   a (Add) compress and add to an archive.

     Compress and Add files specified to an archive.  If the named
     archive does not exist, then create one with the name.  ar7
     overwrites any file in the archive by the given file name with
     'a' command.

     < Example 1 >  ar7 a MINE.AR7 ar7.exe ar7.doc

     ar7 makes an archive named MINE.AR7 from the files ar7.exe and
     ar7.doc.

   r (Update) Compress and Replace.

     Compress and add files specified to an archive as command 'a'.
     If ar7 detects a file with the name same as the one in the
     archive, then ar7 replaces the one in the archive.

     < Example 2 > ar7 r MINE.AR7

     All the file(s) in the current directory which have names identical
     to those of the files in MINE.AR7 are compressed and stored in the
     archive, replacing the copies previously in the archive.


   d (Delete)

     ar7 deletes specified file(s) from the archive.

     < Example 3 > ar7 d MINE.AR7 ar7.doc

     ar7 deletes ar7.doc in the archive MINE.AR7 .

   x (Extract)

     ar7 extracts file(s) from the archive with decompressing.

     <Example 4 > ar7 s MINE.AR7

     Extracts all the file(s) in the archive 'MINE.AR7'.

     < Example 5 > ar7 x MINE.AR7 ar7.doc ar7.exe

     ar7 extracts the files ar7.doc and ar7.exe from 'MINE.AR7'


   p (Print) Print file(s) on standard out.

     ar7 prints file decompressing to standard output.

     < Example 6 >  ar7 p MINE.AR7 ar7.doc

     ar7 extracts 'ar7.doc' from 'MINE.AR7' and displays it on your
     terminal.

     < Example 7 > ar7 p MINE.AR7 ar7.doc > prn

     ar7 extracts 'ar7.doc' from 'MINE.AR7' and prints it out from
     your printer.


   l (List)

     ar7 lists file names in the archive on a line.

     < Example 8 > ar7 l MINE.AR7

     ar7 shows list of file(s) archived in 'MINE.AR7'.
