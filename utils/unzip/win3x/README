  1034 Dec 18 1997  README        what you're reading right now
 90231 Dec 16 1997  unz532d.zip   UnZip 5.32, 16-bit DLL (for Borland C)
329851 Dec 16 1997  wiz401x.exe   WiZ 4.01 graphical app (self-extracting)
 79085 Dec 16 1997  zip22d.zip    Zip 2.2, 16-bit DLL (for Borland C)

The self-extracting files are in zip format.  You can simply run them
at a DOS command prompt to extract into the current directory, or else
use UnZip 5.x or PKUNZIP 2.04g or WizUnZip 2.x or WinZip 5.x (or later)
to extract the archives directly without running them, as in:

    unzip wiz401x.exe

All Info-ZIP packages contain documentation.  Sources are in ../src .
The DLL sources are included as a standard part of the Zip 2.2 and UnZip
5.32 source distributions; the WiZ 4.01 GUI sources are bundled separately
as wiz401.zip.  (Note that WiZ now performs both Zip and UnZip functions.)
